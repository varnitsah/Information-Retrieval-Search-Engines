rover boys in alaska     introduction  my dear boys this book is a complete story in itself but forms the eighteenth volume in a line issued under the general title of the rover boys series for young americans  as i have mentioned in some of the other volumes this line was started with the publication of the rover boys at school on the ocean and in the jungle   the books were so well received that they were followed year after year by the publication of the rover boys out west on the great lakes in camp on land and sea on the river on the plains in southern waters on the farm on treasure isle at college down east in the air and then in new york where we last met the lads  the boys are growing olderas all boys doand dick is married and helping his father in business  in the present story sam and tom return to college until something quite out of the ordinary occurs and the funloving tom disappears most mysteriously  sam and dick go in search of their brother and the trail leads them to faraway alaska where they encounter many perils in the fields of ice and snow  the publishers assure me that by the end of the present year the total of sales on this series of books will have reached one million and a half copies  this is to me truly amazing and i cannot help but feel profoundly grateful to all the boys and girls and their parents who have taken such an interest in my stories  i trust with all my heart that the reading of the books will do the young folks good  affectionately and sincerely yours  edward stratemeyer     contents  chapter        i tom and sam      ii

said sam  here hold my torch said dick     the rover boys in alaska   chapter i  tom and sam  well here we are again tom down to the grind of college life  thats right sam  not so much fun as attending a wedding is it and tom rover grinned broadly at his brother  we cant expect to go to weddings all the time returned sam rover a grin showing on his own face  wonder how dick and dora are making out he mused  oh fine you can be sure of that  dora is just the girl for dick  how do you like being back here tom and the youngest rover looked anxiously at his brother  tom heaved a deep sigh before replying  to tell the truth sam i wish i had stayed home a bit longer he said slowly  my head isnt just as clear as it might be  that whack pelter gave me with that footstool was an awful one  it certainly was and its a wonder it didnt split your skull open maybe youd better go back home for a rest  oh no it isnt as bad as that  sometimes i feel a bit dizzy thats all  but i guess that will wear away sooner or later  you see ive been studying hard the last three days trying to make up for lost time and that is whats done it  i think ill take it a bit easier after this until i feel more like myself  dont you think you had better see a doctor  no ive had the doctor fussing over me until i am tired of it  what i need is some fun sam  cant you think of something  whenever i try to concoct some sort of a joke it makes my head ache and poor tom who loved to play pranks as much as ever heaved another sigh  let us take a long walk this afternoon tom  maybe that will do your head some good  we can take songbird and some of the others along  all right anything to get out of the greasy grind of studying  my dont i wish i was in dicks place and didnt have to go to college any more  well dicks got his hands full with dads business  those brokers left things in a perfect mess  i know it  but dick will straighten things outhes got a head for just that sort of thing  tom took up a text book glanced at it for a moment and then threw it on the table  no use i cant study any more today  im going out on the campus  you come as soon as you are done and well take that walk  all right  will you tell songbird and whoever else you want to go along  yes answered tom and without further words he took up his cap heaved another deep sigh and left the room  sam watched his brother pass down the corridor of the college building and noted that he placed his hand to the back of his head and kept it there for some time  poor tom murmured the youngest rover as he turned again to the lesson he had been studying  he tries to keep up a brave front but that crack he got on the head some weeks ago was a worse one than most folks imagine  im thinking he ought to be home and under the doctors care instead of trying to rack his brains making up lessons he missed while we were away  tom passed along the corridor until he had turned a corner and was out of sight of me room he and sam occupied  then he looked around to make certain that nobody was observing him  both of his hands went up to the back of his head and he clenched his teeth hard  what is the matter with this old head of mine he murmured sometimes i feel as if i had a regular windmill inside of it  and when i try to study it gets to be a regular blank  something is wrong thats certain  what is it  he stood in the corner of the corridor for several minutes trying to pull himself together mentally and physically  his face was still somewhat pale from the suffering he had undergone since the time a wooden footstool hurled by an enemy had hit him and knocked him unconscious  rats this wont do he finally exclaimed and shaking himself he hurried out of the building and on to the broad velvety college campus  students were walking in various directions going to or coming from classes and lectures  many hailed him and he called out in return or waved his hand  the rover boys had a host of friends at brill  presently tom saw a tall slim young man coming up dressed in a light checked suit and wearing pointed patentleather ties and a rosecolored cap  in the buttonhole of the student was a large carnation  under his arm the approaching one carried half a dozen text books  the face of the funloving rover lighted up and for the time being the pain in his head was forgotten  his hand went down in a pocket to feel for something and then came forth again  then he stepped forward and crooked out his elbow  the other student was looking to one side as he came forward and he did not notice the elbow in his way  the elbow caught him in the ribs causing him to give a grunt and the armful of books were scattered on the walk  my gracious me gasped the stylishlydressed youth  what did you do that for tom rover  sorry tubblets answered tom making as sober a face as possible i didnt know you wanted the whole walk  you did that on purpose tom rover you know you did  did what on purpose tubby  how many times must i tell you that my name is not tubby or tubblets it is william philander tubbs and i want you to call me by my right name after this  very well mr w p washbasini mean tubbs  ill not forget again and tom made a low bow  and i dont want you to knock my books out of my arm again went on william philander drawing himself up disdainfully  your books willie  yes my books came wrathfully from the dudish student and dont you dare to call me willie  my name is  oh yes i remember now philugger  its not philugger either  it is wil  sure i know philliam tubbander williams  sorry i forgot before and tom looked truly sorrowful  oh you are simply horrid thats what you are declared the stylishlydressed student in despair  and my books are all covered with dirt  i beg a million pardons cried tom and started to pick the books up one after another  as he did this one hand went again into that pocket before mentioned and on the sly he inserted a printed sheet of paper into each book  now you are all fixed tubbly he added  and you can run along to school like a nice little boy  but wait a moment till i fix your collar he went on as he turned the other youth around  whats the matter with my collar demanded the dudish student suspiciously  talcum powder i guess  you mustnt use so much after this  and tom commenced to brush the collar vigorously  ieri didnt use muchjust a little for my nose dont you know answered william philander tubbs who made much of his personal appearance  tom continued to brush the coat collar off with one hand while unfolding a printed bill with the other  an advertising wagon had gone past the college grounds the day before and from a fellow distributing handbills tom had gotten a sheet telling of the merits of gumleys red pills for redblooded people and also some small bills relating to the same wonderful cure for many ills  the small sheets were in the books the large sheet he now proceeded to place on william philanders back fastening it under the turneddown coat collar  there were a few specks of talcum powder on the coat collar but not enough to have attracted any attention  now you are all right tubbsky said the funloving rover  my but you certainly do know how to dress he added in affected admiration  ah really lisped the dude  thanks  but please dont knock my books down again he added and then proceeded on his way to one of the classrooms  well that makes me feel a little better murmured tom and then he followed slowly to watch the fun  he saw a number of students gather and all commenced to snicker at tubbs who totally unconscious of what was taking place marched on holding his head erect  wish it was my class id like to see it out mused tom  but never mind i guess ill hear about it later and he turned back to the campus to wait for sam  as he did this a queer pain shot through his head and he murmured a suppressed groan  if that keeps on ill have to do as sam says go and see a doctor he told himself  gosh how queer i feel  just as if i was getting batty  hullo tom came the salute from nearby and looking in that direction the funloving youth saw another student coming up rapidly sam just told me you were going to take a walk and asked me to go along  yes songbird well start as soon as sam gets through with the lesson hes studying  hows the muse these days  oh im not writing much poetry now answered john powell otherwise known as songbird because of his efforts at composing verses  ive got too much to do studying  why dont you write a poem to the professors  maybe theyd excuse you from recitations for it and tom smiled broadly  ieri did write one little poem about the lessons answered the wouldbe poet  it went like this    the student sat in his room in a chair   with a look on his face of keen despair   outside his chums were playing ball   and oft to him they sent a call   he wanted to play with all his heart   but from his books he could not part   grand  immense  youve struck the clothespin on the head the first clip cried tom  any more of the same brand  welleri started the second verse but i didnt get it finished it went like this    he had a lesson hard to learn   it made his heart with anguish burn   he wanted to throw those books away   and rush outside and run and play   and soand soand so    and so he kept on grinding there   gnashing his teeth and pulling his hair  finished tom  i know for ive been there  really songbird thats a dandy poem  you ought to have it framed and hung up in the gym  do you really think so and the wouldbe poet looked pleased  i do  it would hit every fellow in brill  and i thinkwhat can that fellow want added tom suddenly as a messenger boy from the town came running up to him  guess hes got a message for you returned songbird  for me  i trust its no bad news said tom     chapter ii  something about the past  is this mr thomas rover asked the messenger boy as he came to a halt  yes thats my handle answered tom  what have you got for me a check for a thousand dollars or a bill  telegram was the laconic answer and the lad held it out  sign here he added bringing his receipt book into evidence  its paid fer  all right son  tom signed the book fished up a dime from his pocket and handed it to the lad who took it with a broad grin  tanks mister  any answer  ill see said tom and tore open the envelope of the telegram  he perused the yellow sheet inside with interest  its from dick he cried to songbird  hes got to come to casford on business and he says he will make the trip in the auto and bring dora along  theyll be here tomorrow or the day after and theyll stop at hope seminary too  say this is great  i must tell sam went on tom his face brightening  you can go he told the messenger boy  here comes sam now announced songbird  hes got stanley and spud with him  and he pointed to one of the doors of the college building  to my old readers the rover boys will need no introduction  for the benefit of others allow me to state that the youths were three in number dick being the oldest funloving tom coming next and sturdy little sam being the youngest  when at the old homestead as they called it they lived with their father anderson rover and their uncle randolph and aunt martha on a farm called valley brook in new york state  as related in the first volume of this series entitled the rover boys at school the three lads had been sent to putnam hall military academy a wellknown institution of learning presided over by captain victor putnam  there they had made many friends and also a few enemies  the first term at school was followed by a trip on the ocean and then another trip into the jungles of africa  then came a journey to the west and jolly times on the great lakes and in the mountains  next the boys returned to the hall to go in camp with their fellow cadets after that they took a long journey over land and sea being cast away on a lonely island of the pacific  now ive had enough adventures to last a lifetime said dick on returning home  but strenuous happenings to him and his brothers were not yet over  on a houseboat the rover boys sailed down the ohio and the mississippi rivers having many adventures by the way and then found themselves on the plains where they solved the mystery of red rock ranch  then they reached southern waters and in the gulf of mexico discovered a deserted steam yacht which they eventually turned over to its anxious owner  now for a good rest said sam and the three lads returned to the home farm where more adventures befell them  next they returned to putnam hall where all graduated with considerable honor  college next said tom and he made a wry face for studying was not particularly in his line although he could knuckle down as hard as anyone when it was necessary  but before they went to college the lads and their father accompanied by some others went off on a treasure hunt locating what was known as the stanhope fortune  brill college was a fine institution of learning located in the middle west not far from the town of ashton  with the rovers went their oldtime school chum songbird powell already introduced  at the same time william philander tubbs came there from putnam hall  he was a dudish fellow who thought more of his dress and his personal appearance than anything else and was often made the butt of some practical joke  at brill the rovers soon made other friends including stanley browne a tall gentlemanly youth and will jackson generally called spud because of his unusual fondness for potatoes  spud was a great story teller and some of his yarns were certainly the limit to use sams way of expressing it  while at putnam hall the rover boys had made the acquaintance of dora stanhope who lived nearby with her widowed mother and also nellie and grace laning doras two cousins  it was not long before dick and dora showed a great liking for each other and at same time tom commenced to pair off with nellie and sam was often seen in the company of grace then came the time when the rovers did a great service for mrs stanhope saving her from the rascality of josiah crabtree a teacher at putnam hall who was trying to get possession of the money mrs stanhope held in trust for dora  crabtree was exposed and then he lost no time in disappearing  not far from brill college was located another institution of learning hope seminary for girls  when the rovers went to brill dora and her two cousins went to hope so the young folks met as often as before  a short term at brill was followed by an unexpected trip down east where the lads again fell in with the rascally crabtree  then the youths returned home for a brief vacation and while there became the owners of a biplane and took several thrilling trips through the air and later on by means of the same aircraft managed to save dora and nellie from some rascals who had abducted them  about this time mr anderson rover who was not well was having much trouble with some brokers who were trying to do him out of much valuable property  he went to new york and disappeared and the sons immediately went in search of him as related in the volume before this entitled the rover boys in new york  the brokers were pelter japson  company and it was not long before dick and his brothers discovered that they were in league with josiah crabtree  the plotters were holding mr rover a prisoner in the hope that he would sign away certain rights to them  the boys traced the crowd to a lonely farmhouse and it was during the happenings which followed that poor tom was struck on the head by a wooden footstool thrown by pelter and knocked unconscious  josiah crabtree tried to escape from a garret window by means of a rope made of a blanket and this broke and he fell breaking a leg in two places  he was taken to a hospital and the doctors there said he would be a cripple for life  all of the rovers were much concerned over tom and for some time it looked as if the youth might be seriously injured  but the boy had grit and pulled himself together and presently announced himself as well as ever  but he often got that sharp pain through the head and there were times when for an instant his mind became a blank  while dick was at college he had become formally engaged to dora and now it was decided that as mr rover was in no physical condition to look after his various financial affairs and as dick seemed to take more to business than to studying he should leave college and take the reins out of his parents hands  then he pleaded with dora that they get married and she consented only stipulating that they must both look after her mother  then followed the grandest wedding that quiet cedarville had ever known and dick and dora went off on a short but exceedingly happy honeymoon trip  and now it is back to the college grind for us sam had said to tom  right you are was the reply  and well have to work pretty hard to catch up with our classes  but your head tom  oh that has got to take care of itself had been toms reply and there the matter had dropped for the time being  but often sam would watch his brother closely for he knew that poor tom had been seriously hurt and was by no means entirely over it  when the two brothers had returned to brill they had had to tell their chums of all their doings in and near new york  songbird had smiled grimly on hearing of the fate of josiah crabtree  well he deserved it the wouldbe poet had said  he was a snake in the grass from the start  i hope he doesnt cross our path again sam had replied  i never want to see him again  nor do i had come from tom  if hes a cripple i reckon hell keep out of our sight  it was hard work after all the excitement of their doings in new york and the added excitement of the wedding for sam and tom to settle down to the humdrum routine of life at college but the lads did their best  nellie laning and her sister grace came back to hope seminary and the young folks managed to see each other at least once a week nellie was very solicitous about tom and when he admitted to her that his head still hurt at times she wanted to know why he didnt return to the farm for a long rest  oh i dont want to drop behind in my studies nellie had been his answer  i want to get through and go into business like dick has done and he gazed at her in a manner that caused her to blush deeply  yes i know  but tom dear supposing your head  she did not know how to go on  oh my head will be all right nellie so dont you fret  why i wouldnt have you fret for the world  and tom had caught both her hands tightly within his own  they understood each other perfectly  but you know what the doctor saidthat you must be very careful for a long long time  she had not added that one of the specialists had remarked that victims of such injuries sometimes went out of their minds  oh ill be all right i tell you nellie he had answered  ill go through brill with a rush see if i dont  and then well get married  oh tom  surest thing you know he had added and then as they chanced to be alone he had caught her in his arms and given her a quick little hug and a kiss that meant a great deal  to tom the whole world did not hold such another girl like nellie  and to nelliewell there was tom and that was all  well you take good care of yourself she had said on parting and he had told her again not to worry  whats the news asked sam as he came up to his brother and saw the telegram in toms hand  read it for yourself was the answer and the younger rover did so  so dick is coming to casford eh mused sam  i suppose its some more of dads business  well ill be glad to see him and see dora too  we can all go up to hope together  go to hope to see the teachers i suppose said stanley browne closing one eye suggestively  fine fun that seeing the teachers and then sam made a playful pass at him with his fist  sam said we were to take a walk put in spud  where are we going  we might go out towards the sanderson farm suggested songbird  so you can call on minnie cried tom for he knew of songbirds deep regard for the farmers daughter  all right that suits me  let us go through lankers woods and by the old mill suggested sam thats a fine walk tom and almost as short as the regular road  just as short put in songbird  ive walked it several times and i know  and then he bit his lip as several of the others commenced to laugh  i dont careive got a right to visit the sandersons if i want to  sure you have answered sam  and minniegreat scott  whats the row now  here comes tubbs on the run and shaking his fist at us  i guess i am in for it returned tom  i fancy tubblets wants to see me    for particulars regarding how putnam hall military academy was organized and what fine times the cadets there enjoyed even before the rovers appeared on the scene read the putnam hall series six volumes starting with the putnam hall cadetspublishers     chapter iii  toms joke  what did you do to him asked sam quickly  put an advertisement of pills on his back and some other ads in his text books answered tom  say he looks some mad doesnt he  i should say yes came from stanley  william philander was approaching with long strides  in one hand he held the poster tom had fastened on his back and he was shaking his other fist wrathfully  tom rover youveerinsulted me he gasped as he came up  youve humiliated me before the whole class  illill  the dudish student was so full of wrath he could not speak  take a cough drop and clear your throat billy suggested tom coolly dont get so excited you might drop dead from heart disease  how dare you put thaterthat advertisement of gumleys red pills on my back stormed the stylishlydressed one  gumleys red pills for redblooded people quoted spud from the poster  say they are fine willie  didnt you ever take em  no and i dont want to  i want tom ro  say if you havent taken any of gumleys pills you dont know what youve missed went on spud with a wink at the others  why there was a man over in rottenberg who was flat on his back with half a dozen fatal diseases  the doctors gave him just three days to livethree days think of it  his wife nearly cried her eyes out  then along came this gumley man with a trunk full of his red pills for redblooded people  he didnt exactly know if the dying man was redblooded or not but he took a chance and gave the fellow sixteen pills four after breakfast four after dinner four after supper and four on retiring and the next day what do you think happened  that man got up and went to work and hes been at his job ever since  yes and not only that added tom earnestly  that man organized a tugofwar teamthe plumbers against the local conclave of the r w q societyand theyve had three tugofwar matches and he has pulled the r w q society over the line every time  talk about pills that are worth their weight in gold  why gumleys red pills for redblooded people are worth their weight in diamonds and you ought to get down on your bended knees and thank somebody for having been given the opportunity to advertise them  oh you make meertired dont you know gasped william philander it was aera horrid trick  all the class were laughing at me  and when i opened my greek book out fell one of those horrid bills  and then i dropped another bill on the platform andoh it was awful ill never forgive you tom rover never  and william philander stalked away still clutching the poster in his hand  poor william philander murmured sam  it was rather a rough joke tom  oh it will do him good was the answer  hes too uppish to live  yes he wants some of the conceit knocked out of him added stanley but come on if we are going for a walk let us get started  wish i had been in the classroom to see the fun mused tom his oldtime grin overspreading his face  no matter how old tom got hed never give up his boyish pranks  the crowd of students were soon on the way in the direction of the sanderson farm  but at the first turn in the road they left that highway and following a path across a pasture lot plunged into the depths of what was known as lankers woods  through the woods ran a fairsized stream of water and at one spot there was an old dam and the remains of a saw mill now going to decay  sam dont you wish you had the old dartaway back remarked stanley presently  you used to cover this part of the country pretty well with that flying machine  ive never wanted it back since it got smashed up on the railroad track was the answer  flying was good enough but i dont think i was cut out for a birdman  id like to go up again some day put in tom  but not regularly id rather travel in an auto or behind a fast horse  give me a horse every time said songbird  and then he warbled softly    to rush along at railroad speed     in auto or on wings of air   is well enough for some i think     to make you jump and make you stare   but when i journey roundabout     ill take a horse or maybe two   and then illill    and then i wont bust any tires     and walk home feeling pretty blue  added tom  say thats right songbird although you cant burst tires on a flying machine he added  that isnt just the way i was going to finish the verse said the wouldbe poet  but it will do  on went the boys deeper and deeper into the woods chatting gaily and occasionally singing snatches of college songs  sam kept close to his brother and he was glad to note that tom was acting quite like his old self  what he needs is plenty of fresh air and rest from studying thought the younger rover  hang it all it was a mistake for tom to get down to the grind so soon  he ought to have taken a trip out west or to europe or somewhere  presently the students came out on the bank of the stream and there in the sunshine they rested on a fallen tree and some rocks  it was pleasant to watch the swiftlyrushing water as it tumbled over the stones  the brook is pretty strong on account of those rains we had remarked sam  yes i never saw it so swift answered stanley  humph this is nothing announced spud  i saw it once when it ran so swiftly that the water couldnt make the turn at the bend below here and ran right up the hill and over on shelbys barn drowning sixteen cows  and some of the water hit the barn roof and bounced off into the chimney of shelbys cottage and put out the fire and  wow spud put on the soft pedal interrupted sam  oh its absolutely true  some day ill show you the tombstone they erected over the sixteen cows  its of granite and a hundred and ten feet high  never mind the tombstone interrupted tom  what i want to see is the match box shelby stored that water in after it hit the barn  and at this sally a general laugh went up  on the boys went again and half an hour later reached the abandoned saw mill  all that was left was the dam with the broken wheel and one end of what had once been a long low onestoried building  lets have a look inside suggested stanley and led the way and the others followed  sam was the last to enter coming directly behind his brother and he saw tom suddenly put his hand to the back of his head and stop  does it hurt again tom he whispered kindly  just aaspasm gasped poor tom and then he drew a long breath there its gone now he added and walked on  sam sighed and shook his head  what was this queer condition of tom going to lead to  it made him shiver to think of it  there was but little to see in the old mill  it was a damp unwholesome place and the boys soon came out again  not far away was a well hole rather deep and partly filled with water  tom was the first to notice this hole which was partly covered with rotted boards  of a sudden he commenced to grin as if he scented a huge joke  he ran up and rearranged the rotted boards so they completely covered the hole  then in the center he placed the brightcolored cap he had been wearing and hurried along to the path leading beside the dam  hi stanley he called out as the others came from the mill  get my cap will you  the wind blew it off  its back there somewhere  i see it shouted stanley  i see it too came from spud who was close by  ill race you for it stan  done was the reply and side by side the two collegians raced for the cap  an apple for the fellow who wins shouted sam who saw nothing wrong in what was going on  leg it both of you added songbird  side by side stanley and spud sped over the uneven ground in the direction of the cap  then both made a plunge forward in true football style  in a heap they landed on the rotted boards each catching hold of the coveted headwear  then came an ominous crash and both boys disappeared headlong into the well hole  look  look what has happened shrieked sam in dismay  they are in the old well gasped songbird  ha ha ha  ho ho came from tom and he shook with laughter isnt that the dandy joke  i thought stanley would go in but i didnt expect to catch the pair of em  tom cried sam in new horror  you didnt really mean  sure i did  i put my cap there on purpose  say they had some tumble didnt they  and tom commenced to laugh againa strange laugh that didnt sound like him at all  theyll be drownedwe must save them exclaimed sam hoarsely songbird what can we do he added turning to his chum  i dont knowmaybe we can throw em a ropeif there is one around  let em crawl outits easy enough came from tom  dont you spoil the joke  and he commenced to laugh again  tom dont act as if you were crazy said sam catching him by the arm and shaking him  those fellows cant get out without helpits too deep  and the sides may cave in on top of them  and there is water down there too  we must help them and at once  tom stared at his brother in bewilderment  then of a sudden the look of fun died out of his face and was succeeded by a look of horror and terror combined  did i do that sam  oh what a foolish thing to do  yes we must help them  what shall i do  ill jump down after them if you say so and tom started forward  no dont do that  sam held him back  well get a rope or a long pole  dont go too close or you may cave the top of the well in on em  yes we must get a rope or a pole gasped poor tom and ran off on a search  and i thought i was having a good joke  oh i certainly must be going crazy he muttered  in the meantime songbird had thrown himself on his hands and knees and crawled to the edge of the old well hole  he called out several times but got no reply  he heard a great floundering and splashing  hi you he continued  are you alive  sasave us came the splutteredout words from spud  sasave us  are you both alive continued songbird anxiously  yes answered stanley  but we need help for the water is over our heads  get a rope or something and be quick about it  hang on the best you can and well help you was the answer  well dont be too long about it or well be drowned came in a shivering tone from spud     chapter iv  the old well hole  the three youths at the top of the old well hole gazed around anxiously  all were looking for a rope but no such article presented itself to their view  there was a bit of iron chain lying in the dead leaves nearby but it was too short to be of service  i dont see anything to use remarked songbird wildly  oh sam this is awful  come on i think i see something answered the younger rover  tom you can help bring it over  he took his halfdazed brother by the arm more to keep him from approaching too close to the well than for any other reason and the three boys raced to where a number of saplings were growing  sam had noted that one of the saplings had been bent over by the wind and was partly uprooted  maybe we can get it upweve got to do it he cried  come catch hold and pull for all you are worth  the others understood and laid hold of the young tree which was all of fifteen feet high and several inches in diameter  it had but few branches which was an advantage  they bent it down and pulled with a will and out of the ground it came so suddenly that the boys fell flat on their backs  wait ill break off some of the branches cried sam  tom songbird try to break off that twisted root  there that will do now if we can get it down the well they ought to be able to climb up on it  it was but the work of a few seconds to drag the sapling to the hole then it was lifted upright so that the end might not dig into the sides of the well and cause a cavein  look out below there shouted sam  dont knock any stones on us came back from stanley  he and spud had braced themselves on the sides of the old well with the water up to their waists  well be as careful as we can answered songbird  look out for dirt in your eyes added tom  all the fun had died out of him and his face was full of concern  slowly and cautiously the three boys lowered the sapling into the old well hole  in doing this they had to stand close to the edge and once they sent down a shower of loose dirt that caused a wild cry of alarm from below  go slow cried spud presently  ive got it he added a second later  let her come and then the sapling was lowered until the roots rested on the bottom of the hole  the top was now several feet below the top of the old well  the old chainjust the thing cried sam and took it up  you had better come up close together suggested songbird peering down at those below  then if the well caves in youll be up that far anyway  this was thought good advice and stanley and spud determined to act on it  stanley came first with spud at his heels  the many small branches of the sapling afforded good holds and as each of the youths was something of an athlete both of them came up with comparative ease  cant get any higher remarked stanley when within two feet of the top of the sapling  its almost ready to break now  catch hold of the chain cried sam  ill hold it  tom and songbird you hold me so i dont fall in  sam had the chain twisted around his right hand and he leaned far over into the well hole his brother and songbird holding him by his free arm  the loose end of the chain dangled close to stanley and he grasped hold  then came a short hard pull and stanley came sprawling out on the grass  then spud crawled up a little higher and he was hauled out the same way  both boys were wet to the skin and covered with mud presenting anything but an enviable appearance  for several seconds they sat on the grass panting for breath  phew that was a close shave gasped spud presently  im mightily glad the old well didnt cave in on us  we went down head first came from stanley  if it hadnt been for the water we would have smashed our skulls  and the water came close to drowning us added spud and say it was some cold believe me and he shivered  youd better race around in the sun a bit or youll take cold said sam  take off your coat spud and put on mine said songbird as he commenced to divest himself of his garment  yes and stanley can have my coat came from tom  he now looked relieved but his eyes had a strange light in them  its queer how your old cap landed right on the top of the well remarked spud  why didnt the wind carry it to some safer place  at this remark toms face grew suddenly red  he tried to speak and gave a gulp  there isnt much wind now added stanley  how was it tom  ierithe wind didnt blow the cap was the lame answer  just then tom wished he was a thousand miles away  he could not look his chums in the face  it didnt blow the cap demanded spud  what do you mean  to this tom did not answer  sam wanted to speak but did not know what to say  songbird looked curiously at tom  say look here burst out stanley striding forward  do you mean to say tom rover that you put that cap on the old well on purpose  iidid answered tom feebly  ieri thought it was aa joke  a joke cried spud sarcastically  a joke to put us in peril of drowning or smothering to death roared stanley  if you call that a joke i dont and i want you to know it  and in a sudden passion he doubled up his fists and sprang towards tom  but sam rushed between the pair  stanley dont please dont he cried  tom made a mistakehe knows it now  hell know it after i am done with him cried the other hotly hes not going to play a joke on me that puts me in danger of my life ill take it out of his hide  and he tried to get past the younger rover  but still sam held him back  stanley dont touch him  you know how sick hes been  he isnt himself  let it pass  hes as sorry as any of us that it happened arent you tom  sure i am answered tom readily but his tone of voice was that of one who didnt care much one way or the other  tom was not himself that was certain  humph maybe hes sorry and maybe he isnt muttered stanley  i guess he ought to have a thrashing  anyway i am done with him and he flung back the coat tom had offered him  all in the crowd looked at tom expecting him to say something more but tom shut his mouth tightly and walked away up the river path  he was without his coat  sam picked up the garment and made after his brother  tom come back here  i wont sam  you can stay with them if you want to  ill take a walk alone was the moody answer and tom walked faster than ever  of all the mean things to do murmured spud shaking his head slowly i would never have thought it of tom rover never  tom hasnt acted just right since he came back to brill said songbird in a low tone you know he got an awful crack on the head and somehow hes been different ever since  i wouldnt lay it up against him if i were you fellows  huh  i guess youd lay it up against him if you had been soused down into that old well hole and were all wet and covered with mud growled stanley  fun is fun but that was no joke i can tell you that  he deserves a good thrashing  if he isnt right in his head they ought to put him under the doctors care or in a sanitarium remarked spud  why if he isnt right in his mind there is no telling what hell do next  he might take it into his head to murder some of us  oh i dont think its as bad as that answered songbird hastily i think in a short while hell be just as he used to be  but the excitement of that capture of those brokers and old crabtree and the fight and then dicks wedding were too much for him  what he needs i think is a good long rest  well he can keep away from me after this grumbled stanley as he looked at his wet and bedrabbled clothes  nice sight well present going back to the college  ill tell you what ill do suggested songbird  ill go ahead to the gym and get you some changes and you can put them on in dobbs barn  then nobody will know about it  all right said stanley his face brightening a trifle  what of sam and tom asked spud who was not as angry as his companion in misfortune  ill tell them we are going back answered songbird and ran after the rovers  in the meantime sam and tom had kept on walkingor rather tom had hurried on and his brother had kept up with him trying to make him turn back  but to all of sams entreaties tom turned a deaf ear  i came out for a walk and im going to walk he said stubbornly if they want to go back they can do itand you and songbird can go with em  but tom that isnt fair insisted sam  they are all wet and  humph a little water wont hurt em  ive been soaked myself more than once  if they cant take a joke let em go and tom continued to stalk on until he came to a flat rock when he suddenly sat down to rest at the same time putting both hands to his head  it was here that songbird found them and informed them of what the others and himself proposed to do  all right songbird i guess that is best said sam softly  tom doesnt feel just right and hell rest here awhile  oh im not sick cried tom  im sorry i played the trick but i dont see any reason for stanley and spud to cut up about it  and then he got up as suddenly as he had sat down and stalked on once more  do your best to fix it up songbird pleaded sam in a low tone you can see tom isnt himself  try to explain to those fellows  i will  i think tom ought to have a doctor was the low reply and then songbird rejoined stanley and spud and the three started back to brill  tom stalked on for fully half a mile without speaking and sam came behind him  the younger rover was busy thinking and did not say a word  presently the pair reached the end of the river path and came to a bridge and the highway  on the bridge tom sat down again  want to go any further tom asked sam as pleasantly as he could  i dont care where i go burst out the other  im sick of it all sick of the college sick of studying sick of those fellows sick of everything and everybody  i wish i could go to africa or the north pole or somewhere else where i wouldnt see or hear of em again  tom  i mean it  whats the use of keeping in the grind day after day like a horse on a tread mill  what does a fellow get out of it  nothing but hard work and a pain in the head  some times my head hurts to beat the band  i cant stand it and i wont  they are all against me every one of em  and tom commenced to wring his hands while two tears stood in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks     chapter v  toms queer actions  sam did not know what to say or what to do  he realized more fully than ever that his brother was not himself  he was growing wilder and more irrational every moment  tom he asked suddenly have you got those pills with you that the doctor gave you to take  sure was the ready answer  have you taken any lately  no  whats the use  they dont seem to help me  let me see them please  there they are  tom brought the box from his pocket  they might as well be bread pills or gumleys red ones and he grinned for a moment at the recollection of the trick played on william philander tubbs  sam took the box and looked at the directions carefully  it says to take one three times a day when needed he said  you had better take one now tom  come on  it wont do any good sam  well take one for me thats a good fellow  wait ive got my pocket cup and ill get some water  and he did so  oh dear youre bound to feed me pills sighed tom and made a wry face as he swallowed the one sam handed him  sam kept the box making up his mind that he would play nurse after this  i guess we had better walk some more said tom suddenly  i hate sitting still  if we had the old dartaway id take a sail from here to san francisco or some other faroff place  wait a little im tired answered sam soothingly  just see those little fishes he said pointing to the water under the bridge  he made tom get down and watch the fishes and bathed his brothers forehead  at first tom was rather restless but soon the pill seemed to take effect and he grew quiet  im getting awfully tired he announced presently  i guess we had better be getting back sam  just as you say tom was the quiet reply  it was growing dark when they reached the college grounds and most of the students had gone in to supper  tom said he did not feel much like eating but his brother told him he had better have a little food and they went in together  they saw songbird and the others at another table  the wouldbe poet and spud nodded to them but stanley paid no attention  sam and tom still occupied their old room number 25 while songbird was still in number 26  since dick was not to return to brill his place in the latter room had been taken by max spangler a jolly fellow of germanamerican parentage  vot is der madder mit dom rofer asked max of the wouldbe poet as both came up to the room after supper  oh he isnt feeling very well max was the reply  what makes you ask  oh i see him put his hands by his head on so many dimes said max he got knocked owit didnt he  yes a rascal hit him over the head with a wooden footstool and nearly cracked his skull  den he should be py der hospital yah instead of py college said the germanamerican student  well maybe theyll have to take him to the hospital or somewhere returned songbird thoughtfully  hang it all with dick gone and tom acting as he does times are not half as jolly as they used to be  in the next room sam sat down to study  tom had wanted to study too but his brother had persuaded him to lie down and rest and now he was asleep and breathing heavily  sam tiptoed his way across the room to gaze at him  poor poor tom he murmured softly  hell have to take it easy  if he tries to keep up here it may kill him or  sam did not finish it was a terrorizing thought to imagine that tom might go out of his mind  hes got to have a doctorsome specialist  im glad dick is coming so we can talk it over  but its too bad to burden dick with thisand dora toowhen they arent over their honeymoon yet  oh dear its too bad pelter threw that footstool at tom  tom continued to sleep and sam tried his best to study  but it was hard work and the youngest rover made slow progress  an hour passed and then there came a soft tap on the door  songbird was there  i thought id ask how he was he whispered nodding towards tom  sound asleep songbird  sam paused for a moment  come in and his chum did so and sam closed the door again  i wanted to ask you about stanley and spud  ii tried to explain to them without going into it too deeply said songbird  i think spud understands  but stanleywell hes pretty well riled yet  but i guess hell get over it  you can tell em that tom would never play such a trick if he waswell just right here and sam touched his forehead  its an awful state of affairs songbird  i hardly know what to do  why not send tom home for a rest  how can i if he wont go  get the doctor to order it  thats an idea  ill talk it over with dick when he comes  but i wish you could fix it up with stanley  ill do my best answered songbird and then as tom moved restlessly he hastily left the room as quietly as he had entered it  before sam went to bed tom roused up and wanted a drink of water  his brother made him take another of the pills and then both retired  for a long time sam could not sleep but at last he fell into a profound slumber  when sam awoke it was with a start for the sun was shining brightly and he feared he had overslept himself  he glanced to where tom had been resting and uttered an exclamation  gone  i wonder where he went to  he glanced at the chair on which tom had placed his clothes and saw that it was empty  the door to the corridor was ajar  can he have been walking in his sleep or did he wander away out of his mind was the agonizing thought that rushed through sams mind in a jiffy he was out of bed and had begun to dress  he did not spend longer than was necessary on his toilet  then he hurried out of the room and gazed about him  an assistant janitor was nearby running a vacuum cleaner over the floor  gilson you know my brother tom he said  have you seen him  saw him outside quite a while ago was the reply  where did he go  i dont know  he was near the gym  thanks  it did not take sam long to reach the campus  fully a score of brill students were in evidence but a quick glance showed that tom was not among them  hello sam came from bob grimes one of the crowd  how goes it this morning  fine bob  have you seen tom  yes he took a walk down the road  which way  towards town  long ago  best part of half an hour i guess  sam said no more but hurried across the broad campus and on to the highway leading to ashton  the big bell in the tower was sending out its last call for breakfast  sam put down the road on a run all sorts of thoughts wandering through his brain  what if tom was clean out of his mind and had wandered off  whoop  sam  where bound in such a hurry child came the unexpected call from a nearby field and tom vaulted the rail fence lightly taking the morning air like myself  tom gasped the younger brother coming to a halt  he ran up closer and gave the other a quick look  toms eyes were as bright as they had ever been  are you feeling all right this morning he faltered  best ive felt in a long time sam  say were you coming after me demanded tom quickly  yes if you want to know  thought i was going to run away eh  well youre mistaken sammy my son  im not going to do anything of the sort  you know how bad i felt yesterday  you certainly were bad yesterday  but come on its time for breakfast  all right sam and the two walked to the college side by side say i did some queer things yesterday didnt i went on the funloving rover anxiously  you certainly did tom  got spud and stanley in a regular mess  worse than that  they were in danger of their lives  i was a fool sam a regular downright fool and ill tell em so when i get a chance  but it was my headit wasnt just right  you must take another pill tom  here it is take it as soon as you can get some water  all right sam youre the doctor and what you say goes  i certainly dont want to act like i did yesterday again and poor tom looked greatly worried  its that crack you got on the head tom  you want to go slow with studying and with all excitement  maybe you had better go back home and take it easy  well i will if i dont feel stronger in a week or two was the slow and thoughtful answer  and then tom put his hand to the back of his head as he had done so many times lately  it was not until the noon hour that the funloving rover had a chance to talk to spud and stanley  he went up to both of his chums frankly and told them what he had told sam  oh its all right said spud quickly  i knew you werent yourself tom  dont say anything more about it  with stanley however it was different  he had spoiled a good suit of clothing and scratched his chin and hands  sam had told him to send the suit to the cleaners at the rovers expense but even this had not altogether satisfied the big student  it was a mean joke and i dont like it said stanley  it was no sort of thing to do at all tom rover  if you are going to act like that in the future i dont want anything to do with you and he left tom standing helplessly where the two had met  then tom rejoined sam feeling as uncomfortable as ever  i suppose it is all right tom said his younger brother  its all right as far as spud is concerned was the moody reply  what about stanley didnt you speak to him  i did but he is as mad as hops  he said if i was going to play that kind of jokes he didnt want anything to do with me and tom sank in an easy chair in the room  sam i guess i put my foot in it that time  stanley is a fine fellow and if he talks like that hes got a reason for it  he doesnt understand the situation tom  ill speak to him as soon as i get a chance  no dont do it  i told him how it was but he wont believe it  and why should he  im all right am i not  im not crazy or anything like that am i and tom looked at his brother pleadingly  i ought to know what i am doing  of course you are not crazy tom  nobody said you were  that crack on the head put youwell a little out of sorts thats all  if i thought i was going crazy ididwell i guess id jump overboard said tom and he heaved a deep sigh  then he very abruptly turned to the table got out one of his text books and commenced to study     chapter vi  boys and girls  hurrah tom  heres good news  from dick and dora  yes  they will be here at halfpast two  dick stopped to transact that business first so he and dora can spend the rest of the time with us and with the girls at hope  isnt that just fine  and sams face showed his pleasure  all to the merry was toms comment  say i guess we can all go over to hope together cant we he asked anxiously  well make a try for it anyway returned his brother  it was the day after the events recorded in the last chapter and tom had declared in the morning that he felt better than ever  he had even gone out on the campus to joke with songbird and william philander tubbs and speak a few words with spud  stanley had seen him and kept out of his way and that was the only cloud on the horizon  ive got nothing on today after two oclock went on tom with a grin  how about you  ive got a physics lecture but i guess i can cut it answered sam ill get spud to tell me all about it afterwards  i wouldnt miss the chance to go to hope for anything  they had heard from dick early in the morning by telegram and now had come in a message over the longdistance telephone  the oldest rover brother and his bride were making the tour in the rover family car doing this for the express purpose of giving the others a ride when they stopped at brill and hope  dick of course wanted to see all the boys at the college and dora was equally anxious to visit with the girls at the seminary  promptly on time the shrill tone of an auto horn was heard and tom and sam ran across the campus to greet the new arrivals  dick was at the wheel and dora sat beside him smiling and blushing prettily  in the tonneau of the big car rested several bags and wraps  welcome to our city sang out tom gaily  and how is mrs rover this afternoon and he made a profound bow and swept the ground with his cap  the same old tom i see cried dora gaily  are you feeling all right she asked quickly  sure was the answer  tom was the last one to put on a doleful face in front of a lady  talk about style came from sam merrily  nothing like keeping the rover name up  and he leaped on the running board and shook hands did you have a good trip  fine  not a puncture answered dick  oh it was just too lovely for anything cried dora  if dick had the time id like to go on a tour for a month  i thought maybe you fellows would like to get in and run over to hope went on dick with a smile  you couldnt keep us out answered tom promptly  we telephoned for them to be ready for us said dora  but you will have to take our baggage out to make room  here comes songbird hell look after that i know he will said sam  the wouldbe poet came up all smiles and shook hands  he said he would do anything they wished and at once took charge of the things  several others came up including spud and stanley and there was a general handshaking and a rapidfire of conversation  then sam and tom got in the automobile and away went the car in the direction of hope seminary  want me to drive asked tom  tom youd better sit in the back with me put in sam quickly this is dicks outing let him run the car  he was afraid that if tom got his hands on the wheel he might do something to put the crowd in danger  all right im satisfied was the ready answer and tom sank back on the cushions  the touring car was a powerful one and dick knew how to handle it to perfection  along the smooth road they rolled swiftly only slowing down at the turns and where the highway was not in a good state of repair  dora turned around to talk to the others asking about the college and then spoke about those left at cedarville and at valley brook  mamma is real well again she said  better in fact than she has been in a long while  i know she feels relieved to think that dick can now take charge of all of her affairs and of my affairs too  dick is getting to be a business man fast remarked sam  with your affairs and dads affairs he must be having his hands full  oh the more the merrier answered the oldest brother  i like it better than going to college  but as he spoke his face became very thoughtful  clearly dick had something on his mind  he was not nearly as talkative as usual sam soon noticed that and so did tom  presently the touring car came in sight of hope seminary nestling in a pretty grove of trees  two girls were down by the stone gateway and both waved their hands  grace and nellie  here they come  i told you theyd bring sam and tom  doesnt dora look sweet in that brown suit  and how handsome dick is getting  say tom looks awfully pale  these words came from nellie and as she spoke she turned a bit pale herself  to be surehes been real sick answered grace  but hell soon get over it dont worry she added trying to comfort her sister  by this time the touring car had come to a halt and dora and dick and the two college boys were getting out  then followed more handshaking and not a few kisses  dora hugged her cousins and was hugged in return  all felt very happy and their faces showed it  of course dick and dora had to tell all about the trip how they had gotten on the wrong road and how a drove of cows had once blocked their way and how they had stopped at one hotel where they had heard a concert given for charity  and the weather has been almost ideal said dick  only one little shower that was just enough to lay the dust on the roads that werent oiled  to give tom and sam a chance to visit with nellie and grace dick continued to run the car with dora at his side and all of the others in the back  with nellie near him tom seemed to brighten up considerably and told a number of jokes that made everybody laugh  but with it all he was by no means as lively as was natural with him  ive got it all arranged to go to spotswood said dick  i telephoned to the big hotel there to have a table ready for us  and well come back in the moonlight  oh glorious moonlight returned sam and gave grace a look that caused her to blush deeply  say let us sing one of the old time songs cried tom and started one that had been their favorite ever since going to putnam hall military academy  thats like old times exclaimed dick  but please dont sing so loud or you may scare the car and this sally caused a general laugh  dont you miss the seminary dora asked nellie  of course i do butbut  shed rather be with dick finished sam with a wink  to be sure i would mr smarty came promptly from the bride  wish i could leave college as dick did put in tom with a glance at nellie  i hate books anyway  oh thats because you are not strong yet tom said dora sympathetically  ive told him he ought to take more of a rest said sam  oh lets talk about something else cried tom  im tired of being held up as an object of sympathy  look at the little calf he continued pointing to a field beside the roadway  a fellow could pick it up in his arms  say wouldnt it be great to introduce that calf in professor blackies bedroom some night  no more such tricks tom answered dick almost sternly  youve got to settle down  oh must i papa returned tom in a trembling childish treble yes papa ill be your own little good boy  and then another general laugh went up  we hardly have any fun any more at hope said nellie  its just lessons and lectures from morning to night and the instructors are that sharp  yesterday i missed a question in ancient history and i was nearly scared to death  humph ancient history is enough to scare anybody to death  whats the use of studying ancient history when there is so much history still to come of which we know absolutely nothing and tom looked around with the air of a profound professor  here is where we once came over in the dartaway said dick a little later  i guess youll remember that ride he added to his bride  shall i ever forget it murmured dora  oh how glad i was to get away from that horrid josiah crabtree and those sobbers went on the girl with a shudder  she referred to a happening which has been related in detail in the rover boys in the air  well the sobbers are going to get what is coming to them put in tom  and old crabtree too said dick  they told me up at the hospital that the double break in his leg will make him more or less of a cripple for life  well if ever a man deserved to be punished it was josiah crabtree said sam  he was a bad egg from the first time we met him at putnam hall  but i say let us forget all that unpleasant past and enjoy ourselves and he started up another song and the others joined in  by six oclock they reached spotswood and dick ran the touring car around to the big hotel located there  then they went inside and washed up a little  in the dining room a special table had been set for them in an alcove  there was a big bouquet in the center and a small bouquet at each plate  say dick this is immense said sam admiringly  just too lovely for anything burst out the laning girls simultaneously  how did you come to think of the flowers asked tom putting his bouquet in his buttonhole and letting nellie pin it fast  that was doras idea answered the big brother  i thought it would brighten things up said dora  its our first dinner together sincesinceyou know and she blushed prettily  since the wedding feast said sam  well its just a number one couldnt be better  thats what cried tom  dick and dora had ordered the dinner with care so there was a wellselected course starting with tomato bisque soup and ending with icecream and crackers cheese and coffee  they had some dainty fish and an extra tenderloin steak and it is perhaps needless to state that the boys did full justice to all that was set before them and the girls also ate heartily for all were still in their growing years tom created some fun by sticking some stalks of celery in the big center bouquet on the sly and then asking dora what sort of flowers she had ordered mixed in  and nellie told dick he ought to make a speech and he said hed leave that to tom whereupon the irrepressible tom said he would deliver a lecture on how to cook for two alone if dick and dora wanted to listen  then the fun became general and lasted long after the meal was over  it was moonlight outside and presently all went to the broad veranda of the hotel  tom naturally paired off with nellie and sam with grace and dick and dora wisely kept out of the way  we had our day now let them have theirs said dick to his bride  by all means dick returned dora with a smile that made him pinch her arm  but listen dear she added in a whisper  did youdid you notice tom  yes  he tries to keep up but he isnt himself at all  i know it and so does sam and i might as well admit it dora both of us are a good deal worried replied the young husband gravely     chapter vii  college days  sam and grace sat in a corner of the piazza for the best part of half an hour and during that time the girl told of her various doings at hope and about the news from home and sam related what had occurred at brill omitting however to tell how tom had sent spud and stanley into the old well hole  there was a good deal of nonsense added to the conversation and it must be admitted that sam held graces hand as much as she would permit  they also spoke about the wedding of dick and dora and of the good times they had enjoyed on that occasion  tom and nellie took a stroll through a little park opposite the hotel what they talked about none of the others knew at the time but nellie came back looking very sober and thoughtful so that her sister wondered if tom had really and truly proposed to her  tom was whistling softly to himself as if to keep up his courage  well i guess it is time to start on the return if you young ladies have got to be in by ten said dick at last  even as it is i havent allowed any time for punctures or breakdowns  perish the thoughts of such happenings cried grace  weve had our blowout where i like it bestat the hotel added sam and this joke caused a smile  as before dick drove the car with dora beside him and the others in the tonneau  he had all his lights lit making the roadway almost as bright as day  once out of town the oldest rover put on speed until they were flying along grandly  oh dick be careful pleaded dora  you might hit something in the dark  not much to hit on this road he answered  but ill look out dont fear  oh let her go shouted tom recklessly  why you can get ten miles more of speed dick if you try  let her out for all you are worth  oh tom pleaded nellie and as he arose and waved his hand she pulled him down on the seat  if you dont look out youll fall out  look out fall out repeated tom  a good joke  ha ha  let her out dick  and he tried to stand up again  want me to help  and he leaned over his brothers shoulder and took hold of the steering wheel  drop it tom exclaimed dick warningly  do you want to steer us into a ditch  drop it i say  and he pushed tom with his elbow  sit down tom called sam and caught hold of his brother  dont monkey like that in the darkits dangerous  oh i was only fooling returned the funloving one  cant you stand for a little sport and then he sank in a corner and had nothing more to say for some time  nellie heaved a deep sigh and for a moment buried her face in her hands  all too soon hope seminary was reached and sam and tom escorted the laning girls to the doorway of that institution  there was a fond good night cut somewhat short on nellies part and then the rover boys returned to the touring car  what a grand time murmured grace as she and her sister went upstairs to the room they occupied  was it asked nellie absently  i am glad you enjoyed it  why nellie didnt you  no  oh  and grace clutched her sister by the arm  what do you mean  ii cant tell you burst out the other and then she fairly ran for their room and once inside threw herself on her bed and burst into tears  grace came after her locked the door and sat down and held her hand  she thought she understood and determined to ask no more questions  you are going to stay in ashton over night are you not questioned sam of his brother as the auto neared brill  yes  i want to see youto talk about dads affairsand about tom went on the youngest rover in a whisper  all right sam  ill get up early and run over here before breakfast ill be at the gate at seven oclockif it is clear  ill see you first and then talk to tom and so it was arranged  here whats the secret demanded tom abruptly  nothing much answered sam  dick will be over to see us in the morning before he and dora go back  oh all right  tom gave a sudden chuckle  wish i had brought that calf along  i could have a barrel of fun with him tonight  youre going right to bed and so am i answered sam  weve had fun enough for the present  and then he and his brother said goodbye to dora for they did not expect to see her again for some time to come  sam was afraid that tom might not want to go to bed so soon but his fears were groundless  tom undressed at once and inside of five minutes was in profound slumber  he occasionally moved uneasily in his sleep and sighed heavily but that was all  maybe he ought to have a doctor but what a doctor can do for him i dont know thought sam and retired himself sighing deeply  with tom not himself the whole world seemed wrong  dick was on hand at the appointed time and sam was glad to get up to meet him and know that tom was still sleeping  well first of all ill have to tell you about dad said dick as he ran the auto up the road a bit out of sight of brill  he is not nearly as well as i would like to see and the doctor says he must not dream of doing a stroke of work  so that leaves all that new york business and that western business in my hands  can you manage it dick  ive got to manage it sam  and in the meantime ive got mrs stanhopes affairs to look after and also doras money matters  it is keeping me hustling i can tell you  i never dreamed i would become such an outandout business fellow  its fine of you to be able to do it dick  i am only sorry i cant help you  but some day tom and i will finish up here and then well take hold  sure i know that  but now let us drop business  tell me all about tom  just how has he been acting  i know you didnt want to let out in front of the girls  well tom is a problem dick  sometimes he acts as bright as ever and then he seems to be clean off  and then in as few words as possible sam related the particulars of his brothers doings since he had returned to brill  as he proceeded dicks face grew very thoughtful  i dont like this at all he said flatly  maybe after all it would be much better to send tom home and place him under the care of a specialist  if he remains here there is no telling what he will do next  supposing spud or stanley had been drowned in that well hole and dick gave a shiver  yes but how are you going to get him home if he wont go  do you think hell object  yes dick  but you can try him if you wish concluded sam  and then the pair returned to the college grounds  by this time tom had come below and was looking for them  if you were going to take a ride why didnt you let me know he grumbled  id like to run that car a bit before dick goes back  say tom why not return to cedarville with me and dora asked dick kindly  i am sure the trip would do you good and when you got there you could take a good long rest  humph all at me to rest eh  well im not going to rest im going to study and get through here just as soon as possible  tom straightened up  now dont you two think i cant do it for i can i feel stronger every day  that crack i got on the head was a fierce one i admit but it isnt going to knock me out not by a long shot in a few weeks ill be as strong as ever  dick and sam looked at each other in dismay  clearly it was out of the question to try to argue with tom who had always been more or less headstrong  all right then stay said dick  but take it easy tom and do what sam tells you to  a little later dick drew sam to one side and asked him to keep a close watch on his brother  ill do my best  and notify me at once if anything goes wrong added dick  then he took the next quarter of an hour to visit with songbird and some of his other old chums  spud hailed him with delight and even stanley smiled warmly as he shook hands  stanley i want to ask you to bear with poor tom said dick as he continued to hold the others hand  he isnt himself at all and you ought to be able to see it  sam and i want him to go home and consult a specialist but he wont do it  i dont know what to make of him what he did was terrible and i am sure he wouldnt have done it if he was in his right mind  maybe returned stanley hesitatingly  ive been talking it over with spud and maybe i was a little harsh  but to be tumbled in that well hole in the mud and water made me mad clean through  it would make anybody mad and i wouldnt stand for it either if tom was in his right mind  but you can see how it is  sam and i feel terrible over it  i want you to forgive him and i want you and spud and songbird to help sam watch him  why do you think hell do something desperate asked stanley curiously  i dont know what to think  if a fellow is out of his head he is liable to do almost anything  i want him watched and what is more id like you fellows to keep this to yourselves  i dont want the whole college to know it  you can trust me to keep mum said spud promptly  i shant say a word added songbird  i think too much of tom  why he is one of the finest fellows in the world when he is all right  all right ill keep quiet too said stanley  and i wont hold anything against him  but you had better watch him pretty closely was the warning  of course tom wanted to know all about his fathers business and dick told him as much as he thought was necessary  he did not want to worry his sick brother and so kept back a good deal of what he had related to sam  dont you worry about me dick cried tom on parting  ill be all right  and he waved his hand gaily and so did sam as the big touring car moved away in the direction of ashton  fortunately for the boys the lessons that day were not hard and tom and sam came through without missing  then followed a settling down to the work of the term and thus a week slipped by  day by day sam watched tom closely  he made his brother take his pills regularly and also made him take outdoor exercise and aided him as much as possible in his studies and with his themes  all the others were very friendly and even stanley came up and told tom that he was sorry he had been so harsh  well i dont blame you stanley said tom frankly  it was a mighty poor joke  i dont see how i did it  and there the matter was dropped  it was ideal weather for outdoor sports and sometimes the lads would go out for a game of baseball or football just as the whim seized them of course the college had its regular teams on the diamond and the gridiron but the rovers did not care enough for the sport to try for these even though they had made creditable records at putnam hall  great news cried tom coming into the gymnasium one afternoon after playing with some of the students on the campus  whats that asked several curiously  a couple of moving picture men from chicago have leased camerons hall in ashton and they are going to open a moving picture theater next week  wont that be fine  i love the movies and now well be able to go there whenever we want to     chapter viii  the joke on william philander  the news tom had brought created much interest in brill  in the past anything in the shape of public amusement for the students had been scarce  once in a while a cheap theatrical company would stop at ashton and give a performance but usually it was of such a poor order that if the boys went they would poke fun at it  how do you know it will be any good tom asked songbird  oh im not sure that it will be  but the druggist told me that the men were wellknown in the movies and had some firstclass showhouses elsewhere so im hoping it will be all right  is it going to be a five or tencent house asked another  five in the afternoon and ten at night  then im going to begin to save my pennies announced spud seriously  ive got two saved already and if i am careful for the next month or two ill have enough to buy a ticket  that is provided ill lend you one cent added tom and this caused a general grin  he looked around and saw william philander approaching  hi tubblets he called out  heres a job for you and he waved his hand quickly for the dudish student to approach  now no more jokes tom rover was the warning of the stylishlydressed one  no more jokes  jokes repeated tom  this is a joba splendid situationopen to just such a handsome wellproportioned young gentleman like yourself  whatahdo you want asked william philander curiously  wouldnt you like to assist during the evening at a new entertainment at ashton  a couple of gentlemen are getting up an entertainment for the benefit of the ladies and gentlemen and they wish the aid of a real nice young man to show the folks to their seats and make them comfortable and all that  and maybe theyll want you to singjust to help things along you know  oh is that it and the dudish students face brightened  on several occasions he had assisted at charity bazaars and the like and had been in his element among the welldressed girls and their mothers  i think you would just fill the bill willie went on tom  you are the best looking fellow here and of course we know nobody dresses quite as well as you do  oh yes of courseits very kind to mention that tom and william philander commenced to swell up with pride  yes i do try to keep up with the fashions  but about this entertainment  who is getting it up and what benefit is it for  two gentlemen named carr and beckwith are getting it up  i dont know about the benefit  you can find out about that from them  but its a splendid chance to show what you can do  you know all about showing folks to seats and all that dont you  why yes of course  and you could sing eh  wellahi might render that spring songcome where the flowers are blooming dearest mary  just the cheesei mean it would be fine tubby  theyd all go wild about that song  its the same one you sang for the prince of moneco isnt itor was it the duke of twisters  ieri never sang for those folks tomi sang it at the ladies aid of the golden hope society and at the quarterly gathering of the poladic society  yes yes i remember now  well you are just the one to fill the bill bill yes you are  please dont call me bill its horrid  but where shall i find out about thiserentertainment  at carters new drugstore  the gentlemen are to be there saturday afternoon to make all arrangements  you go by all meansi know they will be delighted to have your assistance  this isnt aera joke tom asked william philander suspiciously  they want somebody i tell you honest  dont they jepson went on tom turning to a lad who had been to ashton with him  they sure do answered jepson and then turned away to hide the broad grin on his face  how long is the entertainment to last  you will have to get all the information from the gentlemen answered tom calmly  just go down to the drug store and ask for mr carr and mr beckwith and theyll tell you all about it  its a fine chance for you tubby concluded tom and then walked away followed by his chums  tom what is the game demanded sam when they were out of hearing  well go down to the drug store saturday afternoon and see was the reply  are carr and beckwith the moving picture men  yes and they want a young man to play usher and do a lot of other thingsone who can sing preferred and the funloving tom grinned broadly  oh tom and you would send william philander there cried songbird such a dude as he is  hell never forgive you  there is seven dollars a week in it to start answered the funloving rover calmly and this made all in the crowd roar for they knew how rich tubbs was and how working for seven dollars a week would appeal to him  this conversation occurred on thursday and the crowd of boys waited impatiently for saturday to come  sam was glad to notice that tom seemed to improve daily and was acting very much like his old self  on saturday directly after lunch sam and tom saw william philander start off for ashton  he was stylishly dressed as usual and carried a goldheaded cane and in his buttonhole was a large carnation  now for the fun cried tom and he and sam quickly gathered their chums together and all went after the dude but kept out of his sight  the drug store that william philander was bound for was located on a corner with doors opening on both streets  on the side street there was also an ordinary window and both doors and window were wide open  well go around to the side and watch him suggested tom and this was done  sprucing up so as to look his very best william philander strode into the drug store  as it chanced several young ladies of the town were having soda at the fountain and as he had once met one of them he made a most profound bow lifting his hat as he did so  then he approached the proprietor of the shop who was putting up a prescription at the rear counter close to the open window  mr carter i believe he lisped  yes sir  what can i do for you  i am mr william philander tubbs from brill college was the lofty answer  perhaps you have heard of me  i came in to meet two gentlemen mr carr and mr beckwith  are they here  not yet mrermr phillips  no no mr william philander tubbs  when will they be here may i ask  i expect em any moment mrermr tubbs  then ill wait for them answered the dude and sank down in a chair  have you got an interest in that show asked the druggist as he continued to compound the prescription  not yet but i may have answered william philander calmly  it will be quite a grand affair i presume  they say it will be the best ashton ever had  is that so  then i am very glad i came to take part went on william philander warming up  i am sure i can be of great service to messrs carr and beckwith  i have had a great deal of experience you know  thought you said you were from brill  oh yes but dont you know i have assisted at many entertainments gushed william philander  why some entertainments would have been absolute failures if i had not taken part  hum is that so returned the druggist  tubbs dudish ways did not strike him very favorably  well here is mr beckwith now you can tell him about it he added  a burly redfaced man with a heavy moustache had entered  he was evidently in a hurry and full of business  anybody call about that job mr carter he asked abruptly  this young man wants to see you answered the druggist and indicated william philander  you are mr beckwith  yes  permit me and the stylishdressed student presented his card  i was told you were getting up an entertainment and needed some assistance continued william philander  now i have had a great deal of experience in that line and the ladies always seem to be glad to see me  i can aid in getting up the proper programme and all that you know  i was on the committee of the charity bazaar and the plainvine dog show and the ladies aid of the golden hope society and the blue banner social and  say what are you pouring into me gasped mr beckwith in astonishment  do you think i am running a pink tea or a ladies sewing circle  i dont need anybody to help me to get up a programme my partner mr carr attends to that end of it  what i need is a strong willing fellow to take tickets and usher folks to seats and keep the floor free of rubbish and all that  what shrieked william philander  youyouwhat sort of an entertainment are you going to give he faltered  why didnt you know  we are going to open the eclipse moving picture theater in camerons hall over yonder  we advertised for a young man to take tickets usher and make himself generally useful  well have a little vaudeville with the photo plays and if the young fellow can sing or dance well give him a chance at it  oh dear me  did you ever gasped poor william philander  and then as he saw that the girls at the soda fountain had heard all that was going on he turned red  i hardly think you will do for the job went on the moving picture man  you dont lookerwell strong enough  job wailed william philander  ieri dont want any job  oh this is dreadful horrible  its one of tom rovers jokes  i might have known it  sent me all the way to ashton to try to get a position in a horrid moving picture show  oh this is the worst ever  and looking the picture of despair poor tubbs rushed from the drug store with the laughter of the proprietor the show man and the girls ringing in his ears  from the window and the side door tom sam and the others had seen and heard all that took place  they had all they could do to suppress their mirth and when tubbs came storming out of the drug store they lost no time in disappearing out of sight behind the building  they watched the stylishlydressed student prance down the street brandishing his cane viciously in the air  just wait till he catches you tom remarked spud  hell about half kill you added stanley  oh i guess i can stand it answered the funloving rover calmly  it was rather a rough joke was sams comment  oh he needs something like that to take the awful conceit out of him came from songbird  why he is getting worse and worse every day  half the students are down on him  this may do him good  i doubt if you can make william philander improve was stanleys comment  the only thing that will do it is to send him off to sea or on a ranch and make him rough it for a while  tom expected to see tubbs that evening but the dudish student kept out of sight  he did not show himself until sunday afternoon and then he had but little to say  but he eyed tom in a manner that was new to william philander  he is going to get back at you tom said sam  better keep your eyes open  on monday afternoon tom and sam went down to the water for a short row they came back just before supper and rushed up to their room to fix up a bit  hello the door is locked cried tom trying it  and the keyhole is plugged added sam taking a look  then the brothers looked at each other  i guess william philander tubbs did it said tom     chapter ix  william philander turns the tables  it was useless to try to open the door  the lock was filled up with a wad of paper that refused to budge  if its only paper we can burn it out suggested sam  but it may scorch the door  well go through by the way of songbirds room said tom  there was a door connecting the two rooms  it was not supposed to be used for one of the beds was against it  but the bed was rolled to one side by tom  songbird and his roommate had already gone below  heres the key said sam bringing it from a nearby nail  its a wonder william philander didnt plug this keyhole too  maybe he didnt have time answered tom  always supposing it really was tubbs  thats soiy may have been somebody else  the connecting door was unlocked and tom and sam walked into their own apartment  both gave a cry of astonishment  and not without reason  the room had been stacked and every boy who has ever attended boarding school or college knows what that means  in the center of the room lay the parts of the two beds in a heap and on top of those parts were piled a miscellaneous collection of books chairs clothing the table and bureau looking glass an empty water pitcher football baseball bats shoes bed clothing rugs papers pens pencils soap caps a steamer trunk from the closet several framed photographs some college banners and a score of other articles  on the very top of the heap was a fancy sofa pillow nellie had given to tom and to this was pinned a card on which was written in a disguised scrawl    hoping you will enjoy your job   it was william philander all right enough murmured sam as he and his brother inspected the card  you sent him to one job and he is sending us to another and he heaved a deep sigh  some work sammy returned tom  well we cant go at it nowit will take us two hours to straighten things up  well do it after supper  going after tubbs for this  whats the use  i dont blame him for getting back at us  i guess after all that joke i played on him was rather rough replied tom  it took the best part of three hours to put the room back into shape some ink had been spilled on one of the mattresses and the glass over one of the photographs had been broken but that was all the real damage that had been done and it looked to be accidental  the wad of paper in the keyhole was picked out piecemeal by means of a big fishhook  the key was in the heap on the floor having been flung through the open transom after the door was locked and plugged  well he got back at you right enough said songbird while the room was being rearranged  dots chust vot he did py golly came from max spangler  after this incident the boys settled down to their studies for the best part of a week  tom was now doing very well although he still complained of his head  ive got an idea said sam one afternoon after the eclipse photo playhouse in ashton had been opened  why cant we make up a party some afternoon or evening and take the girls to the show  i thought of that answered tom  but dont you think it would be best for us to go alone first and see what sort of a place it is  some of these country show places have pretty rough audiences  oh ashton isnt such a common town as that tom  but maybe it would be better to size it up first  what do you say if we go down next wednesday evening  we might make up a little party with songbird and the others  that suits me  the matter was talked over with the others and it was speedily arranged that nine of the students should go including sam tom songbird and spud  stanley could not get away and max had some lessons he wanted to make up  i hope they have some thrilling films said tom when the time came to leave for ashton  i hate these wishywashy love stories and wouldbe funny scenes  i once saw a shipwreck that was fine and a slide down a mountainside that couldnt be beaten  well well have to take what comes said sam  i understand they change the pictures twice a week  when the students arrived at the playhouse in ashton an agreeable surprise awaited them  instead of the dingy hall they had expected to see they saw that the place had been completely transformed  there was a large electric sign over the door and several big billboards announced the various attractions  a crowd was purchasing tickets at the booth in front and already the showhouse was half filled for the first performance of the evening  her first love read tom from a billboard  that sounds a little mushy  broncho bills reward he went on  that might be interesting  lost in the ice fields of alaska in two parts  say that sounds as if it might be something worth while he added brightening up  yes id like to see some pictures of alaska returned songbird  provided they werent taken in hoboken or somewhere like that answered sam  some of these moving pictures are great fakes  they take real scenes in china right in new york city and show you the bottom of the sea taken on the sixth floor of an office building in chicago  never mind i guess well get our moneys worth said another of the students and then the crowd passed inside each youth buying his own ticket as was the usual custom  they managed to get seats almost in the center of the hall which was long and narrow just the shape for such an exhibition  they noticed that a tall lanky town boy was usher and tom nudged sam in the ribs  just think william philander might have had that job he chuckled  well you did the best you could for him answered sam dryly  the end of a funny reel was being shown and the audience was laughing heartily  then came an illustrated song sung by a young woman with a fairly good voice and after that broncho bills reward a short drama of the plains with cowboys and cattle thieves and a sheriff who aided broncho bill to get back his employers cattle and win the hand of the girl he loved  maybe you could write some verses about that girl suggested sam to songbird in a whisper  you could call it the cowboys sweetheart or something like that  so i could murmured the wouldbe poet and immediately commenced to make up rhymes which he scribbled on some paper in the dark  at last came the welladvertised drama lost in the ice fields of alaska  it was a well put together play the opening scene taking place in a shipping office in seattle  next came the departure of the steamer for the north  there were several views on shipboard and quite a complicated plot the villain of the play trying to get the best of a young gold hunter and his partner  a girl appeared and she exposed the villain and the latter stalked around and vowed vengeance on both the girl and the young gold hunter  the second part of the play took place in alaska and there was shown a typical mining town and then the mountains  it was midwinter and the mountains were covered with snow  the young gold hunter and his partner had discovered several nuggets of good size enough to make them rich and were bound back to the mining camp when the villain and his cronies appeared and robbed them  then came a fierce snowstorm and a blizzard and the young gold hunter and his partner were lost on the fields of ice  this was tremendously realistic and the audience held its breath in suspense wondering what would happen next  isnt it great murmured tom his eyes fairly glued to the screen before him  i never saw anything so real  that must surely have been taken in alaska answered sam  illustration that must surely have been taken in alaska said sam the rover boys in alaska  lost in the ice fields went on tom  how terrible  the play went on  the young gold hunter and his partner were almost frozen to death when the scene shifted to the mining camp  word of the robbery was brought in by an indian and the father of the girl organized a rescuing party taking his daughter and half a dozen men with him  on the way they ran across the villain and his cronies frozen stiff in the ice and snow and with the stolen nuggets in their possession  then the rescuing party went on until they reached the young gold hunter and his partner just in time to save them from death the young man was given his nuggets and he asked for the hand of the girl who had aided in the search and all ended happily  well that was certainly a great play was spuds comment as the students left the photo playhouse  wow it made me fairly shiver to look at that snow and those fields of ice  it was just as if a fellow was there said sam  think of the work of taking those films said bob grimes  ill wager the photographer had pretty cold fingers  thus the talk ran on all of the students being enthusiastic over the production  the only one who was rather quiet was tom and soon sam noticed this  whats the matter tom dont you feel well he asked anxiously  nothing extra was the answer and tom put his hands to his eyes  i guess that moving picture strained my head too much  but it was greatbest picture i ever saw  say id like to go to alaska once wouldnt you sam  yes but not to be caught in the ice and snow like that returned the younger rover boy  say its a good show for the girls all right he went on  fine  well take em as soon as we can arrange it  all the way back to brill the students talked about the wonderful alaskan film which had really been taken on the spot and had cost a good deal of money  evidently in opening the new photo playhouse messrs carr and beckwith had resolved to give the audiences their moneys worth  it was a good advertisement too for not only did the town people flock to the place but the college students told their friends and the next evening a score or more of the boys attended the performance the dimes flowed in steadily much to the delight of the owners of the project  that evening sam noticed that tom was quite feverish and he advised his brother to take an extra pill to quiet him  oh all i need is sleep said tom  that picture hurt my eyes a little  after they are rested ill be all right  and then he undressed and retired  sam had been asleep about two hours when he awoke with a start  he sat up and in the dim light of the room saw his brother thrashing wildly in the bed  give me the nuggets murmured poor tom in a nightmare  i must have the money  ha the biggest nugget in alaska  he clutched at the pillow  out of my way i say  it is mine  look it is snowing where is the trail  we are lost  see the ice and snow  lost lost lost  and tom floundered around more wildly than ever  sam leaped out of bed and catching his brother by the arm shook him vigorously  tom  tom wake up he cried  youre asleep  wake up  you are not in alaska  wake up  oh the ice and snow  and the trail is lost  we shall die  can nothing save  erereh  whats thethe matter stammered tom and suddenly opened his eyes  what are you shaking me for sam he demanded  youve got a nightmare tom and you were shouting to beat the band  was i  say ii thought i was in alaska right in that field of snow and ice  and i was lost  gosh what a scare i had  and poor tom fairly trembled  well go to sleep and try to forget it said sam and tom laid down again and soon dropped off  sam also retired once more but he was much troubled  i guess it didnt do tom any good to go to that show he reasoned     chapter x  in which tom disappears  sam was the first one up in the morning  he found tom thrashing around in his bed  he had an uncertain look in his eyes and was feverish  how do you feel tom he asked sitting down and taking his brothers hand  not as good as usual was the reply  tom put his hand to his head as of old  ive got a fierce pain here he added  shall i send for a doctor  no ill keep quiet and maybe it will go over sam  all right ill have you excused from lessons  sam dressed and went below and after breakfast came up again  he found tom sound asleep  i guess sleep will do him as much good as anything he told himself and went out again closing the door softly  sam had two classes to attend before dinner so it was not until quarter to twelve that he had a chance to run up to the room again  to his surprise tom was gone  songbird did you see tom he called to his chum who was in the next room  no  hes gone and i left him sound asleep when i went to lessons  oh he must be somewhere around suggested the wouldbe poet of the college  maybe hes taking a bath  ill find out said sam  on the way to the bathroom he met spud and asked about tom  why i saw tom about eleven oclock said spud  he told me he was going to town to see a doctor  doctor havens  yes  oh all right and sam felt much relieved  he went to dinner with the others and then waited for toms return  a full hour went by and still tom did not show himself and then sam sought out spud once more  how did tom act when he went away spud  act  what do you mean  was he all right  well to tell the truth sam i think he looked a bit strange in his eyes  but i guess he was all right  id not worry too much if i was you  hell be back before long  maybe doctor havens was out and he had to wait  thats so  presently sam had a lecture to attend and went off to it  at halfpast three he was free once more and hurried again to his room  tom was still absent and nobody seemed to know anything about him  i guess i had better go to town and see where he is thought sam and he asked songbird if he wanted to go along  yes ill go sam  but dont worry so muchim certain tom is ok  maybe songbird  but you know how queer he acted  he didnt seem to be able to get over that crack in his head  well it was an awful blow sam  it would have killed some people  before long the pair were on their way to ashton  about half way to the town they met two students who had been away from brill for several days  did you come from ashton cabot asked sam of one of the boys  we did  see anything of my brother tom  no  i think i saw him said the other student a fellow named lambert  where  down at the depot  i was looking for my baggage  i think i saw him near the freight house  was he alone  yes so far as i know  why whats wrong rover  oh nothing only i want to find him said sam and to avoid further questioning he hurried on pulling songbird with him  if tom was at the freight house he must have been taking a walk suggested songbird  perhaps but i am awfully worried about this  it did not take the two students long to reach ashton and sam went directly to the home of doctor havens located in a grove of trees on a side street  a man was washing down the front piazza with a pail of water  is the doctor in asked sam  no sir he wont he in until about six oclock said the man  how long has he been gone may i ask  he went to the city directly after breakfast this morning for a consultation with some other doctors  he hasnt any assistant  no sir but he said if anybody needed a doctor in a hurry to call old doctor slate  where does he live  in the big white house on the hill opposite the depot  i know the place put in songbird  well go there said sam  much obliged he added to the man  maybe tom went there and that is how lambert came to see him near the freight house suggested songbird  well soon know returned the youngest rover  it did not take the students long to cross the railroad tracks and reach doctor slates residence  they found the old doctor out in his garden tying up some bushes  he was a whitehaired gentleman and had given up his regular practice some years before  no there has been no young man to see me he said in answer to sams question  old mrs powers was in and pop slocum the negro and thats all  in that case tom must be hanging around town waiting for doctor havens to return said songbird  its a puzzle to me said sam with a deep sigh and he and his chum walked slowly away  i wouldnt worry so much sam said songbird sympathetically  i am sure it will be all right  it would be if tom was all right in his head songbird  but you know how he acted that day stanley and spud went into the old well hole and  well what could happen to him in ashton such a sleepy country town as this is  oh hes around somewhere and will soon turn up take my word for it  they found the depot deserted for it was a time of day when there were no trains  then they walked up the main street past the stores and the eclipse photo playhouse  the afternoon performance was just over at the show place and a crowd of about a hundred mostly women and children was pouring forth  in the crowd were a burly jolly looking farmer and a pretty girl his daughter  why mr sanderson cried songbird his face lighting up  and you minnie  this is a surprise and he shook hands  oh cried the girl and smiled sweetly  i didnt expect to see you here  we were doing some tradin in town and thought wed run in and see the movin picters said mr sanderson who knew the boys well  they sure are great  we came in to find tom said sam as he too shook hands  he and his brothers had once done minnie sanderson a great service the particulars of which i have related in the rover boys at college since that time songbird had frequently visited the sanderson homestead to call on minnie whom he regarded as the nicest young lady of his acquaintance  to find tom repeated minnie  yes  have you seen him  i saw him about noon time said mr sanderson  where  why he was walking along the road to hope seminary  the road to hope cried sam  are you sure  tolerably sure sam  i was drivin rather fast an didnt take much of a look  but i reckon it was tom  maybe he went there to call on nellie suggested songbird  this mixes me up murmured sam  i dont know what to think  i trust there is nothing wrong sam said minnie sweetly  she counted the rovers among her warmest friends  ii hope not and yet i am very much worried  you see tom hasnt been just himself ever since he got that blow on the head  he came to ashton to see a doctor but the doctor was away on business  now i cant find him anywhere  if you want to go to hope ill drive you there said mr sanderson ive got to go there anywayto see about some potatoes they wanted minnie said she would stay in town and do some more shopping until i got back  but ive only got a buggy big enough for two added the farmer  i could stay in town with minnie until you got back said songbird eagerly to sam  i could keep my eyes open for tom  we could both look for him added the girl  it pleased her to think she might have the wouldbe poets company  the matter was talked over for several minutes and then it was agreed that sam should ride over to the seminary with the farmer  you wont have to hurry back said songbird on parting  if it gets too late minnie and i can go over to the hotel for supper and he smiled at the girl who blushed and smiled in return  mr sanderson had always owned some excellent horses and the mare attached to his buggy was a swift animal  he and sam got into the turnout and away they went with a whirl soon leaving ashton behind  this year the seminary is going to buy all its potatoes from me explained the farmer  and they get their cabbages and carrots and turnips from me too and a good many of their eggs and chickens  they are quite a customer and i want to do my best to please em  its a fine place returned sam  just as good as brill  so it is sam  by the way how is dick makin out  i understand he was lookin after your fathers business  he is and he is getting along very well  of course our lawyer is helping him for some matters are in an awful tangle  that feller who hit tom over the head ought to have been put in jail  well he is going to lose most of his propertyor at least he had to give up what belonged to dad  the lawyer thinks that will be punishment enough  we thought of prosecuting the bunch but dad is in such bad health he didnt want to bother  besides one of the crowd josiah crabtree broke his leg in two places and he will be a cripple for life  serves the rascal right  he had no business to interfere with you and with that mrs stanhope an her daughter  i aint got no sympathy to waste on sech cattle snorted the straightminded farmer  presently they came in sight of hope seminary and mr sanderson drove around to a side door to interview the housekeeper  sam walked around to the front and rang the doorbell and a maid answered his summons  i would like to see miss grace laning he said  or if she isnt in her sister miss nellie  yes sir and the girl ushered the young collegian into the reception room  a few minutes later grace appeared  she looked at sam in surprise  why i thought you wrote youd come next tuesday she cried  so i did grace  but this time ive come about tom  have you seen him  tom  no  did he come here  i thought he might have come  mr sanderson saw him on the road headed in this direction  oh sam you look soso alarmed  what is it  what do you think has happened  i dont know what has happened grace  but something is wrong i feel sure of it answered sam with conviction  tom is missing and i cant imagine what has become of him     chapter xi  what the girls knew  after that sam related the particulars of what had occurred to which grace listened closely  as she did this tears streamed down the cheeks of the girl  this will break nellies heartif it isnt broken already she faltered  you know i wrote that i had something to tell you sam  it was about nellie  but i cant tell you herelet us take a walk  all right  but i cant stay longi must go back with mr sanderson and continue this hunt for tom  to be surei wont keep you but a few minutes  grace led the way outside and down one of the campus walks  you remember that time we came back from the auto ride she said  of course  well when nellie and i got to our room she threw herself on the bed and cried as if her heart was breaking  i couldnt do anything with her  i wanted to find out what it was all about but at first she wouldnt tell me a word  then she said it was tomthat he had acted so queerly when they took a walk in the park he had scared her  what did he do  oh he talked so queer  he told nellie tie wished he had the dartaway back so that they could go on a honeymoon trip to the moon and then he laughed and asked her if she would go on a camelback ride with him through the sahara desert  and then he said he didnt want to get married until he could lay a big nugget of gold at her feetand a lot of nonsense like that  she was awfully scared at first but after a while he got more rational and then she felt a little better  but she couldnt get it off her mind and it made her feel dreadful  and then the other day tom sent her the queerest letter full of all sorts of the wildest kind of nonsenseabout going to the north pole and bringing the pole back with him and about sending her a pair of slippers to wear in place of gloves and asking her to send him a red and blue handkerchief to keep his head from aching  and he wrote that he didnt think he was cut out for college that he would rather shovel nuggets in a gold minethat is just what he wroteshovel nuggets in a gold mine  oh such a mixedup letter you never read  and it made nellie cry again  oh sam what does it mean  he shook his head and gave a deep sigh  i dont know grace  it scares me almost as much as it has nellie maybe tom ought to be put in a sanitarium  oh do you think he is really out of his mind  it almost looks that way  poor tom and he was always so bright and full of fun  but what canoh sam here is nellie now cried grace as her sister appeared and ran towards them  oh sam i just met mr sanderson and he said you were looking for tom cried nellie as she came closer  thats true nellie  he hasnt been hereat least i havent seen him  so grace just told me sam tried to look at the girl in front of him but had to turn his gaze away  he knew only too well how much nellie thought of his brother  did hehe run away burst out nellie  i dont know about that nellie said sam and told his story over again just as he had related it to her sister  nellie burst into tears and sam and grace did their best to comfort her  graces own eyes were moist and sam had all he could do to keep from breaking down likewise  oh he is gone i am sure of it cried nellie  he is not himself at all  for all we know he may have thrown himself into the river  oh what shall we do  what can we do and she wrung her hands  dont take it so hard nellie it may not be so bad after all said her sister soothingly  tom may be back to brill by this time  for several minutes the matter was talked over  then mr sanderson appeared ready to return to ashton for his daughter  ill help you hunt for tom said the bluff farmer  i know he must be somewhere around  dont you worry so for he could see that nellie had been crying  send word at once when you do find him begged nellie as the buggy drove away and sam promised  on the way back to town but little was said  near brill they met quite a few students and the youngest rover asked them if they had seen his brother  all replied in the negative  when ashton was reached it was dark and they drove around to the hotel  songbird and minnie had been dining and the student asked mr sanderson and sam to have something  no i dont care to eat just now said sam  ill take another look around and he left the sandersons and songbird together  but sams walk around the town was productive of no results  he called again on the two doctors only to be told that tom had not shown himself at either place  at the depot nobody seemed to remember seeing him  the youth visited several stores where tom was known but none of the clerks had seen the missing one  i suppose all i can do is to return to brill and wait said sam on rejoining those at the hotel  i might send out a general alarm but id hate to do that and then have tom walk in as if nothing unusual had happened  and it would be just like him to do it returned songbird  it was nearly ten oclock when sam and his chum returned to the college  tom had not yet shown himself nor had he sent in any word his books and his clothing were exactly as he had left them  well he didnt take anything with him was sams comment as several of his chums came in to sympathize with him  that looks as if he hadnt meant to go far  oh hell be back dont worry said spud optimistically  all did their best to cheer poor sam up but this did little good  sam was much worried and his face showed it  i dont know what to do he said  i certainly dont feel like going to bed  one of the proctors had heard that tom was missing and came to the room to see about it  sam told him all he knew and the proctor said he would immediately report the case to doctor wallington  you know he cant stay out as late as this without permission observed the proctor  permission or no permission i wish he was here answered sam  he is sick and i am very much worried about him  and then the proctor left  an hour dragged by and the other students went to bed  sam sat up in an easy chair trying to doze but starting up at every sound  he tried to figure out what would be best for him to do but could reach no satisfactory conclusion  he looked out of the window  the moon was setting and soon all became dark  a wagon rattled by on the roadway beyond the campus and the clock in the college tower tolled out the hour of midnight  this is simply awful murmured sam as he walked back to the easy chair and dropped down  i wonder if i hadnt better send a message to dick  but i cant do it until seven oclockthe telegraph office is closed  at last sam became so worn out that he could keep his eyes open no longer  he flung himself on his bed dressed as he was and fell into a fitful doze  and thus the hours went by until the sun shone over the hills in the east  did he come in  it was a question put by songbird as he came to the door  no  say sam this is strange  what are you going to do  i dont knowtelegraph to dick and send out a general alarm i guess  you dont think he simply ran away do you  what without telling me  you know better than that songbird  then he must have wandered off while he was out of his mind  maybe hes somewhere in the woods around here  maybe  i only hope he isnt hurt  well if i can do anything let me know answered songbird and stepped back into his room to dress  as soon as possible sam went to doctor wallington and talked the matter over with the head of brill  the worthy doctor knew about the case already and was all sympathy  we had better send out a general alarm he said  and you can notify your folks  it was a mistake to let your brother come back here so soon after being hurt  you can take one of the carriages and drive down to ashton at once if you wish and also drive around to some of the other places in this vicinity  somebody must have seen your brother after he left here or after mr sanderson saw him  would you mind if i take john powell with me asked sam  i may need somebody to help me  very well rover he can go if he wishes  to be sure ill go said songbird when told of this  and well find tom see if we dont he added by way of cheering sam  sam waited until nine oclock to see if tom would show himself and then he and songbird drove over the ashton  a search lasting the best part of an hour followed but nothing new was learned  then rather reluctantlyfor he knew that dick was having trouble enough attending to their fathers affairshe sent a telegram to his big brother telling of toms disappearance and adding that he would telegraph again if anything new turned up  in driving over to hope seminary mr sanderson had pointed out to sam the spot where he had seenor thought he had seentom  sam now determined to visit that spot and see if from that point he could not get on the trail of his brother  the place was near a turn of the road and just beyond was another road at the forks stood an old stone house wherein lived an old basketmaker named rater  the girls of hope often bought baskets from the man just to help him along  sam and songbird found rater sitting on a side porch of his home with his basketmaking materials scattered around him  he was a tall thin man somewhat deaf but with a pair of sharp eyes  come to buy a basket he asked briskly  no i came for a little information if you can give it mr rater replied sam  what do you want to know  were you here yesterday  i sure wasall day long  did you see anything of my brother went on sam  he is a little larger than i am and here is his picture and the youngest rover produced a photograph he had brought along  the old basketmaker looked at the photograph carefully  why yes i see that feller he said slowly  he stopped at my gate fer a minute or two  he acted sort o strange  in what way  he didnt speak to me he spoke to hisself  said something about a basketful o nuggets  i asked him if he wanted to buy a basket but he only shook his head an said somethin about wantin to git the nuggets o gold first  then all of a sudden like he ran away  and which way did he go asked sam with interest  up the hoopville road and the old basketmaker pointed to the side road which ran past his home  did he have any baggage with him questioned songbird  nary a thing  thank you for the information said sam and passed over a quarter which rater pocketed with a broad smile  ready money was scarce with him  well drive to hoopville said sam a minute later as he and songbird got in the buggy  and well ask about tom on the way  a quarter of a mile was passed and they came to a lonely spot on the highway  here the only building in sight was a half tumbled down cottage belonging to a man named hiram duff  duff pretended to be poor but common report had it that he was a miser and fairly well to do  going to stop here questioned songbird as they drove near  we might as well returned sam  old duff is a tough customer but in this case  he did not finish for at that instant a muffled cry came from the old cottage startling both boys     chapter xii  at hiram duffs cottage  what can that be  must be somebody in trouble  maybe it is old duff  let us go and see  with these hasty exclamations both boys leaped from the carriage they occupied and ran towards the delapidated cottage  the cries continued coming from somewhere in the interior  waitwell look in the window first suggested sam  maybe old duff is having a quarrel with one of his neighbors and if so it might not be wise to interfere  there was a window with small panes of glass close at hand and going to this the two youths peered into the cottage  to their surprise they could see nobody  both lower rooms of the old building seemed to be unoccupied  lets go around to the rear  maybe the sounds come from there suggested songbird  there was a path full of weeds leading to a rear porch that was almost ready to fall down  the back door stood partly open  nobody was in sight  the call comes from somewhere inside said sam  come on in  but be on your guard songbird  we dont want to get into trouble  both lads crossed the rickety porch and entered what was the kitchen of the cottage  a musty odor pervaded the building for old duff usually kept everything tightly closed  the place was in disorder a chair being overturned and several cooking utensils littering the floor  on the stove which was cold lay a big carving knife  what do you want  where are you called out sam  oh help me  get me out of here came the somewhat faint reply  i am in the cellar  in the cellar repeated songbird  are you mr duff  yes  help me out please  both boys looked around for a stairs but there was none  then to one side of the kitchen floor they saw a trap door  it was shut down and bolted by means of a plug stuck through two staples  it was an easy matter to kick the plug away and raise the trap door the boys peered down into the opening below and saw hiram duff sitting on the lower step of the stairs  he looked holloweyed and almost exhausted  whats the matter mr duff  how did you get shut up this way asked sam kindly  oh my  oh my sighed the old miser  cacant you help me up the stairs  i am soso weak i cant hardly walk  where is the rascal who shut me up this way  ill have the police on him  did somebody shut you up in this cellar asked sam as he and songbird crawled below to give the old man assistance  they saw that the cellar was merely a big hole in the ground and the stairs were very steep and not particularly safe  yes somebody got me to come down here and then locked that trap door on me grumbled the miser  he got up with difficulty and crawled slowly to the kitchen the boys coming after him to see that he did not fall back  oh dear what a time i have had of it he whined  when was this asked songbird  i dont knowthat is i cant tell how long it was until i know what time it is now  it is halfpast ten answered sam consulting his watch  what  do you mean halfpast ten in the morning burst out hiram duff  if thats true then ive been down cellar all nightever since yesterday afternoon  no wonder i was hungry and thirsty  ive got to have something to eat and drink soon or ill starve to death  and he walked to the kitchen cupboard and got out some bread and meat  there was water in a pail on the bench and he took a long drink of this  who was it locked you in the cellar asked sam  who be you boys asked the miser in return  we belong to brill college  we were driving past and we heard you yell answered songbird  yes i thought i heard a carriage on the road so i called as loud as i could  i did that ever since that fellow went away but i guess nobody heard meleastwise they didnt pay no attention  will you tell us how it all happened asked sam and then he added aside to songbird  dont say anything about tom  and the wouldbe poet of brill nodded to show he understood  it was this way answered hiram duff dropping down on the chair sam fixed for him  i was sitting on the back porch mending my coat when all of a sudden a fellow came around the corner of the house  he was a strange looking young fellow and he wore a funny looking cap pulled away down over his eyes  he asked me if i wasnt hackler  i said i wasnt that my name was hiram duff  then he says i knew it i knew it  at last and sits down on the porch  i says at last what and he says something about a nugget of gold  he acted awful mysterious like and finally he asks me if id like to own half of a big nugget of gold  i told him i certainly would  and then asked sam as the old miser paused to take a bite of bread and meat  then he told a queer story about a nugget of gold brought down to this place from alaska  he was very mysterious and at last he said the nugget was right down in my cellar and if id dig it up fer him hed give me half  at first i thought he was fooling or wasnt just right in his mind but a nugget of goldeven a little oneisnt to be sneezed at and it wouldnt cost me nuthing to go down cellar and look so i starts to go down the stairs when he says to be careful that he would look around to make sure nobuddy was aspying on him  he said the nugget was in the northwest corner  i went down and the next thing i knew i heard a strange cry upstairs  you shant rob me  the nugget is mine yells that fellow and bang goes that trap door and then he up and bolts it fast so i couldnt open it  i calls to let me out and he calls back for me to keep quiet until he got some friends so i couldnt rob him of that nugget  then he slammed around upstairs here something awful  at last he went away and thats the last i seen or heard of him  what did you do  didnt you try to get out questioned songbird  for a long time i waited thinking he would come back  and as he seemed so sure about the nugget i took the lantern and looked for it but there wasnt no signs of any gold  then the lantern got dry and went out leaving me in the dark  i didnt know what to make of it  i went up the stairs and tried to open the door but i couldnt budge it then i tried to dig my way out of the hole but the old shovel i had broke and there i was  im an old man and pretty full of rheumatism and staying down cellar all night has most finished me concluded hiram duff with a groan  did the fellow say where he was going asked sam after a pause  said he was going to get help thats all so i couldnt rob him of that nugget  i dont know what to make of it  might be he was a lunatic eh went on the old miser suddenly  maybe he run away from some asylum  possibly answered sam shortly  did he take anything do you suppose he went on  take anything  you mean steal anything cried hiram duff and started back  the sandwich he had made for himself dropped from his hand  ii wonder if he did take anything he muttered and his eyes roved towards the other room of the cottage  better take a look around if you had anything of value said sam and gave songbird a meaning look  with feeble steps the old miser walked out of the kitchen into what had been the sitting room of the cottage  as he was too feeble to sleep upstairs hiram duff now used the apartment for a bedroom as well  he closed the door between the two rooms and the boys heard him rummaging around among his possessions  then came a wild cry  its gone  its gone  my tin box is gone  your tin box repeated songbird as the old man threw open the door  yes yes  the fellow has robbed me  oh this is dreadful  what shall i do  i am a poor man  oh ill have to go to the poorhouse and the miser commenced to wring his hands  what did you have in the box questioned sam  i hadsomeersome money and someerjewelry faltered hiram duff  he was a very secretive man naturally and it galled him to make the admission  how much money mr duff  oh aerquite some  oh this is too bad  what shall i do  this will ruin me  oh where is that rascal  how can i catch him and the old man ran around the kitchen staring at one thing and another and at the boys  this must be toms work whispered sam to songbird  i wonder what i had best do about it  wait until you are sure it was tom advised the wouldbe poet  sam commenced to question the old miser regarding the looks of the fellow who had visited him  he soon became convinced that it must have been tom  clearly his brother must now be completely out of his mind  poor poor tom he sighed  if he is going to act this way what will he do next  i wish i could find him and that dick was here to help me to take care of him and clear up this mess  i dont know what im agoing to do whined hiram duff  i gotter find that box  how big a box was it questioned sam  twasnt so very biga fellow could put it in his pocket  but it had goldi mean moneyin it and my dead wifes jewelry  how much money mr duff  what business is that of yours demanded the miser suspiciously  why i thinkmaybe i can help you get it back stammered sam  he grew red in the face  to tell the plain truth i think i know who that fellow was  who  tell me what you lost first  well if you must know that box had three hundred dollars in gold in it besides the jewelry  that my wife got from her folks when they died and they said it was wuth over a hundred dollars  is that all  aint that enough  land sakes  i aint no millionaire  that gold was agoing to keep me from the poorhouse  and hiram duff shook his head dolefully  he did not tell the young collegiates that he had an even ten thousand dollars in the banks  he had saved money all his life denying himself and his wife almost the necessities of life  do you suppose anybody else could have come in and taken the box said songbird  what do you mean  i mean did anybody come in after that fellow left  how should i knowi was down cellar  did you hear anybody  i heard something  maybe it was somebody or maybe it was my sheep they come up to the house sometimes  i see  but what do you know about this demanded hiram duff turning to sam you said you might help me to git the money back  ill tell you said sam and related how his brother had disappeared and how the blow on the head seemed to have affected him  thats it  thats him  thats the man cried the old miser  he did it  you catch him and git my money back he went on excitedly  ill certainly do my best to find him mr duff answered sam  and if he really took your box you shall have what you lost back  is he crazy do you think  he wouldnt do such a thing if he was in his right mind  tom rover is as honest as the day is long declared songbird  if he really took your box he didnt know what he was doing  well he certainly did act queer agreed hiram duff  but that aint here nor there  i want my box back with all thats in it and im going to have it  i guess i had better go to town and tell the police about this     chapter xiii  the western express  the old miser was very much excited and began to pace the floor of his cottage  yes i better tell the police thats what i better do he muttered  there wont be any necessity to tell the policeif it was really my brother who did it said sam  why not id like to know challenged hiram duff  he aint no bettern other folks  if he took the box i and my family will see to it that you are repaid for your loss mr duff answered the youngest rover  humph  do you guarantee that demanded the old miser suspiciously  yes  and you can take his word for it sir added songbird  the rovers are wellknown and wealthy and they will do exactly as they promise  ive heard that name before  didnt you have some trouble with the railroad company asked hiram duff  about a bustedup flying machine  yes replied sam  and got the best of that skinflint lawyer belright fogg  we made mr fogg pay for the biplane yes  i know all about it chuckled hiram duff  served fogg right  and he lost his job with the railroad company too  the old man pursed up his lips  well if youll give me your word that you will settle with me i wont go to the police  but i want every cent that is coming to me understand that  youll get itif my brother took the box answered sam  but listen to me  first of all i want to find my brother  i think he ought to be under a doctors care  he ought to be in an asylum responded hiram duff bluntly  its dangerous to allow sech a feller at large  maybe  we are going on a hunt for him right now answered sam ill come back here or you can come to see me at brill  and dont worry mr duffyoull not lose a cent added the youth earnestly  luckily hiram duff had heard all about the trouble the rovers had had with the railroad lawyer and had at the time also heard that sams family were wealthy and of high standing  this being so he took matters far more calmly than would otherwise have been the case  but he wanted something in writing and sam quickly wrote out a statement and signed it  now we must get after my brother said the youth  although you say you have no idea where he went  no i aint got the least idee  let us drive on towards hoopville suggested songbird  we can make inquiries along the way  in a few minutes more the pair were on the way hiram duff gazing after them anxiously  dont forget to let me hear from you he called out  songbird this is terrible murmured sam as they drove on  i wish dick was here to advise me  hell come as quickly as he can dont worry about that sam  i only hope we catch tom before he gets too far away  about a mile was covered along the road leading to hoopville a small village the single industry of which was the making of barrel hoops then they came to another farmhouse where they saw a boy of fifteen sitting on a horseblock whittling a stick  hello there called out sam  say im looking for a young fellow that passed here yesterday  did you see anything of him  here is his picture  sure i saw him answered the boy after a glance at the photograph i drove him over to mortons junction  drove him over to mortons junction repeated sam  when  yesterday afternoon  but we didnt git to the junction till seven oclock  where did you go to  what do you want to know for asked the boy curiously  he is my brother and i want to find him just as quickly as i can  oh  well he wanted to catch a train  he just got it too  what train  the western express  he wouldnt have got it only it was about ten minutes late  he got aboard just as she started out from the depot  sams heart sank at this news  tom on the western express  for what place had he been bound  did he say where he was going put in songbird  to chicago i think  he talked to himself a good deal  said something about chicago and st paul and seattle  i asked him if he was on business and he said he was going to pick up nuggets of gold  i guess he was poking fun at me went on the boy sheepishly  but he paid me two dollars for driving him over he added with satisfaction  did he have much money asked sam  tell me all you know  i might as well tell tell you that was my brother and he is sick in his head so that he doesnt know just what he is doing  say i thought he was queerhe had such a look out of his eyes and talked so much to himself  he only had about ten dollars in bills but he said he had some gold in his pocket in a box  he didnt show it though  he said he was on bill stigers trail  bill stigers trail murmured sam and his mind went back to the night tom had gone to see the moving picture drama entitled lost in the ice fields of alaska  bill stiger had been the name of the villain in the playthe rascal who had robbed the hero of his golden nuggets  he didnt have no ticket went on the boy  so he could get off the train anywhere  we must hurry to mortons junction and see if we can find out anything more said sam to his college chum  his face showed plainly how greatly he was worried  the boy told them how to go and they made the best time possible arriving at the junction some time after noon  they found the depot master on the platform  i remember the fellow you mean he said  he got on the last car dunkirt the conductor helped him up  but i dont know where he went to  maybe dunkirt could tell you when he gets back here  when will he be back  hes off today and hell be here on the onethirty train  you can talk to him when he comes in if you want to  ill do it answered sam  he and songbird had an even hour to wait and the latter suggested that they go to the junction hotel for dinner  might as well eat sam he said kindly it wont help matters any to go hungry  i dont care much about eating songbird was the answer  but ill go along and take a bite  i wish i knew just where tom had gone  i might telegraph ahead for him  well let us hope that conductor can tell you something  with nothing to do but to wait the boys took their time over the midday meal and while doing this they had the team fed  then they sauntered down to the depot to await the arrival of the man they wanted to interview  presently the train came in and the depot master pointed out the conductor  excuse me but are you mr dunkirt asked sam  thats my handle was the prompt reply  i am looking for the young man who jumped on your train just as it was leaving here yesterday  ha  i thought somebody might be after that fellow exclaimed the conductor quickly  in a few words sam explained as much of the situation as seemed necessary the conductor listening with interest  he nodded his head several times  i thought he was a little bit off in his upper story he said  he talked rather wildly of going far away to get gold nuggets  he paid his fare to chicago and thats as far as i carried him  what did he pay with asked sam  he gave me a tendollar gold piece  he had quite a lot of gold with him  did he say where he was going from chicago  oh yes he had it all mapped out  he was going to st paul first and then straight west to seattle  from there he was going to alaska  alaska cried sam and songbird in a breath  that is what he said  what part of alaska asked sam faintly  he didnt tell me and i didnt ask him  i rather thought he was kidding me he acted so queerlike when he talked  after this the conductor told all he could remember about tom  he said that the youth had left the train at chicago in a large crowd and that was the last he had seen of the youth  ill send another telegram to dick said sam to his chum  why not telephone to ashton first suggested the other  there may be a telegram for you there  ill do it said sam and got the station master at ashton on the wire as soon as possible  yes a telegram came in for you an hour ago was the answer over the telephone wire  i sent it up to brill  will you have the operator read it to me asked the youth  sure  hold the wire a minute  another connection was apparently made and sam heard a different voice  is this samuel rover  yes  want that message from richard rover  if you please  he says he is coming up to ashton on the train that gets here at elevenfifteen tonight  is that all  yes  very well  thank you and sam hung up the receiver  whats the news sam questioned songbird and when told he looked relieved  dick will know what to do  i know what i am going to do songbird  i am going right back to brill and get ready to follow tom  i supposed youd do that  id like to go with you  i know it  but that wont be necessaryif dick goes with me  sam drew a deep breath  ii guess id better stop at hope on the way back and let the girls know how matters stand he added soberly  i can go up tomorrow and tell them sam  no  id rather tell them myself answered the youngest rover  he knew exactly how nellie and grace would feel when he broke the news to them  it was a very sober and thoughtful pair of boys that got in the carriage and started back to brill by the way of hope seminary  sam was laying his plans how to follow tom in his wild trip west and songbird was wondering how he could be of assistance to the rovers several times the wouldbe poet started to quote some original verse but each time cut himself short  presently they came in sight of hope just as the girls were coming from their afternoon classes  they espied nellie and grace and beckoned to them  both came forward on a run  what is the news sam asked nellie quickly  its not very good nellie he said kindly  tom has run away  run away gasped the girl and turned pale  oh you dont mean it  where did he go to questioned grace  to chicago  and from there so he told a train conductor he was going to seattle and then to alaska said songbird  sam and dick are going after him just as soon as they can  to alaska  tom has gone to alaska murmured nellie and then she turned and swayed and the next moment fainted in sams arms     chapter xiv  dick and sam in chicago  get some water songbird quick  oh sam shall i get some smelling salts cried grace  i guess the water will do grace  here stand on this side so those other girls cant see nellie went on the boy  no use of letting them know everything  grace understood and she and sam shielded nellie and carried her to a campus bench  then songbird arrived with a cup of water from a well just as he handed it over nellie opened her eyes  oh  iiwhat happened she murmured  oh i remember now  and a look of pain crossed her face  take a drink of water dear said her sister and held the cup nellie took a sip and then grace bathed her forehead with some water poured on a handkerchief that sam passed over  soon the girl sat up straight  iim all right now she faltered  itit was such aa shock oh sam do you really think tom is bound for alaska  it looks like it nellie he answered  ill tell you all about it if youll walk down the road away from those other students  and then as they walked away slowly sam and songbird told their story the two girls hanging on their every word  its awful terrible murmured grace  poor tom he must be clear out of his mind  thats the only explanation answered sam  hed never do such a thing if he was in his right senses  oh but he may lose his mind entirely gasped nellie  ive read of such cases in the newspapers  a person wanders off and forgets who he is or where he came from and all that  supposing tom went to alaska and that happened to him  why we might never be able to find him and the tears began to course down nellies cheeks  well find him answered sam sturdily  why weve got to do it  but alaska is so big sam  and think of going out to those mining camps and out in that snow and ice  oh i cant stand it  and nellies tears started afresh  well have to catch him before he has a chance to leave st paul or seattle returned the youth  i think they had better telegraph ahead and set somebody on the watch said songbird  it will cost money to send a description of tom but it may pay to do it  yes yes  do that sam  anything to find tom pleaded nellie  well do what we can nellie you can be sure of that was the reply  the boys remained with the girls a short time longer and then took their departure  take care of yourself sam said grace on parting  if you go west dont get into any trouble  i wont get into any more trouble than i can help he replied  but we are bound to find tom and bring him back  it was dark when the boys got back to brill and while songbird prepared to go to supper sam hurried to the office of the head of the institution  he found doctor wallington pouring over some teachers reports  he listened with a troubled face to what sam had to tell and shook his head slowly  too bad rover and i sympathize with you and your family from the bottom of my heart  clearly that blow on the head has put your brother completely out of his mind  i am glad that richard is coming to ashton to aid you  what you had better do next is a problem  i think well send word west about tom and then try to follow him answered sam  that is why i came hereto notify you that id have to leave  i shall be sorry to lose you samuel  let us hope that youll be able to come back in a few daysand that thomass case will not prove as bad as we think  i agree that it is best for you to move at once for there is no telling what your missing brother may do  can i aid in any way  you may cash a check for mei may need some ready moneyif dick doesnt happen to have enough with him  ill do that with pleasure  anything else  i want to go to ashton late this evening to meet dick  ill take a suitcase with me  one of the men can drive you down  will your brother come here  possibly  but both of us may stay in ashton to take the one oclock train for chicago  it stops on signal you know  yes  very well  anything else  no sir answered sam and then he wrote out the check and got his money  a little later after a hasty supper he started to pack his suitcase with such things as he thought he might need for the trip to chicago  he was in the midst of his labors when songbird came in followed by spud stanley max and several others  all wanted to assist him yet they could do little  each was deeply sympathetic  its too bad sam said spud  i hope you catch tom before he has a chance to leave chicago  why when a chap gets out of his mind there is no telling what hell do or where hell go  oxactly so came from max  i knowed a man vonce dot goes his mind owid  he took an axe andveil neffer mind dom tont do nuddings like dot anyvay added the germanamerican student hastily after a warning look from songbird  i think that moving picture must have hit tom hard said stanley it was so lifelike  he talked about it a great deal  yes he couldnt forget it  he even talked about it in his sleep returned sam  he wanted to go out and get those nuggets of gold  well id like some nuggets myself cried spud  but i am not going to the ice fields of alaska for em he added grimly and this caused a faint smile to spread on some of the boys faces  songbird had received permission to accompany sam to ashton and at nine oclock the youths were on the way in a carriage driven by one of the college drivers  they went directly to the depot there to await the arrival of the train that was to bring dick  it was a cold disagreeable evening with a promise of rain in the air the boys were glad enough to go into the station which was kept open for the coming of the late train  can a fellow get on that one oclock chicago train from here asked sam of the ticket man  yes if hes got a ticket was the reply  ill have to signal it to stop though  well ill let you know about it as soon as i see my brother  he is coming in on the eleventhirty  it had begun to rain by the time the lastnamed train rolled in  only three passengers got off but one of them was dick  he had a suitcase with him and he fairly ran to meet sam and songbird  any more news he demanded  sam related the particulars of what had occurred  in the meantime the train had gone on and the station was deserted by all but the ticket man  going to lock up now he said to the boys who had gathered in the station out of the rain  wait just one minute please pleaded sam  here go out and get some cigars for yourself added dick and passed over a quarter  thanks i will returned the ticket man and walked off to an allnight resort not far from the station  i dont see anything to do but to follow tom to chicago said dick we might send a telegram to the authorities but i cant see how it would do any good  they dont know him and in a big city like that it is hard enough to find a fellow when he is wellknown  if we take that one oclock train well be in chicago by morning and id rather look around myself than trust the police to do it  all right i came prepared for the trip answered sam and pointed to his suitcase  when the station man came back they purchased two tickets for chicago and the man set out his lantern to signal the express  then songbird said goodbye wishing them all kinds of good luck and rode back to brill  sam this is simply terrible observed the big brother as he paced the depot platform the station master having gone away  i never thought such a thing as this would come to tom  neither did i dick  nellie is all broke up over it too  naturally  did you send word home  i didnt  no i didnt want to worry the folks until the last minute  but dora knows and so does mrs stanhope  what about dads business dick  can you get away from it  i cant get away any too easily sam  things are in a fearful snarl but i telephoned to mr powell the lawyer to look after matters during my absence  i think weve got those brokers under our thumbat least i hope so  but if we havent we stand to lose a bunch of money  how much  twenty or thirty thousand dollars  thats too bad  if you think you ought to go back i might look for tom alone  dont you dare to mention such a thing sam  i think more of tom than i do of twice that amount of moneyand so do you and the rest of the family  our whole duty is to find tom and do it too before he gets into more mischief or gets hurt concluded the oldest rover  promptly on time the night express bound west came along  it seldom stopped at brill and the conductor gazed curiously at the two youths as they got aboard  then the lantern was extinguished and set aside and the heavy train rolled on  fortunately travel was light that night so the lads had no trouble in getting a section of a sleeper from the pullman porter  they had only the lower berth made up and on that laid down to talk matters over and get some sleep  yes it must have been that moving picture that set tom off said dick during the course of the conversation  and that gives us something like a clue to work on  the main scenes took place in alaska and he may be just topsyturvy enough in his mind to want to find those places  talking about golden nuggets and about being on the trail of bill stiger looks like it anyway  i think so myself dick  but his mind may change and he may go to mexico or europe and sam sighed deeply  neither of the boys slept much and both were up almost as early as anybody on the train  more to pass the time than because they felt hungry they went into the dining car for breakfast  at last the train rolled into the suburbs of the great city of the lakes and finally came to a stop at the big depot  the youths took up their suitcases and filed out with the other passengers  have you any idea where we ought to look first asked sam  i think we may as well leave our bags on check at this depot and look around here was the answer  tom started from here and maybe well be lucky enough to meet somebody who saw and remembered him  having checked the suitcases the rovers started in earnest asking the men at the news stand and in the smoking room and at the lunch counter and restaurant  then they questioned the taxicab drivers and even some of the newsboys and bootblacks  it looks almost hopeless said sam at last  not yet returned dick  we havent struck the most important people yet  funny we didnt think of them first  whom do you mean  the ticket sellers  let me have that photo of tom and well see if any of them remember him  from one ticket window they went to another until they reached an elderly man who gazed at the photograph with interest  yes i remember that young man he said slowly  he was here yesterday afternoon  did he buy a railroad ticket  he did  where to  seattle  can you remember on what train asked sam  sure  i had to hurry for him for he took the fourten train by way of st paul was the reply     chapter xv  bound west  well sam we have done all we can do for the present  thats right dick  whether it will do any good or not remains to be seen and dick gave a longdrawn sigh and leaned back in the sleeping car seat he occupied  it was about three hours later and in that time the rover boys had been very busy  following the announcement of the ticket seller that tom had taken a train for seattle by way of st paul the rovers had sent a telegram to the conductor of the train asking him to look out for tom and have him detained  they had procured accommodations on the train they were now on and had so notified the railroad official so he would know where to address them provided the missing one was found  they had also sent a telegram to the folks at home and another to the girls at hope  perhaps well get word when we reach st paul said sam  for all we know tom may be there awaiting our arrival  i sincerely hope so sam  im sure i dont want to go away out to the pacific coast for him  its too bad tom didnt buy one of those railroad tickets that a fellow has to sign observed sam  if he had done that it would be easy to find him  thats true  the train they were on was an express making but few stops and would reach st paul late in the evening  it was only about threequarters filled so the rovers had had no difficulty in getting a section of a sleeper  whether they would go further than st paul was however as yet a problem  next stop milwaukee was the cry and soon the train rolled into that city  anxiously the two brothers looked out and saw one of the trainmen take several telegrams from a man on the platform  after the train had started again the trainman came through the train  telegrams for miss baker mr josephs and mr rover he called out  here you are cried sam eagerly  rover  and the telegram was passed over  hastily the envelope was torn open and the contents scanned  the boys looked at each other blankly  the telegram read as follows   no young man answering to name tom rover on this train  will watch passengers closely as instructed  folsom conductor   what do you make of this dick  maybe tom didnt use that ticket after he bought it gasped sam  but that ticket seller saw him rush for the gate  he must have gone on the train sam  he probably didnt answer to his name because if he is out of his mind he has forgotten what his real name is  and so long as he keeps quiet the trainmen wont suspect anything wrong with him  perhaps well get another telegram at st paul  i hope so  on and on rolled the train through the afternoon coming presently to the shore of the upper mississippi with its wide stretches of marshland and its dead trees  it was not an inviting scene and the two rovers were glad enough when the time came to turn from it and go to the diner for dinner  there was to be a stop of ten minutes at st paul and in that time the boys must make up their minds whether they were going to continue on that train or not  if they laid over several more hours of precious time would be lost  it was well towards midnight when the train reached st paul and a number of sleepy passengers got off and others got on  dick and sam waited impatiently for a messenger to appear  the telegram was there sure enough and this time it carried more interesting information   queeracting young man found but says his name is paul haverlock says he is bound for alaska  wire positive instructions as i can take no risks  folsom conductor   it must be tom cried sam  but that name paul haverlock mused dick  where did he get that  why i remember dick  in that moving picture the hero was called paul haverlock  his name was on the letters they showed on the screen tom must have remembered it just as he remembered the name of the villain bill stiger  i see  then this paul haverlock must really be tom returned dick now to have him stopped  i wonder where that other train is now  they found out that the other train was then in the vicinity of livingston the junction point for yellowstone park  from there it was bound for helena spokane and then to seattle direct  well telegraph again and keep right on this train said dick and this was done  if the two youths had slept but little the night before they were even more restless this night  and yet they realized that folsom the conductor of the other train would not be likely to arouse tom if he had gone to bed  he wont take the chance said dick  remember he isnt sure of what he is doing and all railroad men like to keep out of trouble  if he made a mistake the passenger might sue the railroad company for big damages and get them  if only we could catch up to tom sighed sam  that is impossible sam because he is on an express just as we are as it is hell gain on us when he gets to spokane for he will go through without waiting while well either have to lay over or go by some other route that is much longer  as there seemed nothing more to do just then they at last went to sleep and did not rouse up again until it was broad daylight  they immediately asked for further news but were informed that none had come in  nor did any word come in all that forenoon  this suspense is fierce was dicks remark at last  that conductor is either asleep or has given up the search  i wish i knew of some firstclass detective on the other end of the line who could take up the case for us  wed know somebody if tom was bound for san francisco returned his brother  but i dont know a soul in seattleoh yes i do he suddenly shouted  who sam  a fellow named jim hendricks  he is a cousin of stanley browne and also a cousin to larry colby who went to putnam hall with us  he was at brill once for a week and i got pretty well acquainted with him  why yes i remember him  he and i used to talk about what larry and i did at putnam hall  but is he in seattle now and have you his address  i think i have his address  wait ill look end sam pulled a little notebook out of his pocket  he asked me to write to him some time but i never did more than mail him a postal  yes here is the address  do you think he would help us if he was home  sure i do  he got acquainted with tom and he knew what chums tom and larry were at the hall  then we might telegraph him  it wont do any harm anyway  a rather long telegram was prepared and sent from the next station at which the train stopped  there the youths hoped for another message from folsom the conductor but none came  slowly the hours dragged by the express thundering along in the meanwhile on its journey westward  they stopped at livingston and there many passengers got off bound for a trip through that great natural wonderland yellowstone park  at helena they heard from folsom again  this time the message was one full of mystery   cannot find paul haverlock anywhere  so far as known he did not leave train at any station  we are very much crowded account special excursion and break down of number 126  attached two extra cars  he may be hiding among new passengers  i can do no more   i think i can explain this said the conductor of the train when dick showed him the telegram  number 126 the train just ahead of number 182 the one your brother is on broke down  now the second train is carrying two cars of the other train and most likely all of the other trains passengers  so folsom is having his hands full with his extra duties  in the meantime your brother has disappeared probably in the crowd of extra passengers  if he didnt jump off the train sighed sam  would he do that asked the railroad man  i dont know  a fellow who is out of his mind is liable to do anything  that is true  the train was now in the midst of the rocky mountains but the rovers had no heart to look at the scenery  oh if only we get some sort of encouraging word at spokane sighed sam  we ought to hear from jim hendricks answered dick  that is if he is home and got our message  they knew that the hendricks family were rich and that jim had a great deal of time to himself  at spokane they left the train for they did not want to go down to portland whither it was bound  they asked at the telegraph office for a message and one was handed over to them  this is something like it cried dick as he read it aloud  it ran as follows   my sincere sympathy  i remember tom well and will be on the watch for him  will meet you on your arrival  james v hendricks   well thats one word of encouragement said sam  good for jim  i thought hed help us  if he only got the message in time to catch tom returned his brother  we were rather late in getting it to him remember  well have to hope for the best  while the boys were waiting around spokane for the train to take them to seattle they fell in with a commercial drummer who said he was waiting for a companion with some sample cases  he was a kindlylooking man and during the course of his conversation let slip the news that he had been on the train tom had taken  perhaps you can give us some information cried dick  we are trying to catch a young man who was on that train and he gave a few of the particulars  well well cried the commercial drummer  to be sure i met that fellow  the way i noticed him was because he acted so queer  he didnt want to sit still but kept walking up and down the aisle and from one car to another  i saw the conductor talk to him once or twice too  where did he go questioned sam  well you know the train ahead of ours broke down and we hooked fast to some of the cars  when this was done a lot of new passengers got in our cars and there was something of a mixup  i saw the fellow go into one of the cars from the other train and thats the last i did see of him  and that train went right through to seattle asked dick  yes  that is unless they had more trouble on the line  and by the way did you hear of what happened on the trip from st paul  a lady lost her handbag containing jewelry to the value of ten thousand dollars     chapter xvi  the rover boys in seattle  sam and dick looked at each other in new alarm  they remembered only too well what had occurred at hiram duffs cottage  was it possible that tom had seen the ladys jewels and taken them  in his unbalanced state of mind he was liable to do anything  she had the jewels in her handbag questioned dick  yes a little black affairso she told the conductor  when she discovered that it was gone she was almost crazy  she said some of the jewelry belonged to her mother who was with her  was this in your car  yes up at the other end from where i sat though  and the commercial drummer grinned  oh i had nothing to do with it he added lightly  i didnt suppose you had returned dick  but where was this other fellowthe one i think was my brotherat this time  why he sat up near the other end tooabout two seats from the lady he said the same as did everybody on the car that he hadnt seen the bag or the jewels  the conductor and the porter made a long search but nothing came of it  the lady was wild and said she would get her husband to sue the company for her loss  she had the conductor worried i can tell you  and thats why he lost interest in helping us murmured dick  he certainly had his hands full with that train breakdown and the missing jewels and looking for tom  who sat next to the lady asked sam  her mother a very old woman  and was that young man we mentioned next  yes  couldnt they find any trace of the bag at all  not a thing  it was mighty queer and the woman made it worse by being so excited  she could hardly tell when she had seen the bag last or where  first she said she had had it in her lap and then she said she guessed she had put it on a hook with her coat  what did they do about it  i dont know for i got off here while the lady and her mother went through to seattle answered the drummer  the commercial man could tell but little more of importance to the rovers and presently when his companion came with the sample cases he went away  dick do you think tom took that ladys handbag with the jewels asked sam when the two were by themselves  sam i dont know what to think was the discouraging reply  i only know one thingthe quicker we locate tom and put him in some safe place the better  do youyou think his mind is affected for goodi mean for always  let us hope not  why it would be terrible to have to keep him in an asylum for the rest of his life  it would just about kill father  and think of nellie  it certainly is the worst thing that ever happened muttered sam its worse than our trouble with dan baxter lew flapp or with sobber and those brokers and old crabtree  so it is  when the train for seattle finally came in they got abroad  it was so crowded that they had to take seats in a day coach  but this they did not mind  they would have ridden on a freight train could they have gotten to seattle faster thereby  hour after hour passed slowly  the boys could not settle down to read and they had little appetite for their meals  they caught a little sleep in their seats and were ready to leave the train the moment the conductor called out that they were approaching seattle  i see jim hendricks cried sam as he looked out of a window  is tom with him queried his brother  no he is alone  in a minute more they were out of the train suitcases in hand and shaking hands with the cousin of stanley and larry  jim hendricks usually jolly face showed his deep concern  ive got bad news for you he said  that train tom was on got here before i did and so i didnt have a chance to stop him  ive been making some inquiries though and i am pretty certain he reached this place  one man who was on the train told me he had met a young fellow who said he was bound for alaska to find some nuggets of gold  he wanted to know about the ships that sailed for sitka and juneau and the man told him what he knew  he said the young fellow went off in the direction of the shipping offices  oh dick we must get after him at once cried sam  thats it sam  dick turned to jim hendricks  will you show us where they are  we can go in a taxicab  ive got our auto outsidewe can go in that and you may as well bring your baggage along continued the seattle young man  if you have to remain in town i want you to stay at our house  thanks thats kind of you answered dick  jim led the way outside to where stood a handsome sixcylinder touring car  i dont know when the steamers sail but we can soon find out he said and directed the chauffeur where to go  they were soon passing through the streets of seattle a wellbuilt up city where much business is done  as many of my young readers must know seattle is located on puget sound one of the great natural gateways to the pacific ocean  just south of it is tacoma also a city of importance  the ride to the first of the shipping offices did not take long and going inside dick made some inquiries of the clerk at the desk  dont remember any such man said the clerk  when is your next sailing  day after tomorrow  want to book for the passage  perhaps  i dont know yet  better make up your mind pretty quick  we have only a few berths left went on the clerk  we are looking for a certain young man who was bound for alaska went on dick producing toms photograph  have you seen anything of him  the clerk gave a glance at the photograph and started  well thats strange tie cried  you saw him put in sam eagerly  i sure did  did you want to meet him  very much  well im sorry but i dont see how you are going to do it  his name was let me seehaverlock i believe  thats the name he was traveling under answered dick giving his brother a nudge in the ribs  wasnt his own then and the clerk became interested  no its an assumed name  i might as well tell you the young man isnt all here and dick touched his forehead  i thought that might be ithe acted so queerly  but he got his ticket for the other boat  you see it was this way he came in here just as i was talking to a man who had purchased a ticket for the other boat and wanted to stay in seattle another week  the man wanted me to exchange the ticket or give him his money back  while we were discussing the matter this haverlock or whatever his name is came in  he listened for a minute and then said hed take the ticket and glad of the chance for he said he was in a mighty hurry to get some nuggets of gold  so the man transferred the ticket to him and that was the last i saw of the young fellow  when did that other boat sail asked sam  last night at nine oclock  last night cried dick  then he certainly must have rushed matters  he looked at jim hendricks  what can we do next do you suppose  you might send a wireless to the steamship was the suggestion  if hes under the name of haverlock they ought to be able to hold him where did the steamer sail for jim went on to the clerk  for ketchikan juneau skagway and all the regular ports  she carries a wireless asked sam  certainly  you can send a message from here if you wish  we can telephone it over to the wireless station  lets do it burst out sam  the quicker somebody takes charge of poor tom the better  youre right answered dick  he wiped his forehead with his handkerchief  what a pity we didnt get here sooner or that tom wasnt delayed  then he and sam got a blank and started to write out the wireless message that might put those on board the steamer on the track of tom     chapter xvii  off for alaska  what steamer was that questioned dick and the clerk told him  i suppose we had better address the captain said sam  now the question is what shall we say  well give toms assumed name and a short description of him and ask that he be held for us at one of the ports said dick  i dont know what else to do  i dont think the captain will hold the young man on your sayso said the clerk on being questioned  he would be afraid of getting into trouble with the authorities  you had better get the police to make the request  the trouble is we dont want to make this too public explained dick  wed rather keep it quiet  ill risk the personal message to the captain  ill sign the message with you said jim hendricks  maybe the captain will know our family at least by reputation  who are you if i may ask came from the clerk curiously  i am james hendricks and my father is colonel wilby hendricks  oh yes i guess captain dwight knows of your father  your name will carry weight with him added the clerk for he knew that the colonel was wellknown and was rich  after considerable trouble the message was made out and telephoned at once to the wireless station  this accomplished there was nothing to do but to wait for an answer  when is the next sailing for alaskan ports asked dick  our sailing as i told you before is day after tomorrow  but one of the other lines has a sailing tomorrow at nine p m  they all seem to sail at nine oclock at night mused sam  yes that is the usual hour answered the clerk  well if we have to we can take that boat at nine oclock tomorrow night remarked dick  provided you can get accommodations said the clerk  oh well get aboard somehowif we really have to go  jim hendricks insisted that the rovers ride up to his house with him and away sped the touring car for the most fashionable quarter of seattle  here the hendricks had a beautiful mansion and here the newcomers were cordially greeted by mrs hendricks the colonel being out of the city on business  youve just got to make yourselves at home said jim  it wont do a bit of good to fret so much  you are bound to get hold of poor tom sooner or later and i cant see that this trip to alaska is going to hurt him any  it may do him good  but he may wander away and we may lose all track of him answered sam  ive heard of persons disappearing like that  the hendricks did all in their power to make the rovers feel at home sam and dick were utterly worn out and took a brief rest  after that came an elaborate meal served in the hendricks spacious dining room  the telephone rang several times but they were only local messages of no importance to the rover boys  but then came another message that filled them with interest being from the wireless office  its from captain dwight explained jim who took the message down too bad he murmured  what does he say demanded sam and dick in a breath  he cant find anybody by the name of paul haverlock nor can he find any passenger answering to the description you gave him of tom  he says too many answering your general description which means that he cant pick tom out even if he is on board  tom must have changed his name again said sam  most likely he gives any name that happens to come into his head  but he ought to be on the steamers list of passengers  thats true  i cant understand it  for a long time the rover boys talked the matter over  had tom really gone to alaska  we had better make some inquiries at the dock from which that steamer sailed said dick  maybe well meet somebody who will remember tom  the next morning found them at the dock jim going with them  all sorts of men and boys were interviewed and at last they met a taxicab driver who had carried tom from the railroad station  he recognized the photograph at once  yes i took him from the depot to the shipping office and then carried his handbag to the steamer said the taxicab driver  he was a fine young man he added  maybe he tipped you pretty good ventured dick with a faint smile  he sure didgave me fare and a dollar over  and you are dead sure he got on the steamer insisted sam  i am  he was almost the last passenger on board and i am sure he didnt come ashore again  then he must have gone to alaska said dick  the youths had already learned that the ticket tom had purchased had been for skagway  at that point so the agent had told them a connection could be made for the white pass and yukon route  thats the way tom would goif he wanted to get up to where that moving picture was taken said dick  thats the land of goldand also ice and snow  i guess the best thing we can do dick is to get to juneau and skagway as soon as we can  it would seem so sam  its a pretty long journey  so it is but what else is there to do  we dont want poor tom to become hopelessly lost and in such a faraway country as that  if the travel wasnt so awfully heavy wed have a better chance to locate tom went on dick  but with the steamers so loaded it is pretty hard to find anybody just by a description  as the boys had both left ashton in a hurry they had but few things with them  in the hendricks car they traveled around seattle purchasing such things as they needed  i dont suppose tom has much clothing said sam  poor fellow i do hope he doesnt go away up north where it is so cold  ive got to send some word home and to new york said dick after the shopping was over  dick can you really spare the time to go to alaska questioned his brother  if you cant i could go alone  i think it is best for us to go together sam  i imagine we are going to have our hands full too  as for dads business it will have to wait thats all  i think i can trust mr powell to do the right thing  the worst of the whole business is this is going to worry dad and aunt martha and uncle randolph a great deal  but that cant be helped  at last came the time for the steamer to leave  the brothers had been fortunate in getting a stateroom together  it was not a very desirable room but it was much better than nothing  and they would have gone if they had to sleep on the anchor as sam expressed it  jim hendricks came down to see them off  he shook hands cordially on parting  im sure i wish you the best of luck he said  and ill write to your chums at brill telling them of what is taking place  slowly the big steamer left the harbor and turned her bow towards the north  it was dark so but little outside of the twinkling lights of the city could be seen  yet the rovers remained on deck for over an hour for neither felt like turning in  they noticed that the passengers were quite a mixed set  many were mere tourists taking a round trip to alaska for sight seeing  others were alaskan merchants and traders who had been down to the states on business  mixed in with the crowd were many men young and middleaged bound for the north to try their luck in the gold fields the great rush to the klondyke was a thing of the past but new gold fields were being opened continually  the boys were on their way to their stateroom when they came suddenly face to face with a burly man who wore a heavy beard and mustache  the man was about to pass them when he suddenly stopped short stared at dick and then at sam and caught each by the arm  say am i dreamin or is this the rovers he gasped  we are the rovers yes answered dick and he gave the burly man a closer look  and this is jack wumble i believe he added  jack wumble cried sam  really  put her thar  put her thar cried the man and took hold of the hand of each at once  aint this great  whar ye bound now anyhow  goin to locate another minelike thet one we found out in colorady  no we are not looking for a mine this trip answered dick  we are on the trail of something far more important  more important than a gold mine demanded jack wumble his eyes opening widely  yes  we are on the trail of my brother tom who is out of his mind and has wandered away  hoss pistols an rattlesnakes  ye dont tell me  well if tom is missin count me in on the hunt fer him was the quick and earnest response     chapter xviii  at juneau and skagway  jack wumble was an old miner and prospector a man the boys had met years before in colorado when they went to that section of our country to locate a mine belonging to their father  as related in detail in the rover boys out west wumble had been of great assistance to them and he knew them all well  he had after numerous stirring adventures located a claim for himself which at the time paid very well lately however the rovers had not heard from him and they had often wondered what had become of the man  youre a sight fer sore eyes so ye are cried jack wumble slapping each on the shoulder  i never dreamed o seein ye in this out o the way corner o the country  we didnt expect to come here either up to a few days ago answered sam  maybe ye better tell me the story suggested the old miner  if i kin help ye i will  come on to the cabin suggested dick and led the way  they sat down on a corner seat and there the rovers told their story withholding nothing for they knew they could trust jack wumble in every particular  gosh all hemlock  sounds like one of them theatre plays i see in frisco was the old miners comment  to think tom would wander away in thet fashion  taint no wonder ye are scart to deth  id be scart myself thinkin he might jump overboard or sumthin like thet  he ought to be put in an asylum  after that jack wumble told his own story  he said his claim in colorado had gradually petered out and then he had tried his fortunes in various other places gradually winding up in the klondyke  there he had struck what he hoped would prove a bonanza  ive been down to the states buying some machinery an some supplies he added  they are coming up on a freight boat next week  i find i can do better to go to the states fer things than to buy in alaska  have you taken any gold out of your claim yet questioned sam with interest  jack wumble looked around to make certain that nobody was listening but the rovers  dont ye tell nobody he whispered  i took out about two thousand dollars in nuggets an dust in lessn ten days  fine returned dick and sam nodded  i hope you keep it up  its the machinery is goin to tell the tale returned jack wumble i cant do much more by hand  are you working the mine alone asked sam  fer the present  when i came away i left the claim in charge o a miner named allisontim allison  but i told him not to do any digginjust keep his eyes on things  when there is any diggin to be done i want to be on hand  wumble was bound for skagway where he said his machinery and supplies would be sent  he knew that section of alaska thoroughly and said he would show the lads where to go and what to do  things is changin mightily up there every day he remarked  they are dredgin channels an buildin railroads and making all kinds o roads  go there one year an the next ye wont most know the place it will look so different  well they are developing all parts of the country answered dick  maybe but nuthin to wot theyre doin in alaska answered the old miner  the three sat up for half an hour longer talking matters over  of course jack wumble wanted to know about mr rover and was sorry to learn that the boys father was not well  he could hardly believe that dick was married  why it dont seem like no time since you an your brothers came out to colorady to locate thet mine he remarked  there was a little wind but otherwise the night was calm  now that they could do no more for the present the rovers realized how tired they were and once in their berths both went sound asleep  nor did they rouse up until well into the morning  the sleep did them a world of good and when they dressed and went to breakfast they felt quite like themselves once more  if we didnt have to worry about tom i could enjoy this trip immensely remarked sam  jack wumble had already satisfied his hunger for he was an early riser  after breakfast all sat on the deck and the old miner related some of his experiences while prospecting in various localities and the boys told how they had finished up at putnam hall and gone to brill  i cant hardly believe thet dan baxter has reformed said wumble shaking his head slowly  i allers put him an his father down fer bad eggs  well they were pretty bad at one time answered dick  but dan found out that it didnt pay to be bad  and his father is old and i guess well satisfied to behave himself and take it easy  mr baxter might have been a wealthy man if he had done things on the level returned the old miner  the journey up the coast of canada to the lower point of alaska was full of interest to the boys  in due course of time the bow of the steamer was turned into chatham strait and soon they were running past admiralty island  both sam and dick had expected to see quite a city at juneau and they were disappointed when they beheld only a scattered town lying on a strip of land bound on one side by what is called the lynn canal and on the other by the mouth of the taku river  in the distance were some high mountains which the boys looked at with interest  fortunately the steamer was to remain at juneau for two hours and in that time the rovers hoped to make certain whether or not tom had landed there  they lost no time in getting ashore and jack wumble went with them  at first there was so much confusion at the dock that the youths could learn little or nothing  but as the crowd cleared away they were enabled to make some inquiries of officials and others  but nobody had seen tom or knew anything about him  i think he must have remained on the steamer said sam  if he was after those nuggets hed want to get right up into the land of gold  thets the way i reason it out put in jack wumble  better stick to the trip lads  i think yell be able to learn somethin in skagway  so when the steamer left the dock they were on board  the trip to skagway was a decidedly interesting one and the youths listened closely to all the old miner had to tell them about the country and its inhabitants  its changin amazingly fast said jack wumble  they are clearin out ship channels an buildin railroads and towns spring up like magic  now whar im locateda place called black runthar wasnt a house thar three years ago  now we got a store an a dozen shacks an more buildin every day  i tell you i think alaska is one o the greatest countries in the world  there was a greater bustle and confusion than ever when the steamer tied up at skagway  here a connection can be made with the white pass and yukon route and other routes  about ten miles away up the lynn canal was dyea also a town of importance  the boys followed jack wumble ashore and waited until some of the bustle and confusion was over and then commenced a systematic hunt for tom  the hunt lasted until nearly midnight and then utterly worn out the rovers and the old miner had to give it up  they had met just one man who remembered having seen a person who looked like tom on the steamer and who said the fellow had landed at skagway  but where the unknown had gone the man could not say  yes thats the fellow said the man when shown toms photograph but he didnt look quite as nice as that  he lookedwell wild like  he is wild answered dick  that is why we want to find him  jack wumble knew of a fairly good hotel and the three put up there for the night  the boys were so tired they slept like logs as dick said afterwards  but they were up bright and early along with the old miner and directly after breakfast set out on another search for tom  i hate to waste your time jack said dick to wumble  so if you want to go ahead  stop right thar dick cried the old miner  i aint in sech an allfired hurry i cant try to do ye a good turn  i like tom an im going to stay with ye fer a few days an see if we cant locate him and thus the matter was settled  two days were spent in skagway and dyea hunting for the missing one late in the afternoon of the second day the boys and the old miner separated to make inquiries in different places  sam and dick came back to the hotel at supper time much discouraged having heard nothing to their advantage  half an hour later jack wumble came in his face showing his excitement  ive got on the trail he cried  come on were goin to git after tom right away     chapter xix  from one clue to another  what have you learned jack  when did he leave here  is he all right  im ready to go after him right now  such were the words that came from the rover boys after jack wumble had announced that he had located their missing brother  we aint got no time to spare cried the old miner  let us pay our bill here an git out an ill tell ye all i know while we are on the way  the lads lost no time in packing up as directed and dick settled at the hotel desk  jack wumble led the way down to the docks and ordered them into a small river boat  this here aint no regular boat he explained  but ive hired passage on her so its all right  well save fourteen hours by not waitin fer the regular boat  but where are we going jack questioned dick  to a jumpinoff place called lindy falls  that is whar the party tom was with was goin to start from  soon the boat a large craft of its kind was on the way up the river as they sped along the boys and the old miner drew into a corner of the cabin and jack wumble told his story  by the merest accident i fell in with a man named rabig i used to know in frisco said the old miner  hes interested in the golden sunset mine an the beggars chance  well i told rabig about you an tom an he got interested an asked me how tom looked an i told him  then he told about how he fell in with tom on board thet steamer an how tom had told him he was bound fer the lion head gold fields  he had it in his head so rabig said that he could pick up nuggets at the lion head  the lion head repeated dick  where is that  its a good distance from here dick i can tell ye that  its to the northwest o the klondyke  a wild place  its called the lion head acause thars a mountain thar thet looks like a lions head  i was thar onct prospectin around  but i didnt find any gold thar  but some have found gold added the old miner  how will tom get there questioned sam  thets the strangest part o it resumed jack wumble  it appears as how he fell in with a miner named furnerike furner  rabig says furner is a bit touched here  wumble tapped his forehead  well the two made up their minds to go to lion head  furner told tom he was sure they could pick up nuggets if only they could hit the right spot furner had some kind o an outfit an he got tom to buy some more things and away they started  rabig thought they was both crazy  and so they must be murmured dick  poor tom  i hope we catch him before he gets too far into the mountains  did this man rabig say what name tom was traveling under asked sam  yes  a mighty queer name too  brill thomas  how do ye account fer that  brill thomas repeated dick  oh thats easy  brill is the name of the college he attends and thomas is his first name in full  he is out of his mind but he still retains snatches of names and things i suppose and thats how he hit on brill thomas for a name  he told rabig he was from the land of hopethe valley brook of hope went on jack wumble  rabig never heard tell o the location  valley brook is the farm we live on and hope is a school near brill said sam  poor poor tom  who would have imagined such a thing as this could happen to him  how far is lion head from here asked dick  as the crow flies about five hundred miles  five hundred miles exclaimed sam  yes an its nearly six hundred by the way theyll have to travel went on jack wumble  this news almost stunned the rover boys  was it possible that tom was undertaking a trip of six hundred miles into the littleknown portion of alaska  hed never do such a thing if he was in his right mind said dick we must catch him just as soon as we can  that is why i hired passage on this boat said the old miner  im calkerlatin we can head him off  thet is if the weather stays good  it looks like rain and is getting colder  right ye are dick  an when it gits cold up here it gits cold i kin tell ye thet  last winter i most froze to death up in my shack added jack wumble  the trip on the boat to lindy falls was without special incident there were about a dozen passengers all miners and prospectors who did not care to wait for any of the regular boats  they were a rather goodnatured set and whiled away the time by swapping stories and arguing about the best way to locate paying claims and getting out the gold  lindy falls was reached one afternoon about two oclock  it was little more than a boat and trading station and here the rover boys got their first sight of alaskan indians members of the chilkoot tribe  immediately on landing they made inquiries concerning tom and the miner named ike furner  they soon learned that furner was a wellknown character and from a trader heard that this man and his young companion had set off but a few hours before  i think they went to dawson city said a man standing nearby anyway furner told me he was goin there first an then up to lion head  this put a new view on the matter and the boys and jack wumble questioned the stranger  the upshot was that they decided to go directly to dawson that mecca of all gold hunters in alaska  now the thing of it is how can we get to dawson from here said sam  thats easy replied jack wumble  just leave it to me  inside of an hour their arrangements were made and they were off previous to going they made more inquiries concerning tom and his strange companion and reached the conclusion that the pair had really headed for dawson  but there is no telling how soon they will change their minds and go somewhere else said dick with a sigh  it is not my purpose to tell the particulars of the tedious journey to dawson city about three hundred and fifty miles north of skagway  at that time all of the improvements that now exist had not been made and the crowd suffered from many inconveniences  but the boys were surprised when they reached dawson to find it so up to date as sam expressed it  they had expected to see a rough mining townand that is what dawson was but a handful of years ago  instead they saw a builtup city with many stores and not a few hotels  goin to be a reglar frisco some day said jack wumble  beats all how the towns grow up here  the party had arrived in dawson late at night and put up at the best hotel to be found  immediately after breakfast the search for tom was renewed  it had rained the day before and now it was blustery and cold with a suggestion of snow in the air  the boys were glad enough to don their sweaters under their coats  yell have to git some heavy clothin if ye go north said the old miner  i hope tom is dressed warm enough said sam  it would be too bad if he took sick along with his other troubles  for two days the boys and the old miner hunted around dawson for some trace of the missing one  they visited all sorts of places but all to no purpose  during that time the weather grew suddenly colder and on the second night came a light fall of snow  wont be long now before winter will be on us announced jack wumble and winter up here is somethin wuth rememberin believe me  the next morning found dick at a large trading store where many miners and prospectors purchased their supplies  here he asked all newcomers if they had seen or heard of tom or ike furner  sure i see furner cried one old prospector  see him yesterday afternoon  where demanded dick eagerly  over on the lion head trail  alone  no he had a young feller with him     chapter xx  in the mountains of alaska  sam i think we are in for a heavy snow today  i think so myself dick  how much further do we go  about two miles came from jack wumble  i reckon i got a bit off the trail yesterday but i know i am right now boys  but where is tom came from sam  he must be right ahead of usif what we have been told is true answered his brother  the conversation recorded above took place just ten days after dick and sam arrived in dawson city  during that time the rover boys and jack wumble had spent two days in buying the necessary outfit to follow tom and his strange companion to the wild region in alaska known as lion head  the start had been made and now the three found themselves on a narrow mountain trail in a country that looked to be utterly uninhabited  for three days they had been close behind tom and ike furner this being proven by the remains of campfires and other indications  once they had met some prospectors returning to the klondyke and these men had told of passing the pair ahead and that furner had said they were bound for a spot not many miles from lion head called twin rocks  i never heard o twin rocks before said jack wumble  but if it is nigh lion head we ought to be able to locate it  provided we dont get snowed in before we reach it returned sam  on and on trudged the three  they had left the last supply depot behind  they had passed only a handful of white folks and a band of five indians  do you know i didnt like the looks of those indians we passed yesterday remarked dick as they went forward over the rough upward trail  they looked pretty sharply at our outfits said sam  i guess theyll like to own them he added  we have got to keep our eyes open said jack wumble  them injuns aint above stealin if they git a chanct  in such an outoftheway place as this we cant afford to lose our things asserted dick  maybe we had better set a guard at night suggested his brother  oh we dont want to lose any sleep if we dont have to  it had grown colder and colder and now the wind swept around them in anything but a pleasant fashion  about noon came a flurry of snow  i dont like that said dick shaking his head and looking up at the darkening sky  oh lets hope it wont amount to much dick replied sam  the traveling was steadily upward for they had to pass over a high hill to get into the valley leading to lion head  there was something of a trail made by wild animals originally and now used by prospectors  this wound in and out among the rock and bushes  the footing was uncertain and more than once one or another would go down in a hole  talk about walking gasped sam after pulling himself out of a hole well concealed by bushes  im thankful i didnt break a leg that time  an ye can be thankful ye didnt stir up no snakes came from jack wumble  are there snakes up here jack  so they sayalthough i never see none  its pretty cold for snakes remarked dick  they only come out in the summer time  i wish we were on horseback said sam with a sigh  hosses would be fine if we could feed em answered jack wumble but ye cant do thet when the ground is covered with snow  the outfits are so heavy jack  true my boy but thet cant be helped  well be lucky if our grub holds out  it was after four oclock when they reached the top of the hill  had it been clear they might have seen for many miles around them but now the dullness in the sky hid what was in the distance from view  lion head is over thar said jack wumble pointing with his hand an twin rocks cant be far off  and how far is lion head from here questioned sam  betwixt twenty an thirty miles sam  then maybe well reach there by tomorrow night  let us hope so lad  o course you must remember weve got the wust part o this journey to go  perhaps well catch tom before we get to lion head suggested dick  not by the way he has been traveling answered his brother  it does beat the nation how he and that furner have been able to get over the ground  on the top of the hill the wind was blowing a regular gale and the boys and the old miner were glad enough to go down on the other side where they would be somewhat sheltered  but even below it was cold and the air seemed to strike to their very backbones  winter is comin all right enough announced jack wumble  well be lucky if we git out o here afore it catches us  they trudged along until all were too weary to walk another step  they were keeping their eyes open for a spot where they might camp for the night when dick uttered a cry  look  they must have remained here last night  the others gazed to where he pointed and saw in a shelter of the rocks the remains of a campfire  beside the ashes lay a part of a broken strap and also some fine shavings from a stick  ike furners mark remarked wumble pointing to the shavings  they had been told by several men that one of furners habits was to whittle a stick  he never rested and talked but what he got out his jackknife and started to cut on a bit of wood  at another campfire two days back they had come across a heap of just such whittlings  how new is that campfire asked dick of the old miner  jack wumble examined the heap of dead ashes with care  i should say not moren a daymaybe not thet he answered  boys i reckon were close on em  oh if only it wasnt so dark and we werent so tired murmured sam  we cant do much in the darkness and with a storm coming on returned dick  well have to wait until morning  but we had better start out directly it is daylight  while the others were preparing supper dick commenced to arrange the shelter for the night  while he was doing this he noticed something white fluttering on the ground in the wind  he picked it up  it was a sheet of paper evidently a page torn from a notebook  look what i found he said coming close to the light of the campfire  he gazed at the sheet with deep interest  well i never sam look at this he cried  what is it dick  i think tom wrote this  poor fellow  isnt it too bad  the sheet of paper had been scribbled on with a lead pencil  the writing was in all sorts of curves and was largely as follows    to  to  to  to  ro  ro  ro  to      ro  to  bri  to  ro  bri   nel  nel  nel  di  s  s   to ro   to ro   tover  tomer   nel  nel  nel  nel   neltom   oh dick what do you make of this  what do i make of it  cant you see sam  tom was trying to think he wanted to get something that was hidden away in his memoryhis own name and mine and yours and nellies and the name of brill  maybe a flash of his real self came back to him  oh if it only would dick  yes you must be right  first he tried his best to write tom rover but all he got was to ro and then he went to bri for brill and nel for nellie and di and s for dick and sam its as plain as day  its just like a little child trying to write  and its enough to make a fellow cry was the sober response  the two boys studied the paper for a long time and let jack wumble look at it  then somewhat silently all sat down to supper  their hard walk had made them hungry and they ate every scrap of what had been prepared  by the time they were ready to turn in it had begun to snow  the had found a shelter under a cliff of rocks with some brushwood to keep off the most of the wind  they rolled themselves in their blankets and soon all were in the land of dreams  dick had slumbered the best part of several hours when he suddenly awoke with a start  some furry body had swept across his face  he sat up in bewilderment and looked around the camp lit up only by the flickering rays of the dying fire  then he gave a gasp  from beyond the dying fire two savage eyes were gazing at him intently  without hesitation he reached down under his blanket brought out the pistol he carried and fired     chapter xxi  at the foot of the cliff  crack  the report of the pistol in that confined space sounded loud and clear and brought sam and jack wumble to their feet with a bound  whats the matter dick  what ye firing at  some wild animal  it just leaped over me cried the one who had used the firearm  dick was now on his feet too and all stepped away from the shelter of the cliff  following the discharge of the weapon had come a short sharp bark or yelp showing that the animal had been hit  now followed more barks and yelps from a distance  a foxan alaskan fox thets wot it was said jack wumble  an i reckon as how ye hit him dick  im sure i did for i aimed right at him and he wasnt over twenty feet away was the reply  wonder if hell come back  i dont think sonot if hes hurted returned the old miner  he must have been putty hungry to come so clost  must have smelt our grub  maybe he wasnt alone suggested sam  id hate to have a pack of foxes come down on me  i dont think youll find any pack around here answered jack wumble they aint so plentiful  but ill tell ye what we might run across an alaskan moosean they aint no nice beast to meet at close quarters  some extra brushwood had been gathered before retiring and now a portion of it was heaped on the fire so that they might have more light  the barking and yelping had died away in the distance and all around the camp it was as silent as a tomb  its snowing yet remarked sam as he went out to look at the sky but it doesnt seem to be very heavy  if only were not snowed in until after we find tom murmured his brother  gradually the excitement died away and then they laid down to rest once more  but dick was nervous and only got into a doze and he was glad when morning came  the sky was now dull and heavy jest filled with snow as jack wumble expressed it  the soft flakes were still coming down but no thicker than they had fallen during the night  the ground was covered with white to a depth of two inches  there was a gentle wind from the northwest  let us not lose any more time than we can help said sam  in such weather as this every minute may count  right ye are responded the old miner  well have breakfast quick as we kin an be off  traveling that morning was comparatively easy and they covered quite a number of miles  but then they commenced to climb the mountain leading to lion head and twin rocks and progress became more difficult  some work eh sam remarked dick after they had helped each other over some slippery rocks on the trail  do you think tom and his companion got over these dick  i suppose they did  its the only thing that looks like a trail around here  if they didnt stick to this theyd soon become lost and being lost on a mountain isnt very niceyou know that  the snow was still coming down and to the boys it seemed heavier than before  jack wumble looked at the sky many times and shook his head slowly  well be in fer it by tomorrow he said  an then nobuddy can tell how long it will keep up  winter is comin sure  then the sooner we find tom and get back to dawson with him the better  it was about five oclock in the afternoon when they reached a spot where the trail ran along the bottom of a tall cliff  far below them was the valley they had crossed in the morning now all but shut out from their view by the falling snow  dont either of ye slip here cautioned jack wumble  because if ye do thar aint no tellin whar yell fetch up  ill be as careful as possible answered dick  and so will i added sam  the old miner was in the lead with sam coming next and dick bringing up the rear  thus nearly half a mile more was slowly covered  we ought to be drawing close to tom now said dick  ive got an idea cried his brother  why didnt we think of it before  let us call to him and fire one of the pistols  all right said the old miner  twont do no harm  all three raised their voices in a lusty shout and dick fired a shot into the air  then they listened intently  there was no answer of any kind  let us try it again suggested sam  now then all together  this time their yell was thrice repeated and dick fired two shots they waited several seconds for an answer  listen exclaimed dick  i hear something  all strained their ears and from a great distance made out an answering cry  it appeared to come from somewhere above them  i believe tom and that man with him are on the trail above the cliff cried dick  just what i think answered his brother  oh if only we could climb right up there instead of going away around  aint no way as i can see to do it said jack wumble looking at the bare wall of rocks  well have ter go on till we reach some sort o a break  once again they cried out and again came the answering call  but those above them were so far away that it was impossible to make out what was said  ive got it cried dick  if that is tom ill give him a call hell know  the old putnam hall locomotive whistle queried sam  yes  now then both together sam and as loud and distinct as possible  both youths took a deep breath and then out on the snowy air rang a sharp shrill whistle once twice three times rising and falling in a fashion known only to the cadets of the military school  by gosh thets some whistle remarked jack wumble in admiration  again all three listened intently  there was a long spell of silence and then from a distance came an answering whistle that sounded like an echo of their own  its tom screamed sam and clapped his hands  yes it must be  nobody else could imitate that whistle so perfectly returned his brother  oh let us go on  we must get to him went on sam impatiently maybe that whistle will bring him to his right senses dick  im afraid that is too much to expect sam  but i am glad he remembered the whistle anyway  it shows that he hasnt forgotten everything  let us yell that we are coming and for them to wait suggested the old miner  thats it answered dick  now then ill lead off  and loud and clear rang the cry  we are coming  we are coming  wait for us  wait  wait  to this some answer came back but what it was they could not make out then in the silence that followed they picked up their traps once more and went forward on the wearisome trail  with each yard of advance the walking became more difficult  in some spots the rocks were covered with snow and they had to proceed with caution for fear of a nasty tumble  they were climbing upward steadily and they noted with satisfaction that the cliffs seemed to become correspondingly lower  well be up there in quarter of an hour more said jack wumble  but dont ye try to go too fast  this trail is gittin wuss an wuss  at last they came to some rocks where further progress seemed impossible  there had been something of a landslide and big rocks covered the footpath for a distance of a hundred feet or more  they gazed around the spot in perplexity  well one thing is certain said sam  tom and that man must have come this way if they could get over these rocks we ought to be able to do the same thing  i think i see a way said dick  yes here are some footprints in the snow and on this fallen tree  they climbed up by holding on to those branches  we can do the same thing  dont ye try it yelled jack wumble  thet tree is loose  it might carry ye to the bottom of the mountain  hark called out sam  i hear something  what is that  all listened  from a distance came a curious swishing and cracking sound followed by a wild sort of yell  then came a crashand thenutter silence     chapter xxii  ike furners camp  dick what was that  im sure i dont know sam  sounded like something falling  it was a tree sliding down the mountain put in jack wumble  a tree jest like the one you was goin to take hold on  and somebody on it gasped sam  oh do you suppose it was tom  at this question the old miner shrugged his shoulders  aint no tellin sam  let us hope not fer if he went down the mountain side  hed be killed finished dick and shuddered  they listened and called out  but no answer came back and they heard nothing more but the humming of the wind through the trees for it had begun to blow stronger than before  lets go a little further than this trail suggested jack wumble it looks to be better walking yonder  but we dont want to lose our way returned sam rather impatiently the strange happenings of the day were getting on his nerves  we can come back here if we need to was the old miners reply  the rovers followed him through some brushwood and then up a rough incline  here the bushes growing between the rocks aided them although they had to put on gloves to keep from getting their hands badly scratched for some of the growth was thorny  well here we are at last cried sam when the upper level of the trail was gained  he was almost out of breath for the climb had been a long and hard one  they were now in the midst of a field with the snow coming down thickly all around them  wumble led the way looking for the spot above the fallen tree  to one side was the mountain top to the other the valley but all cut off from their view by the falling flakes of snow  it was so dark that they could scarcely distinguish the trail even though wumble was sure they were on it  why not light a torch suggested dick  that will help us and may make the others see usif they are near by  this was considered a good suggestion and the old miner picked out an extra dry bush that was long and slender  the top ignited readily and he quickly swung it into a blaze  then they went on once more holding the torch at arms length  it was well that the light had been made as they speedily found out scarcely had they gone a hundred yards further when they reached a split in the mountain side  stop yelled the old miner and came to a halt at the very brink of a crevice ten or twelve feet wide and of unknown depth  theres a tree bridge said dick as the torch was swung around to light up the vicinity  he pointed to where a slender tree had been cut down and allowed to fall across the chasm  it made a fairly good bridge although they had to cross with care and only one at a time  their traps they threw over the opening  with the snow now blowing directly in their faces they marched forward once more wumble throwing the light as far ahead as possible  soon they reached another climb up a series of rocks that looked almost like a pair of stairs  look cried the old miner a few minutes later and he stopped to pick something up out of the snow  it was a wooden pipe  it must be that ike furners said dick  tom doesnt smoke  why look the pipe has tobacco in it and its still lit exclaimed sam  it couldnt have been dropped very long ago  and that proves that the owner must be close by put in his brother lets call  and he set up a ringing shout in which sam and jack wumble joined  for fully a minute no answer came back  then from some height above them issued an answering cry  wave the torch jack exclaimed dick and the old miner did as requested  all strained their eyes  i see a light exclaimed sam  see over yonder  i see it came from the others  forward they went in the direction of the light which flickered uncertainly through the falling snow  they had to climb around many rocks and bushes and occasionally they lost sight of the beacon ahead but at last mounting another rise they came in full view of a campfire located at the entrance to a cavelike opening in the side of the mountain  a man was standing close to the campfire a tall thin individual with a shock of hair and a heavy beard  he was dressed in a typical miners costume and in his hands was a pistol  who goes there he cried in a highpitched nervous voice  dont come any closer until i know who you are and he raised his pistol and pointed it at those who approached  dont shoot stranger called out jack wumble as he and the rovers came to a halt  are you ike furner he went on  i am  who are you  im a miner from black run  my handle is jack wumble  these are two friends o mine dick an sam rover  we aint goin to harm you  we are lookin fer a young feller thets lost thats all  we are looking for my brother added dick  his name is tom rover i think he was traveling with you  they had now come close enough to see that ike furner was alone  dont know no tom rover was the slow response  theres a young feller with me but his name is brill thomas  and where is he now asked sam impatiently  was you below here a while ago shoutin asked ike furner without answering the last question  yes  well he went off to meet you  to meet us exclaimed dick  which way did he go  same way you came  but we didnt meet him cried sam and dick in a breath  i dunno nuthin about that stranger  when my partner heard you acallin an heard that queer whistle you gave he got all excited an said he must see who it was  i told him hed better wait till you came along but he wouldnt do itsaid he couldntthat he had remembered somethin an he was afraid he was goin to forgit it agin  poor tom  that whistle must have made him remember who he was said sam  he turned to his brother  where can he be now  oh dick do you remember that strange noise  yes yes  if he had a tumble  dick could not finish  wed better search into this came promptly from jack wumble  he held out the pipe he had picked up  is this yours he asked of the other man  it sure is cried ike furner his eyes lighting up with pleasure  i thought sure she was gone fer good  i suppose ye found her on the trail  i did  thanks and the other miner put the precious pipe in his pocket then he gazed curiously at the crowd before him  i dont understand this nohow he muttered  that feller who was with me was all right till you called an whistled then he acted plumb locoed  he is our brother explained dick and he is a bit out of his mind but we cant waste time explaining just now  we must hunt him up before this storm gets any worse  thats the talk said sam  i dont see why he didnt meet you  we are afraid he had a tumble answered dick and told about the strange swishing and crashing they had heard  by gum  maybe he went down into thet split in the rocks cried ike furner  i yelled to him to be careful o thet openin  but he was in sech a hurry  the miner did not finish  ill get a fresh torch and well go back said jack wumble  his face wore a sober look  a tumble down thet openin would be putty bad he added  want me to go along asked ike furner  you can go if you want to answered dick  but fix your traps so that no wild animals can get at the food  oh the grub is safe enough  ill keep a good fire burnin answered the prospector  they could readily see that he was a peculiar man but with a kindly heart  family troubles had caused him to try his fortunes in this out of the way portion of the globe  it did not take long for them to build up the campfire and get an extra torch  this done all set off in the direction of the split in the rocks jack wumble leading the way and the others coming in a bunch behind him  the rover boys knew not what to say or what to think  had tom tumbled into that awful opening and if so was he alive or dead  if he went down there i dont see how he could escape whispered sam to his brother  why when i crossed on that tree i couldnt see the bottom  let us hope he didnt take that tumble was the low reply     chapter xxiii  a slide down the mountain side  my gracious dick  it sure is snowing some now  yes and it is getting colder every minute  if we dont get out of the mountains putty quick well be snowed in came from jack wumble  did you calkerlate to git back to dawson afore winter sot in inquired ike furner curiously  why of course cried sam  i dont see how you are goin to make it  oh we must get back said dick  if only we could find tom he added with a sigh  it was fully an hour after they had left the campfire at the entrance to the cave of the mountain  they had walked to the chasm where they thought tom might have had a tumble and crossed and recrossed it several times  but they had found no traces of the missing rover boy  if only we knew whether he went down in that opening said sam for at least the tenth time  dick do you suppose we can climb down into it  not without a rope sam  the sides are too steep and slippery  time and again they called down  but no answer came back  if tom was down there he was either unconscious or dead  and now it had begun to snow harder than ever  the air was so full of the white flakes that they could not see ten feet in any direction  it was a typical alaskan snowstorm  there was a sweep to the wind that found the very marrow of their bones  what to do next the rovers did not know nor could the two miners suggest anything  finally however ike furner mentioned something that set the youths to thinking  see here he cried  the old tree is gone  what tree asked all three of the others  why the big hemlock as was hangin over the cliff  she was a whopper i kin tell youbiggest tree in these parts  where was that tree asked dick  right here whar you see the holes  the snow has covered the spot putty well but i know the tree was here when we come up  it must have been that tree we heard sliding down the mountain side exclaimed dick  maybe tom didnt go down into the chasm at all but slid down the mountain on the tree  thats so put in sam eagerly  and he may not be hurt  well a slide like thet wouldnt be anything to sneeze at remarked jack wumble  especially if the tree took to rollin over an over  im goin to investigate said dick and commenced to crawl out on the edge of the cliff  you be careful roared wumble  its slippery an dangerous out there  let us join hands suggested sam and this was done all forming a chain to keep dick from going over the edge of the cliff  he took the torch in one hand that he might light the way in the darkness and the flying snow  at last dick found himself on the very edge of the cliff at the point where the giant tree had stood  to his surprise the cliff was not perpendicular there but formed a slope leading to another ridge some fifty feet below  what was beneath this was hidden from view by the falling snow  i think i can crawl down there he said to the others  anyway i am going to try it  wait  ive got a lariat in my pack said ike furner  ill git that  it will be bettern nuthin  and off he sped for the article mentioned  when he came back dick tied one end of the lariat around his waist and while the others held fast he crawled down the slope  he had to keep on his hands and knees and once he slipped a distance of several yards the others stopping him with a jerk  be carefulthe lariat might snap sang out sam  its better walking down here answered dick  i think  he did not finish for just then his body swung down into a hollow filled with snow and with some dripping water that had commenced to freeze  there was a snap and the end of the lariat came back in the faces of those above  there he goes yelled jack wumble and pointed down to where the torch could be seen whirling around and around  soon it was hidden from view by the snow  dick  dick yelled sam  are you safe  a yell came back but what was said those above could not make out sams face went white and he looked inquiringly at jack wumble  where do you suppose he went to asked ike furner  wumble shook his head  dont know unless he slid clar down to the valley he returned this is certainly the wust yet  im going down after him said sam bravely  be careful lad it may cost ye your life  i dont careim going to find dickand tom too  the youngest rover was just worked up enough to be reckless  and when sam got that way nothing could hold him back  im going back to get something to eat for all handsin case we need it he said  then ill crawl down somehow and learn the truth  if tom and dick are all right ill fire one shot from my pistol  then youll know we are coming up as soon as possible  if i fire two shots youll know we are all right but we cant come up right away  if i fire three shots youll know i need help  in that case come down packs and all and well find some kind of a camping spot below  so it was settled and having gone back to where the traps had been left the youngest rover made up a small bundle for himself and also procured another torch  the others accompanied him to where dick had disappeared  i hate to see ye leavin me said jack wumble with feeling  maybe it would be better to wait till mornin when it was lighter  no jack i cant waitand have dick down there and tom too  for all we know both of them may be dying  that was all sam said and to this the old miner could not reply  ike furner looked on but did not open his mouth  he was waiting to hear the full particulars concerning the young man he had known as brill thomas  down and down went sam the snow soon hiding the two miners from his view  he had to proceed with care fearing a tumble such as his big brother had taken  where there was water ice was forming on the rocks making the descent more dangerous than ever  i dont know how a fellow is to get back that way he said to himself  guess well have to walk around by the trail  it was now intensely cold and the wind was blowing almost a gale  he was glad when he reached something of a hollow where he could crouch down and regain his breath  dick  dick he cried many times but no answer came back  either his brother was too far away to hear him or was too badly hurt to make reply  down and down climbed sam until he felt he must be approaching the foot of the mountain  he had his torch still in hand having often carried it in his teeth while holding fast  in some spots the snow was now over a foot deep and his footing was consequently more uncertain than ever  suddenly he found himself on the edge of a small cliff the last on the mountain side  without knowing it he had crossed the trail leading upward three times  he stepped on some ice on the rocks and the next instant was launched into space  sam had no time to get scared  forth into the descending snow he was tossed and down he went to land first in a tree and then in some thick bushes growing close by  the wind was knocked completely out of him and for the moment he could not move  phew that was a tumble he murmured as he tried to sit up  he was wedged so tightly in the bushes that he could scarcely move  it was far from a pleasant situation yet he realized that coming down first on the tree and then in the bushes had saved him from broken bones if not from death  he was considerably scratched up but just then paid no attention to the hurts  at last he managed to crawl out on the ground or rather the snow which was deeper in the valley than it had been up on the mountain his torch had been extinguished so all was dark around him  dick he called as loudly as he could  dick are you anywhere around  sam came the faint reply  is that you  yes i am over here  help me  i am wedged in between the trees and cant move  is tom down here too  i dont know     chapter xxiv  in which tom is found  guided by his brothers voice sam at last found dick  as the latter had said he was wedged between two tall trees and in anything but a comfortable position  and how to release him was a problem  i guess i had better climb up and bend one of the trees over by my weight suggested sam  i dont see any other way  all right sam  only be careful and dont fall and let the tree snap back on me answered dick weakly  in his cramped position he could scarcely breathe  with great care sam ascended the slimmest of the two trees pushing it as far away from the other as possible  as he went up his weight told and presently the tree commenced to bend down away from the other  thats betternow i can move a little cried dick  go on  there thats enough  all right sam you can come down  and then dick scrambled out in the snow and his brother joined him  did you see anything at all of tom asked the youngest rover as soon as both could get their breath  not a thing sam  but i saw the tree that fellits caught on the cliff above here  yes i saw thatjust before i took a tumble  then you fell too  only from the last cliff  i landed in a tree and then some bushes and got pretty well scratched  but come on if youre able and well look for tom  whats that bundle you have strapped to your back  i brought a little food along in case we had to stay down here until tomorrow  i see  wait well light a torch firstwe cant do much in the dark  dry brushwood was to be had in plenty and the boys not only lit torches but also made a fire to light up the scene all around them then they set off on their hunt going up and down the base of the cliff for several hundred feet  it was now snowing so furiously that progress was difficult  well be snowed in thats certain remarked sam as they moved about swinging their torches to the right and left  i dont careif only we find tom and he isnt seriously hurt returned his brother  but its no fool of a thing to be snowbound in alaska dick  ive heard of miners being starved to deathnot being able to get anywhere for food  yes ive heard of that too  but do you want to give up this hunt for tom  indeed not  ill stick it out no matter what comes answered sam quickly  as they moved along dick presently saw what he thought was a rock or mound of dirt in front of him covered with snow  he was about to step over it when something prompted him to scrape at the object with his foot  the next instant he let out a cry  its tom  are you sure gasped sam who was a few yards away  yes yes  here hold my torch went on dick and as sam took the light dick knelt in the snow and raised up the inanimate form  it was tom true enough with an ugly cut on his forehead from which the blood had been flowing  illustration here hold my torch said dick  the rover boys in alaska  isis he dedead asked sam hoarsely  ii dont know sam was the slow answer  you lead the way and ill carry him back to where we built that fire  oh dick cant you tell if he is breathing  dick put his ear to toms breast and for a moment there was a painful silence  i think he is breathing sam but i am not quite sure  well get to the fire and give him something hot to drink  sam led the way through the snow carrying both torches and dick came after him with the inanimate form of poor tom over his shoulder  in a few minutes they reached the fire they had made and sam piled on some additional brushwood  sam had rolled the food and other things he had brought along in a blanket and this covering was now placed on the snow and tom was laid on it partly under the shelter of some bushes  the two brothers got down and worked over the unconscious one for over a quarter of an hour  they had a bottle of a stimulent the doctor had given them for tom and now they forced a dose of this down the lads throat  then they rubbed his hands and wrists  gradually they saw a change in tom  he began to breath a little deeper and muttered something in an undertone  tom  tom cried dick  dont you know me  tom  its dick and sam wake up old man thats a good fellow  oh my head  oh my head came with a groan and the sufferer slowly stretched himself  then he put one hand up to his forehead oh dear what a crack i got  never mind tom youll soon be yourself cried sam a big relief showing itself in his voice  tom wasnt dead perhaps after all he wasnt seriously hurt  oh my head was all the answer tom made just then  he opened his eyes for an instant and then closed them again  wonder if he will know us whispered sam to dick  i hope so was the answer  but come we must do all we can for him i dont think we can move him very far  but wed be better off if we were in the shelter of that cliff  wait ill hunt up a spot dick  but hadnt i better fire a shot first  and sam told of the signals that had been arranged  yes give em two shots said the big brother  if we want help later we can fire some more  and the shots were discharged without further delay  this done a shelter close to the cliff was selected  here they cut down some brushwood with a hatchet sam had brought along and formed a barrier to keep out the wind and snow  then another campfire was built and tom was brought over and placed on the blanket in a warm and cozy corner  oh my head he muttered over and over again  of a sudden he sat up as if in bewilderment  where am i he cried  is it time to get up say sam i wonder if ive got time to write that theme i didnt do last night  songbird said he would give me a few pointers but i reckon he forgot all about it  say what makes it so cold in this room  its time old muggs turned on the steam heat  tom  tom said sam  do you know me  dont you know where you are  dont i know you  what are you talking about sam  of course i know you  and dick  say how did you get back to college dick  and why in thunder  well i declare  tom sat up and stared at the campfire and the snow  how in the name of washingtons sword did i get here he gasped  never mind that now tom answered dick taking him by the hand how do you feel  you had a bad tumble if youll remember  tumble  where did i tumble from  oh i rememberthat moving picture show  say that alaskan scene was great wasnt it  i thought id like to go to alaska after some of those nuggets  funny wasnt it and poor tom grinned broadly  but how did i get here in the snow and cold  say have i been sick again dick  and now the sufferer looked sharply at his brothers  yes tom youve beenvery sick answered dick slowly  how do you feel now  you had a bad tumble and we were afraid you had been killed  where did i tumble from the roof of the dormitory  no you fell down the mountain side  eh  what mountain side  the one right back of you  but dont bother about that now  just take it easy and rest yourself went on dick soothingly  are you sure no bones are broken asked sam anxiously  i dont remember anything about a tumble said tom slowly iithought i was in our room at brill old number twentyfive  and it wasnt winter either  say i cant understand all this  are we out in the woods back of brill  hadnt we better get back  see how its snowing  we wont go back tonight tom answered dick  you just take my advice and lie down and keep quiet  if you are hungry you can have something to eat  i dont want anything to eati had a bangup supper the last i can remember  but i seem to be in a fog  i dont remember anything about how i got here  and my head hurts to beat the band  feels as if a lot of boiler makers were working inside of it  tom put his hand up as of old  i guess illill have toto leave it all to you he went on faintly and then fell back on the blanket completely exhausted     chapter xxv  the shelter under the cliff  despite the fact that they were caught in a furious snowstorm and that there was no telling how long the downfall would last sam and dick felt very happy as they crouched by the campfire in the shelter of the cliff  they had found their brother and he did not seem to be seriously hurt by the long tumble he had taken  i guess we had better let him rest quietly sam whispered dick as both bent over the sufferer  it will probably do him more good than anything  just what i think dick  but tell me do you think he is in his right mind now  i cant tell exactly  one thing is sure he doesnt seem to remember anything of his trip to this outoftheway spot  isnt it queer  i never thought a fellows mind could play him such tricks  oh men have been known to wander away and then come to themselves and not remember a thing about how it happened  maybe that tumble did him good  the two boys stirred around the shelter fixing the fire and making the barrier of brushwood more secure  tom continued to rest occasionally muttering to himself  we might as well have something to eat since you brought something along remarked dick presently  and then well have to turn in  we can take turns at sleeping and at watching tom  do you think well be completely snowed in by morning  let us hope not  an hour later sam was sleeping while dick sat on some brushwood tending the fire and keeping an eye on tom  it was very quiet and the snow was coming down as thickly as ever  dick had much to occupy his mindthe perils of the present situation his fathers business affairs and dora  poor dora he murmured  shell be much worried until she hears from me again  well i wont mind all this if only tom comes out of it in his right mind  it made dick sick from head to foot to think that funloving tom might have to go to an asylum  such a happening would wreck the happiness of every member of the family and wreck dear nellies happiness too  dick remained on watch for three hours and then roused sam and turned in himself  so the long night passed tom continuing to sleep and only rousing up once and demanding a drink  and he went on sleeping when dick and sam arose to get breakfast and form their plans for the day  it had stopped snowing but the sky was still overcast  it was colder than beforea drop in the thermometer which meant but one thingthat the long alaskan winter had arrived  for months to come everything would be frozen up as hard as a rock  id give a good deal to be back in dawson remarked dick while munching a scant breakfast  he and sam had decided to make the food on hand last as long as possible  so would i  but i dont see ourselves getting there in this fall of snowand with more snow in the air  i dont see what were going to do with tom if he cant walk  we cant carry him  we can make a draga sort of sled samand haul him on that  so we can  how queer i didnt think of it  why it will be just the thing  and the face of the youngest rover brightened up considerably  just what move to make next would depend in a great measure on how tom felt when he roused up  his brothers watched him anxiously but made no move to wake him  it was about ten oclock in the forenoon when a shout was heard and looking through the bushes the boys beheld jack wumble and ike furner each had a pack on his back  hello cried dick and ran out to meet them  oh so there ye are exclaimed jack wumble  thought ye must be somewhere around here  how are ye all right he went on anxiously  yes  a little scratched up thats all  an sam an tom  sam is a bit scratched up too  we found tom and he doesnt seem to have any bones broken  but he is very weak and we are letting him sleep and dick gave some particulars  we had some job getting off the mountain said the old miner and then he added in a somewhat lower tone  ive told furner all about tom and its all right  i reckoned as how he wasnt just ok said ike furner  but then some folks say i aint jest all right when i know i am and he tossed back his head  he was by no means crazy only peculiar and headstrong  do you think we can get back to dawson asked sam who had come forward after dick  maybe lad but it will be a tough journey in this snow answered wumble  im going to stay here an look fer gold cried ike furner stubbornly  ive got your brothers part of our outfit here  he passed it over  theres lion head and over yonder is the split rocks  i think im about due to find a fortune and he drew himself up to his full height  well we are not going to stop you answered dick  all we came after was our brother  but its a pity to leave you here all alone  oh i wont mind that  ive often been alone in the mountains  fact is i rather like it  when a feller is alone he can do just as he pleases  that is true answered dick with a faint smile  i know some other miners up here went on ike furner  im going to hit for their camp an stay there till spring  how is the brother makin it  hes sleeping now  i think he will be all right  he doesnt remember anything about his trip up here  an hour went by and tom roused up  he looked blankly at jack wumble and ike furner  dont you know me tom asked the former  we had some great times out west years ago  sure i know you and the sufferer grinned feebly  youre jack wumble arent you  thats me  put her thar tom  and the old miner took toms hand and held it tightly  glory to heaven  this is like a touch o old times this is  then ike furner approached looking at tom closely  but the youth did not seem to recognize him  know me too dont you asked the old prospector  ii cant say that i do was the slow answer and tom appeared much perplexed  seems to me ive seen you somewhere but i cant just place you  well ill be switched muttered ike furner  thets the strangest thing i ever hear tell on  he pulled on his rough beard  dont remember me a tall  no  who are you  ike furner the man you came to alaska with  alaska  i never went to alaska cried tom  he commenced to grow excited  dick  sam  what does this mean  he tried to struggle to his feet but found himself too weak to do so  keep quiet tom ordered his elder brother  its all right  youve been very sick thats all andwell a bit out of your mind  youll be all right after a while  but that man said i went to alaska  so you did  but its all right so just take it easy  alaska  great hambones  am i in alaska now  yes if you must know  but do be quiet and rest yourself went on dick soothingly  what did i do run away  well talk about it later tom  you must rest now and dick made the sufferer lie down as before  then he motioned for ike furner to come away  its all right ill git outi wouldnt stay fer a farm muttered the old gold hunter  your brother is as crazy as they make em  im glad to get shut o him  didnt remember me  i cant believe it and a little later he bid the crowd farewell and took his departure to hunt up the other old prospectors he had mentioned  it may be said here that that was the last the rovers saw or heard of him for a long time to come  the day passed slowly the others doing all they could for poor tom the sufferer roused up several times and took what nourishment was given to him  his head had been bound up so that the cut on his forehead did not show  evidently he was suffering from exposure and the loss of blood  we must get him to dawson somehow said dick  i guess we had better start tomorrow morning early  just what i think replied sam  suits me responded jack wumble  but it aint going to be no easy job makin it boys he added seriously     chapter xxvi  in the grip of the tornado  in the morning all thoughts of moving had to be abandoned  it was snowing furiously and the wind was sweeping around them in a perfect gale  were snowbound said jack wumble after a look around  winter this year has come on putty quick  it was a dismaying state of affairs and sam and dick looked at each other questioningly  what was to be done  tom was no better nor was he worse  he lay where they had placed him close to the fire and took such nourishment as was given to him  at times he appeared quite rational but once in a while he asked some question that showed he was not altogether in his right mind  we could stay here for some time if it wasnt for one thing remarked dick  we have got to have food  just what i was thinking returned sam  as it is we havent enough to last us for more than a week at the most  if there was a river anywhere near id try my hand at fishin said the old miner  ye kin get plenty o fish in alaska even if ye have to fish through a hole in the ice fer em  the cold was so intense that the boys were glad enough to stir around in the snow and wind to keep warm  they cut a big pile of firewood and piled the brushwood thickly around the shelter taking care however to keep it from the campfire  the day went slowly by  at nightfall the snow stopped coming down but the wind blew as before and if anything it was colder  nothing but ice from now on announced jack wumble and he was right by morning everything was frozen up as stiff as a stake as sam expressed it  the day before they had caught some water dripping from the rocks for drinking purposes now they had to melt the ice over the fire to get the liquid  but the sun was shining brightly and that raised their spirits  dont you suppose if we made a drag for tom that we could get back to dawson somehow questioned sam after all had been outside to look at the sky  well we kin try it if ye say so answered jack wumble  it sure aint no fun stayin here with no more grub showin itself  if i could only shoot a wildcat fer the meat id feel better  with so much brushwood at hand it was an easy matter to construct a rude sledlike drag for poor tom  to make it more comfortable they heaped on it some tundra moss which they found growing on one of the windswept stretches nearby  where are you going to take me demanded the sufferer when told that they were going to leave the place  we are going to take you to a safe shelter tom and then home answered dick  home  that sounds good murmured tom  ill be glad to get there and rest and he gave a longdrawn sigh  the start was made by ten oclock tom being warmly wrapped in blankets and all the traps being piled on the drag in front and behind him  a rope had been tied fast in front and on this wumble and dick pulled while sam had hold of the drag itself to pull and to steer  it was still bitter cold and many times on the way those hauling the drag stopped to make sure that tom was comfortable and in no danger of getting his nose or his ears frostbitten  fortunately the route was largely down hill so pulling the long drag was not such a hardship as it otherwise might have been  at noon they stopped in a small hollow sheltered from the wind and made themselves a hot pot of coffee and ate a frugal lunch  tom sat up for a few minutes and the others were glad to see that the journey had done him no harm either physically or mentally  by the middle of the afternoon it was snowing again and they had all they could do to keep to the trail  the old miner shook his head dubiously  reckon as how were up against it was his comment  if it gits much wuss well have to look fer another shelter boys  the wind had let up during the middle of the day but now it commenced to blow with a suddenness that was alarming  it sent the whirling snow into their faces with pitiless fury and almost blinded them while they breathed with difficulty  got to git out o this an mighty quick too gasped jack wumble  which way shall we turn jack questioned dick  i cant see at all  i think thars a woods belowlets strike fer that lad  it will mean shelter an firewood at least  they hurried on pulling the long drag after them  they were in a valley and suddenly they came to a broad patch of ice and sam went sprawling on his back  his brother helped him to arise and onward they went once more but with added caution  this must be a lake said dick as after traveling for some time they found the ice still under their feet  or else a river  can it be safe asked sam  why it wasnt frozen over four days ago  well be careful cried wumble  even if it is hard enough there may be airholes around  the situation seemed to grow steadily worse  the wind blew so hard that at times they were fairly carried along by it  the snow cut off the view from all sides so they could not determine in what direction they were traveling  heres something ahead cried wumble presently  a huta miners hut  lets get inside just as quickly as we can returned sam his teeth chattering  im momost frozen stiff  the hut was on a small bank evidently on the shore of the lake or river on which they had been traveling  it was closed up tightly and a pounding on the door brought no response  nobuddy home i reckon said jack wumble  well here goes to git in and he pushed on the door  it was not locked and swung inward revealing a single room about twelve feet square and lit up by one small window  opposite the door was a fireplace partly filled with cold ashes  on a shelf and on a rude table rested some cooking utensils and to one side of the hut was a bunk containing some pine tree boughs and several old blankets  hello cried dick  anybody in here  there was no answer and a quick look around convinced them that nobody had been in the place for several days if not weeks  yet on a shelf in a rude locker were a number of storesbeans coffee a side of bacon and several other things  let us start a fire first thing and get thawed out suggested sam and this was done the boys finding plenty of wood piled up behind the hut  they had already brought tom in from the drag and placed him in the bunk and now they closed the door  in this awful blow well have to watch that fire carefully warned wumble  ef we dont we may burn down the shebang over our heads  the blaze soon warmed them all up and even tom said he felt better the boys looked over the stores in the cabin with interest  what about touching these said dick to the old miner  have we any right to do it  of course wed pay for the things  we wont touch em unless we have to dick  it aint a question o pay in sech a spot as this  the owner may be comin back and dependin on em  a man as wants grub wont part with it fer no amount o gold  why ive seen the time in camp in winter when a feller wouldnt sell a quart o plain beans fer a hundred dollars o dust  yes i know that  all right well leave the things alone  and dick sighed  how good an old fashion home dinner would have tasted to all of them just then  the wind continued to howl occasionally rocking the hut in a fashion that alarmed them  sam asked the old miner if there was any danger of it being tipped over  there is allers danger when the wind gits too high was the reply  presently the sparks commenced to blow out into the room and the wind outside grew wilder and wilder  they stamped out the fire and sat huddled together in the darkness tom with the rest for he was now a little stronger and did not want to remain alone  and then came a shock as paralyzing as it was appalling  the hut seemed to be lifted into the air and whirled around  then came a crash and the structure fell over on the ice and snow of the river or lake below  the boys tumbled in a heap with jack wumble on top of them  before they could get up all felt themselves moving swiftly along in a wind that was blowing little short of a tornado  all was pitch black around them and to get up or to do anything was totally out of the question  sam started to ask dick a question when something hit him on the head and he fell back unconscious     chapter xxvii  lost in the fields of ice  where in the world are we jack  dont ask me dick  i reckon the wind must a swept us up to the north pole  tom are you all right  well im here came back faintly from the suffering one  what did we do sail through the air  we sailed through something tomand i guess we went about a mile a minute too  where is sam  i dont know answered the old miner  its so snowy i cant see a thing  sam  sam yelled dick with as much force as he could command  there was no reply  if the youngest rover was nearby he was in no condition to answer the call  a full hour had elapsed since that terrific gust of wind had tumbled the hut down on the river for such the sheet of water proved to be then had followed a tornado or hurricane or cyclone the boys and the old miner could not tell which  hut and occupants had been carried along the stream on the ice with the velocity of an express train from the river they had been swept out over a lake and finally had landed in a big bank of snow with a crash that had shattered the hut into fragments  all had been so shaken up that for some minutes nobody could speak the old miner was the first to recover and he had stumbled around until he found dick who was holding poor tom in his arms  both of the brothers had been pretty well pounded but were otherwise uninjured by their thrilling experience  it was snowing again the snow now coming down in regular chunks as dick said  the wind had gone down a little but was still blowing fiercely  all was dark around the remains of the hut  sam  sam yelled dick again and again and staggered around in the snow searching for the missing one  then he landed on the ice of the lake and went flat on his back and jack wumble came after him  as they picked themselves up they heard a faint cry and caught sight of sam lying but a few yards away  are ye hurted any lad asked wumble who was first at the youngest rovers side  ii dont know gasped sam  somesomething struck me on ththe head  with the assistance of the old miner and dick he arose to his feet and all three staggered back to where tom had been left  the ruins of the hut rested against a snowbank and to get out of the wind they crawled between the logs and the snow  this is the worst yet was dicks comment  how are we ever to find our way back to dawson from here  nobody could answer that question  just now they had all they could do to keep warm  you stay here while i take a little look around said jack wumble presently  i may learn somethin wuth knowin  but dont get lost jack cautioned dick  ill be careful was the answer  the old miner was gone less than ten minutes when he set up a shout  what have you found asked dick quickly  heres a signboard was the reply  i reckon as how theres a trail here  it says somethin but i cant make it out  lets light a torch suggested sam and this was done  they brushed the snow from the signboard and read the following printed in crude letters    10 miles to sublers stores   below this lettering was a crude drawing of a hand pointing up the lake  sublers stores cried the old miner  ive heard o that place its quite a depot for supplies  if we could only git thar wed be all right  lets try it suggested dick  the wind is right down the lake so it will make traveling that much easier  they labored hard in the darkness and wind to construct a drag out of the ruins of the hut  on this they placed tom and also such of their scanty traps and provisions as still remained to them  but once out on the lake they realized that the task before them was no easy one  here the wind blew with terrific force sending them further and further away from the shore which they wanted to skirt  it had stopped snowing and seemed to be growing colder  ii cacant stand this gasped sam after a while  im frfreezing  soso am i answered dick  tom are you all right  im pretty cocold was the chatteredout reply  we cant make it i reckon said the old miner who was as chilled as any of them  well have to go ashore an git out of the wind an build a fire to thaw out by  but getting ashore was out of the question  when they tried to turn around the fierce wind fairly took their breath away  so they continued to advance the wind at times carrying them almost off their feet  we are on the ice and no mistake cried dick after a while  see the wind has blown the snow completely away  he was right  all around them was the ice dark and exceedingly slippery  they seemed to be in the midst of a great field of it  i dont know where i am now said jack wumble  we are lost  lost echoed sam  thats the truth of it sam replied dick  we are lost right out here on this ice  but sublers stores  i havent the least idea in what direction they are  but if we follow the wind  the wind seems to be changing  just watch it  dick was right the wind was shifting first in one direction then in another  if we stay out here well be frozen stiff said tom  as he could not move around he felt the cold more than did the others  let us follow the windit is bound to bring us somewhere and that is better than staying here said dick finally  for the want of something better to suggest the others agreed and on they went once more dragging tom and their few traps and stores behind them  thus another hour passed  by this time they were so exhausted they could scarcely stand  they staggered onward until sam fell  he was so weak the others had to assist him to arise  im all in gasped the youngest rover  you go on and save yourselves  and leave you cried dick  never  sam you know me better than that he added reproachfully  but dick ii cant walk another step  then sit on the drag with tom  but you and wumble  well pull ye somehow said the old miner grimly  we ought to be gittin somewhar soon  it was now dark once more and snowing again  the wind had gone down a trifle but it still carried them forward first in one direction and then another  presently the drag hit a series of rocks covered with ice and snow over it went sending tom and sam sprawling  dick and wumble also fell for the way had suddenly grown uneven  i think we are near the shore now said wumble  them rocks wouldnt be likely to be out in the middle o the lake  i think i see something cried dick  over yonder  with caution they advanced and at last made out a small building located between a number of large rocks  all around the building was snow and ice  a light cried jack wumble  somebody is thar  this is the best news yet  he stumbled through the snow and over the ice and rocks until he reached the door of the cabin  he pounded loudly on the portal  who is there demanded a rough voice from within  friends answered the old miner  let us inwe are most frozen to death  who are you went on the voice from inside the cabin  be careful now i am armed  cautiously the door to the cabin was opened and a very old man appeared  he was armed with a shotgun which he pointed at those outside  i cant see ye he said slowly  come a bit closer but not too clost until i make sure who ye are  why its tony bings fairly shouted jack wumble  how are ye tony dont ye know me  jack wumble cried the old man  how in the name o fate did you git here  and he lowered his gun and opened wide the door of the cabin for the old miner to enter     chapter xxviii  at tony bingss cabin  tony bings was an old miner who had spent several years in colorado working close to jack wumble  the two knew each other well and were warm friends  come right in said tony bings when matters had been explained to him  its a wonder ye aint friz stiff in sech a wind  its been ablowin great guns  once or twice i thought the cabin was goin over  tom was brought in and sam followed and both were placed near the sheet iron stove of which tony bingss cabin boasted  then the old miner bustled about to get the whole party something to eat and to drink  ive got slathers o stores he told jack wumble in answer to a question on that point  got a good supply in durin the summer  i was out here last winter an come near starvin to deth an i made up my mind it shouldnt happen agin  so eat yer fill an welcome  well pay for all we use tony answered wumble  these chaps with me are rich he added in a whisper  at first i thought it might be some goodfer nuthin fellers from up the mountains went on tony bings  once in a while they come here and git things an dont pay for em  if they come agin ill shoot em he went on with determination  he listened with interest to the story the others had to relate and was not surprised when he learned how the old hut had been tossed over by the tornado and carried along on the ice  he said his own shelter was protected by the rocks around it and also by the heavy stones which he had placed on the roof  all of the newcomers were so exhausted that after eating their fill they were glad enough to lie down and rest  tony bings told them not to worrythat he would stay awake to tend the fire and watch out generally  you aint nowhere near sublers stores he told dick  you got off the track entirely  instead of going towards dawson youve been goin away from it  all of the boys and jack wumble slept soundly that night  tony bings did not arouse them and consequently it was long past daylight when they opened their eyes  when dick came to the window of the cabin to look out he uttered a cry of surprise  the sun was shining and all around could be seen immense stretches of ice and snow  it looked as if they were in the midst of desolation  what a change from a week ago he said to sam  a fellow could hardly believe it dick was the reply  how do you feel went on the big brother  all right only somewhat stiff  tom was still asleep  when he awoke the brothers were worried to see that he did not seem to be as clear in his mind as he had been the day before  where is ike furner he asked suddenly  say ive got to be on my way if i am going to get those nuggets of gold  tom take it easy begged dick  dont you remember me  and he looked his brother full in the eyes  sure i know you dick was the wondering answer  why do you ask me such a question  let me see what was i saying  tom put his hand to his forehead  hang it all its slipped my mind entirely he groaned  never mind tom let it go  you just think of sam and me and the folks at home  and dont forget nellie dick added in a whisper  nellie gasped the sufferer  oh yes nellie  as if i could ever forget her  say dick how soon will i see her do you suppose  ill send for her as soon as we get home tom  and when will that be  oh not so very long  now do keep quiet  and dont think of anything but just home and nellie he added pleadingly  all right ill do just as you want me to returned tom and then laid back and was silent  sam had listened to what was going on and now he and dick walked to the far end of the cabin to talk in whispers  he isnt over it yet sam  and it almost looks as if he never would get over it that is altogether  dicks face showed his deep concern  oh dick dont say that  hes got to get over it  oh if only we could get some first class doctor to do something  well weve got to get to some city firstdawson or some other place  here is news cried jack wumble coming forward at that instant tony tells me that there will be a party going through to dawson inside of a week or ten days  he advises that we wait till they go and go with em  it will be much safer said tony bings its a fearful journey alonein sech weather  who are those folks who are going asked dick  one of the men who run the yukon supply depot at crovet twentyfour miles from here  he will come along with four or five of his helpers and most likely a dog train and he always stops here  that will be all rightbut a week or ten daysthats a long time to wait and dick sighed  after that tony bings told his story how he had come to that neighborhood and struck it rich as he confided to jack wumble  he was very enthusiastic about the diggings back of his cabin and in the end got wumble to promise to join him in his hunt for gold in the spring  ive heard o sech cases he told the boys after learning about toms trouble  its too bad  i sure do hope your brother will git over it  it aint nice to have a crazy pusson in the family  after that several days went by slowly  at times tom seemed to improve and then he would sink back sometimes becoming quite wild so the others had to watch him closely  but he grew stronger physically which was something to be thankful for  on the third day it started to snow again and this kept up for twentyfour hours  it was as cold as ever and the sheet iron stove was kept almost red hot so that the party and especially tom might not take cold  on the next morning much to the surprise of everybody tom got up and insisted on walking around the cabin  i feel almost well he told his brothers  but id give a good deal to be home  that afternoon came a great shouting and the cracking of whips outside the cabin  at once tony bingss face lit up  its the men from the supply depot he cried  i reckon its schmidt  hello in dare was the cry  vos you alife alretty tony  vy cant you oben der door und let a feller in aint it  hello gus answered the owner of the cabin and threw open the door and in bustled a big fat german heavily clad and wearing thick gloves and earwarmers  the newcomer stared in astonishment at the rovers and jack wumble  sure und i tidnt know you vos have combany tony said gus schmidt  my friends said the old miner and introduced them  tell yer men to come in and welcome he went on and schmidt went to the door and called to three men who were with him  they drove up with several dog teams which they were taking to dawson for supplies that had come up to that city by way of the yukon river  gus schmidt despite his rather uncouth manner was a wholesouled man and dick and the others took to him at once  he listened gravely to the story they had to tell and readily agreed to take the rovers and jack wumble with him  wumble was invited by tony bings to remain at the cabin for the winter but said he would first see the rovers as far as dawson and visit his own claim and then would return with schmidts party  of the newcomers one was a german like schmidt and the other two were canadians  the latter knew all about the dogs and dog sleds managing the rather savage animals with scarcely an effort  the dogs had originally belonged to some alaskan indians and had cost the owners of the supply depot considerable money  the start for dawson so many miles away was made on the following morning  the boys and jack wumble shook hands with tony bings who refused point blank to accept any money for what he had done for them tom was placed on one of the best of the big sleds and made as comfortable as circumstances permitted  all apoardt cried gus schmidt gaily and cracked the long whip he carried  the canadians understood and cracked their own whips and away went the whole party over the fields of ice and snow in the direction of dawson     chapter xxix  toms wild ride  talk about fields of ice dick  just look around us  it was sam who spoke  the party had come to a halt for the midday meal  they had stopped in the shelter of some big rocks now thickly covered with snow and ice  snow and ice were on all sidesthe latter glistening brightly in the sunshine  it was a wonderful transformation from the green and brown that had decked the landscape before winter had set in so suddenly  id hate to be out in this alone remarked the big brother  a fellow could get lost without half trying  dick what do you think of tom went on sam in a lower tone  hes in a bad way again sam was the reply  poor fellow  if only we had him where we could place him under the care of some good doctor some specialist  that is what he needs  tom was indeed in a bad way  all morning he had talked in a rambling fashion to himself and to the others around him  the canadians were getting afraid of him and the germans shrugged their shoulders  i dink he besser peen in an asylum aint it said gus schmidt  a feller cant vos dell vot such a feller vos going to do next alretty  well have to watch him had been dicks answer  one of the canadians was preparing dinner aided by one of the germans to show that they did not wish to shirk any camp duties sam and dick did what they could to assist  the dogs and the sleds were off to one side  tom sat on one sled wrapped in heavy blankets for it was still very cold  suddenly there came a wild shout from the canadian who was doing the cooking  with a saucepan he pointed to the dogs and sleds  all of the others gazed in that direction and sam and dick set up a cry of alarm  and well they might for the sight that met their eyes filled them with fear  in some way tom had gotten one of the sleds with its dogs away from the others and jumped aboard  with a crack of a whip he was off standing on the sled and yelling like a demon  tom  tom  stop screamed dick and sam in unison  come back here  im off for gold  nuggets of gold yelled the one who was not right in his mind  dont you dare to follow me  off for gold  gold gold  and then the sled with its rider passed out of hearing the dogs doing their best urged on by the continued cracking of the long whip  we must catch him said dick  quick before he gets out of sight over some hill or around some rocks  he has der pest sled und der pest dogs groaned gus schmidt  i said ve must keep an eye on him yah  of he busts dot sled somepody got to pay for him  well pay never fear answered sam  but we must catch him  we dont want him to get hurt  you come mit me said the leader of the outfit motioning to dick it aint no use for all of us to go after him  de udders da stay right here  ludvig you hear  yah came from the other german and he nodded his head  in a few minutes gus schmidt had one of the other dog teams ready for use  he was about to jump on the sled when he paused  besser ve took somedings along he suggested  somedings to eat und to trink hey  und some plankets yah and he commenced to haul over the packs  why do you think the chase will be a long one asked dick anxiously  i cant vos tell dot  mebbe him peen long  dem vos schmart togs i tole you dot  a pack containing food and blankets was hastily thrown together and strapped to the sled  then dick was assigned a place and gus schmidt hopped aboard  of ve tont got back tonight go on to riss rifer he directed the others  goodby dick and good luck called out sam and jack wumble waved his hand  you take care of yourself sam was the brothers parting caution  the dog sleds had done some fairly fast traveling before but the rate of speed now set by gus schmidt almost took away dicks breath  on and on bounded the sled the dogs yelping wildly at first but then settling down to a steady pace  up one hill awl down another they dashed sending the loose snow flying in all directions  soon the camp was left out of sight even the smoke gradually disappearing from view  tom and his outfit were nowhere to be seen having long since passed over a hill to the northward  gus schmidt had however noted the direction with care  he had noted too that the runaway had taken a somewhat curved course and now he attempted to catch him by taking a straight route for the same point  for over an hour the chase kept up and then reaching the top of a long hill they saw far to the northward a dog sled moving to the eastward  i dink i got him now cried gus schmidt and once more he cracked his long whip and again his team bounded forward  quarter of an hour passed and they drew closer to the other team and then both the german and dick set up a cry of dismay  it was not the sled on which tom had run away  the dogs were different and on the sled sat two men strangers  yes we saw the sled you are after said one of the men when the others had come up and put a question to him and his companion  it passed us going like the wind and the driver yelling like a madman  and how was it headed  about due north answered the other man on the sled  and then he and his companion moved forward again  i dink ve haf to go pack und look for der tracks said gus schmidt too pad dot vosnt our sled aint it  the team was turned back and for the best part of half an hour they looked for the missing trail  at last it was discovered and once more they moved rapidly forward this time due north  fortunately there was little wind otherwise dick could not have stood that long and wild ride  as it was he felt chilled to the bone and his feet were like two lumps of ice  gus schmidt must have surmised this for presently he stopped the sled and motioned to the youth  ve git off und rundt a leetle  it vos do us goot he remarked and swung himself down on the icy snow  dick followed so stiff at first that he could scarcely put one foot before the other  they set off on a walk the dogs pulling them and gradually increased their speed to a run  then dick felt better  all through the afternoon the chase kept up  they saw nothing of tom but the track he had left was a plain one and to that they stuck closely  at last it grew so dark that they could see the track but indistinctly they had to reduce their speed to a walk for fear of turning off  he ought to be stopping for the night said dick  such a feller might not sthop at all answered the german  he might go on und on bis der togs trop dead yah  finally gus schmidt came to a halt and announced that they must go into camp for the night  the dogs needed the rest  they could continue the chase at the first sign of dawn  do you know where we are asked dick  out in der ice und snow dot ist all i know said the german  i nefer vos here pefore  if we are not lost we are next door to it murmured dick  they had brought along a little tent and sleeping bags and after supper made themselves as comfortable as possible  the dogs had been fed and they snapped and snarled over the bones thrown to them  only once during the night were dick and his companion disturbed  from a distance came a yelping which the dogs at once answered  what is that asked the youth sitting up  not the dogs of the other sled  nein dot vos foxes answered gus schmidt  tont podder mit dem da tont come hereda vos afraid of ter dogs  and he turned over to go to sleep again  dick could not sleep with any kind of comfort  he was utterly exhausted yet his mind was continually on tom  what was his poor brother doing all by himself amid that desolation of ice and snow  at daybreak they were on the way again  the sun had come up but soon it was hidden by a heavy bank of clouds and then the snowflakes commenced to fall  dot ist pad said gus schmidt shaking his head  you mean it will wipe out the trail said dick  yahder drail to find your prudder und der drail for us to git pack py  maype ve besser go pack now  no no dont turn back  please dont go back pleaded dick  he cant be so very far ahead of us  we are sure to catch up to him in a very short while now  if we  dick did not finish for a strange sight ahead caught his eye  coming towards them was a dog team on a gallop  behind the team was an overturned sled empty     chapter xxx  goodbye to alaskaconclusion  is that your sled  yah  vait i vos sthop dem yelled gus schmidt and with a dexterity that was really marvelous he turned his own team about and in a few seconds was traveling after the runaways  wait  im going to get off  to look for my brother cried dick and as the german slackened his speed for a few seconds the oldest rover boy sprang out in the snow  he went sprawling but was not injured almost before he knew it the two sleds had disappeared and he was left alone  all around him were the vast and mysterious fields of ice and snow far off he could hear the barking of the dogs but this soon died out and then came utter silencea silence that seemed to fairly weigh him down  and now the snow started to come down harder than ever  had dick rover been less stouthearted than he was he would have then and there given up the hunt for his brother  but dick had the stuff of a real hero in him and he went forward through the snow bending low to escape the wind and to keep his eyes on that slowly disappearing trail  thus half an hour went by and by that time weighed down as he was by his heavy clothing and heavy footwear dick was wellnigh exhausted he stopped to rest and to get his breath and then struck with a sudden idea let out that old familiar locomotive whistle of putnam hall fame  he waited for a few seconds and then whistled once more  was he mistaken or did an answering whistle sound out  he could not tell he set his face grimly and trudged on  at last he could see the trail no longer and then he realized the truth of the terrible situation  he was lost on this vast field of ice and snow  and tom somewhere ahead must be lost too  it was a thought to make the stoutest heart quake  but dick did not think of himself  he was thinking only of his brother  how could he locate tom and save him from the cold and from starvation  ive got to do it he told himself over and over again  ive got to do it  i must  i must  on and on he plunged and suddenly went sprawling over some object half hidden in the falling snow  he felt around and realized that he had come upon the two packs that had been on the sled tom had taken  if they fell off here maybe tom fell off too he told himself  and then he commenced to search the vicinity carefully  it was well that he did this otherwise he might have missed poor tom who lay in a slight hollow partly covered with snow  the sled had hit a rock and the poor youth had been flung out with great force landing on one shoulder and on his head  tom  tom  are you alive  answer me cried dick as he raised his brother in his arms  but no reply came from toms lips  he was unconscious  with all the strength that remained to him dick carried his brother to the spot where he had found the traps  then he quickly undid the bundles to see if there was anything there he might use  he found a tiny oil stove filled with oil and lit it and then rolled tom in two blankets and gave him something hot to drink  then he found a stick of wood soaked it well in oil and set it up in the ice as a torch  all this while tom lay like a log  he was breathing heavily but he did not open his eyes or speak  evidently the shock had been a heavy one  dick did not know but what some of his brothers bones might be broken  an anxious hour went by and in that time dick did all he could for tom who still laid in a stupor  then came a shout and gus schmidt appeared driving his dog team and with the runaway team also in harness  behind the first sled was the secondthe one tom had taken  so you got your brudder hey said the german  how vos he  in bad shape im afraid answered dick soberly  i guess the dogs ran away and pitched him overboard  i dink you vos right und da drow dem dings oferpoard doo and schmidt pointed to the traps  veil its goot ve got der draps und er sled pack  can we get back to the others tonight  nein it was too dark und cold  ve go in der morning to riss rifer maybe dare you got a doctor yah  so it was settled and the german proceeded to make himself and the others as comfortable as possible  he prepared something to eat and suggested that tom be given a little broth made out of some dried meat  this was done and presently the sufferer opened his eyes and tried to sit up  whewhere in ththe world am i he asked in a faint voice  tom youre all right answered his brother soothingly  do you know me  why of course i know you came the wondering answer  what happened to me dick  you ran off with a dog sled and got a nasty tumble  a dog sled  dick you are stringing me  whos got a dog sled around brill  never mind tom just keep quiet  youre very sick  just rest yourself  all right  tom heaved a deep sigh  gosh  i do feel pretty bad he added  he had tried to sit up but now fell back exhausted  it was a night never to be forgotten  the german snored peacefully but dick did not close his eyes  he watched tom closely to do all he could for his brother and make certain that the sufferer should not get away again  during the night it stopped snowing and in the morning the sun came out as brightly as ever  dick was astir early and was gratified to see that tom was sleeping peacefully  they did not awaken the sufferer until gus schmidt announced himself ready to move on  tom was still very weak but dick was gratified to see that he appeared to be in his right mind and his eyes were brighter than they had been in many a day  i cant understand this he said when he was bundled up and placed on one of the sleds  i feel as if i had had some awful dream  so you have had tom was dicks reply  and i want you to be careful so that that awful dream doesnt come back  but where are we dick  in alaska tom  now do keep quiet please  alaska  well i never murmured the sufferer  and i thought we were near brill or the farm  the two boys occupied the rear sled with one of the bundles while gus schmidt did the driving from the other sled and carried the rest of the traps  on and on they went mile after mile the german driving the dogs with great skill  they passed over hill after hill and over vast expanses of ice and snow  at noon they rested half an hour for lunch tom tried to stand up but was too weak  its no use dick he said  im about as strong as a bowl of mush i guess i need about a months rest  and you are going to get it tom as soon as we can get home replied his brother  but i dont understand how i got here went on the sufferer in perplexity  ill tell you all about it some day tom  but now you must keep quiet  wont you just to please me  sureanything you say dick  i know something is wrong somewhere but ill leave it all to you  late that evening they reached the riss river a small stream flowing into the mighty yukon  they passed along the river bank until they reached a settlement known as boyers  here they found sam and the others of the expedition  so yer got tom cried jack wumble  good enough  and how is he questioned sam anxiously  hes been hurt sam  but i think he is brighter in his mind than ever answered dick  the rovers found a great bustle and confusion going on at boyers depot due to the fact that a steamer coming down the river from dawson was due the next morning  it was to be the last vessel to pass that way until spring  where is that steamer bound for asked dick of the man who had charge of the depot  san francisco  can we secure passage on her do you think  i reckon so  travel is light this time of year  that boat is going to have some trouble getting through the ice though  well risk thatif only they will take us on board  the party was made as comfortable as possible at boyers sharing various bunks in a cabin that chanced to be deserted  dick settled up with gus schmidt stating he would not go on to dawson if he could secure passage on the steamer  at last the vessel came in and after the general hubub was over dick inquired about accommodations  pretty full but i think we can stow you away somewhere said the purser  i dont care what sort of accommodations we have so long as my brother gets a stateroom went on dick  he isnt very well  bring your baggage aboard and ill fix you up somehow later on  the boys went aboard the steamer and there bid farewell to jack wumble they had left some things at dawson and these they turned over on a written order to the old miner telling him to do as he pleased with them  goodbye to ye cried wumble on parting  an good luck he added and shook hands all around  after the rough experiences in the wilds of alaska the boys felt quite at home on the big steamer  the purser managed to find a large stateroom for them containing three berths  and what was even better he introduced dick and sam to a doctor who chanced to be on board  the physician was a man of experience who lived in san francisco and he readily agreed to take tom under his care and do all he could for the sufferer  i think all he needs is restabsolute rest said the doctor after an examination  he ought not to go to college againat least not for a year or two  its hard to keep him quiet doctorhe has always been such a lively fellowthe liveliest boy in our family said dick  well then let him travel  anything to keep his mind from his books and from himself  the voyage down the mighty yukon to bering sea and the pacific ocean was a long and tedious one to dick and sam  for several days the steamer had a hard time of it crushing her way through the ice which was rapidly forming  in a few days more navigation would be completely closed so far as that portion of our globe was concerned  we got out just in time said dick to sam when the yukon was at last left behind and they saw ahead of them the blue waters of bering sea  the trip on the ocean seemed to do tom a world of good  daily he grew stronger until he could walk on deck  the doctor attended him from time to time but gave the sufferer little medicine  as soon as it was possible to do so dick sent a wireless message ashore to be relayed to the farm telling the folks that tom was safe and that all hands would soon be back at valley brook  this message was also sent by way of the farm to mrs stanhope and dora and to the girls at hope  my gracious what adventures we have had on this trip remarked sam to dick as the steamer was headed for the golden gate the entrance to san francisco harbor  right you are sam was the reply  i dont think well have any more so strenuous  but dick was mistaken  more adventures were still in store for the rovers and what some of them were will be related in the next volume of this series to be entitled the rover boys in business or the search for the missing bonds  on the arrival at san francisco it was deemed advisable by the doctor that tom rest for a few days at a hotel before starting on the trip for home  toms mind now seemed to be as clear as ever and all his weakness was physical  one day when dick was reading a local newspaper he chanced on a paragraph that instantly arrested his attention  he read it carefully and then sought out sam  look here he cried  here is news about that lady on the train who lost her handbag with jewelry in it worth ten thousand dollars  what about it asked sam with interest  she didnt lose it at all it seems  her mother who was with her took it and absentmindedly hid it in their berth  there a porter found it and turned it over to the railroad company  well that clears tom of that said sam with a sigh of relief  but what of hiram duffs money and jewelry  that still remains to be found out sam  i guess tom took itbut of course he didnt know what he was doing  you cant count such a thing a crime when a fellow is out of his mind  in the end it may be as well to state here this mystery was never fully explained  but the rover family paid the old miser for his loss and for what he had suffered in being locked down in his cellar and there the matter was dropped  tom stood the journey to valley brook better than expected  at the oak run railroad station the family touring car was drawn up with jack ness the hired man in charge  the boys father was there to greet them  my boys  my boys he said and the tears stood in his eyes  then he folded poor tom in his arms and led him to the touring car  and there a surprise awaited the sufferer  nellie was there having arrived the day before from hope  i just had to come she said and then she caught tom and held him tightly  the tears were streaming down her cheeks and the others had to turn away  oh tom  tom she murmured over and over again  oh nellie dont make such a fuss  im not worth it murmured tom but nevertheless he looked greatly pleased  ive had aan awfuldream he went on slowly  but imwell im not going to dream that way againnot if i can help it  and he gave her a look that thrilled her through and through  there was another warm welcome when the touring car reached the farm uncle randolph and aunt martha were on the piazza to meet the boys aunt martha shed tears over tom just as nellie had done but they were tears of joy and nobody minded them  uncle randolph shook hands and told them all to come in out of the cold and rubbed his own hands together in great satisfaction  home again murmured tom when he stood in the great hallway  he gave a deep sniff  and a good dinner  aunt martha you know how to make us feel comfortable dont you  he gave her one of his oldtime hugs  his eyes were as clear as they had ever been  evidently he was fast becoming the tom of old  his running away from brill and his trip to alaska were but a horrible uncertain nightmare to him  he did not want to remember those days and they were best forgotten  and how do you feel dad asked dick as soon as he could get the chance  better than in many a day returned anderson rover  and what is the news from new york  everything is going along well  we have those brokers just where we want them  good  that is what i like to hear and dicks face showed his satisfaction  ive got more news dick that you will like to hear said his father with a faint smile  what is that  dora telegraphed that she would be here tonight  fine  well we certainly had a great trip said sam when the whole family and nellie were gathered around the dining table  but i dont know as i want to take it over again  hardly returned his big brother     the end     famous rover boys series  by arthur m winfield  edward stratemeyer  over three million copies sold of this series  uniform
