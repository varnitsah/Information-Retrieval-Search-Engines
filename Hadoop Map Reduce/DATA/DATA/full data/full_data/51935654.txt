51935654	a bundle of letters by henry james   chapter i   from miss miranda mope in paris to mrs abraham c mope at bangor maine  september 5th 1879  my dear motheri have kept you posted as far as tuesday week last and although my letter will not have reached you yet i will begin another before my news accumulates too much  i am glad you show my letters round in the family for i like them all to know what i am doing and i cant write to every one though i try to answer all reasonable expectations but there are a great many unreasonable ones as i suppose you knownot yours dear mother for i am bound to say that you never required of me more than was natural  you see you are reaping your reward i write to you before i write to any one else  there is one thing i hopethat you dont show any of my letters to william platt  if he wants to see any of my letters he knows the right way to go to work  i wouldnt have him see one of these letters written for circulation in the family for anything in the world  if he wants one for himself he has got to write to me first  let him write to me first and then i will see about answering him  you can show him this if you like but if you show him anything more i will never write to you again  i told you in my last about my farewell to england my crossing the channel and my first impressions of paris  i have thought a great deal about that lovely england since i left it and all the famous historic scenes i visited but i have come to the conclusion that it is not a country in which i should care to reside  the position of woman does not seem to me at all satisfactory and that is a point you know on which i feel very strongly  it seems to me that in england they play a very fadedout part and those with whom i conversed had a kind of depressed and humiliated tone a little dull tame look as if they were used to being snubbed and bullied which made me want to give them a good shaking  there are a great many peopleand a great many things tooover here that i should like to perform that operation upon  i should like to shake the starch out of some of them and the dust out of the others  i know fifty girls in bangor that come much more up to my notion of the stand a truly noble woman should take than those young ladies in england  but they had a most lovely way of speaking in england and the men are remarkably handsome  you can show this to william platt if you like  i gave you my first impressions of paris which quite came up to my expectations much as i had heard and read about it  the objects of interest are extremely numerous and the climate is remarkably cheerful and sunny  i should say the position of woman here was considerably higher though by no means coming up to the american standard  the manners of the people are in some respects extremely peculiar and i feel at last that i am indeed in foreign parts  it is however a truly elegant city very superior to new york and i have spent a great deal of time in visiting the various monuments and palaces  i wont give you an account of all my wanderings though i have been most indefatigable for i am keeping as i told you before a most exhaustive journal which i will allow you the privilege of reading on my return to bangor i am getting on remarkably well and i must say i am sometimes surprised at my universal good fortune  it only shows what a little energy and commonsense will accomplish  i have discovered none of these objections to a young lady travelling in europe by herself of which we heard so much before i left and i dont expect i ever shall for i certainly dont mean to look for them  i know what i want and i always manage to get it  i have received a great deal of politenesssome of it really most pressing and i have experienced no drawbacks whatever  i have made a great many pleasant acquaintances in travelling round both ladies and gentlemen and had a great many most interesting talks  i have collected a great deal of information for which i refer you to my journal  i assure you my journal is going to be a splendid thing  i do just exactly as i do in bangor and i find i do perfectly right and at any rate i dont care if i dont  i didnt come to europe to lead a merely conventional life i could do that at bangor  you know i never would do it at bangor so it isnt likely i am going to make myself miserable over here  so long as i accomplish what i desire and make my money hold out i shall regard the thing as a success  sometimes i feel rather lonely especially in the evening but i generally manage to interest myself in something or in some one  in the evening i usually read up about the objects of interest i have visited during the day or i post up my journal  sometimes i go to the theatre or else i play the piano in the public parlour  the public parlour at the hotel isnt much but the piano is better than that fearful old thing at the sebago house sometimes i go downstairs and talk to the lady who keeps the booksa french lady who is remarkably polite  she is very pretty and always wears a black dress with the most beautiful fit she speaks a little english she tells me she had to learn it in order to converse with the americans who come in such numbers to this hotel  she has given me a great deal of information about the position of woman in france and much of it is very encouraging  but she has told me at the same time some things that i should not like to write to you i am hesitating even about putting them into my journal especially if my letters are to be handed round in the family  i assure you they appear to talk about things here that we never think of mentioning at bangor or even of thinking about she seems to think she can tell me everything because i told her i was travelling for general culture  well i do want to know so much that it seems sometimes as if i wanted to know everything and yet there are some things that i think i dont want to know  but as a general thing everything is intensely interesting i dont mean only everything that this french lady tells me but everything i see and hear for myself  i feel really as if i should gain all i desire  i meet a great many americans who as a general thing i must say are not as polite to me as the people over here  the people over hereespecially the gentlemenare much more what i should call attentive  i dont know whether americans are more sincere i havent yet made up my mind about that  the only drawback i experience is when americans sometimes express surprise that i should be travelling round alone so you see it doesnt come from europeans  i always have my answer ready for general culture to acquire the languages and to see europe for myself and that generally seems to satisfy them  dear mother my money holds out very well and it is real interesting     chapter ii   from the same to the same  september 16th  since i last wrote to you i have left that hotel and come to live in a french family  its a kind of boardinghouse combined with a kind of school only its not like an american hoardinghouse nor like an american school either  there are four or five people here that have come to learn the languagenot to take lessons but to have an opportunity for conversation  i was very glad to come to such a place for i had begun to realise that i was not making much progress with the french  it seemed to me that i should feel ashamed to have spent two months in paris and not to have acquired more insight into the language i had always heard so much of french conversation and i found i was having no more opportunity to practise it than if i had remained at bangor  in fact i used to hear a great deal more at bangor from those french canadians that came down to cut the ice than i saw i should ever hear at that hotel  the lady that kept the books seemed to want so much to talk to me in english for the sake of practice too i suppose that i couldnt bear to let her know i didnt like it  the chambermaid was irish and all the waiters were german so that i never heard a word of french spoken  i suppose you might hear a great deal in the shops only as i dont buy anythingi prefer to spend my money for purposes of culturei dont have that advantage  i have been thinking some of taking a teacher but i am well acquainted with the grammar already and teachers always keep you bothering over the verbs  i was a good deal troubled for i felt as if i didnt want to go away without having at least got a general idea of french conversation the theatre gives you a good deal of insight and as i told you in my last i go a good deal to places of amusement  i find no difficulty whatever in going to such places alone and am always treated with the politeness which as i told you before i encounter everywhere  i see plenty of other ladies alone mostly french and they generally seem to be enjoying themselves as much as i  but at the theatre every one talks so fast that i can scarcely make out what they say and besides there are a great many vulgar expressions which it is unnecessary to learn  but it was the theatre nevertheless that put me on the track  the very next day after i wrote to you last i went to the palais royal which is one of the principal theatres in paris  it is very small but it is very celebrated and in my guidebook it is marked with two stars which is a sign of importance attached only to firstclass objects of interest but after i had been there half an hour i found i couldnt understand a single word of the play they gabbled it off so fast and they made use of such peculiar expressions  i felt a good deal disappointed and troubledi was afraid i shouldnt gain all i had come for  but while i was thinking it overthinking what i should doi heard two gentlemen talking behind me  it was between the acts and i couldnt help listening to what they said  they were talking english but i guess they were americans  well said one of them it all depends on what you are after  im french thats what im after  well said the other im after art  well said the first im after art too but im after french most  then dear mother i am sorry to say the second one swore a little  he said oh damn french  no i wont damn french said his friend  ill acquire itthats what ill do with it  ill go right into a family  what familyll you go into  into some french family  thats the only way to doto go to some place where you can talk  if youre after art you want to stick to the galleries you want to go right through the louvre room by room you want to take a room a day or something of that sort  but if you want to acquire french the thing is to look out for a family  there are lots of french families here that take you to board and teach you  my second cousinthat young lady i told you aboutshe got in with a crowd like that and they booked her right up in three months  they just took her right in and they talked to her  thats what they do to you they set you right down and they talk at you  youve got to understand them you cant help yourself  that family my cousin was with has moved away somewhere or i should try and get in with them  they were very smart people that family after she left my cousin corresponded with them in french  but i mean to find some other crowd if it takes a lot of trouble  i listened to all this with great interest and when he spoke about his cousin i was on the point of turning around to ask him the address of the family that she was with but the next moment he said they had moved away so i sat still  the other gentleman however didnt seem to be affected in the same way as i was  well he said you may follow up that if you like i mean to follow up the pictures  i dont believe there is ever going to be any considerable demand in the united states for french but i can promise you that in about ten years therell be a big demand for art  and it wont be temporary either  that remark may be very true but i dont care anything about the demand i want to know french for its own sake  i dont want to think i have been all this while without having gained an insight    the very next day i asked the lady who kept the books at the hotel whether she knew of any family that could take me to board and give me the benefit of their conversation  she instantly threw up her hands with several little shrill cries in their french way you know and told me that her dearest friend kept a regular place of that kind  if she had known i was looking out for such a place she would have told me before she had not spoken of it herself because she didnt wish to injure the hotel by being the cause of my going away  she told me this was a charming family who had often received american ladies and others as well who wished to follow up the language and she was sure i should be delighted with them  so she gave me their address and offered to go with me to introduce me  but i was in such a hurry that i went off by myself and i had no trouble in finding these good people  they were delighted to receive me and i was very much pleased with what i saw of them  they seemed to have plenty of conversation and there will be no trouble about that  i came here to stay about three days ago and by this time i have seen a great deal of them  the price of board struck me as rather high but i must remember that a quantity of conversation is thrown in  i have a very pretty little roomwithout any carpet but with seven mirrors two clocks and five curtains  i was rather disappointed after i arrived to find that there are several other americans here for the same purpose as myself  at least there are three americans and two english people and also a german gentleman  i am afraid therefore our conversation will be rather mixed but i have not yet time to judge  i try to talk with madame de maisonrouge all i can she is the lady of the house and the real family consists only of herself and her two daughters  they are all most elegant interesting women and i am sure we shall become intimate friends  i will write you more about them in my next  tell william platt i dont care what he does     chapter iii   from miss violet ray in paris to miss agnes rich in new york  september 21st  we had hardly got here when father received a telegram saying he would have to come right back to new york  it was for something about his businessi dont know exactly what you know i never understand those things never want to  we had just got settled at the hotel in some charming rooms and mother and i as you may imagine were greatly annoyed  father is extremely fussy as you know and his first idea as soon as he found he should have to go back was that we should go back with him  he declared he would never leave us in paris alone and that we must return and come out again  i dont know what he thought would happen to us i suppose he thought we should be too extravagant  its fathers theory that we are always running up bills whereas a little observation would show him that we wear the same old rags for months but father has no observation he has nothing but theories  mother and i however have fortunately a great deal of practice and we succeeded in making him understand that we wouldnt budge from paris and that we would rather be chopped into small pieces than cross that dreadful ocean again  so at last he decided to go back alone and to leave us here for three months  but to show you how fussy he is he refused to let us stay at the hotel and insisted that we should go into a family  i dont know what put such an idea into his head unless it was some advertisement that he saw in one of the american papers that are published here  there are families here who receive american and english people to live with them under the pretence of teaching them french  you may imagine what people they arei mean the families themselves  but the americans who choose this peculiar manner of seeing paris must be actually just as bad  mother and i were horrified and declared that main force should not remove us from the hotel  but father has a way of arriving at his ends which is more efficient than violence  he worries and fusses he nags as we used to say at school and when mother and i are quite worn out his triumph is assured  mother is usually worn out more easily than i and she ends by siding with father so that at last when they combine their forces against poor little me i have to succumb  you should have heard the way father went on about this family plan he talked to every one he saw about it he used to go round to the bankers and talk to the people therethe people in the postoffice he used to try and exchange ideas about it with the waiters at the hotel  he said it would be more safe more respectable more economical that i should perfect my french that mother would learn how a french household is conducted that he should feel more easy and five hundred reasons more they were none of them good but that made no difference  its all humbug his talking about economy when every one knows that business in america has completely recovered that the prostration is all over and that immense fortunes are being made  we have been economising for the last five years and i supposed we came abroad to reap the benefits of it  as for my french it is quite as perfect as i want it to be  i assure you i am often surprised at my own fluency and when i get a little more practice in the genders and the idioms i shall do very well in this respect  to make a long story short however father carried his point as usual mother basely deserted me at the last moment and after holding out alone for three days i told them to do with me what they pleased  father lost three steamers in succession by remaining in paris to argue with me  you know he is like the schoolmaster in goldsmiths deserted villageeen though vanquished he would argue still he and mother went to look at some seventeen families they had got the addresses somewhere while i retired to my sofa and would have nothing to do with it  at last they made arrangements and i was transported to the establishment from which i now write you  i write you from the bosom of a parisian menagefrom the depths of a secondrate boardinghouse  father only left paris after he had seen us what he calls comfortably settled here and had informed madame de maisonrouge the mistress of the establishmentthe head of the family that he wished my french pronunciation especially attended to  the pronunciation as it happens is just what i am most at home in if he had said my genders or my idioms there would have been some sense  but poor father has no tact and this defect is especially marked since he has been in europe  he will be absent however for three months and mother and i shall breathe more freely the situation will be less intense  i must confess that we breathe more freely than i expected in this place where we have been for about a week  i was sure before we came that it would prove to be an establishment of the lowest description but i must say that in this respect i am agreeably disappointed  the french are so clever that they know even how to manage a place of this kind  of course it is very disagreeable to live with strangers but as after all if i were not staying with madame de maisonrouge i should not be living in the faubourg st germain i dont know that from the point of view of exclusiveness it is any great loss to be here  our rooms are very prettily arranged and the table is remarkably good mamma thinks the whole thingthe place and the people the manners and customsvery amusing but mamma is very easily amused  as for me you know all that i ask is to be let alone and not to have peoples society forced upon me  i have never wanted for society of my own choosing and so long as i retain possession of my faculties i dont suppose i ever shall  as i said however the place is very well managed and i succeed in doing as i please which you know is my most cherished pursuit madame de maisonrouge has a great deal of tactmuch more than poor father  she is what they call here a belle femme which means that she is a tall ugly woman with style  she dresses very well and has a great deal of talk but though she is a very good imitation of a lady i never see her behind the dinnertable in the evening smiling and bowing as the people come in and looking all the while at the dishes and the servants without thinking of a dame de comptoir blooming in a corner of a shop or a restaurant  i am sure that in spite of her fine name she was once a dame de comptoir  i am also sure that in spite of her smiles and the pretty things she says to every one she hates us all and would like to murder us  she is a hard clever frenchwoman who would like to amuse herself and enjoy her paris and she must be bored to death at passing all her time in the midst of stupid english people who mumble broken french at her  some day she will poison the soup or the vin rouge but i hope that will not be until after mother and i shall have left her  she has two daughters who except that one is decidedly pretty are meagre imitations of herself  the family for the rest consists altogether of our beloved compatriots and of still more beloved englanders  there is an englishman here with his sister and they seem to be rather nice people he is remarkably handsome but excessively affected and patronising especially to us americans and i hope to have a chance of biting his head off before long  the sister is very pretty and apparently very nice but in costume she is britannia incarnate  there is a very pleasant little frenchmanwhen they are nice they are charmingand a german doctor a big blonde man who looks like a great white bull and two americans besides mother and me  one of them is a young man from bostonan aesthetic young man who talks about its being a real corot day etc and a young womana girl a female i dont know what to call herfrom vermont or minnesota or some such place  this young woman is the most extraordinary specimen of artless yankeeism that i ever encountered she is really too horrible  i have been three times to clementine about your underskirt etc     chapter iv   from louis leverett in paris to harvard tremont in boston  september 25th  my dear harvardi have carried out my plan of which i gave you a hint in my last and i only regret that i should not have done it before  it is human nature after all that is the most interesting thing in the world and it only reveals itself to the truly earnest seeker  there is a want of earnestness in that life of hotels and railroad trains which so many of our countrymen are content to lead in this strange old world and i was distressed to find how far i myself had been led along the dusty beaten track  i had however constantly wanted to turn aside into more unfrequented ways to plunge beneath the surface and see what i should discover  but the opportunity had always been missing somehow i never meet those opportunities that we hear about and read aboutthe things that happen to people in novels and biographies  and yet i am always on the watch to take advantage of any opening that may present itself i am always looking out for experiences for sensationsi might almost say for adventures  the great thing is to live you knowto feel to be conscious of ones possibilities not to pass through life mechanically and insensibly like a letter through the postoffice  there are times my dear harvard when i feel as if i were really capable of everythingcapable de tout as they say hereof the greatest excesses as well as the greatest heroism oh to be able to say that one has livedquon a vecu as they say herethat idea exercises an indefinable attraction for me  you will perhaps reply it is easy to say it but the thing is to make people believe you  and then i dont want any secondhand spurious sensations i want the knowledge that leaves a tracethat leaves strange scars and stains and reveries behind it  but i am afraid i shock you perhaps even frighten you  if you repeat my remarks to any of the west cedar street circle be sure you tone them down as your discretion will suggest  for yourself you will know that i have always had an intense desire to see something of real french life  you are acquainted with my great sympathy with the french with my natural tendency to enter into the french way of looking at life  i sympathise with the artistic temperament i remember you used sometimes to hint to me that you thought my own temperament too artistic i dont think that in boston there is any real sympathy with the artistic temperament we tend to make everything a matter of right and wrong  and in boston one cant liveon ne peut pas vivre as they say here  i dont mean one cant residefor a great many people manage that but one cant live aestheticallyi may almost venture to say sensuously  this is why i have always been so much drawn to the french who are so aesthetic so sensuous  i am so sorry that theophile gautier has passed away i should have liked so much to go and see him and tell him all that i owe him  he was living when i was here before but you know at that time i was travelling with the johnsons who are not aesthetic and who used to make me feel rather ashamed of my artistic temperament  if i had gone to see the great apostle of beauty i should have had to go clandestinelyen cachette as they say here and that is not my nature i like to do everything frankly freely naivement au grand jour  that is the great thingto be free to be frank to be naif doesnt matthew arnold say that somewhereor is it swinburne or pater  when i was with the johnsons everything was superficial and as regards life everything was brought down to the question of right and wrong they were too didactic art should never be didactic and what is life but an art  pater has said that so well somewhere  with the johnsons i am afraid i lost many opportunities the tone was gray and cottony i might almost say woolly  but now as i tell you i have determined to take right hold for myself to look right into european life and judge it without johnsonian prejudices  i have taken up my residence in a french family in a real parisian house  you see i have the courage of my opinions i dont shrink from carrying out my theory that the great thing is to live  you know i have always been intensely interested in balzac who never shrank from the reality and whose almost lurid pictures of parisian life have often haunted me in my wanderings through the old wickedlooking streets on the other side of the river  i am only sorry that my new friendsmy french familydo not live in the old cityau coeur du vieux paris as they say here  they live only in the boulevard haussman which is less picturesque but in spite of this they have a great deal of the balzac tone  madame de maisonrouge belongs to one of the oldest and proudest families in france but she has had reverses which have compelled her to open an establishment in which a limited number of travellers who are weary of the beaten track who have the sense of local colourshe explains it herself she expresses it so wellin short to open a sort of boardinghouse  i dont see why i should not after all use that expression for it is the correlative of the term pension bourgeoise employed by balzac in the pere goriot do you remember the pension bourgeoise of madame vauquer nee de conflans  but this establishment is not at all like that and indeed it is not at all bourgeois there is something distinguished something aristocratic about it  the pension vauquer was dark brown sordid graisseuse but this is in quite a different tone with high clear lightlydraped windows tender subtle almost morbid colours and furniture in elegant studied reedlike lines  madame de maisonrouge reminds me of madame hulotdo you remember la belle madame hulotin les barents pauvres  she has a great charm a little artificial a little fatigued with a little suggestion of hidden things in her life but i have always been sensitive to the charm of fatigue of duplicity  i am rather disappointed i confess in the society i find here it is not so local so characteristic as i could have desired  indeed to tell the truth it is not local at all but on the other hand it is cosmopolitan and there is a great advantage in that  we are french we are english we are american we are german and i believe there are some russians and hungarians expected  i am much interested in the study of national types in comparing contrasting seizing the strong points the weak points the point of view of each  it is interesting to shift ones point of viewto enter into strange exotic ways of looking at life  the american types here are not i am sorry to say so interesting as they might be and excepting myself are exclusively feminine  we are thin my dear harvard we are pale we are sharp  there is something meagre about us our line is wanting in roundness our composition in richness  we lack temperament we dont know how to live nous ne savons pas vivre as they say here  the american temperament is represented putting myself aside and i often think that my temperament is not at all american by a young girl and her mother and another young girl without her motherwithout her mother or any attendant or appendage whatever  these young girls are rather curious types they have a certain interest they have a certain grace but they are disappointing too they dont go far they dont keep all they promise they dont satisfy the imagination  they are cold slim sexless the physique is not generous not abundant it is only the drapery the skirts and furbelows that is i mean in the young lady who has her mother that are abundant  they are very different one of them all elegance all expensiveness with an air of high fashion from new york the other a plain pure cleareyed straightwaisted straightstepping maiden from the heart of new england  and yet they are very much alike toomore alike than they would care to think themselves for they eye each other with cold mistrustful deprecating looks  they are both specimens of the emancipated young american girlpractical positive passionless subtle and knowing as you please either too much or too little  and yet as i say they have a certain stamp a certain grace i like to talk with them to study them  the fair new yorker is sometimes very amusing she asks me if every one in boston talks like meif every one is as intellectual as your poor correspondent  she is for ever throwing boston up at me i cant get rid of boston  the other one rubs it into me too but in a different way she seems to feel about it as a good mahommedan feels toward mecca and regards it as a kind of focus of light for the whole human race  poor little boston what nonsense is talked in thy name  but this new england maiden is in her way a strange type she is travelling all over europe aloneto see it she says for herself  for herself  what can that stiff slim self of hers do with such sights such visions  she looks at everything goes everywhere passes her way with her clear quiet eyes wide open skirting the edge of obscene abysses without suspecting them pushing through brambles without tearing her robe exciting without knowing it the most injurious suspicions and always holding her course passionless stainless fearless charmless  it is a little figure in which after all if you can get the right point of view there is something rather striking  by way of contrast there is a lovely english girl with eyes as shy as violets and a voice as sweet  she has a sweet gainsborough head and a great gainsborough hat with a mighty plume in front of it which makes a shadow over her quiet english eyes  then she has a sagegreen robe mystic wonderful all embroidered with subtle devices and flowers and birds of tender tint very straight and tight in front and adorned behind along the spine with large strange iridescent buttons  the revival of taste of the sense of beauty in england interests me deeply what is there in a simple row of spinal buttons to make one dreamto donnor a rever as they say here  i think that a great aesthetic renascence is at hand and that a great light will be kindled in england for all the world to see  there are spirits there that i should like to commune with i think they would understand me  this gracious english maiden with her clinging robes her amulets and girdles with something quaint and angular in her step her carriage something mediaeval and gothic in the details of her person and dress this lovely evelyn vane isnt it a beautiful name is deeply delightfully picturesque  she is much a womanelle est bien femme as they say here simpler softer rounder richer than the young girls i spoke of just now  not much talka great sweet silence  then the violet eyethe very eye itself seems to blush the great shadowy hat making the brow so quiet the strange clinging clutching pictured raiment  as i say it is a very gracious tender type  she has her brother with her who is a beautiful fairhaired grayeyed young englishman  he is purely objective and he too is very plastic     chapter v   from miranda hope to her mother  september 26th  you must not be frightened at not hearing from me oftener it is not because i am in any trouble but because i am getting on so well  if i were in any trouble i dont think i should write to you i should just keep quiet and see it through myself  but that is not the case at present and if i dont write to you it is because i am so deeply interested over here that i dont seem to find time  it was a real providence that brought me to this house where in spite of all obstacles i am able to do much good work  i wonder how i find the time for all i do but when i think that i have only got a year in europe i feel as if i wouldnt sacrifice a single hour  the obstacles i refer to are the disadvantages i have in learning french there being so many persons around me speaking english and that as you may say in the very bosom of a french family  it seems as if you heard english everywhere but i certainly didnt expect to find it in a place like this  i am not discouraged however and i talk french all i can even with the other english boarders  then i have a lesson every day from miss maisonrouge the elder daughter of the lady of the house and french conversation every evening in the salon from eight to eleven with madame herself and some friends of hers that often come in  her cousin mr verdier a young french gentleman is fortunately staying with her and i make a point of talking with him as much as possible  i have extra private lessons from him and i often go out to walk with him  some night soon he is to accompany me to the opera  we have also a most interesting plan of visiting all the galleries in paris together like most of the french he converses with great fluency and i feel as if i should really gain from him  he is remarkably handsome and extremely politepaying a great many compliments which i am afraid are not always sincere  when i return to bangor i will tell you some of the things he has said to me  i think you will consider them extremely curious and very beautiful in their way  the conversation in the parlour from eight to eleven is often remarkably brilliant and i often wish that you or some of the bangor folks could be there to enjoy it  even though you couldnt understand it i think you would like to hear the way they go on they seem to express so much  i sometimes think that at bangor they dont express enough but it seems as if over there there was less to express  it seems as if at bangor there were things that folks never tried to say but here i have learned from studying french that you have no idea what you can say before you try  at bangor they seem to give it up beforehand they dont make any effort  i dont say this in the least for william platt in particular  i am sure i dont know what they will think of me when i get back  it seems as if over here i had learned to come out with everything  i suppose they will think i am not sincere but isnt it more sincere to come out with things than to conceal them  i have become very good friends with every one in the housethat is you see i am sincere with almost every one  it is the most interesting circle i ever was in  theres a girl here an american that i dont like so much as the rest but that is only because she wont let me  i should like to like her ever so much because she is most lovely and most attractive but she doesnt seem to want to know me or to like me  she comes from new york and she is remarkably pretty with beautiful eyes and the most delicate features she is also remarkably elegantin this respect would bear comparison with any one i have seen over here  but it seems as if she didnt want to recognise me or associate with me as if she wanted to make a difference between us  it is like people they call haughty in books  i have never seen any one like that beforeany one that wanted to make a difference and at first i was right down interested she seemed to me so like a proud young lady in a novel  i kept saying to myself all day haughty haughty and i wished she would keep on so but she did keep on she kept on too long and then i began to feel hurt i couldnt think what i have done and i cant think yet  its as if she had got some idea about me or had heard some one say something  if some girls should behave like that i shouldnt make any account of it but this one is so refined and looks as if she might be so interesting if i once got to know her that i think about it a good deal  i am bound to find out what her reason isfor of course she has got some reason i am right down curious to know  i went up to her to ask her the day before yesterday i thought that was the best way  i told her i wanted to know her better and would like to come and see her in her roomthey tell me she has got a lovely roomand that if she had heard anything against me perhaps she would tell me when i came  but she was more distant than ever and she just turned it off said that she had never heard me mentioned and that her room was too small to receive visitors  i suppose she spoke the truth but i am sure she has got some reason all the same  she has got some idea and i am bound to find out before i go if i have to ask everybody in the house  i am right down curious  i wonder if she doesnt think me refinedor if she had ever heard anything against bangor  i cant think it is that dont you remember when clara barnard went to visit new york three years ago how much attention she received  and you know clara is bangor to the soles of her shoes  ask william plattso long as he isnt a nativeif he doesnt consider clara barnard refined  apropos as they say here of refinement there is another american in the housea gentleman from bostonwho is just crowded with it  his name is mr louis leverett such a beautiful name i think and he is about thirty years old  he is rather small and he looks pretty sick he suffers from some affection of the liver  but his conversation is remarkably interesting and i delight to listen to himhe has such beautiful ideas  i feel as if it were hardly right not being in french but fortunately he uses a great many french expressions  its in a different style from the conversation of mr verdiernot so complimentary but more intellectual  he is intensely fond of pictures and has given me a great many ideas about them which i should never have gained without him i shouldnt have known where to look for such ideas he thinks everything of pictures he thinks we dont make near enough of them  they seem to make a good deal of them here but i couldnt help telling him the other day that in bangor i really dont think we do  if i had any money to spend i would buy some and take them back to hang up  mr leverett says it would do them goodnot the pictures but the bangor folks  he thinks everything of the french too and says we dont make nearly enough of them  i couldnt help telling him the other day that at any rate they make enough of themselves  but it is very interesting to hear him go on about the french and it is so much gain to me so long as that is what i came for  i talk to him as much as i dare about boston but i do feel as if this were right down wronga stolen pleasure  i can get all the boston culture i want when i go back if i carry out my plan my happy vision of going there to reside  i ought to direct all my efforts to european culture now and keep boston to finish off  but it seems as if i couldnt help taking a peep now and then in advancewith a bostonian  i dont know when i may meet one again but if there are many others like mr leverett there i shall be certain not to want when i carry out my dream  he is just as full of culture as he can live  but it seems strange how many different sorts there are  there are two of the english who i suppose are very cultivated too but it doesnt seem as if i could enter into theirs so easily though i try all i can  i do love their way of speaking and sometimes i feel almost as if it would be right to give up trying to learn french and just try to learn to speak our own tongue as these english speak it  it isnt the things they say so much though these are often rather curious but it is in the way they pronounce and the sweetness of their voice  it seems as if they must try a good deal to talk like that but these english that are here dont seem to try at all either to speak or do anything else they are a young lady and her brother  i believe they belong to some noble family  i have had a good deal of intercourse with them because i have felt more free to talk to them than to the americanson account of the language  it seems as if in talking with them i was almost learning a new one  i never supposed when i left bangor that i was coming to europe to learn english  if i do learn it i dont think you will understand me when i get back and i dont think youll like it much  i should be a good deal criticised if i spoke like that at bangor  however i verily believe bangor is the most critical place on earth i have seen nothing like it over here  tell them all i have come to the conclusion that they are a great deal too fastidious  but i was speaking about this english young lady and her brother  i wish i could put them before you  she is lovely to look at she seems so modest and retiring  in spite of this however she dresses in a way that attracts great attention as i couldnt help noticing when one day i went out to walk with her  she was ever so much looked at but she didnt seem to notice it until at last i couldnt help calling attention to it  mr leverett thinks everything of it he calls it the costume of the future  i should call it rather the costume of the pastyou know the english have such an attachment to the past  i said this the other day to madame do maisonrougethat miss vane dressed in the costume of the past  de lan passe vous voulez dire said madame with her little french laugh you can get william platt to translate this he used to tell me he knew so much french  you know i told you in writing some time ago that i had tried to get some insight into the position of woman in england and being here with miss vane it has seemed to me to be a good opportunity to get a little more  i have asked her a great deal about it but she doesnt seem able to give me much information  the first time i asked her she told me the position of a lady depended upon the rank of her father her eldest brother her husband etc  she told me her own position was very good because her father was some relationi forget whatto a lord  she thinks everything of this and that proves to me that the position of woman in her country cannot be satisfactory because if it were it wouldnt depend upon that of your relations even your nearest  i dont know much about lords and it does try my patience though she is just as sweet as she can live to hear her talk as if it were a matter of course that i should  i feel as if it were right to ask her as often as i can if she doesnt consider every one equal but she always says she doesnt and she confesses that she doesnt think she is equal to lady somethingorother who is the wife of that relation of her father  i try and persuade her all i can that she is but it seems as if she didnt want to be persuaded and when i ask her if lady soandso is of the same opinion that miss vane isnt her equal she looks so soft and pretty with her eyes and says of course she is  when i tell her that this is right down bad for lady soandso it seems as if she wouldnt believe me and the only answer she will make is that lady soandso is extremely nice  i dont believe she is nice at all if she were nice she wouldnt have such ideas as that  i tell miss vane that at bangor we think such ideas vulgar but then she looks as though she had never heard of bangor  i often want to shake her though she is so sweet  if she isnt angry with the people who make her feel that way i am angry for her  i am angry with her brother too for she is evidently very much afraid of him and this gives me some further insight into the subject she thinks everything of her brother and thinks it natural that she should be afraid of him not only physically for this is natural as he is enormously tall and strong and has very big fists but morally and intellectually  she seems unable however to take in any argument and she makes me realise what i have often heardthat if you are timid nothing will reason you out of it  mr vane also the brother seems to have the same prejudices and when i tell him as i often think it right to do that his sister is not his subordinate even if she does think so but his equal and perhaps in some respects his superior and that if my brother in bangor were to treat me as he treates this poor young girl who has not spirit enough to see the question in its true light there would be an indignation meeting of the citizens to protest against such an outrage to the sanctity of womanhoodwhen i tell him all this at breakfast or dinner he bursts out laughing so loud that all the plates clatter on the table  but at such a time as this there is always one person who seems interested in what i saya german gentleman a professor who sits next to me at dinner and whom i must tell you more about another time  he is very learned and has a great desire for information he appreciates a great many of my remarks and after dinner in the salon he often comes to me to ask me questions about them  i have to think a little sometimes to know what i did say or what i do think  he takes you right up where you left off and he is almost as fond of discussing things as william platt is  he is splendidly educated in the german style and he told me the other day that he was an intellectual broom well if he is he sweeps clean i told him that  after he has been talking to me i feel as if i hadnt got a speck of dust left in my mind anywhere  its a most delightful feeling  he says hes an observer and i am sure there is plenty over here to observe  but i have told you enough for today  i dont know how much longer i shall stay here i am getting on so fast that it sometimes seems as if i shouldnt need all the time i have laid out  i suppose your cold weather has promptly begun as usual it sometimes makes me envy you  the fall weather here is very dull and damp and i feel very much as if i should like to be braced up     chapter vi   from miss evelyn vane in paris to the lady augusta fleming at brighton  paris september 30th  dear lady augustai am afraid i shall not be able to come to you on january 7th as you kindly proposed at homburg  i am so very very sorry it is a great disappointment to me  but i have just heard that it has been settled that mamma and the children are coming abroad for a part of the winter and mamma wishes me to go with them to hyeres where georgina has been ordered for her lungs  she has not been at all well these three months and now that the damp weather has begun she is very poorly indeed so that last week papa decided to have a consultation and he and mamma went with her up to town and saw some three or four doctors they all of them ordered the south of france but they didnt agree about the place so that mamma herself decided for hyeres because it is the most economical  i believe it is very dull but i hope it will do georgina good  i am afraid however that nothing will do her good until she consents to take more care of herself i am afraid she is very wild and wilful and mamma tells me that all this month it has taken papas positive orders to make her stop indoors  she is very cross mamma writes me about coming abroad and doesnt seem at all to mind the expense that papa has been put totalks very illnaturedly about losing the hunting etc  she expected to begin to hunt in december and wants to know whether anybody keeps hounds at hyeres  fancy a girl wanting to follow the hounds when her lungs are so bad  but i daresay that when she gets there she will he glad enough to keep quiet as they say that the heat is intense  it may cure georgina but i am sure it will make the rest of us very ill  mamma however is only going to bring mary and gus and fred and adelaide abroad with her the others will remain at kingscote until february about the 3d when they will go to eastbourne for a month with miss turnover the new governess who has turned out such a very nice person she is going to take miss travers who has been with us so long but who is only qualified for the younger children to hyeres and i believe some of the kingscote servants  she has perfect confidence in miss t it is only a pity she has such an odd name  mamma thought of asking her if she would mind taking another when she came but papa thought she might object  lady battledown makes all her governesses take the same name she gives 5 pounds more a year for the purpose  i forget what it is she calls them i think its johnson which to me always suggests a ladys maid  governesses shouldnt have too pretty a name they shouldnt have a nicer name than the family  i suppose you heard from the desmonds that i did not go back to england with them  when it began to be talked about that georgina should be taken abroad mamma wrote to me that i had better stop in paris for a month with harold so that she could pick me up on their way to hyeres it saves the expense of my journey to kingscote and back and gives me the opportunity to finish a little in french  you know harold came here six weeks ago to get up his french for those dreadful examinations that he has to pass so soon  he came to live with some french people that take in young men and others for this purpose its a kind of coaching place only kept by women  mamma had heard it was very nice so she wrote to me that i was to come and stop here with harold  the desmonds brought me and made the arrangement or the bargain or whatever you call it  poor harold was naturally not at all pleased but he has been very kind and has treated me like an angel  he is getting on beautifully with his french for though i dont think the place is so good as papa supposed yet harold is so immensely clever that he can scarcely help learning  i am afraid i learn much less but fortunately i have not to pass an examinationexcept if mamma takes it into her head to examine me  but she will have so much to think of with georgina that i hope this wont occur to her  if it does i shall be as harold says in a dreadful funk  this is not such a nice place for a girl as for a young man and the desmonds thought it exceedingly odd that mamma should wish me to come here  as mrs desmond said it is because she is so very unconventional but you know paris is so very amusing and if only harold remains good natured about it i shall be content to wait for the caravan thats what he calls mamma and the children  the person who keeps the establishment or whatever they call it is rather odd and exceedingly foreign but she is wonderfully civil and is perpetually sending to my door to see if i want anything  the servants are not at all like english servants and come bursting in the footman they have only one and the maids alike at all sorts of hours in the most sudden way  then when one rings it is half an hour before they come  all this is very uncomfortable and i daresay it will be worse at hyeres  there however fortunately we shall have our own people  there are some very odd americans here who keep throwing harold into fits of laughter  one is a dreadful little man who is always sitting over the fire and talking about the colour of the sky  i dont believe he ever saw the sky except through the windowpane  the other day he took hold of my frock that green one you thought so nice at homburg and told me that it reminded him of the texture of the devonshire turf  and then he talked for half an hour about the devonshire turf which i thought such a very extraordinary subject  harold says he is mad  it is very strange to be living in this way with people one doesnt know  i mean that one doesnt know as one knows them in england  the other americans beside the madman are two girls about my own age one of whom is rather nice  she has a mother but the mother is always sitting in her bedroom which seems so very odd  i should like mamma to ask them to kingscote but i am afraid mamma wouldnt like the mother who is rather vulgar  the other girl is rather vulgar too and is travelling about quite alone  i think she is a kind of schoolmistress but the other girl i mean the nicer one with the mother tells me she is more respectable than she seems  she has however the most extraordinary opinionswishes to do away with the aristocracy thinks it wrong that arthur should have kingscote when papa dies etc  i dont see what it signifies to her that poor arthur should come into the property which will be so delightfulexcept for papa dying  but harold says she is mad  he chaffs her tremendously about her radicalism and he is so immensely clever that she cant answer him though she is rather clever too  there is also a frenchman a nephew or cousin or something of the person of the house who is extremely nasty and a german professor or doctor who eats with his knife and is a great bore  i am so very sorry about giving up my visit  i am afraid you will never ask me again     chapter vii   from leon verdier in paris to prosper gobain at lille  september 28th  my dear prosperit is a long time since i have given you of my news and i dont know what puts it into my head tonight to recall myself to your affectionate memory  i suppose it is that when we are happy the mind reverts instinctively to those with whom formerly we shared our exaltations and depressions and je teu ai trop dit dans le bon temps mon gros prosper and you always listened to me too imperturbably with your pipe in your mouth your waistcoat unbuttoned for me not to feel that i can count upon your sympathy today  nous en sommes nous flanquees des confidencesin those happy days when my first thought in seeing an adventure poindre a lhorizon was of the pleasure i should have in relating it to the great prosper  as i tell thee i am happy decidedly i am happy and from this affirmation i fancy you can construct the rest  shall i help thee a little  take three adorable girls    three my good prosperthe mystic numberneither more nor less  take them and place thy insatiable little leon in the midst of them  is the situation sufficiently indicated and do you apprehend the motives of my felicity  you expected perhaps i was going to tell you that i had made my fortune or that the uncle blondeau had at last decided to return into the breast of nature after having constituted me his universal legatee but i neednt remind you that women are always for something in the happiness of him who writes to theefor something in his happiness and for a good deal more in his misery  but dont let me talk of misery now time enough when it comes ces demoiselles have gone to join the serried ranks of their amiable predecessors  excuse mei comprehend your impatience  i will tell you of whom ces demoiselles consist  you have heard me speak of my cousine de maisonrouge that grande belle femme who after having married en secondes nocesthere had been to tell the truth some irregularity about her first uniona venerable relic of the old noblesse of poitou was left by the death of her husband complicated by the indulgence of expensive tastes on an income of 17000 francs on the pavement of paris with two little demons of daughters to bring up in the path of virtue  she managed to bring them up my little cousins are rigidly virtuous  if you ask me how she managed it i cant tell you its no business of mine and a fortiori none of yours  she is now fifty years old she confesses to thirtyseven and her daughters whom she has never been able to marry are respectively twentyseven and twentythree they confess to twenty and to seventeen  three years ago she had the thriceblessed idea of opening a sort of pension for the entertainment and instruction of the blundering barbarians who come to paris in the hope of picking up a few stray particles of the language of voltaireor of zola  the idea lui a porte bonheur the shop does a very good business  until within a few months ago it was carried on by my cousins alone but lately the need of a few extensions and embellishments has caused itself to be felt  my cousin has undertaken them regardless of expense she has asked me to come and stay with herboard and lodging gratisand keep an eye on the grammatical eccentricities of her pensionnaires  i am the extension my good prosper i am the embellishment  i live for nothing and i straighten up the accent of the prettiest english lips  the english lips are not all pretty heaven knows but enough of them are so to make it a gaining bargain for me  just now as i told you i am in daily conversation with three separate pairs  the owner of one of them has private lessons she pays extra  my cousin doesnt give me a sou of the money but i make bold nevertheless to say that my trouble is remunerated  but i am well very well with the proprietors of the two other pairs  one of them is a little anglaise of about twentya little figure de keepsake the most adorable miss that you ever or at least that i ever beheld  she is decorated all over with beads and bracelets and embroidered dandelions but her principal decoration consists of the softest little gray eyes in the world which rest upon you with a profundity of confidencea confidence that i really feel some compunction in betraying  she has a tint as white as this sheet of paper except just in the middle of each cheek where it passes into the purest and most transparent most liquid carmine  occasionally this rosy fluid overflows into the rest of her faceby which i mean that she blushesas softly as the mark of your breath on the windowpane  like every anglaise she is rather pinched and prim in public but it is very easy to see that when no one is looking elle ne demande qua se laisser aller  whenever she wants it i am always there and i have given her to understand that she can count upon me  i have reason to believe that she appreciates the assurance though i am bound in honesty to confess that with her the situation is a little less advanced than with the others  que voulezvous  the english are heavy and the anglaises move slowly thats all  the movement however is perceptible and once this fact is established i can let the pottage simmer  i can give her time to arrive for i am overwell occupied with her concurrentes  cellesci dont keep me waiting par exemple  these young ladies are americans and you know that it is the national character to move fast  all rightgo ahead  i am learning a great deal of english or rather a great deal of american  they go ahead at a rate that sometimes makes it difficult for me to keep up  one of them is prettier than the other but this hatter the one that takes the private lessons is really une file prodigieuse  ah par exemple elle brule ses vaisseux cellala  she threw herself into my arms the very first day and i almost owed her a grudge for having deprived me of that pleasure of gradation of carrying the defences one by one which is almost as great as that of entering the place  would you believe that at the end of exactly twelve minutes she gave me a rendezvous  it is true it was in the galerie dapollon at the louvre but that was respectable for a beginning and since then we have had them by the dozen i have ceased to keep the account  non cest une file qui me depasse  the little one she has a mother somewhere out of sight shut up in a closet or a trunk is a good deal prettier and perhaps on that account elle y met plus de facons  she doesnt knock about paris with me by the hour she contents herself with long interviews in the petit salon with the curtains halfdrawn beginning at about three oclock when every one is a la promenade  she is admirable this little one a little too thin the bones rather accentuated but the detail on the whole most satisfactory  and you can say anything to her  she takes the trouble to appear not to understand but her conduct half an hour afterwards reassures you completelyoh completely  however it is the tall one the one of the private lessons that is the most remarkable  these private lessons my good prosper are the most brilliant invention of the age and a real stroke of genius on the part of miss miranda  they also take place in the petit salon but with the doors tightly closed and with explicit directions to every one in the house that we are not to be disturbed  and we are not my good prosper we are not  not a sound not a shadow interrupts our felicity  my cousine is really admirable the shop deserves to succeed  miss miranda is tall and rather flat she is too pale she hasnt the adorable rougeurs of the little anglaise  but she has bright keen inquisitive eyes superb teeth a nose modelled by a sculptor and a way of holding up her head and looking every one in the face which is the most finished piece of impertinence i ever beheld  she is making the tour du monde entirely alone without even a soubrette to carry the ensign for the purpose of seeing for herself a quoi sen tenir sur les hommes et les choseson les hommes particularly  dis donc prosper it must be a drole de pays over there where young persons animated by this ardent curiosity are manufactured  if we should turn the tables some day thou and i and go over and see it for ourselves  it is as well that we should go and find them chez elles as that they should come out here after us  dis donc mon gras prosper        chapter viii   from dr rudolf staub in paris to dr julius hirsch at gottingen  my dear brother in sciencei resume my hasty notes of which i sent you the first instalment some weeks ago  i mentioned then that i intended to leave my hotel not finding it sufficiently local and national  it was kept by a pomeranian and the waiters without exception were from the fatherland  i fancied myself at berlin unter den linden and i reflected that having taken the serious step of visiting the headquarters of the gallic genius i should try and project myself as much as possible into the circumstances which are in part the consequence and in part the cause of its irrepressible activity  it seemed to me that there could be no wellgrounded knowledge without this preliminary operation of placing myself in relations as slightly as possible modified by elements proceeding from a different combination of causes with the spontaneous homelife of the country  i accordingly engaged a room in the house of a lady of pure french extraction and education who supplements the shortcomings of an income insufficient to the evergrowing demands of the parisian system of sense gratification by providing food and lodging for a limited number of distinguished strangers  i should have preferred to have my room alone in the house and to take my meals in a brewery of very good appearance which i speedily discovered in the same street but this arrangement though very lucidly proposed by myself was not acceptable to the mistress of the establishment a woman with a mathematical head and i have consoled myself for the extra expense by fixing my thoughts upon the opportunity that conformity to the customs of the house gives me of studying the tablemanners of my companions and of observing the french nature at a peculiarly physiological moment the moment when the satisfaction of the taste which is the governing quality in its composition produces a kind of exhalation an intellectual transpiration which though light and perhaps invisible to a superficial spectator is nevertheless appreciable by a properly adjusted instrument  i have adjusted my instrument very satisfactorily i mean the one i carry in my good square german head and i am not afraid of losing a single drop of this valuable fluid as it condenses itself upon the plate of my observation  a prepared surface is what i need and i have prepared my surface  unfortunately here also i find the individual native in the minority there are only four french persons in the housethe individuals concerned in its management three of whom are women and one a man  this preponderance of the feminine element is however in itself characteristic as i need not remind you what an abnormallydeveloped part this sex has played in french history  the remaining figure is apparently that of a man but i hesitate to classify him so superficially  he appears to me less human than simian and whenever i hear him talk i seem to myself to have paused in the street to listen to the shrill clatter of a handorgan to which the gambols of a hairy homunculus form an accompaniment  i mentioned to you before that my expectation of rough usage in consequence of my german nationality had proved completely unfounded  no one seems to know or to care what my nationality is and i am treated on the contrary with the civility which is the portion of every traveller who pays the bill without scanning the items too narrowly  this i confess has been something of a surprise to me and i have not yet made up my mind as to the fundamental cause of the anomaly  my determination to take up my abode in a french interior was largely dictated by the supposition that i should be substantially disagreeable to its inmates  i wished to observe the different forms taken by the irritation that i should naturally produce for it is under the influence of irritation that the french character most completely expresses itself  my presence however does not appear to operate as a stimulus and in this respect i am materially disappointed  they treat me as they treat every one else whereas in order to be treated differently i was resigned in advance to be treated worse  i have not as i say fully explained to myself this logical contradiction but this is the explanation to which i tend  the french are so exclusively occupied with the idea of themselves that in spite of the very definite image the german personality presented to them by the war of 1870 they have at present no distinct apprehension of its existence  they are not very sure that there are any germans they have already forgotten the convincing proofs of the fact that were presented to them nine years ago  a german was something disagreeable which they determined to keep out of their conception of things  i therefore think that we are wrong to govern ourselves upon the hypothesis of the revanche the french nature is too shallow for that large and powerful plant to bloom in it  the englishspeaking specimens too i have not been willing to neglect the opportunity to examine and among these i have paid special attention to the american varieties of which i find here several singular examples  the two most remarkable are a young man who presents all the characteristics of a period of national decadence reminding me strongly of some diminutive hellenised roman of the third century  he is an illustration of the period of culture in which the faculty of appreciation has obtained such a preponderance over that of production that the latter sinks into a kind of rank sterility and the mental condition becomes analogous to that of a malarious bog  i learn from him that there is an immense number of americans exactly resembling him and that the city of boston indeed is almost exclusively composed of them he communicated this fact very proudly as if it were greatly to the credit of his native country little perceiving the truly sinister impression it made upon me  what strikes one in it is that it is a phenomenon to the best of my knowledgeand you know what my knowledge isunprecedented and unique in the history of mankind the arrival of a nation at an ultimate stage of evolution without having passed through the mediate one the passage of the fruit in other words from crudity to rottenness without the interposition of a period of useful and ornamental ripeness  with the americans indeed the crudity and the rottenness are identical and simultaneous it is impossible to say as in the conversation of this deplorable young man which is one and which is the other they are inextricably mingled  i prefer the talk of the french homunculus it is at least more amusing  it is interesting in this manner to perceive so largely developed the germs of extinction in the socalled powerful anglosaxon family  i find them in almost as recognisable a form in a young woman from the state of maine in the province of new england with whom i have had a good deal of conversation  she differs somewhat from the young man i just mentioned in that the faculty of production of action is in her less inanimate she has more of the freshness and vigour that we suppose to belong to a young civilisation  but unfortunately she produces nothing but evil and her tastes and habits are similarly those of a roman lady of the lower empire  she makes no secret of them and has in fact elaborated a complete system of licentious behaviour  as the opportunities she finds in her own country do not satisfy her she has come to europe to try as she says for herself  it is the doctrine of universal experience professed with a cynicism that is really most extraordinary and which presenting itself in a young woman of considerable education appears to me to be the judgment of a society  another observation which pushes me to the same inductionthat of the premature vitiation of the american populationis the attitude of the americans whom i have before me with regard to each other  there is another young lady here who is less abnormally developed than the one i have just described but who yet bears the stamp of this peculiar combination of incompleteness and effeteness  these three persons look with the greatest mistrust and aversion upon each other and each has repeatedly taken me apart and assured me secretly that he or she only is the real the genuine the typical american  a type that has lost itself before it has been fixedwhat can you look for from this  add to this that there are two young englanders in the house who hate all the americans in a lump making between them none of the distinctions and favourable comparisons which they insist upon and you will i think hold me warranted in believing that between precipitate decay and internecine enmities the englishspeaking family is destined to consume itself and that with its decline the prospect of general pervasiveness to which i alluded above will brighten for the deeplunged children of the fatherland     chapter ix   miranda hope to her mother  october 22d  dear motheri am off in a day or two to visit some new country i havent yet decided which  i have satisfied myself with regard to france and obtained a good knowledge of the language  i have enjoyed my visit to madame de maisonrouge deeply and feel as if i were leaving a circle of real friends  everything has gone on beautifully up to the end and every one has been as kind and attentive as if i were their own sister especially mr verdier the french gentleman from whom i have gained more than i ever expected in six weeks and with whom i have promised to correspond  so you can imagine me dashing off the most correct french letters and if you dont believe it i will keep the rough draft to show you when i go back  the german gentleman is also more interesting the more you know him it seems sometimes as if i could fairly drink in his ideas  i have found out why the young lady from new york doesnt like me  it is because i said one day at dinner that i admired to go to the louvre  well when i first came it seemed as if i did admire everything  tell william platt his letter has come  i knew he would have to write and i was bound i would make him  i havent decided what country i will visit yet it seems as if there were so many to choose from  but i shall take care to pick out a good one and to meet plenty of fresh experiences  dearest mother my money holds out and it is most interesting
