montrose  to his fatherinlaw james armour mason mauchline  the thomson letters    burnss letters  it is not perhaps generally known that the prose of burns exceeds in quantity his verse the world remembers him as a poet and forgets or overlooks his letters his place among the poets has never been deniedit is in the first rank nor is he lowest though little remembered among letterwriters his letters gave jeffrey a higher opinion of him as a man than did his poetry though on both alike the critic saw the seal and impress of genius dugald stewart thought his letters objects of wonder scarcely less than his poetry and robertson comparing his prose with his verse thought the former the more extraordinary of the two in the popular view of his genius there is however no denying the fact that his poetry has eclipsed his prose  his prose consists mostly of letters but it also includes a noble fragment of autobiography three journals of observations made at mossgiel edinburgh and ellisland respectively two itineraries the one of his border tour the other of his tour in the highlands and historical notes to two collections of scottish songs a full enumeration of his prose productions would take account also of his masonic minutes his inscriptions a rather curious business paper drawn up by the poetexciseman in prosecution of a smuggler and of course his various prefaces notably the dedication of his poems to the members of the caledonian hunt  his letters however far exceed the sum of his otherprose writings close upon five hundred and forty have already been published these are not all the letters he ever wrote where for example is the literary correspondence in which he engaged so enthusiastically with his kirkoswald schoolfellows though i had not three farthings worth of business in the world yet every post brought me as many letters as if i had been a broadplodding son of daybook and ledger where are the letters which brought to the ploughman at lochlie such a constant and copious stream of replies the circumstances of his position will explain why they perished he was then a youth and all unknown to fame it is even doubtful if the five hundred and forty published letters include all the letters of burns that now exist scarcely a year passes but some epistolary scrap in the wellknown handwriting is unearthed and ceremoniously added to the previous sum total and yet notwithstanding losses past or within recall it is probable that we have long had the whole of burnss most characteristic letters it was inevitable that these should be preserved and published his fame was so rooted in the popular regard in his lifetime that a characteristic letter from his hand was sure to be received as something singularly precious it must not be forgotten however that burnss personality was so intense as to colour the smallest fragment of his correspondence and it is on this account desirable that every note he penned that yet remains unpublished should be produced it might give no new feature to our conception of his character but it would help the shadingwhich in the portraiture of any person must chiefly be furnished by the minor and more commonplace actions of his everyday life  the correspondence of burns as we have it commences presumably near the close of his twentysecond year and extends to all but exactly the middle of his thirtyeighth the dates are a day somewhere at the end of 1780 and monday 18th july 1796 between these limits lies the printed correspondence of sixteen years the sum total of this correspondence allows about thirtyfour letters to each year but the actual distribution is very unequal ranging from the minimum in 1782 of one a masonic letter addressed to sir john whitefoord of ballochmyle to the maximum number of ninetytwo in 1788 the great year of the clarinda episode it is in 1786 the year of the publication of his first volume at kilmarnock the year of his literary birth that his correspondence first becomes heavy it rises at a leap from two letters in the preceding year to as many as fortyfour the phenomenal increase is partly explained by the success of his poems he became a man that was worth the knowing whose correspondence was worth preserving the six years of his published correspondence previous to the discovery of his genius in 1786 are represented by only fourteen letters in all but in those years his letters though both numerous and prized above the common were not considered as likely to be of future interest and were therefore suffered to live or die as chance might determine they mostly perished the recipients thinking it hardly worth their while to be sae nice wi robin as to preserve them  after the recognition of his power in 1786 the record of his preserved letters shews for the ten years of his literary life several fluctuations which admit of easy explanation commencing with 1787 the numbers are78 92 54 33 44 31 66 30 27 24 the first of these years was totally severed from rural occupations or business of any kind if we except the publication of the first edinburgh edition of his poems it was a complete holiday year to him he was either resident in edinburgh studying men and manners or touring about the country visiting those places which history song or scenery had made famous wherever he was his fame brought him the acquaintance of a great many new people his leisure and the novelty of his situation afforded him both opportunity and subject for an extensive correspondence for a large part of the next year 1788 he was similarly circumstanced and the number of his letters was exceptionally increased by his entanglement with mrs mlehose to her alone in less than three months of this year he wrote at least thirtysix lettersconsiderably over onethird of the entire epistolary produce of the year in 1789 we find the number of his letters fall to fiftyfour this was perhaps the happiest year of his life he was now comfortably established as a farmer in a home of his own busied with healthy rural work and finding in the happy fireside clime which he was making for wife and weans the true pathos and sublime of human duty he has still however time and inclination to write on the average one letter a week for each of the next three years the average number is thirtysix in 1793 the number suddenly goes up to sixtysix the increase is due to the heartiness with which he took up the scheme of george thomson to popularise and perpetuate the best old scottish airs by fitting them with words worthy of their merits he wrote in this year twentysix letters in support of the scheme  there is a sad falling off in burnss ordinary correspondence in the last three years of his life the amount of it scarcely touches twenty letters per year even the correspondence with thomson though on a subject so dear to the heart of burns rousing at once both his patriotism and his poetry sinks to about ten letters per year and is irregular at that burns was losing hope and health and caring less and less for the worlds favour and the worlds friendships he had lost largely in selfrespect as well as in the respect of friends the loss gave him little heart to write  burnss correspondents as far as we know them numbered over a hundred and fifty persons the number is large and significant neither gray nor cowper nor byron commanded so wide a circle they had not the farreaching sympathies of burns they were all more or less fastidious in their choice of correspondents burns on the contrary was as catholic or as careless in his friendships as his own cæsarwho    wad spend an hour caressin    evn wi a tinkler gipsys messan  he moved freely up and down the whole social scale blind to the imaginary distinctions of blood and title and the extrinsic differences of wealth seeing true superiority in an honest manly heart and bearing himself wherever he found it as an equal and a brother his correspondents were of every social gradepeers and peasants of every intellectual attainmentphilosophers like dugald stewart and simple swains like thomas orr and of almost every variety of calling from professional men of recognised eminence to obscure shopkeepers cottars and tradesmen they include servantgirls gentlewomen and ladies of titled rank country schoolmasters and college professors men of law of all degrees from poor john richmond a plain lawclerk with a lodging in the lawnmarket to the honourable henry erskine dean of the faculty farmers small and large lairds large and small shoemakers and shopkeepers ministers bankers and doctors printers booksellers editors knights earlsnay a duke factors and winemerchants army officers and officers of excise his female correspondents were women of superior intelligence and accomplishments they can lay claim to a large proportion of his letters mrs mclehose takes fortyeight mrs dunlop fortytwo maria riddell eighteen peggy chalmers eleven these four ladies received among them rather more than onefourth of the whole of his published correspondence no four of his male correspondents can be accredited with so many even though george thomson for his individual share claims fiftysix  it is rather remarkable that so few of the letters are addressed to his own relatives his cousin james burness of montrose and his own younger brother william receive indeed ten and eight respectively but to his other brother gilbert with whom he was on the most affectionate and confidential terms there fall but three to his wife only two one to his father and none to either his sisters or his mother a maternal uncle samuel brown is favoured with oneif indeed the old man was not scandalised with itand there are two to james armour mason in mauchline his somewhat stonyhearted fatherinlaw  burnss letters exhibit quite as much variety of moodseldom of course so picturesquely conveyedas his poems he is in promiscuous alternation refined gross sentimental serious humorous indignant repentant dignified vulgar tender manly sceptical reverential rakish pathetic sympathetic satirical playful pitiably selfabased mysteriously selfexalted his letters are confessions and revelations they are as sincerely and spontaneously autobiographical of his inner life as the sacred lyrics of david the hebrew they were indited with as much free fearless abandonment the advice he gave to young andrew to keep something to himsel not to be told even to a bosom crony was a maxim of worldly prudence which he himself did not practice he did not reck his own rede and though that habit of unguarded expression brought upon him the wrath and revenge of the philistines and kept him in material poverty all his days yet prompted as it always was by sincerity and nearly always by absolute truth it has made the manhood of today richer stronger and nobler the world today has all the more the courage of its opinions that burns exercised as a right the freedom of sincere and enlightened speechand suffered for his bravery  the subjects of his letters are numerous and to a pretty large extent of much the same sort as the subjects of his poems often indeed you have the anticipation of an image or a sentiment which his poetry has made familiar you have a glimpse of green buds which afterwards unfold into fragrance and colour this is an interesting connection of which one or two examples may be given so early as 1781 he wrote to alison begbieonce you are convinced i am sincere i am perfectly certain you have too much goodness and humanity to allow an honest man to languish in suspense only because he loves you too well alison begbie becomes mary morison and the sentiment so elegantly turned in prose for her is thus melodiously transmuted for the ladyloves of all languishing lovers    o mary canst thou wreck his peace     wha for thy sake would gladly dee   or canst thou break that heart of his     whas only faut is loving thee    if love for love thou wiltna gie     at least be pity on me shown   a thocht ungentle canna be     the thocht o mary morison  again in the first month of 1783 he writes to murdoch the schoolmasteri am quite indolent about those great concerns that set the bustling busy sons of care agog and if i have wherewith to answer for the present hour i am very easy with regard to anything further even the last worst shift of the unfortunate and wretched does not greatly terrify me just one year later this sentiment was sent current in the wellknown stanza concluding    but davie lad neer fash your head     though we hae little gear   were fit to win our daily bread     as langs were hale an fier       mair speer na nor fear na         auld age neer mind a fig       the last ot the warst ot         is only for to beg  again in the letter last referred to occurs the passagei am a strict economist not indeed for the sake of the money but one of the principal parts in my composition is a kind of pride and i scorn to fear the face of any man living above everything i abhor as hell the idea of sneaking into a corner to avoid a dun this is metrically rendered in may 1786 in the following lines    to catch dame fortunes golden smile     assiduous wait upon her   and gather gear by every wile     thats justified by honour   not for to hide it in a hedge     nor for a train attendant   but for the glorious privilege     of being independent  it would be easy to multiply examples he is jostled in his letters by marketmen before he is hogshouthered and jundied by them in his verse and the legends of alloway kirk are narrated in a letter to grose before the immortal tale of tam oshanter is woven for the antiquities of scotland  there is nothing morbid or narrow in burnss letters they are frank and healthy you can spend a day over them and feel at the end of it as if you had been wandering at large through the freedom of nature they seem to have been written in the open air the first condition necessary to an appreciative understanding of them is to concern yourself with the sentiment and indeed the strength and sincerity of the sentiment byandby draw you away to oblivion of the style however much it may at first strike you as redundant and affected they are not the letters of a literary man they have nothing suggestive of the studious chamber and the midnight lamp there is often a narrowness of idea in the merely literary man which limits his auditory to men of his peculiar pattern to this narrowness burns with all his faults of style was a stranger his letters are the utterances of a man who refused to be imprisoned in any single department of human thought he was no specialist pinned to one standpoint and making the width of the world commensurate with the narrowness of his own horizon he moved about he looked abroad he had no pet subject no restricted field of study nature and human nature in their multitudinous phases and many retreats were his range and he expressed his views as freely and vigorously as he took them  the general tone of the letters is high the subject is not seldom of supreme interest questions are discussed which are rarely discussed in ordinary correspondence the writer rises above creeds and formularies and arbitrarily established rule he speculates on a theology beyond the bounds of calvinism on a philosophy of the soul above the dialectics of the schoolmen on a morality at variance with conventional law he interrogates the intuitions of the mind and the intimations of nature in order that if possible he may learn something of the souls origin destiny and supremest duty but let us hear himself     a i have ever looked on mankind in the lump to be nothing better    than a foolish headstrong credulous unthinking mob and their    universal belief has ever had extremely little weight with me i    am drawn by conviction like a man not by a halter like an ass     b on earth discord a gloomy heaven above opening its jealous    gates to the nineteenthousandth part of the tithe of mankind and    below an inexorable hell expanding its leviathan jaws for the vast    residue of mortals o doctrine comfortable and healing to the weary    wounded soul of man ye sons and daughters of affliction to whom day    brings no pleasure and night yields no rest be comforted tis one    to but nineteen hundred thousand that your situation will mend in    this world and tis nineteen hundred thousand to one by the dogmas    of theology that you will be damned eternally in the world to come     c a pillar that bears us up amid the wreck of misfortune and    misery is to be found in those feelings and sentiments which however    the sceptic may deny or the enthusiast disfigure them are yet i am    convinced original and component parts of the human soul those    senses of the mind if i may be allowed the expression which link    us to the awful obscure realities of an allpowerful and equally    beneficent god and a worldtocome beyond death and the grave     d can it be possible that when i resign this frail feverish    being i shall still find myself in conscious existence shall i    yet be warm in life seeing and seen enjoying and enjoyed ye    venerable sages and holy flamens is there probability in your    conjectures truth in your stories of another world beyond death or    are they all alike baseless visions and fabricated fables if there    is another life it must only be for the just the benevolent the    amiable and the humane what a flattering idea then is a world to    come would to god i as firmly believed it as i ardently wish it    jesus christ thou amiablest of characters i trust thou art no    impostor i trust that in thee shall all the families of the earth    be blessed     e from the seeming nature of the human mind as well as from the    evident imperfections in the administration of affairs in both the    natural and moral worlds there must be a retributive scene of    existence beyond the grave     f i never hear the loud solitary whistle of the curlew in a    summers noon or the wild mixing cadence of a troop of grey plover    in an autumn morning without feeling an elevation of soul like the    enthusiasm of devotion or poetry tell me my dear friend to what    can this be owing are we a piece of machinery that like the Æolian    harp passive takes the impression of the passing accident or do    these workings argue something within us above the trodden clod     g gracious heaven why this disparity between our wishes and our    powers why is the most generous wish to make others blest impotent    and ineffectual out upon the world say i that its affairs are    administered so ill     h at first glance several of your propositions startled me as    paradoxical that the martial clangour of a trumpet had something in    it vastly more grand heroic and sublime than the twingletwangle of    a jewsharp that the delicate flexure of a rosetwig when the    halfblown flower is heavy with the tears of the dawn was infinitely    more beautiful and elegant than the upright stub of a burdock and    that from something innate and independent of all associations of    ideasthese i had set down as irrefragable orthodox    truthsa     i o i could curse circumstances and the coarse tie of human    laws which keeps fast what commonsense would loose and which bars    that happiness it cannot givehappiness which otherwise love and    honour would warrant     j if there is no man on earth to whom your heart and affections    are justly due it may savour of imprudence but never of    criminality to bestow that heart and those affections where you    please the god of love meant and made those delicious attachments to    be bestowed on somebody  the inequalities of fortune the pleasures of friendship the miseries of poverty the glories of independence the privileges of wealth allied to generosity the sin of ingratitude and similar topics are continually recurring to prove the elevation at which his spirit usually soared and surveyed mankind it has been charged against himb that these subjects were not the food of his daily contemplation but were lugged into his letters for the sake of effect and that their clumsy introduction was frequently apologised for by the complaint that the writer had nothing else to write about the frequent apologies here spoken of will be hard to find and the critics only reason for advancing the charge for which he would fain find support in the fancied apologies of burns is that many of the letters relate neither to facts nor feelings peculiarly connected with the author or his correspondent this only means that a very large proportion of burnss letters are not like the letters of ordinary men and therefore do not satisfy the critics idea or definition of a letter they treat of themes that are not specially à propos of passing events and therefore they are forced and affected few are likely to be imposed upon by such shallow reasoning another criticc avers that while burns says nothing of difficulties at all he yet leaves an admirable letter out of nothing in your hands we may pit the one critic against the other and so leave them while we peruse the letters and form an opinion for ourselves  while both the verse and the prose of burns are revelations his letters reveal more than his poems the failings and frailties of the man his poems taken altogether shew him at his best as we wish toand as we mainly doremember him a man to be loved admired even envied and by no means pitied for his soul though often vexed with the irritations incidental to an obscure and toiling lot has a strength and buoyancy which readily raise it to divine altitudes where it might well be content to see and smile at the petty class distinctions and the paltry social tyranny from which those irritations chiefly spring his letters on the other hand present him to us less frequently on those commanding altitudes he is oftener careful and concerned about many things groping occasionally in the worlds ways for the worlds gifts and handicapped in the struggle for them by a contemptuous and halfhearted adoption of the worlds methods of winning them  the same personality that stands forth in the poems is everywhere present in all essential features in the letters we have in the latter the same view of life present and future the same fierce contentment with honest poverty the same aggressive independency of manhood the same patriotism susceptibility to female loveliness love of sociality undaunted likes and dislikes the humour is the same though often too elaborately expressedd in one important respect however his letters fail to reflect that image of him which his poetry presents it is remarkable that his descriptions of rural nature and one might add of rustic life so full and plentiful in his verse are so few and slight in his letters he seems to have reserved these descriptions for his verse  the best because the most genuine biography of burns is furnished by his own writings his letters will if carefully studied disprove many of the positions taken up so confidently by wouldbe interpreters of his history it is not the purpose of this discursive paper to take up the details of the clarinda episode but philandering is scarcely the word by which to describe the mutual relations of the lovers as for mrs mlehose the severest thing that can with justice be said against her is that if she maintained her virtue she endangered her reputation one remarkable position taken up by a recent writere on the subject of burnss amours is that he never really loved any woman and least of all jean armour the letters would rather warrant the converse of his statement they go to prove that while burnss affections were more than oriental in their strength and liberality they were especially centred upon jean he felt a miserable blank in his heart with want of her a rooted attachment for her had no reason on her part to rue his marriage with her and never saw where he could have made it better if burns was never really in love it is more than probable that the whole world has been mistaking some other passion for it it is this same writer who in one breath speaks of burns philandering with clarinda and yet declaring his attachment to her in the best songs he ever wrote another error which the letters should correct is the belief expressed in some quarters that burns was no longer capable of producing poetry after his fatal residence in edinburgh it was as a matter of fact subsequent to his residence in edinburgh that he wrote the poems for which he is now and for which he will be longest famousnamely his songs the writer already referred to compares the composition of these songs to the carving of cherrystones they were he says in effect the amusement of a man who could do nothing better in literature the world has agreed that they are the best things burns has done and rates him for their sake in the highest rank of its poets the truth is that burns came to ellisland with numerous schemes of future poetical work vigorous hopes of carrying some of them and an inspiration and faculty of utterance unimpaired it was in dumfriesshire that he composed the most tenderly and melodiously seraphic of his lyricsto mary in heaven and highland mary the most powerful and popular of his narrative poemstam o shanter the first of all patriotic odesbruces address to his army and the noblest manifesto of the rights and hopes of manhooda mans a man for a that  with one word on his style as a prosewriter this short paper must close the most diverse opinions have been uttered on the subject the critics trip up each other with charming independency to jeffrey they seemed to be all composed as exercises and for display carlyle declared that they were written for the most part with singular force and even gracefulness and that when burns wrote to trusted friends on real interests his style became simple vigorous expressive sometimes even beautiful dr waddell prefers him to cowper and byron as a letterwriter scott while allowing passages of great eloquence found in the letters strong marks of affectation with a tincture of pedantry taine thinks burns brought ridicule on himself by imitating the men of the academy and the court lockhart thought with walker that he accommodated his style to the tastes of his correspondents and so on  it is worth while to learn from burns himself what he thought of his talent for prosecomposition and in the first place it is to be noted that he practised prosecomposition before he took to poetry at sixteen he was carrying on an extensive literary correspondence which was virtually a competition in essaywriting he kept copies of the letters he liked best and was flattered to find that he was superior to his correspondents he studied the essayists of queen annes time and formed his style upon theirs and that of their most distinguished followers steele addison swift sterne and mackenzie were his models he liked their rounded sentences and caught their conventional phrases he found delight in imitating them he volunteered his services with the pen on behalf of his fellowswains he became the complete letterwriter of his parish and was proud of his function and his faculty he was aware of his abilities at a billetdoux to the very last he had a high opinion of himself as a writer of letters he speaks of one letter being in his very best manner and of waiting for an hour of inspiration to write another that should be as good he retained copies of about thirty of his longer letters and had them bound for preservation  the most serious almost the only charge brought against the prose style of burns is the charge of affectation more or less occasional all the earlier critics make it or imply it and with such an apparent show of proof that it has generally been believed later critics while unable to deny the feature of his style which so looks like affectation have explained it to such good effect as to make it appear a beauty they have asked us to regard it as the happy result of a sympathetic mind adapting itself to the object of its address this looks very like blaming burnss correspondents for the badness of his style there is some truth in the explanation putting it even so extremely but when this allowance is made there still remains a wide and wellmarked difference between his use of english prose and his mastery of scottish verse the latter is completeit is the mastery of an originator of style the former on the other hand is the attainment of a clever pupil when the sentiment is commonplace when it is deep and vehement it is often in the language of carlyle the effort of a man to express something which he has no organ fit for expressing common people to whom niceties of style are unknown and who read primarily or exclusively for the sake of the matter perceive nothing of this affectation and think scarcely less highly of burnss letters than they do of his poetry  j logie robertson  7 lockharton terrace slateford edinburgh   footnote a this is really the exposure of an absurdity  footnote b by jeffrey  footnote c dr hately

am a stranger in these matters a as i assure you that you are the first woman to whom i ever made such a declaration so i declare i am at a loss how to proceed  i have more than once come into your

ardently wish for or that could possibly give me so much happiness as one day to see you mine  i think you cannot doubt my sincerity as i am sure that whenever i see you my very looks betray me and when once you are convinced i am sincere i am perfectly certain you have too much goodness and humanity to allow an honest man to languish in suspense only because he loves you too well and i am certain that in such a state of anxiety as i myself at present feel an absolute denial would be a much preferable state     footnote 1 the original ms of the foregoing letter is the property    of john adam esquire greenock and the letter was first published    in 1878 if it is a genuine loveletter and not a mere exercise in    loveletter writing it was probably the first of the short series to    alison begbie who is supposed to have been the daughter of a small    farmer and who has been identified with the mary morison of the    wellknown lyric the sentiment of the last paragraph of the letter    agrees with the sentiment of the last stanza of the song                                       iito ellison begbie  lochlie 1780  my dear ei do not remember in the course of your acquaintance and mine ever to have heard your opinion on the ordinary way of falling in love amongst people in our station in life i do not mean the persons who proceed in the way of bargain but those whose affection is really placed on the person  though i be as you know very well but a very awkward lover myself yet as i have some opportunities of observing the conduct of others who are much better skilled in the affair of courtship than i am i often think it is owing to lucky chance more than to good management that there are not more unhappy marriages than usually are  it is natural for a young fellow to like the acquaintance of the females and customary for him to keep them company when occasion serves some one of them is more agreeable to him than the rest there is something he knows not what pleases him he knows not how in her company this i take to be what is called love with the greater part of us and i must own my dear e it is a hard game such a one as you have to play when you meet with such a lover you cannot refuse but he is sincere and yet though you use him ever so favourably perhaps in a few months or at farthest in a year or two the same unaccountable fancy may make him as distractedly fond of another whilst you are quite forgot i am aware that perhaps the next time i have the pleasure of seeing you you may bid me take my own lesson home and tell me that the passion i have professed for you is perhaps one of those transient flashes i have been describing but i hope my dear e you will do me the justice to believe me when i assure you that the love i have for you is founded on the sacred principles of virtue and honour and by consequence so long as you continue possessed of those amiable qualities which first inspired my passion for you so long must i continue to love you believe me my dear it is love like this alone which can render the marriage state happy people may talk of flames and raptures as long as they please and a warm fancy with a flow of youthful spirits may make them feel something like what they describe but sure i am the nobler faculties of the mind with kindred feelings of the heart can only be the foundation of friendship and it has always been my opinion that the married life was only friendship in a more exalted degree  if you will be so good as to grant my wishes and it should please providence to spare us to the latest periods of life i can look forward and see that even then though bent down with wrinkled ageeven then when all other worldly circumstances will be indifferent to me i will regard my e with the tenderest affection and for this plain reason because she is still possessed of those noble qualities improved to a much higher degree which first inspired my affection for her    o happy state when souls each other draw   where love is liberty and nature law  i know were i to speak in such a style to many a girl who thinks herself possessed of no small share of sense she would think it ridiculousbut the language of the heart is my dear e the only courtship i shall ever use to you  when i look over what i have written i am sensible it is vastly different from the ordinary style of courtshipbut i shall make no apologyi know your good nature will excuse what your good sense may see amiss                                       iiito ellison begbie  lochlie 1780  i verily believe my dear e that the pure genuine feelings of love are as rare in the world as the pure genuine principles of virtue and piety this i hope will account for the uncommon style of all my letters to you by uncommon i mean their being written in such a serious manner which to tell you the truth has made me often afraid lest you should take me for some zealous bigot who conversed with his mistress as he would converse with his minister i dont know how it is my dear for though except your company there is nothing on earth gives me so much pleasure as writing to you yet it never gives me those giddy raptures so much talked of among lovers i have often thought that if a wellgrounded affection be not really a part of virtue tis something extremely akin to it whenever the thought of my e warms my heart every feeling of humanity every principle of generosity kindles in my breast it extinguishes every dirty spark of malice and envy which are but too apt to infest me i grasp every creature in the arms of universal benevolence and equally participate in the pleasures of the happy and sympathise with the miseries of the unfortunate i assure you my dear i often look up to the divine disposer of events with an eye of gratitude for the blessing which i hope he intends to bestow on me in bestowing you i sincerely wish that he may bless my endeavours to make your life as comfortable and happy as possible both in sweetening the rougher parts of my natural temper and bettering the unkindly circumstances of my fortune this my dear is a passion at least in my view worthy of a man and i will add worthy of a christian the sordid earthworm may profess love to a womans person whilst in reality his affection is centred in her pocket and the slavish drudge may go awooing as he goes to the horsemarket to choose one who is stout and firm and as we say of an old horse one who will be a good drudge and draw kindly i disdain their dirty puny ideas i would be heartily out of humour with myself if i thought i were capable of having so poor a notion of the sex which were designed to crown the pleasures of society poor devils i dont envy them their happiness who have such notions for my part i propose quite other pleasures with my dear partner                                       ivto ellison begbie  lochlie 178l  my dear ei have often thought it a peculiarly unlucky circumstance in love that though in every other situation in life telling the truth is not only the safest but actually by far the easiest way of proceeding a lover is never under greater difficulty in acting or more puzzled for expression than when his passion is sincere and his intentions are honourable i do not think that it is very difficult for a person of ordinary capacity to talk of love and fondness which are not felt and to make vows of constancy and fidelity which are never intended to be performed if he be villain enough to practice such detestable conduct but to a man whose heart glows with the principles of integrity and truth and who sincerely loves a woman of amiable person uncommon refinement of sentiment and purity of mannersto such a one in such circumstances i can assure you my dear from my own feelings at this present moment courtship is a task indeed there is such a number of foreboding fears and distrustful anxieties crowd into my mind when i am in your company or when i sit down to write to you that what to speak or what to write i am altogether at a loss  there is one rule which i have hitherto practised and which i shall invariably keep with you and that is honestly to tell you the plain truth there is something so mean and unmanly in the arts of dissimulation and falsehood that i am surprised they can be used by any one in so noble so generous a passion as virtuous love no my dear e i shall never endeavour to gain your favour by such detestable practices if you will be so good and so generous as to admit me for your partner your companion your bosom friend through life there is nothing on this side of eternity shall give me greater transport but i shall never think of purchasing your hand by any arts unworthy of a man and i will add of a christian there is one thing my dear which i earnestly request of you and it is this that you would soon either put an end to my hopes by a peremptory refusal or cure me of my fears by a generous consent  it would oblige me much if you would send me a line or two when convenient i shall only add further that if behaviour regulated though perhaps but very imperfectly by the rules of honour and virtue if a heart devoted to love and esteem you and an earnest endeavour to promote your happiness if these are qualities you would wish in a friend in a husband i hope you shall ever find them in your real friend and sincere lover                                        vto ellison begboe  lochlie 1781  i ought in good manners to have acknowledged the receipt of your letter before this time but my heart was so shocked with the contents of it that i can scarcely yet collect my thoughts so as to write you on the subject i will not attempt to describe what i felt on receiving your letter i read it over and over again and again and though it was in the politest language of refusal still it was peremptory you were sorry you could not make me a return but you wish me what without you i never can obtain you wish me all kind of happiness it would be weak and unmanly to say that without you i never can be happy but sure i am that sharing life with you would have given it a relish that wanting you i can never taste  your uncommon personal advantages and your superior good sense do not so much strike me these possibly in a few instances may be met with in others but that amiable goodness that tender feminine softness that endearing sweetness of disposition with all the charming offspring of a warm feeling heartthese i never again expect to meet with in such a degree in this world all these charming qualities heightened by an education much beyond anything i have ever met in any woman i ever dared to approach have made an impression on my heart that i do not think the world can ever efface my imagination has fondly flattered myself with a wish i dare not say it ever reached a hope that possibly i might one day call you mine i had formed the most delightful images and my fancy fondly brooded over them but now i am wretched for the loss of what i really had no right to expect i must now think no more of you as a mistress still i presume to ask to be admitted as a friend as such i wish to be allowed to wait on you and as i expect to remove in a few days a little further off and you i suppose will soon leave this place i wish to see or hear from you soon and if an expression should perhaps escape me rather too warm for friendship i hope you will pardon it in my dear miss pardon me the dear expression for once r b                                       vito his father  irvine december 27 1781  honoured siri have purposely delayed writing in the hope that i should have the pleasure of seeing you on new years day but work comes so hard upon us that i do not choose to be absent on that account as well as for some other little reasons which i shall tell you at meeting my health is nearly the same as when you were here only my sleep is a little sounder and on the whole i am rather better than otherwise though i mend by very slow degrees the weakness of my nerves has so debilitated my mind that i dare neither review my past wants nor look forward into futurity for the least anxiety or perturbation in my breast produces most unhappy effects on my whole frame sometimes indeed when for an hour or two my spirits are a little lightened i glimmer a little into futurity but my principal and indeed my only pleasurable employment is looking backwards and forwards in a moral and religious way i am quite transported at the thought that ere long perhaps very soon i shall bid an eternal adieu to all the pains and uneasiness and disquietudes of this weary life for i assure you i am heartily tired of it and if i do not very much deceive myself i could contentedly and gladly resign it    the soul uneasy and confind at home   rests and expatiates in a life to come  it is for this reason i am more pleased with the 15th 16th and 17th verses of the 7th chapter of revelation2 than with any ten times as many verses in the whole bible and would not exchange the whole noble enthusiasm with which they inspire me for all that this world has to offer as for this world i despair of ever making a figure in it i am not formed for the bustle of the busy nor the flutter of the gay i shall never again be capable of entering into such scenes indeed i am altogether unconcerned at the thoughts of this life i foresee that poverty and obscurity probably await me and i am in some measure prepared and daily preparing to meet them i have but just time and paper to return you my grateful thanks for the lessons of virtue and piety you have given me which were too much neglected at the time of giving them but which i hope have been remembered ere it is yet too late present my dutiful respects to my mother and my compliments to mr and mrs muir and with wishing you a merry newyears day i shall concludei am honoured sir your dutiful son  robert burness  p smy meal is nearly out but i am going to borrow till i get more     footnote 2 therefore are they before the throne of god and serve    him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth

ballochmyle3  sirwe who subscribe this are both members of st jamess lodge tarbolton and one of us in the office of warden and as we have the honour of having you for master of our lodge we hope you will excuse this freedom as you are the proper person to whom we ought to apply we look on our mason lodge to be a serious matter both with respect to the character of masonry itself and likewise as it is a charitable society this last indeed does not interest you further than a benevolent heart is interested in the welfare of its fellowcreatures but to us sir who are of the lower order of mankind to have a fund in view on which we may with certainty depend to be kept from want should we be in circumstances of distress or old agethis is a matter of high importance  we are sorry to observe that our lodges affairs with respect to its finances have for a good while been in a wretched situation we have considerable sums in bills which lie by without being paid or put in execution and many of our members never mind their yearly dues or anything else belonging to the lodge and since the separation4 from st davids we are not sure even of our existence as a lodge there has been a dispute before the grand lodge but how decided or if decided at all we know not  for these and other reasons we humbly beg the favour of you as soon as convenient to call a meeting and let us consider on some means to retrieve our wretched affairswe are etc     footnote 3 the ms of the foregoing joint letter in burnss    handwriting belongs to john adam esquire greenock and the letter    was first published in 1878 burns was first admitted in st davids    tarbolton lodge in july 1781 at the separation preferred to he    became a member of the new lodge st jamess of which two years    afterwards

opportunity of sending you a letter without putting you to that expense which any production of mine would but ill repay i embrace it with pleasure to tell you that i have not forgotten or ever will forget the many obligations i lie under to your kindness and friendship  i do not doubt sir but you will wish to know what has been the result of all the pains of an indulgent father and a masterly teacher and i wish i could gratify your curiosity with such a recital as you would be pleased withbut that is what i am afraid will not be the case i have indeed kept pretty clear of vicious habits and in this respect i hope my conduct will not disgrace the education i have gotten but as a man of the world i am most miserably deficient one would have thought that bred as i have been under a father who has figured pretty well as un homme des affaires i might have been what the world calls a pushing active fellow but to tell you the truth sir there is hardly anything more my reverse i seem to be one sent into the world to see and observe and i very easily compound with the knave who tricks me of my money if there be anything original about him which shows me human nature in a different light from anything i have seen before in short the joy of my heart is to study men their manners and their ways and for this darling subject i cheerfully sacrifice every other consideration i am quite indolent about those great concerns that set the bustling busy sons of care agog and if i have to answer for the present hour i am very easy with regard to anything further even the last worst shift of the unfortunate and the wretched5 does not much terrify me i know that even then my talent for what countryfolks call a sensible crack when once it is sanctified by a hoary head would procure me so much esteem that even theni would learn to be happy however i am under no apprehensions about that for though indolent yet so far as an extremely delicate constitution permits i am not lazy and in many things especially in tavern matters i am a strict economist not indeed for the sake of the money but one of the principal parts in my composition is a kind of pride of stomach and i scorn to fear the face of any man living above every thing i abhor as hell the idea of sneaking in a corner to avoid a dunpossibly some pitiful sordid wretch whom in my heart i despise and detest tis this and this alone that endears economy to me6  in the matter of books indeed i am very profuse my favourite authors are of the sentimental kind such as shenstone particularly his elegies thomson man of feelinga book i prize next to the bible man of the world sterne especially his sentimental journey macphersons ossian etcthese are the glorious models after which i endeavour to form my conduct and tis incongruoustis absurd to suppose that the man whose mind glows with sentiments lighted up at their sacred flamethe man whose heart distends with benevolence to all the human racehe who can soar above this little scene of thingscan he descend to mind the paltry concerns about which the terraefilial race fret and fume and vex themselves o how the glorious triumph swells my heart i forget that i am a poor insignificant devil unnoticed and unknown stalking up and down fairs and markets when i happen to be in them reading a page or two of mankind and catching the manners living as they rise whilst the men of business jostle me on every side as an idle incumbrance in their way but i daresay i have by this time tired your patience so i shall conclude with begging you to give mrs murdochnot my compliments for that is a mere commonplace story but my warmest kindest wishes for her welfare and accept the same for yourself fromdear sir yours etc     footnote 5       the last ot the warst ot

his cousin mr james burness writer montrose  lochlie 21st june 1783  dear sirmy father received your favour of the both current and as he has been for some months very poorly in health and is in his own opinion and indeed in almost every bodys else in a dying condition he has only with great difficulty written a few farewell lines to each of his brothersinlaw for this melancholy reason i now hold the pen for him to thank you for your kind letter and to assure you sir that it shall not be my fault if my fathers correspondence in the north die with him my brother writes to john caird6 and to him i must refer you for the news of our family  i shall only trouble you with a few particulars relative to the wretched state of this country our markets are exceedingly high oatmeal 17d and 18d per peck and not to be got even at that price we have indeed been pretty well supplied with quantities of white peas from england and elsewhere but that resource is likely to fail us and what will become of us then particularly the very poorest sort heaven only knows this country till of late was flourishing incredibly in the manufacture of silk lawn and carpetweaving and we are still carrying on a good deal in that way but much reduced from what it was we had also a fine trade in the shoe way but now entirely ruined and hundreds driven to a starving condition on account of it farming is also at a very low ebb with us our lands generally speaking are mountainous and barren and our landholders full of ideas of farming gathered from the english and the lothians and other rich soils in scotland make no allowance for the odds of the quality of land and consequently stretch us much beyond what in the event we will be found able to pay we are also much at a loss for want of proper methods in our improvements of farming necessity compels us to leave our old schemes and few of us have opportunities of being well informed in new ones in short my dear sir since the unfortunate beginning of this american war and its as unfortunate conclusion this country has been and still is decaying very fast even in higher life a couple of ayrshire noblemen and the major part of our knights and squires are all insolvent a miserable job of a douglas heron  cos bank which no doubt you have heard of has undone numbers of them and imitating english and french and other foreign luxuries and fopperies has ruined as many more there is a great trade of smuggling carried on along our coasts which however destructive to the interests of the kingdom at large certainly enriches this corner of it but too often at the expense of our morals however it enables individuals to make at least for a time a splendid appearance but fortune as is usual with her when she is uncommonly lavish of her favours is generally even with them at last and happy were it for numbers of them if she would leave them no worse than when she found them  my mother sends you a small present of a cheese tis but a very little one as our last years stock is sold off but if you could fix on any correspondent in edinburgh or glasgow we would send you a proper one in the season mrs black promises to take the cheese under her care so far and then to send it to you by the stirling carrier  i shall conclude this long letter with assuring you that i shall be very happy to hear from you or any of our friends in your country when opportunity serves  my father sends you probably for the last time in this world his warmest wishes for your welfare and happiness and my mother and the rest of the family desire to inclose their kind compliments to you mrs burness and the rest of your family along with those of dear sir your affectionate cousin     footnote 6 the writers uncle                                       xto mr james burness writer montrose  lochlie 17th feb 1784  dear cousini would have returned you my thanks for your kind favour of the 13th of december sooner had it not been that i waited to give you an account of that melancholy event which for some time past we have from day to day expected  on the 13th current i lost the best of fathers though to be sure we have had long warning of the impending stroke still the feelings of nature claim their part and i cannot recollect the tender endearments and parental lessons of the best of friends and ablest of instructors without feeling what perhaps the calmer dictates of reason would partly condemn  i hope my fathers friends in your country will not let their connection in this place die with him for my part i shall ever with pleasurewith pride acknowledge my connection with those who were allied by the ties of blood and friendship to a man whose memory i shall ever honour and revere  i expect therefore my dear sir you will not neglect any opportunity of letting me hear from you which will very much obligemy dear cousin yours sincerely  robert burness                                       xito mr james burness writer montrose  mossgiel 3rd august 1784  my dear siri ought in gratitude to have acknowledged the receipt of your last kind letter before this time but without troubling you with any apology i shall proceed to inform you that our family are all in good health at present and we were very happy with the unexpected favour of john cairds6a company for nearly two weeks and i must say it of him that he is one of the most agreeable facetious warmhearted lads i was ever acquainted with  we have been surprised with one of the most extraordinary phenomena in the moral world which i dare say has happened in the course of this half century we have had a party of presbytery relief as they call themselves for some time in this country a pretty thriving society of them has been in the burgh of irvine for some years past till about two years ago a mrs buchan from glasgow came among them and began to spread some fanatical notions of religion among them and in a short time made many converts and among others their preacher mr whyte who upon that account has been suspended and formally deposed by his brethren he continued however to preach in private to his party and was supported both he and their spiritual mother as they affect to call old buchan by the contributions of the rest several of whom were in good circumstances till in spring last the populace rose and mobbed mrs buchan and put her out of the town on which all her followers voluntarily quitted the place likewise and with such precipitation that many of them never shut their doors behind them one left a washing on the green another a cow bellowing at the crib without food or anybody to mind her and after several stages they are fixed at present in the neighbourhood of dumfries their tenets are a strange jumble of enthusiastic jargon among others she pretends to give them the holy ghost by breathing on them which she does with postures and practices that are scandalously indecent they have likewise disposed of all their effects and hold a community of goods and live nearly an idle life carrying on a great farce of pretended devotion in barns and woods where they lodge and lie all together and hold likewise a community of women as it is another of their tenets that they can commit no moral sin i am personally acquainted with most of them and i can assure you the above mentioned are facts  this my dear sir is one of the many instances of the folly of leaving the guidance of sound reason and common sense in matters of religion  whenever we neglect or despise these sacred monitors the whimsical notions of a perturbated brain are taken for the immediate influences of the deity and the wildest fanaticism and the most inconsistent absurdities will meet with abetters and converts nay i have often thought that the more outoftheway and ridiculous the fancies are if once they are sanctified under the sacred name of religion the unhappy mistaken votaries are the more firmly glued to them  i

thingsa ploughwedge a horse nail an old letter or a tattered rhyme in short everything but my penknife and that at last after a painful fruitless search will be found in the unsuspected corner of an unsuspected pocket as if on purpose thrust out of the way still sir i long had a wishing eye to that inestimable blessing a wife   a young fellow after a few idle commonplace stories from a gentleman in black  no one durst say black was his eye while i  only wanting that ceremony am made a sundays laughingstock and abused like a pickpocket i was well aware though that if my illstarred fortune got the least hint of my connubial wish my scheme would go to nothing to prevent this i determined to take my measures with such thought and forethought such cautions and precautions that all the malignant planets in the hemisphere should be unable to blight my designs  heaven and earth must i remember my damned star wheeled about to the zenith by whose baleful rays fortune took the alarm15a

malstrom and religion a feeblystruggling beaver down the roarings of niagara i reprobated the first moment of my existence execrated adams follyinfatuated wish for that goodlylooking but poisonbreathing gift which had ruined him and undone me and called on the womb of uncreated night to close over me and all my sorrows  a storm naturally overblows itself my spent passions gradually sunk into a lurid calm and by degrees i have subsided into the timesettled sorrow of the sablewidower who wiping away the decent tear lifts up his griefworn eye to lookfor another wife    such is the state of man today he buds   his tender leaves of hope tomorrow blossoms   and bears his blushing honours thick upon him   the third day comes a frost a killing frost   and nips his root and then he falls as i do15  such sir has been the fatal era of my life and it came to pass that when i looked for sweet behold bitter and for light behold darkness  but this is not all already the holy beagles begin to snuff the scent and i expect every moment to see them cast off and hear them after me in full cry but as i am an old fox i shall give them dodging and doubling for it and by and by i intend

burness writer montrose  mossgiel tuesday noon 26th sept 1786  my dear siri this moment receive yoursreceive it with the honest hospitable warmth of a friends welcome whatever comes from you always wakens up the better blood about my heart which your kind little recollections of my parental friend carries as far as it will go tis there that man is blest tis there my friend man feels a consciousness of something within him above the trodden clod the grateful reverence to the hoary earthly authors of his being the burning glow when he clasps the woman of his soul to his bosom the tender yearnings of heart for the little angels to whom he has given existencethese nature has poured in milky streams about the human heart and the man who never rouses them to action by the inspiring influences of their proper objects loses by far the most pleasurable part of his existence  my departure is uncertain but i do not think it will be till after harvest i will be on very short allowance of time indeed if i do not comply with your friendly invitation when it will be i dont know but if i can make my wish good i will endeavour to drop you a line some time before my best compliments to mrs burness i should be equally mortified should i drop in when she is abroad but of that i suppose there is little chance what i have wrote heaven knows i have not time to review it so accept of it in the beaten way of friendship with the ordinary phrase and perhaps rather more than the ordinary sincerity i am dear sir ever yours r b                                xxvito mrs stewart of stair19  oct 1786  madamthe hurry of my preparations for going abroad has hindered me from performing my promise so soon as i intended i have here sent you a parcel of songs etc which never made their appearance except to a friend or two at most perhaps some of them may be no great entertainment to you but of that i am far from being an adequate judge the song to the time of ettrick banks20 you will easily see the impropriety of exposing much even in manuscript i think myself it has some merit both as a tolerable description of one of natures sweetest scenes a july evening and as one of the finest pieces of natures workmanship the finest indeed we know anything of an amiable beautiful young woman but i have no common friend to procure me that permission without which i would not dare to spread the copy  i am quite aware madam what task the world would assign me in this letter the obscure bard when any of the great condescend to take notice of him should heap the altar with the incense of flattery their high ancestry their own great and godlike qualities and actions should be recounted with the most exaggerated description this madam is a task for which i am altogether unfit besides a certain disqualifying pride of heart i know nothing of your connections in life and have no access to where your real character is to be foundthe company of your compeers and more i am afraid that even the most refined adulation is by no means the road to your good opinion  one feature of your character i shall ever with grateful pleasure rememberthe reception i got when i had the honour of waiting on you at stair i am little acquainted with politeness but i know a good deal of benevolence of temper and goodness of heart surely did those in exalted stations know how happy they could make some classes of their inferiors by condescension and affability they would never stand so high measuring out with every look the height of their elevation but condescend as sweetly as did

ballochmyle                                xxviito mr robert aikin writer ayr  oct 1786  siri was with wilson my printer tother day and settled all our bygone matters between us after i had paid him all demands i made him the offer of the second edition on the hazard of being paid out of the first and readiest which he declines by his account the paper of a thousand copies would cost about twentyseven pounds and the printing about fifteen or sixteen he offers to agree to this for the printing if i will advance for the paper but this you know is out of my power so farewell hopes of a second edition till i grow richer an epocha which i think will arrive at the payment of the british national debt  there is scarcely anything hurts me so much in being disappointed of my second edition as not having it in my power to show my gratitude to mr ballantine by publishing my poem of the brigs of ayr i would detest myself as a wretch if i thought i were capable in a very long life of forgetting the honest warm and tender delicacy with which he enters into my interests i am sometimes pleased with myself in my grateful sensations but i believe on the whole i have very little merit in it as my gratitude is not a virtue the consequence of reflection but sheerly the instinctive emotion of my heart too inattentive to allow worldly maxims and views to settle into selfish habits  i have been feeling all the various rotations and movements within respecting the excise there are many things plead strongly against it the uncertainty of getting soon into business the consequences of my follies which may perhaps make it impracticable for me to stay at home and besides i have for some time been pining under secret wretchedness from causes which you pretty well knowthe pang of disappointment the sting of pride with some wandering stabs of remorse which never fail to settle on my vitals like vultures when attention is not called away by the calls of society or the vagaries of the muse even in the hour of social mirth my gaiety is the madness of an intoxicated criminal under the hands of the executioner all these reasons urge me to go abroad and to all these reasons i have only one answerthe feelings of a father this in the present mood i am in overbalances everything that can be laid in the scale against it  you may perhaps think it an extravagant fancy but it is a sentiment which strikes home to my very soul though sceptical in some points of our current belief yet i think i have every evidence for the reality of a life beyond the stinted bourne of our present existence if so then how should i in the presence of that tremendous being the author of existence how should i meet the reproaches of those who stand to me in the dear relation of children whom i deserted in the smiling innocency of helpless infancy o thou great unknown powerthou almighty god who has lighted up reason in my breast and blessed me with immortalityi have frequently wandered from that order and regularity necessary for the perfection of thy works yet thou hast never left me nor forsaken me  since i wrote the foregoing sheet i have seen something of the storm of mischief thickening over my follydevoted head should you my friends my benefactors be successful in your applications for me perhaps it may not be in my power in that way to reap the fruit of your friendly efforts what i have written in the preceding pages is the settled tenor of my present resolution but should inimical circumstances forbid me closing with your kind offer or enjoying it only threaten to entail farther misery  to tell the truth i have little reason for this last complaint as the world in general has been kind to me fully up to my deserts i was for some time past fast getting into the pining distrustful snarl of the misanthrope i saw myself alone unfit for the struggle of life shrinking at every rising cloud in the chancedirected atmosphere of fortune while all defenceless i looked about in vain for a cover it never occurred to me at least never with the force it deserved that this world is a busy scene and man a creature destined for a progressive struggle and that however i might possess a warm heart and inoffensive manners which last by the by was rather more than i could well boast still more than these passive qualities there was something to be done when all my schoolfellows and youthful compeers those misguided few excepted who joined to use a gentoo phrase the hallachores of the human race were striking off with eager hope and earnest intent in some one or other of the many paths of busy life i was standing idle in the marketplace or only left the chase of the butterfly from flower to flower to hunt fancy from whim to whim  you see sir that if to know ones errors were a probability of mending them i stand a fair chance but according to the reverend westminster divines though conviction must precede conversion it is very far from always implying it                                xxviiito dr mackenzie mauchline inclosing him verses on dining with lord daer  wednesday morning 1st nov 1786  dear siri never spent an afternoon

dunlop of dunlop  nov 1786  madami am truly sorry i was not at home yesterday when i was so much honoured with your order for my copies and incomparably more by the handsome compliments you are pleased to pay my poetic abilities i am fully persuaded that there is not any class of mankind so feelingly alive to the titillations of applause as the sons of parnassus nor is it easy to conceive how the heart of the poor bard dances with rapture when those whose character in life gives them a right to be polite judges honour him with their approbation had you been thoroughly acquainted with me madam you could not have touched my darling heartchord more sweetly than by noticing my attempts to celebrate your illustrious ancestor the saviour of his country    great patriot hero illrequited chief  the first book i met with in my early years which i perused with pleasure was the life of hannibal the next was the history of sir william wallace for several of my early years i had few other authors and many a solitary hour have i stole out after the laborious vocations of the day to shed a tear over their glorious but unfortunate stories in those boyish days i remember in particular being struck with that part of wallaces story where these lines occur    syne to the leglen wood when it was late   to make a silent and a safe retreat  i chose a fine summer sunday the only day my line of life allowed and walked halfadozen of miles to pay my respects to the leglen wood with as much devout enthusiasm as ever pilgrim did to loretto and as i explored every den and dell where i could suppose my heroic countryman to have lodged i recollect for even then i was a rhymer that my heart glowed with a wish to be able to make a song on him in some measure equal to his merits r b

allows them a larger latitude in the laws of propriety than the sober sons of judgment and prudence i mention this as an apology for the liberties that a nameless stranger has taken with you in the inclosed poem which he begs leave to present you with whether it has poetical merit any way worthy of the theme i am not the proper judge but it is the best my abilities can produce and what to a good heart will perhaps be a superior grace it is equally sincere as fervent  the scenery was nearly taken from real life though i dare say madam you do not recollect it as i believe you scarcely noticed the poetic reveur as he wandered by you i had roved out as chance directed in the favourite haunts of my muse on the banks of the ayr to view nature in all the gaiety of the vernal year the evening sun was flaming over the distant western hills not a breath stirred the crimson opening blossom or the verdantspreading leaf it was a golden moment for a poetic heart i listened to the feathered warblers pouring their harmony on every hand with a congenial kindred regard and frequently turned out of my path lest i should disturb their little songs or frighten them to another station surely said i to myself he must be a wretch indeed who regardless of your harmonious endeavour to please him can eye your elusive flights to discover your secret recesses and to rob you of all the property nature gives youyour dearest comforts your helpless nestlings even the hoary hawthorn twig that shot across the way what heart at such a time but must have been interested in its welfare and wished it preserved from the rudelybrowsing cattle or the withering eastern blast such was the scene and such the hour when in a corner of my prospect i spied one of the fairest pieces of natures workmanship that ever crowned a poetic landscape or met a poets eye those visionary bards excepted who hold commerce with aerial beings had calumny and villainy taken my walk they had at that moment sworn eternal peace with such an object  what an hour of inspiration for a poet it would have raised plain dull historic prose into metaphor and measure  the inclosed song was the work of my return and perhaps it

to inquire whether formal duty bade or cold propriety disallowed my thanking you in this manner as i am convinced from the light in which you kindly view me that you will do me the justice to believe this letter is not the manoeuvre of the needy sharping author fastening on those in upper life who honour him with a little notice of him or his works indeed the situation of poets is generally such to a proverb as may in some measure palliate that prostitution of heart and talents they have at times been guilty of i do not think that prodigality is by any means a necessary concomitant of a poetic turn but i believe a careless indolent inattention to economy is almost inseparable from it then there must be in the heart of every bard of natures making a certain modest sensibility mixed with a kind of pride which will ever keep him out of the way of those windfalls of fortune which frequently light on hardy impudence and footlicking servility it is not easy to imagine a more helpless state than his whose poetic fancy unfits him for the world and whose character as a scholar gives him some pretensions to the politesse of life yet is as poor as i am for my part i thank heaven my star has been kinder learning never elevated my ideas above the peasants shed and i have an independent fortune at the ploughtail  i was surprised to hear25 that any one who pretended in the least to the manners of the gentleman should be so foolish or worse as to stoop to traduce the morals of such a one as i am and so inhumanly cruel too as to meddle with that late most unfortunate unhappy part of my story with a tear of gratitude i thank you sir for the warmth with which you interposd in behalf of my conduct i am i acknowledge too frequently the sport of whim caprice and passion but reverence to god and integrity to my fellowcreatures i hope i shall ever preserve i have no return sir to make you for your goodness but onea return which i am persuaded will not be unacceptablethe honest warm wishes of a grateful heart for your happiness and every one of that lovely flock who stand to you in a filial relation if ever calumny aims the poisoned shaft at them may friendship be by

subscription bills come out tomorrow and you shall have some of them next post i have met in mr dalrymple of orangefield what solomon emphatically calls a friend that sticketh closer than a brother the warmth with which he interests himself in my affairs is of the same enthusiastic kind which you mr aikin and the few patrons that took notice of my earlier poetic days showed for the poor unlucky

forgivenessingratitude to friendship in not writing you sooner but of all men living i had intended to have sent you an entertaining letter and by all the plodding stupid powers that in nodding conceited majesty preside over the dull routine of businessa heavilysolemn oath thisi am and have been ever since i came to edinburgh as unfit to write a letter of humour as to write a commentary on the revelation of st john the divine who was banished to the isle of patmos by the cruel and bloody domitian son to vespasian and brother to titus both emperors of rome and who was himself an emperor and raised the second or third persecution i forget which against the christians and after throwing the said apostle john brother to the apostle james commonly called james the greater to distinguish him from another james who was on some account or other known by the name of james the lessafter throwing him into a cauldron of boiling oil from which he was miraculously preserved he banished the poor son of zebedee to a desert island in the archipelago where he was gifted with the second sight and saw as many wild beasts as i have seen since i came to edinburgh which a circumstance not uncommon in storytelling brings me back to where i set out  to make you some amends for what before you reach this paragraph you will have suffered i enclose you two poems i have carded and spun since

citizen of the world but have all those national prejudices which i believe glow peculiarly strong in the breast of a scotchman there is scarcely anything to which i am so fully alive as the honour and welfare of my country and as a poet i have no higher enjoyment than singing her sons and daughters fate had cast my station in the veriest shades of life but never did a heart pant more ardently than mine to be distinguished though till very lately i looked in vain on every side for a ray of light it is easy then to guess how much i was gratified with the countenance and approbation of one of my countrys most illustrious sons when mr wauchope called on me yesterday on the part of your lordship your munificence my lord certainly deserves my very grateful acknowledgments but your patronage is a bounty peculiarly suited to my feelings i am not master enough of the etiquette of life to know whether there be not some impropriety in troubling your lordship with my thanks but my heart whispered me to do it from the emotions of my inmost soul i do it selfish ingratitude i hope i am incapable of and mercenary servility i trust i shall ever have so much honest pride as to detest r b

past redemption for i have still this favourable symptom of grace that when my conscience as in the case of this letter tells me i am leaving something undone that i ought to do it teases me eternally till i do it  i am still dark as was chaos in respect to futurity my generous friend mr patrick miller has been talking with me about a lease of some farm or other in an estate called dalswinton which he has lately bought near dumfries some liferented embittering recollections whisper me that i will be happier anywhere than in my old neighbourhood but mr miller is no judge of land and though i daresay he means to favour me yet he may give me in his opinion an advantageous bargain that may ruin me i am to take a tour by dumfries as i return and have promised to meet mr miller on his lands some time in may  i went to a masonlodge yesternight where the most worshipful grand master chartres and all the grand lodge of scotland visited the meeting was numerous and elegant all the different lodges about town were present in all their pomp the grand master who presided with great solemnity and honour to himself as a gentleman and mason among other general toasts gave caledonia and caledonias bard brother burns which rung through the whole assembly with multiplied honours and repeated acclamations as i had no idea such a thing would happen i was downright thunderstruck and trembling in every nerve made the best return in my power just as i had finished some of the grand officers said so loud that i could hear with a most comforting accent very well indeed which set me something to rights again  i have just now had a visit from my landlady29 who is a staid sober piouslydisposed viceabhorring widow coming on her climacteric she is at present in great tribulation respecting some daughters of belial who are on the floor immediately above my landlady who as i have said is a fleshdisciplining godly matron firmly believes her husband is in heaven and having been very happy with him on earth she vigorously and perseveringly practises such of the most distinguished christian virtues as attending church railing against vice etc that she may be qualified to meet him in that happy place where the ungodly shall never enter this no doubt requires some strong exertions of selfdenial in a hale wellkept widow of fortyfive and as our floors are low and illplastered we can easily distinguish our laughterloving nightrejoicing neighbours when they are eating drinking singing etc my worthy landlady tosses sleepless and unquiet looking for rest and finding none the whole night just now she told methough bytheby she is sometimes dubious that i am in her own phrase but a rough an roun christianthat we should not be uneasy or envious because the wicked enjoy the good things of this life for the jades would one day lie in hell etc etc  i have today corrected my 152nd page my best good wishes to mr aikini am ever dear sir your much indebted humble servant r b

current which i am this moment honoured with is a deep reproach to me for ungrateful neglect i will tell you the real truth for i am miserably awkward at a fibi wished to have written to dr moore before i wrote to you but though every day since i received yours of december 30th the idea the wish to write to him has constantly pressed on my thoughts yet i could not for my soul set about it i know his fame and character and i am one of the sons of little men to write him a mere matteroffact affair like a merchants order would be disgracing the little character i have and to write the author of the view of society and manners a letter of sentimenti declare every artery runs cold at the thought i shall try however to write to him tomorrow or next day his kind interposition on my behalf i have already experienced as a gentleman waited on me the other day on the part of lord eglinton with ten guineas by way of subscription for two copies of my next edition  the word you object to in the mention i have made of my glorious countryman and your immortal ancestor is indeed borrowed from thomson but it does not strike me as an improper epithet i distrusted my own judgment on your finding fault with it and applied for the opinion of some of the literati here who honour me with their critical strictures and they all allowed it to be proper the song you ask i cannot recollect and i have not a copy of it i have not composed anything on the great wallace except what you have seen in print and the inclosed which i will print in this edition30 you will see i have mentioned some others of the name when i composed my vision long ago i had attempted a description of kyle of which the additional stanzas are a part as it originally stood my heart glows with a wish to be able to do justice to the merits of the saviour of his country which sooner or later i shall at least attempt   you are afraid i shall grow intoxicated with my prosperity as a poet alas madam i know myself and the world too well i do not mean any airs of affected modesty i am willing to believe that my abilities deserve some notice but in a most enlightened informed age and nation when poetry is and has been the study of men of the first natural genius aided with all the powers of polite learning polite books and polite companyto be dragged forth to the full glare of learned and polite observation with all my imperfections of awkward rusticity and crude unpolished ideas on my headi assure you madam i do not dissemble when i tell you i tremble for the consequences the novelty of a poet in my obscure situation without any of those advantages which are reckoned necessary for that character at least at this time of day has raised a partial tide of public notice which has borne me to a height where i am absolutely feelingly certain my abilities are inadequate to support me and too surely do i see that time when the same tide will leave me and recede perhaps as far below the mark of truth i do not say this in the ridiculous affectation of selfabasement and modesty i have studied myself and know what ground i occupy and however a friend or the world may differ from me in that particular i stand for my own opinion in silent resolve with all the tenaciousness of property i mention this to you once for all to disburthen my mind and i do not wish to hear or say more about it but    when proud fortunes ebbing tide recedes  you will bear me witness that when my bubble of fame was at the highest i stood unintoxicated with the inebriating cup in my hand looking forward with rueful resolve to the hastening time when the blow of calumny should dash it to the ground with all the eagerness of vengeful triumph  your patronising me and interesting yourself in my fame and character as a poet i rejoice in it exalts me in my own idea and whether you can or cannot aid me in my subscription is a trifle has a paltry subscriptionbill any charms to the heart of a bard compared with the patronage of the descendant of the immortal wallace r b     footnote 30 stanza in the vision beginning by stately tower or    palace fair and ending with the first duan

who have felt the anxieties and solicitudes of authorship can only know what pleasure it gives to be noticed in such a manner by judges of the first character your criticisms sir i receive with reverence only i am sorry they mostly came too late a peccant passage or two that i would certainly have altered were gone to the press  the hope to be admired for ages is in by far the greater part of those even who are authors of repute an unsubstantial dream for my part my first ambition was and still my strongest wish is to please my compeers the inmates of the hamlet while everchanging language and manners shall allow me to be relished and understood i am very willing to admit that i have some poetical abilities and as few if any writers either moral or poetical are intimately acquainted with the classes of mankind among whom i have chiefly mingled i may have seen men and manners in a different phasis from what is common which may assist originality of thought still i know very well the novelty of my character has by far the greatest share in the learned and polite notice i have lately had and in a language where pope and churchill have raised the laugh and shenstone and gray drawn the tear where thomson and beattie have painted the landscape and lyttelton and collins described the heart i am not vain enough to hope for distinguished poetic fame r b     footnote

and distracted attention do me the justice to believe that my delay by no means proceeded from want of respect i feel and ever shall feel for you the mingled sentiments of esteem for a friend and reverence for a father  i thank you sir with all my soul for your friendly hints though i do not need them so much as my friends are apt to imagine you are dazzled with newspaper accounts and distant reports but in reality i have no great temptation to be intoxicated with the cup of prosperity novelty may attract the attention of mankind awhile to it i owe my present eclat but i see the time not far distant when the popular tide which has borne me to a height of which i am perhaps unworthy shall recede with silent celerity and leave me a barren waste of sand to descend at my leisure to my former station i do not say this in the affectation of modesty i see the consequence is unavoidable and am prepared for it i had been at a good deal of pains to form a just impartial estimate of my intellectual powers before i came here i have not added since i came to edinburgh anything to the account and i trust i shall take every atom of it back to my shades the coverts of my unnoticed early years  in dr blacklock whom i see very often i have found what i would have expected in our friend a clear head and an excellent heart  by far the most agreeable hours i spend in edinburgh must be placed to the account of miss lawrie and her pianoforte i cannot help repeating to you and mrs lawrie a compliment that mr mackenzie the celebrated man of feeling paid to miss lawrie the other night at the concert i had come in at the interlude and sat down by him till i saw miss lawrie in a seat not very far distant and went up to pay my respects to her on my return to mr mackenzie he asked me who she was i told him twas the daughter of a reverend friend of mine in the west country he returned there were something very striking to his idea in her appearance on my desiring to know what it was he was pleased to say she has a great deal of the elegance of a wellbred lady about her with all the sweet simplicity of a country girl  my compliments to all the happy inmates of st margaretsi am

advise me to fire my muse at scottish story and scottish scenes i wish for nothing more than to make a leisurely pilgrimage through my native country to sit and muse on those once hardcontended fields where caledonia rejoicing saw her bloody lion borne through broken ranks to victory and fame and catching the inspiration to pour the deathless names in song but my lord in the midst of these enthusiastic reveries a longvisaged dry morallooking phantom strides across my imagination and pronounces these emphatic words     i wisdom dwell with prudence friend i do not come to open the    illclosed wounds of your follies and misfortunes merely to give you    pain i wish through these wounds to imprint a lasting lesson on your    heart i will not mention how many of my salutary advices

zigzagged across the    path contemning me to my face you know the consequences it is not    yet three months since home was so hot for you that you were on the    wing for the western shore of the

scottish story are the themes i could wish to sing i have no dearer aim than to have it in my power unplagued with the routine of business for which heaven knows i am unfit enough to make leisurely pilgrimages through caledonia to sit on the fields of her battles to wander on the romantic banks of her rivers and to muse by the stately towers or venerable ruins once the honoured abodes of her heroes  but these are all utopian thoughts i have dallied long enough with life tis time to be in earnest i have a fond an aged mother to care for and some other bosom ties perhaps equally tender where the individual only suffers by the consequences of his own thoughtlessness indolence or folly he may be excusable nay shining abilities and some of the nobler virtues may half sanctify a heedless character but where god and nature have intrusted the welfare of others to his care where the trust is sacred and the ties are dear that man must be far gone in selfishness or strangely lost

dear friendon our return at a highland gentlemans hospitable mansion we fell in with a merry party and danced till the ladies left us at three in the morning our dancing was none of the french or english insipid formal movements the ladies sung scotch songs like angels at intervals then we flew at bab at the bowster tullochgorum loch erroch side39 etc like midges sporting in the mottie sun or craws prognosticating a storm in a hairst day when the dear lasses left us we ranged round the bowl till the goodfellow hour of six except a few minutes that we went out to pay our devotions to the glorious lamp of day peering over the towering top of benlomond we all kneeled our worthy landlords son held the bowl each man a full glass in his hand and i as priest repeated some rhyming nonsense like thomasarhymers prophecies i suppose after a small refreshment of the gifts of somnus we proceeded to spend the day on lochlomond and reached dumbarton in the evening we dined at another good fellows house and consequently pushed the bottle when we went out to mount our horses we found ourselves no vera fou but gaylie yet my two friends and i rode soberly down the loch side till by came a highlandman at the gallop on a tolerably good horse but which had never known the ornaments of iron or leather we scorned to be outgalloped by a highlandman so off we started whip and spur my companions though seemingly gaily mounted fell sadly astern but my old mare jenny geddes one of the rosinante family she strained past the highlandman in spite of all his efforts with the hair halter just as i was passing him donald wheeled his horse as if to cross before me to mar my progress when down came his horse and threw his riders breekless a in a clipt hedge and down came jenny geddes over all and my hardship between her and the highlandmans horse jenny geddes trode over me with such cautious reverence that matters were not so bad as might well have been expected so i came off with a few cuts and bruises and a thorough resolution to be a pattern of sobriety for the future  i have yet fixed on nothing with respect to the serious business of life i am just as usual a rhyming masonmaking raking aimless idle fellow however i shall somewhere have a farm soon i was going to say a wife too but that must never be my blessed lot i am but a younger son of the house of parnassus and like other younger sons of great families i may intrigue if i choose to run all risks but must not marry  i am afraid i have almost ruined one source the principal one indeed of my former happiness that eternal propensity i always had to fall in love my heart no more glows with feverish rapture i have no paradisiacal evening interviews stolen from the restless cares and prying inhabitants of this weary world i have only  this last is one of your distant acquaintances has a fine figure and elegant manners and in the train of some great folks whom you know has seen the politest quarters in europe i do like her a deal but what piques me is her conduct at the commencement of our acquaintance i frequently visited her when i was in  and after passing regularly the intermediate degrees between the distant formal bow and the familiar grasp round the waist i ventured in my careless way to talk of friendship in rather ambiguous terms and after her return to  i wrote to her in the same style miss construing my words farther i suppose than even i intended flew off in a tangent of female dignity and reserve like a mounting lark in an april morning and wrote me an answer which measured me out very completely what an immense way i had to travel before i could reach the climate of her favour but i am an old hawk at the sport and wrote her such a cool deliberate prudent reply as brought my bird from her aerial towerings pop down at my foot like corporal trims hat  as for the rest of my acts and my wars and all my wise sayings and why my mare was

richmond  mossgiel 7th july 1787  my dear richmondi am all impatience to hear of your fate since the old confounder of right and wrong has turned you out of place by his journey to answer his indictment at the bar of the other world he will find the practice of the court so different from the practice in which he has for so many years been thoroughly hackneyed that his friends if he had any connections truly of that kind which i rather doubt may well tremble for his sake his chicane his lefthanded wisdom which stood so firmly by him to such good purpose here like other accomplices in robbery and plunder will now the piratical business is blown in all probability turn kings evidences and then the devils bagpiper will touch him off bundle and go  if he has left you any legacy i beg your pardon for all this if not i know you will swear to every word i said about him  i have lately been rambling over by dumbarton and inverary and running a drunken race on the side of loch lomond with a wild highlandman his horse which had never known the ornaments of iron or leather zigzagged across before my old spavind hunter whose name is jenny geddes and down came the highlandman horse and all and down came jenny and my bardship so i have got such a skinful of bruises and wounds that i shall be at least four weeks before i dare venture on my journey to edinburgh  not one new thing under the sun has happened in mauchline since you left it i hope this will find you as comfortably situated as formerly or if heaven pleases more so but at all events i trust you will let me know of course how matters stand with you well or ill tis but poor consolation to tell the world when matters go wrong but you know very well your connection and mine stands on a different footingi am ever my

that i have not a friend upon earth besides yourself to whom i can talk nonsense without forfeiting some degree of his esteem now to one like me who never cares for speaking anything else but nonsense such a friend as you is an invaluable treasure i was never a rogue but have been a fool all my life and in spite of all my endeavours i see now plainly that i shall never be wise now it rejoices my heart to have met with such a fellow as you who though you are not just such a hopeless fool as i yet i trust you will never listen so much to temptation as to grow so very wise that you will in the least disrespect an honest fellow because he is a fool in short i have set you down as the staff of my old age when the whole list of my friends will after a decent share of pity have forgot me    though in the morn comes sturt and strife   yet joy may come at noon   and i hope to live a merry merry life   when a thir days are done  write me soon were it but a few lines just to tell me how that

sister leah  r b                                lvito dr moore  mauchline 2nd august 1787  sirfor some months past i have been rambling over the country but i am now confined with some lingering complaints originating as i take it in the stomach to divert my spirits a little in this miserable fog of ennui i have taken a whim to give you a history of myself my name has made some little noise in this country you have done me the honour to interest yourself very warmly in my behalf and i think a faithful account of what character of a man i am and how i came by that character may perhaps amuse you in an idle moment i will give you an honest narrative though i know it will be often at my own expense for i assure you sir i have like solomon whose character excepting in the trifling affair of wisdom i sometimes think i resemblei have i say like him turned my eyes to behold madness and folly and like him too frequently shaken hands with their intoxicating friendship after you have perused these pages should you think them trifling and impertinent i only beg leave to tell you that the poor author wrote them under some twitching qualms of conscience arising from a suspicion that he was doing what he ought not to do a predicament he has more than once been in before  i have not the most distant pretensions to assume that character which the pyecoated guardians of escutcheons call a gentleman when at edinburgh last winter i got acquainted in the heralds office and looking through that granary of honours i there found almost every name in the kingdom but for me    my ancient but ignoble blood   has crept thro scoundrels ever since the flood  gules purpure argent etc quite disowned me  my father was in the north of scotland the son of a farmer and was thrown by early misfortunes on the world at large where afier many years wanderings and sojournings he picked up a pretty large quantity of observation and experience to which i am indebted for most of my little pretensions to wisdom i have met with few who understood men their manners and their ways equal to him but stubborn ungainly integrity and headlong ungovernable irascibility are disqualifying circumstances consequently i was born a very poor mans son for the first six or seven years of my life my father was gardener to a worthy gentleman of small estate in the neighbourhood of ayr had he continued in that station i must have marched off to be one of the little underlings about a farm house but it was his dearest wish and prayer to have it in his power to keep his children under his own eye till they could discern between good and evil so with the assistance of his generous master my father ventured on a small farm on his estate at those years i was by no means a favourite with anybody i was a good deal noted for a retentive memory a stubborn sturdy something in my disposition and an enthusiastic idiot piety i say idiot piety because i was then but a child though it cost the schoolmaster some thrashings i made an excellent english scholar and by the time i was ten or eleven years of age i was a critic in substantives verbs and particles in my infant and boyish days too i owed much to an old woman who resided in the family remarkable for her ignorance credulity and superstition she had i suppose the largest collection in the country of tales and songs concerning devils ghosts fairies brownies witches warlocks spunkies kelpies elfcandles deadlights wraiths apparitions cantraips giants enchanted towers dragons and other trumpery this cultivated the latent seeds of poetry but had so strong an effect on my imagination that to this hour in my nocturnal rambles i sometimes keep a sharp look out in suspicious places and though nobody can be more sceptical than i am in such matters yet it often takes an effort of philosophy to shake off these idle terrors the earliest composition that i recollect taking pleasure in was the vision of mirza and a hymn of addisons beginning how are thy servants blest o lord i particularly remember one halfstanza which was music to my boyish ear    for though on dreadful whirls we hung      high on the broken wave  i met with these pieces in mansons english collection one of my schoolbooks the first two books i ever read in private and which gave me more pleasure than any two books i ever read since were the life of hannibal and the history of sir william wallace hannibal gave my young ideas such a turn that i used to strut in rapture up and down after the recruiting drum and bagpipe and wish myself tall enough to be a soldier while the story of wallace poured a scottish prejudice into my veins which will boil along there till the floodgates of life shut in eternal rest  polemical divinity about this time was putting the country half mad and i ambitious of shining in conversation parties on sundays between sermons at funerals etc used a few years afterwards to puzzle calvinism with so much heat and indiscretion that i raised a hue and cry of heresy against me which has not ceased to this hour  my vicinity to ayr was of some advantage to me my social disposition when not checked by some modifications of spirited pride was like our catechism definition of infinitude without bounds or limits i formed several connections with other younkers who possessed superior advantages the youngling actors who were busy in the rehearsal of parts in which they were shortly to appear on the stage of life where alas i was destined to drudge behind the scenes it is not commonly at this green stage that our young gentry have a just sense of the immense distance between them and their ragged playfellows it takes a few dashes into the world to give the young great man that proper decent unnoticing disregard for the poor insignificant stupid devils the mechanics and peasantry around him who were perhaps born in the same village my young superiors never insulted the clouterly appearance of my ploughboy carcase the two extremes of which were often exposed to all the inclemencies of all the seasons they would give me stray volumes of books among them even then i could pick up some observations and one whose heart i am sure not even the munny begum scenes have tainted helped me to a little french parting with these my young friends and benefactors as they occasionally went off for the east or west indies was often to me a sore affliction but i was soon called to more serious evils my fathers generous master died the farm proved a ruinous bargain and to clench the misfortune we fell into the hands of a factor who sat for the picture i have drawn of one in my tale of twa dogs my father was advanced in life when he married i was the eldest of seven children and he worn out by early hardships was unfit for labour my fathers spirit was soon irritated but not easily broken there was a freedom in his lease in two years more and to weather these two years we retrenched our expenses we lived very poorly i was a dexterous ploughman for my age and the next eldest to me was a brother gilbert who could drive a plough very well and help me to thrash the corn a novelwriter might perhaps have viewed these scenes with some satisfaction but so did not i my indignation yet boils at the recollection of the scoundrel factors insolent threatening letters which used to set us all in tears  this kind of lifethe cheerless gloom of a hermit with the unceasing moil of a galleyslave brought me to my sixteenth year a little before which period i first committed the sin of rhyme you know our country custom of coupling a man and woman together as partners in the labours of harvest in my fifteenth autumn my partner was a bewitching creature a year younger than myself my scarcity of english denies me the power of doing her justice in that language but you know the scottish idiom she was a bonnie sweet sonsie lass in short she altogether unwittingly to herself initiated me in that delicious passion which in spite of acid disappointment ginhorse prudence and bookworm philosophy i hold to be the first of human joys our dearest blessing here below how she caught the contagion i cannot tell you medical people talk much of infection from breathing the same air the touch etc but i never expressly said i loved her indeed i did not know myself why i liked so much to loiter behind with her when returning in the evening from our labours why the tones of her voice made my heartstrings thrill like an aeolian harp and particularly why my pulse beat such a furious ratan when i looked and fingered over her little hand to pick out the cruel nettlestings and thistles among her other loveinspiring qualities she sung sweetly and it was her favourite reel to which i attempted giving an embodied vehicle in rhyme i was not so presumptuous as to imagine that i could make verses like printed ones composed by men who had greek and latin but my girl sung a song which was said to be composed by a small country lairds son on one of his fathers maids with whom he was in love and i saw no reason why i might not rhyme as well as he for excepting that he could smear sheep and cast peats his father living in the moorlands he had no more scholarcraft than myself  thus with me began love and poetry which at times have been my only and till within the last twelve months have been my highest enjoyment my father struggled on till he reached the freedom in his lease when he entered on a larger farm about ten miles farther in the country the nature of the bargain he made was such as to throw a little ready money into his hands at the commencement of his lease otherwise the affair would have been impracticable for four years we lived comfortably here but a difference commencing between him and his landlord as to terms after three years tossing and whirling in the vortex of litigation my father was just saved from the horrors of a jail by a consumption which after two years promises kindly stepped in and carried him away to where the wicked cease from troubling and where the weary are at rest  it is during the time that we lived on this farm that my little story is most eventful i was at the beginning of this period perhaps the most ungainly awkward boy in the parishno solitaire was less acquainted with the ways of the world what i knew of ancient story was gathered from salmons and guthries geographical grammars and the ideas i had formed of modern manners of literature and criticism i got from the spectator these with popes works some plays of shakespeare tull and dickson on agriculture the pantheon lockes essay on the human understanding stackhouses history of the bible justices british gardeners directory boyles lectures allan ramsayss works taylors scripture doctrine of original sin a select collection of english songs and herveys meditations had formed the whole of my reading the collection of songs was my vade mecum i pored over them driving my cart or walking to labour song by song verse by verse carefully noting the true tender or sublime from affectation and fustian i am convinced i owe to this practice much of my criticcraft such as it is  in my seventeenth year to give my manners a brush i went to a country dancingschool my father had an unaccountable antipathy against these meetings and my going was what to this moment i repent in opposition to his wishes my father as i said before was subject to strong passions from that instance of disobedience in me he took a sort of dislike to me which i believe was one cause of the dissipation which marked my succeeding years i say dissipation comparatively with the strictness and sobriety and regularity of presbyterian country life for though the willowisp meteors of thoughtless whim were almost the sole lights of my path yet early ingrained piety and virtue kept me for several years afterwards within the line of innocence the great misfortune of my life was to want an aim i had felt early some stirrings of ambition but they were the blind gropings of homers cyclops round the walls of his cave i saw my fathers situation entailed on me perpetual labour the only two openings by which i could enter the temple of fortune were the gate of niggardly economy or the path of little chicaning bargainmaking the first is so contracted an aperture i never could squeeze myself into itthe last i always hatedthere was contamination in the very entrance thus abandoned of aim or view in life with a strong appetite for sociability as well from native hilarity as from a pride of observation and remark a constitutional melancholy or hypochondriasm that made me fly solitude add to these incentives to social life my reputation for bookish knowledge a certain wild logical talent and a strength of thought something like the rudiments of good sense and it will not seem surprising that i was generally a welcome guest where i visited or any great wonder that always where two or three met together there was i among them but far beyond all other impulses of my heart was un penchant à ladorable moitié du genre humain my heart was completely tinder and was eternally lighted up by some goddess or other and as in every other warfare in this world my fortune was various sometimes i was received with favour and sometimes i was mortified with a repulse at the plough scythe or reaphook i feared no competitor and thus i set absolute want at defiance and as i never cared further for my labours than while i was in actual exercise i spent the evenings in the way after my own heart a country lad seldom carries on a love adventure without an assisting confidant i possessed a curiosity zeal and intrepid dexterity that recommended me as a proper second on these occasions and i dare say i felt as much pleasure in being in the secret of half the loves of the parish of tarbolton as ever did statesman in knowing the intrigues of half the courts of europe the very goosefeather in my hand seems to know instinctively the wellworn path of my imagination the favourite theme of my song and is with difficulty restrained from giving you a couple of paragraphs on the loveadventures of my compeers the humble inmates of the farmhouse and cottage but the grave sons of science ambition or avarice baptise these things by the name of follies to the sons and daughters of labour and poverty they are matters of the most serious nature to them the ardent hope the stolen interview the tender farewell are the greatest and most delicious parts of their enjoyments  another circumstance in my life which made some alteration in my mind and manners was that i spent my nineteenth summer on a smuggling coast a good distance from home at a noted school to learn mensuration surveying dialling etc in which i made a pretty good progress but i made a greater progress in the knowledge of mankind the contraband trade was at that time very successful and it sometimes happened to me to fall in with those who carried it on scenes of swaggering riot and roaring dissipation were till this time new to me but i was no enemy to social life here though i learned to fill my glass and to mix without fear in a drunken squabble yet i went on with a high hand with my geometry till the sun entered virgo a month which is always a carnival in my bosom when a charming fillette who lived next door to the school overset my trigonometry and set me off at a tangent from the spheres of my studies i however struggled on with my sines and cosines for a few days more but stepping into the garden one charming noon to take the suns altitude there i met my angel         like proserpine gathering flowers    herself a fairer flower  it was in vain to think of doing any more good at school  the remaining week i staid i did nothing but craze the faculties of my soul about her or steal out to meet her and the two last nights of my stay in the country had sleep been a mortal sin the image of this modest and innocent girl had kept me guiltless  i returned home very considerably improved my reading was enlarged with the very important edition of thomsons and shenstones works i had seen human nature in a new phasis and i engaged several of my schoolfellows to keep up a literary correspondence with me this improved me in composition i had met with a collection of letters by the wits of queen annes reign and i pored over them most devoutly i kept copies of any of my own letters that pleased me and a comparison between them and the composition of most of my correspondents flattered my vanity i carried this whim so far that though i had not threefarthings worth of business in the world yet almost every post brought me as many letters as if i had been a broad plodding son of daybook and ledger  my life flowed on much in the same course till my twentythird year vive lamour et vive la bagatelle were my sole principles of action the addition of two more authors to my library gave me great pleasure sterne and mackenzietristram shandy and the man of feeling were my bosom favourites poesy was still a darling walk for my mind but it was only indulged in according to the humour of the hour i had usually halfadozen or more pieces on hand i took up one or other as it suited the momentary tone of the mind and dismissed the work as it bordered on fatigue my passions when once lighted up raged like so many devils till they got vent in rhyme and then the conning over my verses like a spell soothed all into quiet none of the rhymes of those days are in print except winter a dirge the eldest of my printed pieces the death of poor maillie john barleycorn and songs first second and third song second was the ebullition of that passion which ended the forementioned school business  my twentythird year was to me an important era partly through whim and partly that i wished to set about doing something in life i joined a flaxdresser in a neighbouring town irvine to learn his trade this was an unlucky affair my partner was a scoundrel of the first water and to finish the whole as we were giving a welcome carousal to the new year the shop took fire and burnt to ashes and i was left like a true poet not worth a sixpence  i was obliged to give up this scheme the clouds of misfortune were gathering thick round my fathers head and what was worst of all he was visibly far gone in a consumption and to crown my distresses a belle fille whom i adored and who had pledged her soul to meet me in the field of matrimony jilted me with peculiar circumstances of mortification the finishing evil that brought up the rear of this infernal file was my constitutional melancholy being increased to such a degree that for three months i was in a state of mind scarcely to be envied by the hopeless wretches who have got their mittimusdepart from me ye cursed  from this adventure i learned something of a town life but the principal thing which gave my mind a turn was a friendship i formed with a young fellow a very noble character but a hapless son of misfortune40 he was the son of a simple mechanic but a great man in the neighbourhood taking him under his patronage gave him a genteel education with a view of bettering his situation in life the patron dying just as he was ready to launch out into the world the poor fellow in despair went to sea where after a variety of good and ill fortune a little before i was acquainted with him he had been sent on shore by an american privateer on the wild coast of connaught stripped of everything i cannot quit this poor fellows story without adding that he is at this time master of a large westindiaman belonging to the thames  his mind was fraught with independence magnanimity and every manly virtue i loved and admired him to a degree of enthusiasm and of course strove to imitate him  in some measure i succeeded i had pride before but he taught it to flow in proper channels his knowledge of the world was vastly superior to mine and i was all attention to learn he was the only man i ever saw who was a greater fool than myself where woman was the presiding star but he spoke of illicit love with the levity of a sailor which hitherto i had regarded with horror here his friendship did me a mischief and the consequence was that soon after i resumed the plough i wrote the poets welcome my reading only increased while in this town by two stray volumes of pamela and one of ferdinand count fathom which gave me some idea of novels rhyme except some religious pieces that are in print i had given up but meeting with fergussons scottish poems i strung anew my wildlysounding lyre with emulating vigour when my father died his all went among the hellhounds that prowl in the kennel of justice but we made a shift to collect a little money in the family amongst us with which to keep us together my brother and i took a neighbouring farm my brother wanted my hairbrained imagination as well as my social and amorous madness but in good sense and every sober qualification he was far my superior  i entered on this farm with a full resolution come go to i will be wise i read farming books i calculated crops i attended markets and in short in spite of the devil and the world and the flesh i believe i should have been a wise man but the first year from unfortunately buying bad seed the second from a late harvest we lost half our crops this overset all my wisdom and i returned like the dog to his vomit and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire  i now began to be known in the neighbourhood as a maker of rhymes the first of my poetic offspring that saw the light was a burlesque lamentation on a quarrel between two reverend calvinists both of them dramatis personæ in my holy fair i had a notion myself that the piece had some merit but to prevent the worst i gave a copy of it to a friend who was very fond of such things and told him that i could not guess who was the author of it but that i thought it pretty clever with a certain description of the clergy as well as laity it met with a roar of applause holy willies prayer next made its appearance and alarmed the kirksession so much that they held several meetings to look over their spiritual artillery if haply any of it might be pointed against profane rhymers unluckily for me my wanderings led me on another side within pointblank shot of their heaviest metal this is the unfortunate story that gave rise to my printed poem the lament this was a most melancholy affair which i cannot yet bear to reflect on and had very nearly given me one or two of the principal qualifications for a place among those who have lost the chart and mistaken the reckoning of rationality i gave up my part of the farm to my brother in truth it was only nominally mine and made what little preparation was in my power for jamaica but before leaving my native country for ever i resolved to publish my poems i weighed my productions as impartially as was in my power i thought they had merit and it was a delicious idea that i should be called a clever fellow even though it should never reach my earsa poor negrodriveror perhaps a victim to that inhospitable clime and gone to the world of spirits i can truly say that pauvre inconnu as i then was i had pretty nearly as high an idea of myself and of my works as i have at this moment when the public has decided in their favour it ever was my opinion that the mistakes and blunders both in a rational and religious point of view of which we see thousands daily guilty are owing to their ignorance of themselves to know myself had been all along my constant study i weighed myself alone i balanced myself with others i watched every means of information to see how much ground i occupied as a man and as a poet i studied assiduously natures design in my formationwhere the lights and shades in my character were intended i was pretty confident my poems would meet with some applause but at the worst the roar of the atlantic would deafen the voice of censure and the novelty of west indian scenes make me forget neglect i threw off six hundred copies of which i had got subscriptions for about three hundred and fifty my vanity was highly gratified by the reception i met with from the public and besides i pocketed all expenses deducted nearly twenty pounds this sum came very seasonably as i was thinking of indenting myself for want of money to procure my passage as soon as i was master of nine guineas the price of wafting me to the torrid zone i took a steerage passage in the first ship that was to sail from the clyde for    hungry ruin had me in the wind  i had been for some days skulking from covert to covert under all the terrors of a jail as some illadvised people had uncoupled the merciless pack of the law at my heels i had taken the last farewell of my few friends my chest was on the road to greenock i had composed the last song i should ever measure in caledoniathe gloomy night is gathering fast when a letter from dr blacklock to a friend of mine overthrew all my schemes by opening new prospects to my poetic ambition the doctor belonged to a set of critics for whose applause i had not dared to hope his opinion that i would meet with encouragement in edinburgh for a second edition fired me so much that away i posted for that city without a single acquaintance or a single letter of introduction the baneful star that had so long shed its blasting influence in my zenith for once made a revolution to the nadir and a kind providence placed me under the patronage of one of the noblest of men the earl of glencairn oubliez moi grand dieu si jamais je loublie  i need relate no farther at edinburgh i was in a new world i mingled among many classes of men but all of them new to me and i was all attention to catch the characters and the manners living as they

still make him zigzag in his future path of life is very probable but come what will i shall answer for him the most determinate integrity and honour and though his evil star should again blaze in his meridian with tenfold more direful influence he may reluctantly tax friendship with pity but with no more  my most respectful compliments to miss williams41 the very elegant and friendly letter she honoured me with a few days ago i cannot answer at present as my presence is required at edinburgh for a week or so and i set off tomorrow  i enclose you holy willie for the sake of giving you a little further information of the affair than mr creech42 could do an elegy i composed the other day on sir james h blair if time allow i will transcribe the merit is just mediocre  if you will oblige

worthy man a mr nicol one of the masters of the highschool in edinburgh i left auld reekie yesterday morning and have passed besides byexcursions linlithgow borrowstounness falkirk and here am i undoubtedly this morning i knelt at the tomb of sir john the graham the gallant friend of the immortal wallace and two hours ago i said a fervent prayer for old caledonia over the hole in a blue whinstone where robert de bruce fixed his royal standard on the banks of bannockburn and just now from stirling castle i have seen by the setting sun the glorious prospect of the windings of forth through the rich carse of stirling and skirting the equally rich carse of falkirk the crops are very strong but so very late that there is no harvest except a ridge or two perhaps in ten miles all the way i have travelled from edinburgh  i left andrew bruce45 and family all well i will be at least three weeks in making my tour as i shall return by the coast and have many people to call for  my best

waving crops of wheat barley etc but no harvest at all yet except in one or two places an oldwifes ridge yesterday morning i rode from this town up the meandering devons banks to pay my respects to some ayrshire folks at harvieston after breakfast we made a party to go and see the famous caudronlinn a remarkable cascade in the devon about five miles above harvieston and after spending one of the most pleasant days i ever had in my life i returned to stirling in the evening they are a family sir though i had not had any prior tie though they had not been the brother and sisters of a certain generous friend of mine i would never forget them i am told you have not seen them these several years so you can have very little idea of what these young folks are now your brother47 is as tall as you are but slender rather than otherwise and i have the satisfaction to inform you that he is getting the better of those consumptive symptoms which i suppose you know were threatening him his make and particularly his manner resemble you but he will have a still finer face i put in the word still to please mrs hamilton good sense modesty and at the same time a just idea of that respect that man owes to man and has a right in his turn to exact are striking features in his character and what with me is the alpha and the omega he has a heart that might adorn the breast of a poet grace has a good figure and the look of health and cheerfulness but nothing else remarkable in her person i scarcely ever saw so striking a likeness as is between her and your little beenie the mouth and chin particularly she is reserved at first but as we grew better acquainted i was delighted with the native frankness of her manner and the sterling sense of her observation of charlotte i cannot speak in common terms of admiration she is not only beautiful but lovely her form is elegant her features not regular but they have the smile of sweetness and the settled complacency of good nature in the highest degree and her complexion now that she has happily recovered her wonted health is equal to miss burnets after the exercises of our riding to the falls charlotte was exactly dr donnes mistress      her pure and eloquent blood   spoke in her cheeks and so distinctly wrought   that one would almost say her body thought  her eyes are fascinating at once expressive of good sense tenderness and a noble mind  i do not give you all this account my good sir to flatter you i mean it to reproach you such relations the first peer in the realm might own with pride then why do you not keep up more correspondence with these so amiable young folks i had a thousand questions to answer about you i had to describe the little ones with the minuteness of anatomy they were highly delighted when i told them that john48 was so good a boy and so fine a scholar and that willie was going on still very pretty but i have it in commission to tell her from them that beauty is a poor silly bauble without she be good miss chalmers i had left in edinburgh but i had the pleasure of meeting with mrs chalmers only lady mackenzie being rather a little alarmingly ill of a sore throat somewhat marred our

halfhour i spent at bruar i do not mean it was extempore for i have endeavoured to brush it up as well as mr nicols chat and the jogging of the chaise would allow it eases my heart a good deal as rhyme is the coin with which a poet pays his debts of honour or gratitude what i owe to the noble family of athole of the first kind i shall ever proudly boast what i owe of the last so help me god in my hour of need i shall never forget  the little angelband i declare i prayed for them very sincerely today at the fall of fyers i shall never forget the fine familypiece i saw at blair the amiable the truly noble duchess with her smiling little seraph in her lap at the head of the table the lovely olive plants as the hebrew bard finely says round the happy mother the beautiful mrs g the lovely sweet miss c etc i wish i had the powers of guido to do them justice my lord dukes kind hospitalitymarkedly kind indeed mr graham of fintrys charms of conversation sir w murrays friendship in short

my dear siri arrived here safe yesterday evening after a tour of twentytwo days and travelling near six hundred miles windings included my farthest stretch was about ten miles beyond inverness i went through the heart of the highlands by crieff taymouth the famous seat of lord breadalbane down the tay among cascades and druidical circles of stones to dunkeld a seat of the duke of athole thence across tay and up one of his tributary streams to blair of athole another of the dukes seats where i had the honour of spending nearly two days with his grace and family thence many miles through a wild country among cliffs grey with eternal snows and gloomy savage glens till i crossed spey and went down the stream through strathspey so famous in scottish music badenoch etc till i reached grant castle where i spent half a day with sir james grant and family and then crossed the country for fort george but called by the way at cawdor the ancient seat of macbeth there i saw the identical bed in which tradition says king duncan was murdered lastly from fort george to inverness  i returned by the coast through nairn forres and so on to aberdeen thence to stonehive where james burness from montrose met me by appointment i spent two days among our relations and found our aunts jean and isabel still alive and hale old women john cairn though born the same year with our father walks as vigorously as i can they have had several letters from his son in new york william brand is likewise a stout old fellow but further particulars i delay till i see you which will be in two or three weeks the rest of my stages are not worth rehearsing warm as i was for ossians country where i had seen his very grave what cared i for fishingtowns or fertile carses i slept at the famous brodie of brodies one night and dined at gordon castle next day with the duke duchess and family i am thinking to cause my old mare to meet me by means of john ronald at glasgow but you shall hear farther from

was spending a few days at sir william murrays ochtertyre and did not get your obliging letter till today i came to town i was still more unlucky in catching a miserable cold for which the medical gentlemen have ordered me into close confinement under pain of death the severest of penalties in two or three days if i get better and if i hear at your lodgings that you are still at dalswinton i will take a ride to dumfries directly from something in your last i would wish to explain my idea of being your tenant i want to be a farmer in a small farm about a ploughgang in a pleasant country under the auspices of a good landlord i have no foolish notion of being a tenant on easier terms than another to find a farm where one can live at all is not easyi only mean living soberly like an oldstyle farmer and joining personal industry the banks of the nith are as sweet poetic ground as any i ever saw and besides sir tis but justice to the feelings of my own heart and the opinion of my best friends to say that i would wish to call you landlord sooner than any landed gentleman i know these are my views and wishes and in whatever way you think best to lay out your farms i shall be happy to rent one of them i shall certainly be able to ride to dalswinton about the middle of next week if i hear that you are not gonei have the honour to be sir your obliged humble servant  robert

most sincere thanks for the best poetical compliment i ever received i assure you sir as a poet you have conjured up an airy demon of vanity in my fancy which the best abilities in your other capacity would be ill able to lay i regret and while i live i shall regret that when i was in the north i had not the pleasure of paying a younger brothers dutiful respect to the author of the best scotch song ever scotland sawtullochgorums my delight the world may think slightingly of the craft of songmaking if they please but as job sayso that mine adversary had written a booklet them try there is a certain something in the old scotch songs a wild happiness of thought and expression which peculiarly marks them not only from english songs but also from the modern efforts of songwrights in our native manner and language the only remains of this enchantment these spells of the imagination rest with you our true brother ross of lochlee was likewise owre canniea wild warlockbut now he sings among the sons of the morning  i have often wished and will certainly endeavour to form a kind of common acquaintance among all the genuine sons of caledonian song the world busy in low prosaic pursuits may overlook most of us but reverence thyself the world is not our peers so we challenge the jury we can lash that world and find ourselves a very great source of amusement and happiness independent of that world  there is a work53 going on in edinburgh just now which claims your best assistance an engraver in this town has set about collecting and publishing all the scotch songs with the music that can be found songs in the english language if by scotchmen are admitted but the music must all be scotch drs beattie and blacklock are lending a hand and the first musician in town presides over that department i have been absolutely crazed about it collecting old stanzas and every information remaining respecting their origin authors etc etc this last is but a very fragment business but at the end of his second numberthe first is already publisheda small account will be given of the authors particularly to preserve those of latter times your three songs tullochgorum john of badenyon and ewie wi the crookit horn go in this second number i was determined before i got your letter to write you begging that you would let me know where the editions of these pieces may be found as you would wish them to continue in future times and if you would be so kind to this undertaking as send any songs of your own or others that you would think proper to publish your name will be inserted among the other authors nill ye will ye onehalf of scotland already give your songs to other authors paper is done i beg to hear from you the sooner the better as i leave edinburgh in a

dissimulation in the language of the heart i am determined to pay charlotte a poetic compliment if i could hit on some glorious old scotch air in number second54 you will see a small attempt on a shred of paper in the book but though dr blacklock commended it very highly i am not just satisfied with it myself i intend to make it a description of some kind the whining cant of love except in real passion and by a masterly hand is to me as insufferable as the preaching cant of old father smeaton whigminister at kilmaurs darts flames cupids loves graces and all that farrago are just a mauchlinea senseless rabble  i got an excellent poetic epistle yesternight from the old venerable author of tullochgorum john of badenyon etc i suppose you know he is a clergyman it is by far the finest poetic compliment i ever got i will send you a copy of it  i go on thursday or friday to dumfries to wait on mr miller about his farms do tell that to lady mackenzie that she may give me credit for a little wisdom i wisdom dwell with prudence what a blessed fireside how happy should i be to pass a winter evening under their venerable roof and smoke a pipe of tobacco or drink watergruel with them what solemn lengthened laughterquashing gravity of phiz what sage remarks on the goodfornothing sons and daughters of indiscretion and folly and what frugal lessons as we straitened the fireside circle on the uses of the poker and tongs  miss n is very well and begs to be remembered in the old way to you i used all my eloquence all the persuasive flourishes of the hand and heartmelting modulation of periods in my power to urge her out to harvieston but all in vain my rhetoric seems quite to have lost its effect on the lovely half of mankind i have seen the daybut this is a tale of other years in my conscience i believe that my heart has been so oft on fire that it is absolutely vitrified i look on the sex with something like the admiration with which i regard the starry sky in a frosty december night i admire the beauty of the creators workmanship i am charmed with the wild but graceful eccentricity of their motions andwish them goodnight i mean this with respect to a certain passion dont jat eu lhonneur detre un miserable esclave as for friendship you and charlotte have given me pleasure permanent pleasure which the world cannot give nor take away i hope and which

of correspondence and friendship to me you do me too much honour but as i shall soon be at my wonted leisure and rural occupation if any remark on what i have read or seen or any new rhyme that i may twist be worth the while  you shall have it with all my heart and soul it requires no common exertion of good sense and philosophy in persons of elevated rank to keep a friendship properly alive with one much their inferior externals things wholly extraneous of the man steal upon the hearts and judgments of almost if not altogether all mankind nor do i know more than one instance of a man who fully regards all the world as a stage and all the men and women merely players and who the dancingschool bow excepted only values these players the dramatis personæ who build cities and who rear hedges who govern provinces or superintend flocks merely as they act their parts for the honour of ayrshire this man is professor dugald stewart of catrine to him i might perhaps add another instance a popish bishop geddes of edinburgh i ever could ill endure those  beasts of prey who foul the hallowed ground of religion with their nocturnal prowlings and if the prosecution against my worthy friend dr mcgill goes on i shall keep no measure with the savages but fly at them with the faucons of ridicule or run them down with the bloodhounds of satire as lawful game wherever i start them  i expect to leave edinburgh in eight or ten days and shall certainly do myself the honour of calling at dunlop house as i return to ayrshirei have the honour to be madam your obliged humble servant

impulse of gratitude and esteem whispered to me that i ought to send you something by way of return when a poet owes anything particularly when he is indebted for good offices the payment that usually recurs to himthe only coin indeed in which he is probably conversantis rhyme johnson sends the books by the fly as directed and begs me to inclose his most grateful thanks my return i intended should have been one or two poetic bagatelles which the world have not seen or perhaps for obvious seasons cannot see these i shall send you before i leave edinburgh they may make you laugh a little which on the whole is no bad way of spending ones precious hours and still more precious breath at any rate they will be though a small yet a very sincere mark of my respectful esteem for a gentleman whose farther acquaintance i should look upon as a peculiar obligation  the dukes song independent totally of his dukeship charms me there is i know not what of wild happiness of thought and expression peculiarly beautiful in the old scottish song style of which his grace old venerable skinner the author of tullochgorum etc and the late ross at lochlee of true scottish poetic memory are the only modern instances that i recollect since ramsay with his contemporaries and poor bob fergusson went to the world of deathless existence and truly immortal song the mob of mankind that manyheaded beast would laugh at so serious a speech about an old song but as job says o that mine adversary had written a book those who think that composing a scotch song is a trifling businesslet them try  i wish my lord duke would pay a proper attention to the christian admonition hide not your candle under a bushel but let your light shine before men i could name halfadozen dukes that i guess are a deal worse

effectuate it i wish to get into the excise i am told that your lordships interest will easily procure me the grant from the commissioners and your lordships patronage and goodness which have already rescued me from obscurity wretchedness and exile embolden me to ask that interest you have likewise put it in my power to save the little tie of home that sheltered an aged mother two brothers and three sisters from destruction there my lord you have bound me over to the highest gratitude  my brothers farm is but a wretched lease but i think he will probably weather out the remaining seven years of it and after the assistance which i have given and will give him to keep the family together i think by my guess i shall have rather better than two hundred pounds and instead of seeking what is almost impossible at present to find a farm that i can certainly live by with so small a stock i shall lodge this sum in a bankinghouse a sacred deposit excepting only the calls of uncommon distress or necessitous old age  these my lord are my views i have resolved from the maturest deliberation and now i am fixed i shall leave no stone unturned to carry my resolve into execution your lordships patronage is the strength of my hopes nor have i yet applied to anybody else indeed my heart sinks within me at the idea of applying to any other of the great who have honoured me with their countenance i am illqualified to dog the heels of greatness with the impertinence of solicitation and tremble nearly as much at the thought of the cold promise as the cold denial but to your lordship

share my willowisp fate you know do you recollect a sunday we spent together in eglinton woods you told me on my repeating some verses to you that you wondered i could resist the temptation of sending verses of such merit to a magazine it was from this remark i derived that idea of my own pieces which encouraged me to endeavour at the character of a poet i am happy to hear that you will be two or three months at home as soon as a bruised limb will permit me i shall return to ayrshire and we shall meet and faith i hope well not sit dumb nor yet cast out  i have much to tell you of men their manners and their ways perhaps a little of the other sex apropos i beg to be remembered to mrs brown there i doubt not my dear friend but you have found substantial happiness i expect to find you something of an altered but not a different man the wild bold generous young fellow composed into the steady affectionate husband and the fond careful parent for me i am just the same willowisp being

out lately i was a sixpenny private and god knows a miserable soldier enough now i march to the campaign a starving cadet a little more conspicuously wretched  i am ashamed of all this for though i do want bravery for the warfare of life i could wish like some other soldiers to have as much fortitude or cunning as to dissemble or conceal my cowardice  as soon as i can bear the journey which will be

acquaintance your songs appear in the third volume with your name in the index as i assure you sir i have heard your tullochgorum particularly among our westcountry folks given to many different names

of your kindness it may be said of hearts such as yours is and such i hope mine is much more justly than addison applies it    some souls by instinct to each other turn  there was something in my reception at kilravock so different from the cold obsequious dancingschool bow of politeness that it almost got into my head that friendship had occupied her ground without the intermediate march of acquaintance i wish i could transcribe or rather transfuse into language the glow of my heart when i read your letter my ready fancy with colours more mellow than life itself painted the beautifully wild scenery of kilravockthe venerable grandeur of the castlethe spreading woodsthe winding river gladly leaving his unsightly heathy source and lingering with apparent delight as he passes the fairy walk at the bottom of the gardenyour late distressful anxietiesyour present enjoymentsyour dear little angel the pride of your hopesmy aged friend venerable in worth and years whose loyalty and other virtues will strongly entitle her to the support of the almighty spirit here and his peculiar favour in a happier state of existence you cannot imagine madam how much such feelings delight me they are my dearest proofs of my own immortality should i never revisit the north as probably i never will nor again see your hospitable mansion were i some twenty years hence to see your little fellows name making a proper figure in a newspaper paragraph my heart would bound with pleasure  i am assisting a friend in a collection of scottish songs set to their proper tunes every air worth preserving is to

grateful esteem i beg leave to present you with a copy of the work as far as it is printed the man of feeling that first of men has promised to transmit it by the first opportunity  i beg to be remembered most respectfully to my venerable friend and to your little highland chieftain when you see the two fair spirits of the hill at kildrummie tell them that i have done myself the honour of setting myself down as one of their admirers for at least twenty years to come consequently they must look upon me as an acquaintance for the same period but as the apostle paul says this i ask of

after fighting my way through paisley and kilmarnock against those old powerful foes of mine the devil the world and the fleshso terrible in the fields of dissipation i have met with few incidents in my life which gave me so much pleasure as meeting you in glasgow there is a time of life beyond which we cannot form a tie worth the name of friendship o youth enchanting stage profusely blest life is a fairy scene almost all that deserves the name of enjoyment or pleasure is only a charming delusion and in comes repining age in all the gravity of hoary wisdom and wretchedly chases away the bewitching phantom when i think of life i resolve to keep a strict lookout in the course of economy for the sake of worldly convenience and independence of mind to cultivate intimacy with a few of the companions of youth that they may be the friends of age never to refuse my liquorish humour a handful of the sweetmeats of life when they come not too dear and for futurity    the present moment is

the savage hospitality of this country the object of all hosts being to send every guest drunk to bed if they can  i executed your commission in glasgow and i hope the cocoa came safe twas the same price and the very same kind as your former parcel for the gentleman recollected your buying there perfectly well  i should return my thanks for your hospitality i leave a blank for the epithet as i know none can do it justice to a poor wayfaring bard who was spent and almost overpowered fighting with prosaic wickedness in high places but i am afraid lest you should burn the letter whenever you come to the passage so i pass over it in silence i am just returned from visiting mr millers farm the friend whom i told you i would take with me was highly pleased with the farm and as he is without exception the most intelligent farmer in the country he has staggered me a good deal i have the two plans of life before me i shall balance them to the best of my judgment and fix on the most eligible i have written mr miller and shall wait on him when i come to town which shall be the beginning or middle of next week i would be in sooner but my unlucky knee is rather worse and i fear for some time will scarcely stand the fatigue of my excise instructions i only mention these ideas to you and indeed except mr ainslie whom i intend writing to tomorrow i will not write at all to edinburgh till i return to it i would send my compliments to mr nicol but he would be hurt if he knew i wrote to anybody and not to him so i shall only beg my best kindest kindest compliments to my worthy hostess and the sweet little rosebud  so soon as i am settled in the routine of life either as an exciseofficer or as a farmer i propose myself great pleasure from a regular correspondence with the only man almost i ever saw who joined the most attentive prudence with the warmest generosity  i am much interested for that best of men mr wood i hope he is in better health and spirits than when i saw him

3rd march 1788  my dear friendi am just returned from mr millers farm my old friend whom i took with me was highly pleased with the bargain and advised me to accept of it he is the most intelligent sensible farmer in the county and his advice has staggered me a good deal i have the two plans before me i shall endeavour to balance them to the best of my judgment and fix on the most eligible on the whole if i find mr miller in the same favourable disposition as when i saw him last i shall in all probability turn farmer  i have been through sore tribulation and under much buffetting of the wicked one since i came to this country jean i found banished forlorn destitute and friendless i have reconciled her to her fate and i have reconciled her to her mother i swore her privately and solemnly never to attempt any claim on me as a husband even though anybody should persuade her she had such a claim  i shall be in edinburgh middle of next week my farming ideas i shall keep private till i see i got a letter from clarinda yesterday and she tells me she has got no letter of mine but one tell her that i wrote to her from glasgow from kilmarnock from mauchline and yesterday from cumnock as i returned from dumfries indeed she is the only person in edinburgh i have written to till this day how are your soul and body putting upa little like man and wife i supposeyour faithful

now when i am afraid you will be gone out of the country too i have been looking at farms and after all perhaps i may settle in the character of a farmer i have got so vicious a bent to idleness and have ever been so little a man of business that it will take no ordinary effort to bring my mind properly into the routine but you will say a great effort is worthy of you i say so myself and butter up my vanity with all the stimulating compliments i can think of men of grave geometrical minds the sons of which was to be demonstrated may cry up reason as much as they please but i have always found an honest passion or native instinct the truest auxiliary in the warfare of this world reason almost always comes to me like an unlucky wife to a poor devil of a husband just in sufficient time to add her reproaches to his other grievances  i am gratified with your kind inquiries after jean as after all i may say with othello    excellent wretch   perdition catch my soul but i do love thee

you i took old glenconner with me to mr millers farm and he was so pleased with it that i have wrote an offer to mr miller which if he accepts i shall sit down a plain farmer the happiest of lives when a man can live by it in this case i shall not stay in edinburgh above a week i set out on monday and would have come by kilmarnock but there are several small sums owing me for my first edition about galston and newmilns and i shall set off so early as to despatch my business and reach glasgow by night when i return i shall devote a forenoon or two to make some kind of acknowledgment for all the kindness i owe your friendship now that i hope to settle with some credit and comfort at home there was not any friendship or friendly correspondence that promised me more pleasure than yours i hope i will not be disappointed i trust the spring will renew your shattered frame and make your friends happy you and i have often agreed that life is no great blessing on the whole the close of life indeed to a reasoning age is    dark as was chaos ere the infant sun   was rolld together or had tried his beams   athwart the gloom profound  but an honest man has nothing to fear if we lie down in the grave the whole man a piece of broken machinery to moulder with the clods of the valley be it so at least there is an end of pain care woes and wants if that part of us called mind does survive the apparent destruction of the manaway with oldwife prejudices and tales every age and every nation has had a different set of stories and as the many are always weak of consequence they have often perhaps always been deceived a man conscious of having acted an honest part among his fellowcreatureseven granting that he may have been the sport at times of passions and instinctshe goes to a great unknown being who could have no other end in giving him existence but to make him happy who gave him those passions and instincts and well knows their force  these my worthy friend are my ideas and i know they are not far different from yours it becomes a man of sense to think for himself particularly in a case where all men are equally interested and where indeed all men are equally in the dark

so i shall begin my answer where you ended your letter that i am often a sinner with any little wit i have i do confess but i have taxed my recollection to no purpose to find out when it was employed against you i hate an ungenerous sarcasm a great deal worse than i do the devilat least as milton describes him and though i may be rascally enough to be sometimes guilty of it myself i cannot endure it in others you my honoured friend who cannot appear in any light but you are sure of being respectableyou can afford to pass by an occasion to display your wit because you may depend for fame on your sense or if you choose to be silent you know you can rely on the gratitude of many and the esteem of all but god help us who are wits or witlings by profession if we stand not for fame there we sink unsupported  i am highly flattered by the news you tell me of coila i may say to the fair painter60 who does me so much honour as dr beattie says to ross the poet of his muse scota from which by

savage hospitality which knocks a man down with strong liquors is the devil i have a sore warfare in this world the devil the world and the flesh are three formidable foes the first i generally try to fly from the second alas generally flies from me but the third is my plague worse than the ten plagues of egypt  i have been looking over several farms in this country one in particular in nithsdale pleased me so well that if my offer to the proprietor is accepted i shall commence farmer at whitsunday if farming do not appear eligible i shall have recourse to any other shift but this to a friend  i set out for edinburgh on monday morning how long i stay there is uncertain but you will know so soon as i can inform you myself however i determine poesy must be laid aside for some time my mind has been vitiated with idleness and it will take a good deal of effort to habituate it to the routine of businessi am my dear sir yours sincerely r b                                lxxxiiito miss chalmers

dalswinton for the farm of ellisland on the banks of the nith between five and six miles above dumfries i begin at whitsunday to build a house drive lime etc and heaven be my help for it will take a strong effort to bring my mind into the routine of business i have discharged all the army of my former pursuits fancies and pleasuresa motley host and have literally and strictly retained only the ideas of a few friends which i have incorporated into a lifeguard i trust in dr johnsons observation where much is attempted something is done firmness both in sufferance and exertion is a character i would wish to be thought to possess and have always despised the whining yelp of complaint and the cowardly feeble resolve  poor miss k61 is ailing a good deal this winter and begged me to remember her to you the first time i wrote to you surely woman amiable woman is often made in vain too delicately formed for the rougher pursuits of ambition too noble for the dirt of avarice and even too

    the clarinda letters   note prefatory to the letters to clarinda  we have now arrived in the history of burns as his general correspondence reveals it at the middle of march 1788 before the end of the month he had broken off from clarinda and shortly afterwards he married jean armour the correspondence with clarinda began in the last month of 1787 and ran its course in three months it is now necessary to go back to the commencement of this correspondence and to follow it down to its first conclusion at the point to which his general correspondence has brought us it has been thought preferable to take it by itself  clarindas maiden name was agnes craig she was the daughter of mr andrew craig who had been a surgeon in glasgow lord craig of the court of session was her cousin she was born in the same year as burns but three months later at the age of seventeen she was married to mr james mlehose a law agent in glasgow incompatibility of temper resulted in a separation of the unhappy pair five years after their marriage the lady went home to her father and on his death in 1782 removed to edinburgh where she lived independently on a small annuity her two sons lived with her her husband meanwhile went out to the west indies to push his fortune     letters to clarinda  i  thursday evening dec 6th 1787  madami had set no small store by my teadrinking tonight and have not often been so disappointed saturday evening i shall embrace the opportunity with the greatest pleasure i leave this town this day seennight and probably for a couple of twelvemonths but must ever regret that i so lately got an acquaintance i shall ever highly esteem and in whose welfare i shall ever be warmly interested  our worthy common friend in her usual pleasant way rallied me a good deal on my new acquaintance and in the humour of her ideas i wrote some lines which i inclose you as i think they have a good deal of poetic merit and miss nimmo tells me you are not only a critic but a poetess fiction you know is the native region of poetry and i hope you will pardon my vanity in sending you the bagatelle as a tolerably offhand jeudesprit i have several poetic trifles which i shall gladly leave with miss nimmo or you if they were worth house room as there are scarcely two people on earth by whom it would mortify me more to be forgotten though at the distance of ninescore milesi am madam with the highest respect your very humble servant  robert burns                                ii  saturday evening dec 8th 1787  i can say with truth madam that i never met with a person in my life whom i more anxiously wished to meet again than yourself tonight i was to have had that very great pleasure i was intoxicated with the idea but an unlucky fall from a coach has so bruised one of my knees that i cant stir my leg so if i dont see you again i shall not rest in my grave for chagrin i was vexed to the soul i had not seen you sooner i determined to cultivate your friendship with the enthusiasm of religion but thus has fortune ever served me i cannot bear the idea of leaving edinburgh without seeing you i know not how to account for iti am strangely taken with some people nor am i often mistaken you are a stranger to me but i am an odd being some yet unnamed feelings things not principles but better than whims carry me farther than boasted reason ever did a philosopher farewell every happiness be yours robert burns                                iii  dec 12 1787  i stretch a point indeed my dearest madam when i answer your card on the rack of my present agony your friendship madam by heavens i was never proud before your lines i maintain it are poetry and good poetry mine were indeed partly fiction and partly a friendship which had i been so blest as to have met with you in time might have led megod of love only knows where time is too short for ceremonies i swear solemnly in all the tenor of my former oath to remember you in all the pride and warmth of friendship until i cease to be tomorrow and every day till i see you you shall hear from me farewell may you enjoy a better nights repose than i am likely to have r b                                iv  thursday dec 20 1787  your last my dear madam had the effect on me that jobs situation had on his friends when they sat down seven days and seven nights astonished and spake not a word pay my addresses to a married woman i started as if i had seen the ghost of him i had injured i recollected my expressions some of them were indeed in the law phrase habit and repute which is being half guilty i cannot possibly say madam whether my heart might not have gone astray a little but i can declare upon the honour of a poet that the vagrant has wandered unknown to me i have a pretty handsome troop of follies of my own and like some other peoples they are but undisciplined blackguards but the luckless rascals have something like honour in themthey would not do a dishonest thing  to meet with an unfortunate woman amiable and young deserted and widowed by those who were bound by every tie of duty nature and gratitude to protect comfort and cherish her add to all when she is perhaps one of the first of lovely forms and noble mindsthe mind too that hits ones taste as the joys of heaven do a saintshould a faint idea the natural child of imagination thoughtfully peep over the fencewere you my friend to sit in judgment and the poor airy straggler brought before you trembling selfcondemned with artless eyes brimful of contrition looking wistfully on its judgeyou could not my dear madam condemn the hapless wretch to death without benefit of clergy i wont tell you what reply my heart made to your raillery of seven years but i will give you what a brother of my trade says on the same allusion    the patriarch to gain a wife   chaste beautiful and young   served fourteen years a painful life   and never thought it long    o were you to reward such cares     and life so long would stay   not fourteen but four hundred years     would seem but as a day62  i have written you this scrawl because i have nothing else to do and you may sit down and find fault with it if you have no better way of consuming your time but finding fault with the vagaries of a poets fancy is much such another business as xerxes chastising the waves of hellespont  my limb now allows me to sit in some peace to walk i have yet no prospect of as i cant mark it to the ground  i have just now looked over what i have written and it is such a chaos of nonsense that i daresay you will throw it into the fire and call me an idle stupid fellow but whatever you may think of my brains believe me to be with the most sacred respect and heartfelt esteem my dear madam your humble servant robt burns     footnote 62 tom durfeys songs                                v  friday evening 28th december 1787  i beg your pardon my dear clarinda for the fragment scrawl i sent you yesterday i really do not know what i wrote a gentleman for whose character abilities and critical knowledge i have the highest veneration called in just as i had begun the second sentence and i would not make the porter wait i read to my muchrespected friend several of my own bagatelles and among others your lines which i had copied out he began some criticisms on them as on the other pieces when i informed him they were the work of a young lady in this town which i assure you made him stare my learned friend seriously protested that he did not believe any young woman in edinburgh was capable of such lines and if you know anything of professor gregory you will neither doubt of his abilities nor his sincerity i do love you if possible still better for having so fine a taste and turn for poesy i have again gone wrong in my usual unguarded way but you may erase the word and put esteem respect or any other tame dutch expression you please in its place i believe there is no holding converse or carrying on correspondence with an amiable woman much less a gloriously amiable fine woman without some mixture of that delicious passion whose most devoted slave i have more than once had the honour of being but why be hurt or offended on that account can no honest man have a prepossession for a fine woman but he must run his head against an intrigue take a little of the tender witchcraft of love and add to it the generous the honourable sentiments of manly friendship and i know but one more delightful morsel which few few in any rank ever taste such a composition is like adding cream to strawberries it not only gives the fruit a more elegant richness but has a deliciousness of its own  i inclose you a few lines i composed on a late melancholy occasion i will not give above five or six copies of it in all and i should be hurt if any friend should give any copies without my consent  you cannot imagine clarinda i like the idea of arcadian names in a commerce of this kind how much store i have set by the hopes of your future friendship i do not know if you have a just idea of my character but i wish you to see me as i am i am as most people of my trade are a strange willowisp being the victim too frequently of much imprudence and many follies my great constituent elements are pride and passion the first i have endeavoured to humanise into integrity and honour the last makes me a devotee to the warmest degree of enthusiasm in love religion or friendshipeither of them or all together as i happen to be inspired tis true i never saw you but once but how much acquaintance did i form with you in that once do not think i flatter you or have a design upon you clarinda i have too much pride for the one and too little cold contrivance for the other but of all gods creatures i ever could approach in the beaten way of my acquaintance you struck me with the deepest the strongest the most permanent impression i say the most permanent because i know myself well and how far i can promise either on my prepossessions or powers why are you unhappy and why are so many of our fellowcreatures unworthy to belong to the same species with you blest with all they can wish you have a hand all benevolent to givewhy were you denied the pleasure you have a heart formedgloriously formedfor all the most refined luxuries of lovewhy was that heart ever wrung o clarinda shall we not meet in a state some yet unknown state of being where the lavish hand of plenty shall minister to the highest wish of benevolence and where the chill northwind of prudence shall never blow over the flowery fields of enjoyment if we do not man was made in vain i deserved most of the unhappy hours that have lingered over my head they were the wages of my labour but what unprovoked demon malignant as hell stole upon the confidence of unmistrusting busy fate and dashed your cup of life with undeserved sorrow  let me know how long your stay will be out of town i shall count the hours till you inform me of your return cursed etiquette forbids your seeing me just now and so soon as i can walk i must bid edinburgh adieu lord why was i born to see misery which i cannot relieve and to meet with friends whom i cannot enjoy i look back with the pang of unavailing avarice on my loss in not knowing you sooner all last winter these three months past what luxury of intercourse have i not lost perhaps thoughtwas better for my peace you see i am either above or incapable of dissimulation i believe it is want of that particular genius i despise design because i want either coolness or wisdom to be capable of it i am interrupted adieu my dear clarinda  sylvander                                vi  thursday jan 3 1788  you are right my dear clarinda a friendly correspondence goes for nothing except one writes his or her undisguised sentiments yours please me for their instrinsic merit as well as because they are yours which i assure you is to me a high recommendation your religious sentiments madam i revere if you have on some suspicious evidence from some lying oracle learned that i despise or ridicule so sacredly important a matter as real religion you have my clarinda much misconstrued your friend i am not mad most noble festus have you ever met a perfect character do we not sometimes rather exchange faults than get rid of them for instance i am perhaps tired with and shocked at a life too much the prey of giddy inconsistencies and thoughtless follies by degrees i grow sober prudent and statedly piousi say statedly because the most unaffected devotion is not at all inconsistent with my first characteri join the world in congratulating myself on the happy change but let me pry more narrowly into this affair have i at bottom any thing of a sacred pride in these endowments and emendations have i nothing of a presbyterian sourness an hypocritical severity when i survey my less regular neighbours in a word have i missed all those nameless and numberless modifications of indistinct selfishness which are so near our own eyes that we can scarcely bring them within the sphere of our vision and which the known spotless cambric of our character hides from the ordinary observer  my definition of worth is short truth and humanity respecting our fellowcreatures reverence and humility in the presence of that being my creator and preserver and who i have every reason to believe will one day be my judge the first part of my definition is the creature of unbiassed instinct the last is the child of after reflection where i found these two essentials i would gently note and slightly mention any attendant flawsflaws the marks the consequences of human nature  i can easily enter into the sublime pleasures that your strong imagination and keen sensibility must derive from religion particularly if a little in the shade of misfortune but i own i cannot without a marked grudge see heaven totally engross so amiable so charming a woman as my friend clarinda and should be very well pleased at a circumstance that would put it in the power of somebody happy somebody to divide her attention with all the delicacy and tenderness of an earthly attachment  you will not easily persuade me that you have not a grammatical knowledge of the english language so far from being inaccurate you are elegant beyond any woman of my acquaintance except onewhom i wish you knew  your last verses to me have so delighted me that i have got an excellent old scots air that suits the measure and you shall see them in print in the scots musical museum a work publishing by a friend of mine in this town i want four stanzas you gave me but three and one of them alluded to an expression in my former letter so i have taken your two first verses with a slight alteration in the second and have added a third but you must help me to a fourth here they are the latter half of the first stanza would have been worthy of sappho i am in raptures with it    talk not of love it gives me pain     for love has been my foe   he bound me with an iron chain     and sunk me deep in woe    but friendships pure and lasting joys     my heart was formed to prove   there welcome win and wear the prize     but never talk of love    your friendship much can make me blest     o why that bliss destroy                only   why urge the odious one request                will     you know i must deny  the alteration in the second stanza is no improvement but there was a slight inaccuracy in your rhyme the third i only offer to your choice and have left two words for your determination the air is the banks of spey and is most beautiful  tomorrow evening i intend taking a chair and paying a visit at park place to a muchvalued old friend63 if i could be sure of finding you at home and i will send one of the chairmen to call i would spend from five to six oclock with you as i go past i cannot do more at this time as i have something on my hand that hurries me much i propose giving you the first call my old friend the second and miss nimmo as i return home do not break any engagement for me as i will spend another evening with you at any rate before i leave town  do not tell me that you are pleased when your friends inform you of your faults i am ignorant what they are but i am sure they must be such evanescent trifles compared with your personal and mental accomplishments that i would despise the ungenerous narrow soul who would notice any shadow of imperfections you may seem to have any other way than in the most delicate agreeable raillery coarse minds are not aware how much they injure the keenly feeling tie of bosom friendship when in their foolish officiousness they mention what nobody cares for recollecting people of nice sensibility and generous minds have a certain intrinsic dignity that fires at being trifled with or lowered or even too nearly approached  you need make no apology for long letters i am even with you many happy new years to you charming clarinda i cant dissemble were it to shun perdition he who sees you as i have done and does not love you deserves to be damnd for his stupidity he who loves you and would injure you deserves to be doubly damnd for his villany adieu  sylvander  ps what would you think of this for a fourth stanza    your thought if love must harbour there     conceal it in that thought   nor cause me from my bosom tear     the very friend i sought     footnote 63 probably mr nicol who lived in buccleuch pend a    short distance from clarindas residence                                        vii  saturday noon 5th january  some days some nights nay some hours like the ten righteous persons in sodom save the rest of the vapid tiresome miserable months and years of life one of these hours my dear clarinda blest me with yesternight    one wellspent hour   in such a tender circumstance for friends   is better than an age of common time  thomson  my favourite feature in miltons satan is his manly fortitude in supporting what cannot be remediedin short the wild broken fragments of a noble exalted mind in ruins i meant no more by saying he was a favourite hero of mine  i mentioned to you my letter to dr moore giving an account of my life it is truth every word of it and will give you a just idea of the man whom you have honoured with your friendship i am afraid you will hardly be able to make sense of so torn a piece your verses i shall muse on deliciously as i gaze on your image in my minds eye in my hearts core they will be in time enough for a week to come i am truly happy your headache is better o how can pain or evil be so daringly unfeeling cruelly savage as to wound so noble a mind so lovely a form  my little fellow is all my namesake write me soon my every strongest good wishes attend you clarinda  sylvander  i know not what i have writteni am pestered with people around me                                viii  jan 8 1788 tuesday night  i am delighted charming clarinda with your honest enthusiasm for religion those of either sex but particularly the female who are lukewarm in that most important of all things o my soul come not thou into their secrets i feel myself deeply interested in your good opinion and will lay before you the outlines of my belief he who is our author and preserver and will one day be our judge must be not for his sake in the way of duty but from the native impulse of our hearts the object of our reverential awe and grateful adoration he is almighty and allbounteous we are weak and dependent hence prayer and every other sort of devotion he is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to everlasting life consequently it must be in every ones power to embrace his offer of everlasting life otherwise he could not in justice condemn those who did not a mind pervaded actuated and governed by purity truth and charity though it does not merit heaven yet is an absolute necessary prerequisite without which heaven can neither be obtained nor enjoyed and by divine promise such a mind shall never fail of attaining everlasting life hence the impure the deceiving and the uncharitable extrude themselves from eternal bliss by their unfitness for enjoying it the supreme being has put the immediate administration of all this for wise and good ends known to himself into the hands of jesus christ a great personage whose relation to him we cannot comprehend but whose relation to us is a guide and saviour and who except for our own obstinacy and misconduct will bring us all through various ways and by various means to bliss at last  these are my tenets my lovely friend and which i think cannot well be disputed my creed is pretty nearly expressed in the last clause of jamie deans grace an honest weaver in ayrshirelord grant that we may lead a gude life for a gude life maks a gude end at least it helps weel  i am flattered by the entertainment you tell me you have found in my packet you see me as i have been you know me as i am and may guess at what i am likely to be i too may say talk not of love etc for indeed he has plunged me deep in woe not that i ever saw a woman who pleased unexceptionably as my clarinda elegantly says in the companion the friend and the mistress one indeed i could exceptone before passion threw its mists over my discernment i knewthe first of women her name is indelibly written in my hearts corebut i dare not look in on ita degree of agony would be the consequence oh thou perfidious cruel mischiefmaking demon who presidest over that frantic passionthou mayest thou dost poison my peace but thou shalt not taint my honour i would not for a single moment give an asylum to the most distant imagination that would shadow the faintest outline of a selfish gratification at the expense of her whose happiness is twisted with the threads of my existencemay she be as happy as she deserves and if my tenderest faithfullest friendship can add to her bliss i shall at least have one solid mine of enjoyment in my bosom dont guess at these ravings  i watched at our front window today but was disappointed it has been a day of disappointments i am just risen from a two hours bout after supper with silly or sordid souls who could relish nothing in common with me but the portonetis now witching time of night and whatever is out of joint in the foregoing scrawl impute it to enchantments and spells for i cant look over it but will seal it up directly as i dont care for tomorrows criticisms on it  you are by this time fast asleep clarinda may good angels attend and guard you as constantly and faithfully as my good wishes do    beauty which whether waking or asleep   shot forth peculiar graces  john milton i wish thy soul better rest than i expect on my own pillow tonight o for a little of the carthorse part of human nature good night my dearest clarinda  sylvander                                ix  thursday noon 10th january 1788  i am certain i saw you clarinda but you dont look to the proper storey for a poets lodging    where speculation roosted near the sky  i could almost have thrown myself over for vexation why didnt you look higher it has spoiled my peace for this day to be so near my charming clarinda to miss her look while it was searching for mei am sure the soul is capable of disease for mine has convulsed itself into an inflammatory fever  you have converted me clarinda i shall love that name while i live there is heavenly music in it booth and amelia i know well64 your sentiments on that subject as they are on every subject are just and noble to be feelingly alive to kindness and to unkindness is a charming female character  what i said in my last letter the powers of fuddling sociality only know for me by yours i understand my good star has been partly in my horizon when i got wild in my reveries had that evil planet which has almost all my life shed its baleful rays on my devoted head been as usual in my zenith i had certainly blabbed something that would have pointed out to you the dear object of my tenderest friendship and in spite of me something more had that fatal information escaped me and it was merely chance or kind stars that it did not i had been undone  you would never have written me except perhaps once more o i could curse circumstances and the coarse tie of human laws which keeps fast what common sense would loose and which bars that happiness itself cannot givehappiness which otherwise love and honour would warrant but holdi shall make no more hairbreadth scapes  my friendship clarinda is a liferent business my likings are both strong and eternal i told you i had but one male friend i have but two female i should have a third but she is surrounded by the blandishments of flattery and courtship the name i register in my hearts core is peggy chalmers miss nimmo can tell you how divine she is she is worthy of a place in the same bosom with my clarinda that is the highest compliment i can pay her  farewell clarinda remember  sylvander     footnote 64 see fieldings amelia                                x  saturday morning 12th january  your thoughts on religion clarinda shall be welcome you may perhaps distrust me when i say tis also my favourite topic but mine is the religion of the bosom i hate the very idea of a controversial divinity as i firmly believe that every honest upright man of whatever sect will be accepted of the deity if your verses as you seem to hint contain censure except you want an occasion to break with me dont send them i have a little infirmity in my disposition that where i fondly love or highly esteem i cannot bear reproach  reverence thyself is a sacred maxim and i wish to cherish it i think i told you lord bolingbrokes saying to swiftadieu dear swift with all thy faults i love thee entirely make an effort to love me with all mine a glorious sentiment and without which there can be no friendship i do highly very highly esteem you indeed clarindayou merit it all perhaps too i scorn dissimulation i could fondly love you judge then what a maddening sting your reproach would be o i have sins to heaven but none to you with what pleasure would i meet you today but i cannot walk to meet the fly i hope to be able to see you on foot about the middle of next week  i am interruptedperhaps you are not sorry for it you will tell mebut i wont anticipate blame o clarinda did you know how dear to me is your look of kindness your smile of approbation you would not either in prose or verse risk a censorious remark    curst be the verse how well soeer it flow   that tends to make one worthy man my foe  sylvander                                xi  saturday jan 12 1788  you talk of weeping clarinda some involuntary drops wet your lines as i read them offend me my dearest angel you cannot offend me you never offended me if you had ever given me the least shadow of offence so pardon me god as i forgive clarinda i have read yours again it has blotted my paper though i find your letter has agitated me into a violent headache i shall take a chair and be with you about eight a friend is to be with us to tea on my account which hinders me from coming sooner forgive my dearest clarinda my unguarded expressions for heavens sake forgive me or i shall never be able to bear my own mind your unhappy sylvander                                xii  monday evening 11 oclock 14th january  why have i not heard from you clarinda today i expected it and before supper when a letter to me was announced my heart danced with rapture but behold twas some fool who had taken it into his head to turn poet and made me an offering of the firstfruits of his nonsense it is not poetry but prose run mad did i ever repeat to you an epigram i made on a mr elphinstone65 who has given a translation of martial a famous latin poet the poetry of elphinstone can only equal his prose notes i was sitting in a merchants shop of my acquaintance waiting somebody he put elphinstone into my hand and asked my opinion of it i begged leave to write it on a blank leaf which i did    to mr elphinstone    o thou whom poesy abhors   whom prose has turned out of doors   heardst thou yon groan proceed no further   twas laureld martial calling murther  i am determined to see you if at all possible on saturday evening next week i must sing    the night is my departing night     the morns the day i maun awa   theres neither friend nor foe o mine     but wishes that i were awa   what i hae done for lack o wit     i never never can reca   i hope yere a my friends as yet     gude night and joy be wi you a  if i could see you sooner i would be so much the happier but i would not purchase the dearest gratification on earth if it must be at your expense in worldly censure far less inward peace  i shall certainly be ashamed of thus scrawling whole sheets of incoherence the only unity a sad word with poets and critics in my ideas is clarinda there my heart reigns and revels    what art thou love whence are those charms    that thus thou bearst an universal rule   for thee the soldier quits his arms    the king turns slave the wise man fool   in vain we chase thee from the field    and with cool thoughts resist thy yoke   next tide of blood alas we yield    and all those high resolves are broke  i like to have quotations for every occasion they give ones ideas so pat and save one the trouble of finding expression adequate to ones feelings i think it is one of the greatest pleasures attending a poetic genius that we can give our woes cares joys loves etc an embodied form in verse which to me is ever immediate ease goldsmith says finely of his muse    thou source of all my bliss and all my woe   thou foundst me poor at first and keepst me so  my limb has been so well today that i have gone up and down stairs often without my staff tomorrow i hope to walk once again on my own legs to dinner it is only next streetadieu sylvander     footnote 65 a native of edinburgh and a schoolmaster in london he    was a friend of samuel johnson                                xiii  tuesday evening jan 15  that you have faults my clarinda i never doubted but i knew not where they existed and saturday night made me more in the dark than ever o clarinda why will you wound my soul by hinting that last night must have lessened my opinion of you true i was behind the scenes with you but what did i see a bosom glowing with honour and benevolence a mind ennobled by genius informed and refined by education and reflection and exalted by native religion genuine as in the climes of heaven a heart formed for all the glorious meltings of friendship love and pity these i sawi saw the noblest immortal soul creation ever showed me  i looked long my dear clarinda for your letter and am vexed that you are complaining i have not caught you so far wrong as in your idea that the commerce you have with one friend hurts you if you cannot tell every tittle of it to another why have so injurious a suspicion of a good god clarinda as to think that friendship and love on the sacred inviolate principles of truth honour and religion can be anything else than an object of his divine approbation  i have mentioned in some of my former scrawls saturday evening next do allow me to wait on you that evening oh my angel how soon must we part and when can we meet again i look forward on the horrid interval with tearful eyes what have i lost by not knowing you sooner i fear i fear my acquaintance with you is too short to make that lasting impression on your heart i could wish  sylvander                                xiv  saturday morning 19th jan  there is no time my clarinda when the conscious thrilling chords of love and friendship give such delight as in the pensive hours of what our favourite thomson calls philosophic melancholy the sportive insects who bask in the sunshine of prosperity or the worms that luxuriantly crawl amid their ample wealth of earth they need no clarinda they would despise sylvanderif they durst the family of misfortune a numerous group of brothers and sisters they need a resting place to their souls unnoticed often condemned by the worldin some degree perhaps condemned by themselves they feel the full enjoyment of ardent love delicate tender endearments mutual esteem and mutual reliance  in this light i have often admired religion in proportion as we are wrung with grief or distracted with anxiety the ideas of a compassionate deity an almighty protector are doubly dear    tis this my friend that streaks our morning bright   tis this that gilds the horrors of our night  i have been this morning taking a peep through as young finely says the dark postern of time long elapsd and you will easily guesstwas a rueful prospect what a tissue of thoughtlessness weakness and folly my life reminded me of a ruined temple what strength what proportion in some parts what unsightly gaps what prostrate ruin in others i kneeled down before the father of mercies and said father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son i rose eased and strengthened i despise the superstition of a fanatic but i love the religion of a man the future said i to myself is still before me there let me          on reason build resolve   that column of true majesty in man  i have difficulties many to encounter said i but they are not absolutely insuperable and where is firmness of mind shown but in exertion mere declamation is bombast rant besides wherever i am or in whatever situation i may be               tis nought to me   since god is ever present ever felt   in the void waste as in the city full   and where he vital breathes there must be joy   saturday nighthalf after ten  what luxury of bliss i was enjoying this time yesternight my ever dearest clarinda you have stolen away my soul but you have refined you have exalted it you have given it a stronger sense for virtue and a stronger relish for piety clarinda first of your sex if ever i am the veriest wretch on earth to forget you if ever your lovely image is effaced from my soul    may i be lost no eye to weep my end   and find no earth thats base enough to bury me  what trifling silliness is the childish fondness of the everyday children of the world tis the unmeaning toying of the younglings of the fields and forests but where sentiment and fancy unite their sweets where taste and delicacy refine where wit adds the flavour and good sense gives strength and spirit to all what a delicious draught is the hour of tender endearment beauty and grace in the arms of truth and honour in all the luxury of mutual love  clarinda have you ever seen the picture realised not in all its very richest colouring  last night clarinda but for one slight shade was the glorious picture                          innocence   lookd gaily smiling on while rosy pleasure   hid young desire amid her flowery wreath   and pourd her cup luxuriant mantling high   the sparkling heavenly vintage love and bliss  clarinda when a poet and poetess of natures making two of natures noblest productions when they drink together of the same cup of love and blissattempt not ye coarser stuff of human nature profanely to measure enjoyment ye never can know good night my dear clarinda  sylvander                                xv  sunday night 20th january  the impertinence of fools has joined with a return of an old indisposition to make me good for nothing today the paper has lain before me all this evening to write to my dear clarinda but    fools rushd on fools as waves succeed to waves  i cursed them in my soul they sacrilegiously disturbed my meditations on her who holds my heart what a creature is man a little alarm last night and today that i am mortal has made such a revolution on my spirits there is no philosophy no divinity comes half so home to the mind i have no idea of courage that braves heaven tis the wild ravings of an imaginary hero in bedlam i can no more clarinda i can scarcely hold up my head but i am happy you do not know it you would be so uneasy  sylvander   monday morning  i am my lovely friend much better this morning on the whole but i have a horrid languor on my spirits    sick of the world and all its joys     my soul in pining sadness mourns   dark scenes of woe my mind employs     the past and present in their turns  have you ever met with a saying of the great and like wise good mr locke author of the famous essay on the human understanding he wrote a letter to a friend directing it not to be delivered till after my decease it ended thusi know you loved me when living and will preserve my memory now i am dead all the use to be made of it is that this life affords no solid satisfaction but in the consciousness of having done well and the hopes of another life adieu i leave my best wishes with you j locke  clarinda may i reckon on your friendship for life i think i may thou almighty preserver of men thy friendship which hitherto i have too much neglected to secure it shall all the future days and nights of my life be my steady care the idea of my clarinda follows    hide it my heart within that close disguise   where mixd with gods her lovd idea lies  but i fear that inconstancy the consequent imperfection of human weakness shall i meet with a friendship that defies years of absence and the chances and changes of fortune perhaps such things are one honest man65a i have great hopes from that way but who except a romance writer would think on a love that could promise for life in spite of distance absence chance and change and that too with slender hopes of fruition for my own part i can say to myself in both requisitions thou art the man i dare in cool resolve i dare declare myself that friend and that lover if womankind is capable of such things clarinda is i trust that she is and i feel i shall be miserable if she is not there is not one virtue which gives worth or one sentiment which does honour to the sex that she does not possess superior to any woman i ever saw her exalted mind aided a little perhaps by her situation is i think capable of that noblyromantic loveenthusiasm  may i see you on wednesday evening my dear angel the next wednesday again will i conjecture be a hated day to us both i tremble for censorious remark for your sake but in extraordinary cases may not usual and useful precaution be a little dispensed with three evenings three swiftwinged evenings with pinions of down are all the past i dare not calculate the future i shall call at miss nimmos tomorrow eveningtwill be a farewell call  i have wrote out my last sheet of paper so i am reduced to my last halfsheet what a strange mysterious faculty is that thing called imagination we have no ideas almost at all of another world but i have often amused myself with visionary schemes of what happiness might be enjoyed by small alterationsalterations that we can fully enter into in this present state of existence for instance suppose you and i just as we are at present the same reasoning powers sentiments and even desires the same fond curiosity for knowledge and remarking observation in our minds and imagine our bodies free from pain and the necessary supplies for the wants of nature at all times and easily within our reach imagine further that we were set free from the laws of gravitation which bind us to this globe and could at pleasure fly without inconvenience through all the yet unconjectured bounds of creation what a life of bliss would we lead in our mutual pursuit of virtue and knowledge and our mutual enjoyment of friendship and love  i see you laughing at my fairy fancies and calling me a voluptuous mahometan but i am certain i would be a happy creature beyond anything we call bliss here below nay it would be a paradise congenial to you too dont you see us hand in hand or rather my arm about your lovely waist making our remarks on sirius the nearest of the fixed stars or surveying a comet flaming innoxious by us as we just now would mark the passing pomp of a travelling monarch or in a shady bower of mercury or venus dedicating the hour to love in mutual converse relying honour and revelling endearment whilst the most exalted strains of poesy and harmony would be the ready spontaneous language of our souls devotion is the favourite employment of your heart so it is of mine what incentives then to and powers for reverence gratitude faith and hope in all the fervours of adoration and praise to that being whose unsearchable wisdom power and goodness so pervaded so inspired every sense and feeling by this time i daresay you will be blessing the neglect of the maid that leaves me destitute of paper  sylvander     footnote 65a alluding to captain brown                                 xvi  monday 21st jan 1788   i am a discontented ghost a perturbed spirit clarinda if ever you forget sylvander may you be happy but he will be miserable o what a fool i am in love what an extraordinary prodigal of affection why are your sex called the tender sex when i have never met with one who can repay me in passion they are either not so rich in love as i am or they are niggards where i am lavish  o thou whose i am and whose are all my ways thou seest me here the hapless wreck of tides and tempests in my own bosom do thou direct to thyself that ardent love for which i have so often sought a return in vain from my fellowcreatures if thy goodness has yet such a gift in store for me as an equal return of affection from her who thou knowest is dearer to me than life do thou bless and hallow our bond of love and friendship watch over us in all our outgoings and incomings for good and may the tie that unites our hearts be strong and indissoluble as the thread of mans immortal life  i am just going to take your blackbird66 the sweetest i am sure that ever sung and prune its wings a little  sylvander     footnote 66 her verses to a blackbird singing                                xvii  thursday morning 24th january  unlavish wisdom never works in vain  i have been tasking my reason clarinda why a woman who for native genius poignant wit strength of mind generous sincerity of soul and the sweetest female tenderness is without a peer and whose personal charms have few very very few parallels among her sex why or how she should fall to the blessed lot of a poor hairum scairum poet whom fortune had kept for her particular use to wreak her temper on whenever she was in ill humour one time i conjectured that as fortune is the most capricious jade ever known she may have taken not a fit of remorse but a paroxysm of whim to raise the poor devil out of the mire where he had so often and so conveniently served her as a stepping stone and given him the most glorious boon she ever had in her gift merely for the maggots sake to see how his fool head and his fool heart will bear it at other times i was vain enough to think that nature who has a great deal to say with fortune had given the coquettish goddess some such hint as here is a paragon of female excellence whose equal in all my former compositions i never was lucky enough to hit on and despair of ever doing so again you have cast her rather in the shades of life there is a certain poet of my making among your frolics it would not be amiss to attach him to this masterpiece of my hand to give her that immortality among mankind which no woman of any age ever more deserved and which few rhymsters of this age are better able to confer   evening 9 oclock  i am here absolutely unfit to finish my letterpretty hearty after a bowl which has been constantly plied since dinner till this moment i have been with mr schetki the musician and he has set it66a finelyi have no distinct ideas of anything

  xviii  friday jan 25  clarinda my life you have wounded my soul can i think of your being unhappy even though it be not described in your pathetic elegance of language without being miserable clarinda can i bear to be told from you that you will not see me tomorrow nightthat you wish the hour of parting were come do not let us impose on ourselves by sounds if in the moment of tender endearment i perhaps trespassed against the letter of decorums law i appeal even to you whether i ever sinned in the very least degree against the spirit of her strictest statute but why my love talk to me in such strong termsevery word of which cuts me to the very soul you know a hint the slightest signification of your wish is to me a sacred command be reconciled my angel to your god yourself and me and i pledge you sylvanders honouran oath i daresay you will trust without reservethat you shall never more have reason to complain of his conduct now my love do not wound our next meeting with any averted looks or restrained caresses i have marked the line of conduct a line i know exactly to your taste and which i will inviolably keep but do not you shew the least inclination to make boundaries seeming distrust where you know you may confide is a cruel sin against sensibility delicacy you know it was which won me to you at oncetake care you do not loosen the dearest most sacred tie that unites us clarinda i would not have stung your soul i would not have bruised your spirit as that harsh crucifying take care did mineno not to have gained heaven let me again appeal to your dear self if sylvander even when he seemingly halftransgressed the laws of decorum if he did not shew more chastened trembling faltering delicacy than the many of the world do in keeping these laws  o love and sensibility ye have conspired against my peace i love to madness and i feel to torture clarinda how can i forgive myself that i have ever touched a single chord in your bosom with pain would i do it willingly would any consideration any gratification make me do so oh did you love like me you would not you could not deny or put off a meeting with the man who adores youwho would die a thousand deaths before he would injure you and who must soon bid you a long farewell  i had proposed bringing my bosom friend mr ainslie tomorrow evening at his strong request to see you as he has only time to stay with us about ten minutes for an engagement but i shall hear from youthis afternoon for mercys sake for till i hear from you i am wretched o clarinda the tie that binds me to thee is

you are an angel clarinda you are surely no mortal that the earth owns to kiss your hand to live on your smile is to me far more exquisite bliss than the dearest favours that the fairest of the sex yourself excepted can bestow  sunday evening  you are the constant companion of my thoughts how wretched is the condition of one who is haunted with conscious guilt and trembling under the idea of dreaded vengeance and what a placid calm what a charming secret enjoyment it gives to bosom the kind feelings of friendship and the fond throes of love out upon the tempest of anger the acrimonious gall of fretful impatience the sullen frost of louring resentment or the corroding poison of withered envy they eat up the immortal part of man if they spent their fury only on the unfortunate objects of them it would be something in their favour but these miserable passions like traitor iscariot betray their lord and master  thou almighty author of peace and goodness and love do thou give me the social heart that kindly tastes of every mans cup is it a draught of joywarm and open my heart to share it with cordial unenvying rejoicing is it the bitter potion of sorrowmelt my heart with sincerely sympathetic woe above all do thou give me the manly mind that resolutely exemplifies in life and manners those sentiments which i would wish to be thought to possess the friend of my soulthere may i never deviate from the firmest fidelity and most active kindness clarinda the dear object of my fondest love there may the most sacred inviolate honour the most faithful kindling

poetic production and get immortal fame by it tis when you bid the scenes of nature remind me of clarinda can i forget you clarinda i would detest myself as a tasteless unfeeling insipid infamous

my actions some time perhaps very soon my almighty judge i am not going to be the advocate of passion be thou my inspirer and testimony o god as i plead the cause of truth  i have read over your friends70 haughty dictatorial letter you are answerable only to your god in such a matter who gave any fellowcreature of yours one incapable of being your judge because not your peer a right to catechise scold undervalue abuse and insultwantonly and inhumanly to insult you thus i do not even wish to deceive you madam the searcher of hearts is my witness how dear you are to me but though it were possible you could be still dearer to me i would not even kiss your hand at the expense of your conscience away with declamation let us appeal to the bar of commonsense it is not mouthing everything sacred it is not vague ranting assertions it is not assuming haughtily and insultingly the dictatorial language of a roman pontiff that must dissolve a union like ours tell me madamare you under the least shadow of an obligation to bestow your love tenderness caresses affections heart and soul on mr mlehose the man who has repeatedly habitually and barbarously broken through every tie of duty nature and gratitude to you the laws of your country indeed for the most useful reasons of policy and sound government have made your person inviolate but are your heart and affections bound to one who gives not the least return of either to you you cannot do it it is not in the nature of things the common feelings of humanity forbid it have you then a heart and affections which are no mans right you have it would be absurd to suppose the contrary tell me then in the name of commonsense can it be wrong is such a supposition compatible with the plainest ideas of right and wrong that it is improper to bestow the heart and these affections on anotherwhile that bestowing is not in the smallest degree hurtful to your duty to god to your children to yourself or to society at large  this is the great test the consequences let us see them in a widowed forlorn lonely condition with a bosom glowing with love and tenderness yet so delicately situated that you cannot indulge these

forgetfulness i have been tossed about through the country ever since i wrote you and am here returning from dumfriesshire at an inn the post office of the place with just so long time as my horse eats his corn to write you i have been hurried with business and dissipation almost equal to the insidious decree of the persian monarchs mandate when he forbade asking petition of god or man for forty days had the venerable prophet been as throng as i he had not broken the decree at least not thrice a day  i am thinking my farming scheme will yet hold a worthy intelligent farmer my fathers friend and my own has been with me on the spot he thinks the bargain practicable i am myself on a more serious review of the lands much better pleased with them i wont mention this in writing to any

got from you and that this is the fifth or sixth i have sent to you you will not reproach me with a good grace for unkindness i have always some kind of idea not to sit down to write a letter except i have time and possession of my faculties so as to do some justice to my letter which at present is rarely my situation for instance yesterday i dined at a friends at some distance the savage hospitality of this country spent me the most part of the night over the nauseous potion in the bowl this daysickheadachelow spiritsmiserablefasting except for a draught of water or small beer now eight oclock at nightonly able to crawl ten minutes walk into mauchline to wait the post in the pleasurable hope of hearing from the mistress of my soul  but truce with all this when i sit down to write to you all is harmony and peace a hundred times a day do i figure you before your taper your book or work laid aside as i get within the room how happy have i been and how little of that scantling portion of time called the life of man is sacred to happiness much less transport  i could moralise tonight like a deaths head     o what is life that thoughtless wish of all    a drop of honey in a draught of gall  nothing astonishes me more when a little sickness clogs the wheels of life than the thoughtless career we run in the hour of health none saith where is god my maker that giveth songs in the night who teacheth us more knowledge than the beasts of the field and more understanding than the fowls of the air  give me my maker to remember thee give me to act up to the dignity of my nature give me to feel anothers woe and continue with me that dearloved friend that feels with mine  the dignified and dignifying consciousness of an honest man and the wellgrounded

for unkindness a sin so unlike me a sin i detest more than a breach of the whole decalogue fifth sixth seventh and ninth articles excepted that i believe i shall not rest in my grave about it if i die before i see you you have often allowed me the head to judge and the heart to feel the influence of female excellence  was it not blasphemy then against your own charms and against my feelings to suppose that a short fortnight could abate my passion you my love may have your cares and anxieties to disturb you but they are the usual recurrences of life your future views are fixed and your mind in a settled routine could not you my ever dearest madam make a little allowance for a man after long absence paying a short visit to a country full of friends relations and early intimates cannot you guess my clarinda what thoughts what cares what anxious forebodings hopes and fears must crowd the breast of the man of keen sensibility when no less is on the tapis than his aim his employment his very existence through future life  now that not my apology but my defence is made i feel my soul respire more easily i know you will go along with me in my justificationwould to heaven you could in my adoption too i mean an adoption beneath the starsan adoption where i might revel in the immediate beams of     her the bright sun of all her sex  i would not have you my dear madam so much hurt at miss nimmos coldness tis placing yourself below her an honour she by no means deserves we ought when we wish to be economists in happinesswe ought in the first place to fix the standard of our own character and when on full examination we know where we stand and how much ground we occupy let us contend for it as property and those who seem to doubt or deny us what is justly ours let us either pity their prejudices or despise their judgment i know my dear you will say this is selfconceit but i call it selfknowledge the one is theoverweening opinion of a fool who fancies himself to be what he wishes himself to be thought the other is the honest justice that a man of sense who has thoroughly examined the subject owes to himself without this standard this column in our own mind we are perpetually at the mercy of the petulance the mistakes the prejudices nay the very weakness and wickedness of our fellowcreatures  i urge this my dear both to confirm myself in the doctrine which i assure you i sometimes need and because i know that this causes you often much disquiet to return to miss nimmo she is most certainly a worthy soul and equalled by very very few in goodness of heart but can she boast more goodness of heart than clarinda not even prejudice will dare to say so for penetration and discernment clarinda sees far beyond her to wit miss nimmo dare make no pretence to clarindas wit scarcely any of her sex dare make pretence personal charms it would be ridiculous to run the parallel and for conduct in life miss nimmo was never called out either much to do or to suffer clarinda has been both and has performed her part where miss nimmo would have sunk at the bare idea  away then with these disquietudes let us pray with the honest weaver of kilbarchanlord send us a gude conceit o oursel or in the words of the auld sang    who does me disdain i can scorn them again   and ill never mind any such foes  there is an error in the commerce of intimacy74   way of exchange have not an equivalent to give us and what is still worse have no idea of the value of our goods happy is our lot indeed when we meet with an honest merchant who is qualified to deal with us on our own terms but that is a rarity with almost everybody we must pocket our pearls less or more and learn in the old scotch phraseto gie sic like as we get for this reason one should try to erect a kind of bank or storehouse in ones own mind or as the psalmist says we should commune with our own hearts and be still this is exactly     footnote 74 the ms is so worn as to be indecipherable     ms

walk delightful the evening rapture do not be uneasy today clarinda i am in rather better spirits today though i had but an indifferent night care anxiety sat on my spirits all the cheerfulness of

loves you who has loved you and who will love you to death through death and for ever o clarinda what do i owe to heaven for blessing me with such a piece of exalted excellence as you i call over your idea as a miser counts over his treasure tell me were you studious to please me last night i am sure you did it to transport  how rich am i who have such a treasure as you you know me you know how to make me happy and you do it most effectually god bless you with long life long youth long pleasure and a friend tomorrow night according to your own direction i shall watch the windowtis the star that

irksomely to write a letter because he is in duty bound to do so  i have been roving over the country as the farm76 i have taken is forty miles from this place hiring servants and preparing matters but most of all i am earnestly busy to bring about a revolution in my own mind as till within these eighteen months i never was the wealthy master of ten guineas my knowledge of business is to learn add to this my late scenes of idleness and dissipation have enervated my mind to an alarming degree skill in the sober science of life is my most serious and hourly study i have dropped all

attendance for instructions to entitle me to a commission which commission lies by me and at any future period on my simple petition can be resumedi thought fiveandthirty pounds ayear was no bad

4th may 1788  madamdrydens virgil has delighted me i do not know whether the critics will agree with me but the georgics are to me by far the best of virgil it is indeed a species of writing entirely new to me and has filled my head with a thousand fancies of emulation but alas when i read the georgics and then survey my own powers tis like the idea of a shetland pony drawn up by the side of a thoroughbred hunter to start for the plate i own i am disappointed in the aeneid faultless correctness may please and does highly please the lettered critic but to that awful character t have not the most distant pretensions i do not know whether i do not hazard my pretensions to be a critic of any kind when i say that i think virgil in many instances a servile copier of homer if i had the odyssey by me i could parallel many passages where virgil has evidently copied but by no means improved homer nor can i think there is anything of this owing to the translators for from everything i have seen of dryden i think him in genius and fluency of language popes master i have not perused tasso enough to form an opinion in some future letter you shall have my ideas of him though i am conscious my criticisms must be very inaccurate and imperfect as there i have ever felt and lamented my want of learning most r b                                xcto mr samuel brown kirkoswald  mossgiel 4th may

bargainings hitherto mrs burns not excepted which title i now avow to the world i am truly pleased with this last affair it has indeed added to my anxieties for futurity but it has given a stability

which has followed me in my return to the shade of life with assiduous benevolence often did i regret in the fleeting hours of my late willowisp appearance that here i had no continuing city and but for the consolation of a few solid guineas could almost lament the time that a momentary acquaintance with wealth and splendour put me so much out of conceit with the sworn companions of my road through lifeinsignificance and poverty  there are few circumstances relating to the unequal distribution of the good things of this life that give me more vexation i mean in what i see around me than the importance the opulent bestow on their trifling family affairs compared with the very same things on the contracted scale of a cottage last afternoon i had the honour to spend an hour or two at a good womans fireside where the planks that composed the floor were decorated with a splendid carpet and the gay table sparkled with silver and china tis now about termday and there has been a revolution among those creatures who though in appearance partakers and equally noble partakers of the same nature with madame are from time to timetheir nerves their sinews their health strength

insignificant creatures nay notwithstanding their general stupidity and rascality did some of the poor devils the honour to commend them but light be the turf upon his breast who taught reverence

honoured friend that i have been on my farm a solitary inmate of an old smoky spence far from every object i love or by whom i am beloved nor any acquaintance older than yesterday except jenny geddes the old mare i ride on while uncouth cares and novel plans hourly insult my awkward ignorance and bashful inexperience there is a foggy atmosphere native to my soul in the hour of care consequently the dreary objects seem larger than the life extreme sensibility irritated and prejudiced on the gloomy side by a series of misfortunes and disappointments at that period of my existence when the soul is laying in her cargo of ideas for the voyage of life is i believe the principal cause of this unhappy frame of mind    the valiant in himself what can he suffer   or what need he regard his single woes  your surmise madam is just i am indeed a husband  i found a once muchloved and still muchloved female literally and truly cast out to the mercy of the naked elementsbut there is no sporting with a fellowcreatures happiness or misery the most placid goodnature and sweetness of disposition a warm heart gratefully devoted with all its powers to love me vigorous health and sprightly cheerfulness

dearest sir that i have sojourned in these regions and during these three days you have occupied more of my thoughts than in three weeks preceding in ayrshire i have several variations of friendships compass here it points invariably to the pole my farm gives me a good many uncouth cares and anxieties but i hate the language of complaint job or some one of his friends says wellwhy should a living man complain  i have lately been much mortified with contemplating an unlucky imperfection in the very framing and construction of my soul namely a blundering inaccuracy of her olfactory organs in hitting the scent of craft or design in my fellowcreatures i do not mean any compliment to my ingenuousness or to hint that the defect is in consequence of the unsuspicious simplicity of conscious truth and honour i take it to be in some way or other an imperfection in the mental sight or metaphor apart some modification of dulness in two or three instances lately i have been most shamefully out  i have all along hitherto in the warfare of life been bred to arms among the light horsethe piquetguards of fancy a kind of hussars and highlanders of the brain but i am firmly resolved to sell out of these giddy battalions who have no ideas of a battle but fighting the foe or of a siege but storming the town cost what it will i am determined to buy in among the grave squadrons of heavyarmed thought or the artillery corps of plodding contrivance  what books are you reading or what is the subject of your thoughts besides the great studies of your profession you said something about religion in your last i dont exactly remember what it was as the letter is in ayrshire but i thought it not only prettily said but nobly thought you will make a noble fellow if once you were married i make no reservation of your being wellmarried you have so much sense and knowledge of human nature that though you may not realise perhaps the ideas of romance yet you will never be illmarried  were it not for the terrors of my ticklish situation respecting provision for a family of children i am decidedly of opinion that the step i have taken is vastly for my happiness80 as it is i look to the excise scheme as a certainty of maintenance a maintenanceluxury to what either mrs burns or i were born to adieu  r b     footnote 80 this alludes to his marriage                                xcvito mr robert ainslie  ellisland 30th june 1788  my dear siri just now received your brief epistle and to take vengeance on your laziness i have you see taken a long sheet of writingpaper and have begun at the top of the page intending to scribble on to the very last corner  i am vexed at that affair of the  but dare not enlarge on the subject until you send me your direction as i suppose that will be altered on your late master and friends death81 i am concerned for the old fellows exit only as i fear it may be to your disadvantage in any respectfor an old mans dying except he have been a very benevolent character or in some particular situation of life that the welfare of the poor or the helpless depended on him i think it an event of the most trifling moment to the world man is naturally a kind benevolent animal but he is dropped into such a needy situation here in this vexatious world and has such a hungry growling multiplying pack of necessities appetites passions and desires about him ready to devour him for want of other food that in fact he must lay aside his cares for others that he may look properly to himself you have been imposed upon in paying mr miers for the profile of a mr h i did not mention it in my letter to you nor did i ever give mr miers any such order i have no objection to lose the money but i will not have any such profile in my possession  i desired the carrier to pay you but as i mentioned only 15s to him i will rather inclose you a guineanote i have it not indeed to spare here as i am only a sojourner in a strange land in this place but in a day or two i return to mauchline and there i have the banknotes through the house like salt permits  there is a great degree of folly in talking unnecessarily of ones private affairs i have just now been interrupted by one of my new neighbours who has made himself absolutely contemptible in my eyes by his silly garrulous pruriency i know it has been a fault of my own too but from this moment i abjure it as i would the service of hell your poets spendthrifts and other fools of that kidney pretend forsooth to crack their jokes on prudence buttis a squalid vagabond glorying in his rags still imprudence respecting money matters is much more pardonable than imprudence respecting character i have no objection to prefer prodigality to avarice in some few instances but i appeal to your observation if you have not met and often met with the same disingenuousness the same hollowhearted insincerity and disintegritive depravity of principle in the hackneyed victims of profusion as in the unfeeling children of parsimony i have every possible reverence for the much talkedof world beyond the grave and i wish that which piety believes and virtue deserves may be all matter of fact but in things belonging to and terminating in this present scene of existence man has serious and interesting business on hand whether a man shall shake hands with welcome in the distinguished elevation of respect or shrink from contempt in the abject corner of insignificance whether he shall wanton under the tropic of plenty at least enjoy himself in the comfortable latitude of easy convenience or starve in the arctic circle of dreary poverty whether he shall rise in the manly consciousness of a selfapproving mind or sink beneath a galling load of regret and remorsethese are alternatives of the last moment  you see how i preach you used occasionally to sermonise too i wish you would in charity favour me with a sheet full in your own way i admire the close of a letter lord bolingbroke writes to dean swiftadieu dear swift with all thy faults i love thee entirely make an effort to love me with all mine humble servant and all that trumpery is now such a prostituted business that honest

      xcviito mrs dunlop  mauchline july 10th 1788  my much honoured friendyours of the 24th june is before me i found it as well as another valued friendmy wife waiting to welcome me to ayrshire i met both with the sincerest pleasure  when i write you madam i do not sit down to answer every paragraph of yours by echoing every sentiment like the faithful commons of great britain in parliament assembled answering a speech from the best of kings i express myself in the fulness of my heart and may perhaps be guilty of neglecting some of your kind inquiries but not from your very odd reason that i do not read your letters all your epistles for several months have cost me nothing except a swelling throb of gratitude or a deepfelt sentiment of veneration  when mrs burns madam first found herself as women wish to be who love their lords as i loved her nearly to distraction we took steps for a private marriage her parents got the hint and not only forbade me her company and their house but on my rumoured west indian voyage got a warrant to put me in jail till i should find security in my abouttobe paternal relation you know my lucky reverse of fortune on my éclatant return to mauchline i was made very welcome to visit my girl the usual consequences began to betray her and as i was at that time laid up a cripple in edinburgh she was turned literally turned out of doors and i wrote to a friend to shelter her till my return when our marriage was declared her happiness or misery were in my hands and who could trifle with such a deposit  to jealousy or infidelity i am an equal stranger my preservative against the first is the most thorough consciousness of her sentiments of honour and her attachment to me my antidote against the last is my long and deeprooted affection for her i can easily fancy a more agreeable companion for my journey of life but upon my honour i have never seen the individual instance  in household matters of aptness to learn and activity to execute she is eminently mistress and during my absence in nithsdale she is regularly and constantly apprentice to my mother and sisters in their dairy and other rural business  the muses must not be offended when i tell them the concerns of my wife and family will in my mind always take the pas but i assure them their ladyships will ever come next in place  you are right that a bachelor state would have insured me more friends but from a cause you will easily guess conscious peace in the enjoyment of my own mind and unmistrusting confidence in approaching my god would seldom have been of the number  circumstanced as i am i could never have got a female partner for life who could have entered into my favourite studies relished my favourite authors etc without probably entailing on me at the same time expensive living fantastic caprice perhaps apish affectation with all the other blessed boardingschool acquirements which pardonnez moi madame are sometimes to be found among females of the upper ranks but almost universally pervade the misses of the wouldbe gentry82  i like your way in your churchyard lucubrations thoughts that are the spontaneous result of accidental situations either respecting health place or company have often a strength and always an originality that would in vain be looked for in fancied circumstances and studied paragraphs for me i have often thought of keeping a letter in progression by me to send you when the sheet was written out now i talk of sheets i must tell you my reason for writing to you on paper of this kind is my pruriency of writing to you at large a page of post is on such a dissocial narrowminded scale that i cannot abide it and double letters at least in my miscellaneous reverie manner are a monstrous tax in a close correspondence r b     footnote 82 in burnss private memoranda are these wordsi am    more and more pleased with the step i took respecting my jean a    wifes head is immaterial compared with her heart and virtues for    wisdom what poet pretends to it ways are ways of pleasantness    and all her paths are peace                                       xcviiito mr peter hill bookseller edinburgh  my dear hilli shall say nothing to your mad presentyou have so long and often been of important service to me and i suppose you mean to go on conferring obligations until i shall not be able to lift up my face before you in the meantime as sir roger de coverley because it happened to be a cold day in which he made his will ordered his servants greatcoats for mourning so because i have been this week plagued with an indigestion i have sent you by the carrier a fine old ewemilk cheese83  indigestion is the devil nay tis the devil and all it besets a man in every one of his senses i lose my appetite at the sight of successful knavery and sicken to loathing at the noise and nonsense of selfimportant folly when the hollowhearted wretch takes me by the hand the feeling spoils my dinner the proud mans wine so offends my palate that it chokes me in the gullet and the pulvilised feathered pert coxcomb is so disgustful in my nostril that my stomach turns  if ever you have any of these disagreeable sensations let me prescribe for you patience and a bit of my cheese i know that you are no niggard of your good things among your friends and some of them are in much need of a slice there in my eye is our friend smellie a man positively of the first abilities and greatest strength of mind as well as one of the best hearts and keenest wits that i have ever met with when you see him as alas he too is smarting at the pinch of distressful circumstances aggravated by the sneer of contumelious greatnessa bit of my cheese alone will not cure him but if you add a tankard of brown stout and superadd a magnum of bright oporto you will see his sorrows vanish like the morning mist before the summer sun  candlish the earliest friend except my only brother that i have on earth and one of the worthiest fellows that ever any man called by the name of friend if a luncheon of my cheese would help to rid him of some of his superabundant modesty you would do well to give it him  david84 with his courant comes too across my recollection and i beg you will help him largely from the said ewemilk cheese to enable him to digest those bedaubing paragraphs with which he is eternally larding the lean characters of certain great men in a certain great town i grant you the periods are very well turned so a fresh egg is a very good thing but when thrown at a man in a pillory it does not at all improve his figure not to mention the irreparable loss of the egg  my facetious friend dunbar i would wish also to be a partaker not to digest his spleen for that he laughs off but to digest his last nights wine at the last fieldday of the crochallan corps85  among our common friends i must not forget one of the dearest of themcunningham the brutality insolence and selfishness of a world unworthy of having such a fellow as he is in it i know sticks in his stomach and if you can help him to anything that will make him a little easier on that score it will be very obliging  as to honest john sommerville he is such a contented happy man that i know not what can annoy him except perhaps he may not have got the better of a parcel oif modest anecdotes which a certain poet gave him one night at supper the last time the said poet was in town  though i have mentioned so many men of law i shall have nothing to do with them professedlythe faculty are beyond my prescription as to their clients that is another thing god knows they have much to digest  the clergy i pass by their profundity of erudition and their liberality of sentiment their total want of pride and their detestation of hypocrisy are so proverbially notorious as to place them far far above either my praise or censure  i was going to mention a man of worth whom i have the honour to call friendthe laird of craigdarroch but i have spoken to the landlord of the kings arms inn here to have at the next county meeting a large ewemilk cheese on the table for the benefit of the dumfriesshire

calling at a postoffice once in a fortnight i am six miles from dumfries am scarcely ever in it myself and as yet have little acquaintance in the neighbourhood besides i am now very busy on my farm building a dwellinghouse as at present i am almost an evangelical man in nithsdale for i have scarce where to lay my head  there are some passages in your last that brought tears in my eyes the heart

honoured friend to send you an elegiac epistle and want only genius to make it quite shenstonian    why droops my heart with fancied woes forlorn   why sinks my soul beneath each wintry sky  my increasing cares in this as yet strange countrygloomy conjectures in the dark vista of futurityconsciousness of my own inability for the struggle of the worldmy broadened mark to misfortune in a wife and childreni could indulge these reflections till my humour should ferment into the most acid chagrin that would corrode the very thread of life  to counterwork these baneful feelings i have sat down to write to you as i declare upon my soul i always find that the most sovereign balm for my wounded spirit  i was yesterday at mr millers to dinner for the first time my reception was quite to my mind from the lady of the house quite flattering she sometimes hits on a couplet or two impromptu she repeated one or two to the admiration of all present my suffrage as a professional man was expected i for once went agonising over the belly of my conscience pardon me ye my adored household gods independence of spirit and integrity of soul in the course of conversation johnsorfs musical museum a collection of scottish songs with the music was talked of we got a song on the harpsichord beginning    raving winds around her blowing  the air was much admired the lady of the house asked me whose were the words mine madamthey are indeed my very best verses she took not the smallest notice of them the old scottish proverb says well kings caff is better than ither folks corn i was going to make a new testament quotation about casting pearls but that would be too virulent for the lady is actually a woman of sense and taste  after all that has been said on the other side of the question man is by no means a happy creature i do not speak of the selected few favoured by partial heaven whose souls are tuned to gladness amidst riches and honours and prudence and wisdom i speak of the neglected many whose nerves whose sinews whose days are sold to the minions of fortune  if i thought you had never seen it i would transcribe for you a stanza of an old scottish ballad called the life and age of man beginning thus    twas in the sixteenth hundred year      of god and fiftythree    frae christ was born that bought us dear      as writings testifie  i had an old granduncle with whom my mother lived a while in her girlish years the good old man for such he was was long blind ere he died during which time his highest enjoyment was to sit down and cry while my mother would sing the simple old song of the life and age of man  it is this way of thinking it is these melancholy truths that make religion so precious to the poor miserable children of men if it is a mere phantom existing only in the heated imagination of enthusiasm    what truth on earth so precious as the lie  my idle reasonings sometimes make me a little sceptical but the necessities of my heart always give the cold philosophisings the lie who looks for the heart weaned from earth the soul affianced to her god the correspondence fixed with heaven the pious supplication and devout thanksgiving constant as the vicissitudes of even and morn who thinks to meet with these in the court the palace in the glare of public life no to find them in their precious importance and divine efficacy we must search

me yesternight  i am here on my farm busy with my harvest but for all that most pleasurable part of life called social communication i am here at the very elbow of existence the only things that are to be found in this country in any degree of perfection are stupidity and canting prose they only know in graces prayers etc and the value of these they estimate as they do their plaiding webs by the ell as for the muses they have as much an idea of a rhinoceros as of a poet for my old capricious but goodnatured hussy of a muse    by banks of nith i sat and wept    when coila i thought on   in midst thereof i hung my harp    the willow trees upon  i am generally about half my time in ayrshire with my darling jean and then i at lucid intervals throw my horny fist across my becobwebbed lyre much in the same manner as an old wife throws her hand across the spokes of her spinningwheel  i will send you the fortunate shepherdess as soon as i return to ayrshire for there i keep it with other precious treasure i shall send it by a careful hand as i would not for anything it should be mislaid or lost i do not wish to serve you from any benevolence or other grave christian virtue tis purely a selfish gratification of my own feelings whenever i think of you  if your better functions would give you leisure to write me i should be extremely happy that is to say if you neither keep nor look for a regular correspondence i hate the idea of being obliged to write a letter i sometimes write a friend twice a week at other times once a quarter  i am exceedingly pleased with your fancy in making the author you mention place a map of iceland instead of his portrait before his works twas a glorious idea  could you conveniently do me one thingwhenever you finish any head i should like to

application i lately made to your board to be admitted an officer of the excise i have according to form been examined by a supervisor and today i gave in his certificate with a request for an order for instructions in this affair if i succeed i am afraid i shall but too much need a patronising friend propriety of conduct as a man and fidelity and attention as an officer i dare engage for but with anything like business except manual labour i am totally unacquainted  i had intended to have closed my late appearance on the stage of life in the character of a country farmer but after discharging some filial and fraternal claims i find i could only fight for existence in that miserable manner which i have lived to see throw a venerable parent into the jaws of a jail whence death the poor mans last and often best friend rescued him  i know sir that to need your goodness is to have a claim on it may i therefore beg your patronage to forward me in this affair till i be appointed

the whole night last but alas i fear it will be three weeks yet ere i can hope for the happiness of seeing you my harvest is going on i have some to cut down still but i put in two stacks today so im as tired as a dog  you might get one of gilberts sweetmilk cheeses and send it to on second thoughts i believe you had best get the half of gilberts web of table linen and make it up though i think it damnable dear but it is no outlaid money to us you know i have just now consulted my old landlady about table linen and she thinks i may have the best for two shillings a yard so after all let it alone till i return and some day soon i will be in dumfries and ask the price there i expect your new gowns will be very forward or ready to make against i be home to get the baiveridge88  i have written my longthoughton letter to mr graham the commissioner of excise and have sent a sheetful of poetry besides     footnote 88 on her first appearance in public in a new dress a    young woman was subject to this tax if claimed by the young man who    happened first to meet her                                               civto miss chalmers edinburgh  ellisland near dumfries sept 16th 1788  where are you and how are you and is lady mackenzie recovering her health for i have had but one solitary letter from you i will not think you have forgot me madam and for my part    when thee jerusalem i forget   skill part from my right hand  my heart is not of that rock nor my soul careless as that sea i do not make my progress among mankind as a bowl does among its fellowsrolling through the crowd without bearing away any mark or impression except where they hit in hostile collision  i am here driven in with my harvestfolks by bad weather and as you and your sister once did me the honour of interesting yourselves much à l egard de moi i sit down to beg the continuation of your goodness i can truly say that all the exterior of life apart i never saw two whose esteem flattered the nobler feelings of my souli will not say more but so much as lady mackenzie and miss chalmers when i think of youhearts the best minds the noblest of human kindunfortunate even in the shades of lifewhen i think i have met with you and have lived more of real life with you in eight days than i can do with almost anybody i meet with in eight yearswhen i think on the improbability of meeting you in this world againi could sit down and cry like a child if ever you honoured me with a place in your esteem i trust i can now plead more desert i am secure against that crushing grip of iron poverty which alas is less or more fatal to the native worth and purity of i fear the noblest souls and a late important step in my life has kindly taken me out of the way of those ungrateful iniquities which however overlooked in fashionable licence or varnished in fashionable phrase are indeed but lighter and deeper shades of villainy  shortly after my last return to ayrshire i married my jean this was not in consequence of the attachment of romance perhaps but i had a long and muchloved fellowcreatures happiness or misery in my determination and i durst not trifle with so important a deposit nor have i any cause to repent it if i have not got polite tattle modish manners and fashionable dress i am not sickened and disgusted with the multiform curse of boardingschool affectation and i have got the handsomest figure the sweetest temper the soundest constitution and the kindest heart in the county mrs burns believes as firmly as her creed that i am le plus bel esprit et le plus honnête homme in the universe although she scarcely ever in her life except the scriptures of the old and new testament and the psalms of david in metre spent five minutes together on either prose or verse i must except also from this last a certain late publication of scots poems which she has perused very devoutly and all the ballads in the country as she has o the partial lover you will cry the finest wood note wild i ever heard i am the more particular in this ladys character as i know she will henceforth have the honour of a share in your best wishes she is still at mauchline as i am building my house for this hovel that i shelter in while occasionally here is pervious to every blast that blows and every shower that falls and i am only preserved from being chilled to death by being suffocated with smoke i do not find my farm that pennyworth i was taught to expect but i believe in time it may be a saving bargain you will be pleased to hear that i have laid aside the idle éclat and bind every day after my reapers  to save me from that horrid situation of at any time going down in a losing bargain of a farm to misery i have taken my excise instructions and have my commission in my pocket for any emergency of fortune if i could set all before your view whatever disrespect you in common with the world have for this business i know you would approve of my idea  i will make no apology dear madam for this egotistic detail i know you and your sister will be interested in every circumstance of it what signify the silly idle gewgaws of wealth or the ideal trumpery of greatness when fellowpartakers of the same nature fear the same god have the same benevolence of heart the same nobleness of soul the same detestation at everything dishonest and the same scorn at everything unworthyif they are not in the dependence of absolute beggary in the name of common sense are they not equals and if the bias the instinctive bias of their souls run the same way why may they not be friends  when i may have an opportunity of sending you this heaven only knows shenstone says when one is confined idle within doors by bad weather the best antidote against ennui is to read the letters of or write to ones friends in that case then if the weather continues thus i may scrawl you half a quire  i very latelyto wit since harvest beganwrote a poem not in imitation but in the manner of popes moral epistles it is only a short essay just to try the strength of my muses pinion in that way i will send you a copy of it when once i have heard from you i have likewise been laying the foundation of some pretty large poetic works how the superstructure will come on i leave to that great maker and marrer of projects time johnsons collection of scots songs is going on in the third volume and of consequence finds me a consumpt for a great deal of idle metre one of the most tolerable things i have done in that way is two stanzas i made to an air a musical gentleman of my acquaintance composed for the anniversary of his weddingday which happens on the seventh of november take it as follows    the day returnsmy bosom burns   the blissful day we twa did meet etc  i shall give over this letter for shame if i should be seized with a scribbling fit before this goes away i shall make it another letter and then you may allow your patience a weeks respite between the two i have not room for more than the old kind hearty farewell                                       to make some amends mes chères mesdames for dragging you on to this second sheet and to relieve a little the tiresomeness of my unstudied and uncorrectible prose i shall transcribe you some of my late poetic bagatelles though i have these eight or ten months done very little that way one day in a hermitage on the banks of nith belonging to a gentleman in my neighbourhood who is so good as give me a key at pleasure i wrote as follows supposing myself the sequestered venerable inhabitant of the lonely mansion     lines written in friarscarse hermitage     thou whom chance may hither lead    be thou clad in russet weed etc  r b                                cvto mr morison wright mauchline

the 12th instant to make myself understood i had wrote to mr graham enclosing my poem addressed to him and the same post which favoured me with yours brought me an answer from him it was dated the very day he had received mine and i am quite at a loss to say whether it was most polite or kind  your criticisms my honoured benefactress are truly the work of a friend they are not the blasting depredations of a cankertoothed caterpillar critic nor are they the fair statement of cold impartiality balancing with unfeeling exactitude the pro and con of an authors merits they are the judicious observations of animated friendship selecting the beauties of the piece i am just arrived from nithsdale and will be here a fortnight i was on horseback this morning by three oclock for between my wife and my farm is just fortysix miles as i jogged on in the dark i was taken with a poetic fit as follows  mrs ferguson of craigdarrochs lamentation for the death of her son an uncommonly promising youth of eighteen or nineteen years of age     fate gave the wordthe arrow sped    and pierced my darlings heartetc  you will not send me your poetic rambles but you see i am no niggard of mine i am sure your impromptus give me double pleasure what falls from your pen can neither be unentertaining in itself nor indifferent to me  the one fault you found is just but i cannot please myself in an emendation  what a life of solicitude is the life of a parent you interested me much in your young couple  i would not take my folio paper for this epistle and now i repent it i am so jaded with my dirty long journey that i was afraid to drawl into the essence of dulness with anything larger than a quarto and so i must leave out another rhyme of this mornings manufacture  i will pay the sapientipotent george most cheerfully to hear from you ere i leave ayrshire r b                                cviito mr peter hill  mauchline 1st october 1788  i have been here in this country about three days and all that time my chief reading has been the address to lochlomond you were so obliging as to send to me were i impanneled one of the authors jury to determine his criminality respecting the sin of poesy my verdict should be guilty a poet of natures making it is an excellent method for improvement and what i believe every poet does to place some favourite classic author in his walks of study and composition before him as a model though your author had not mentioned the name i could have at half a glance guessed his model to be thomson will my brotherpoet forgive me if i venture to hint that his imitation of that immortal bard is in two or three places rather more servile than such a genius as his requiredeg    to soothe the maddening passions all to peace     address   to soothe the throbbing passions into peace     thomson  i think the address is in simplicity harmony and elegance of versification fully equal to the seasons like thomson too he has looked into nature for himself you meet with no copied description one particular criticism i made at first reading in no one instance has he said too much he never flags in his progress but like a true poet of natures making kindles in his course his beginning is simple and modest as if distrustful of the strength of his passion only i do not altogether like      truth   the soul of every song thats nobly great  fiction is the soul of many a song that is nobly great perhaps i am wrong this may be but a prose criticism is not the phrase in line 7 page 6 great lake too much vulgarised by everyday language for so sublime a poem    great mass of waters theme for nobler song  is perhaps no emendation his enumeration of a comparison with other lakes is at once harmonious and poetic every readers ideas must sweep the    winding margin of a hundred miles  the perspective that follows mountains bluethe imprisoned billows beating in vainthe wooded islesthe digression on the yewtreebenlomonds lofty cloudenvelopd head etc are beautiful a thunderstorm is a subject which has been often tried yet our poet in his grand picture has interjected a circumstance so far as i know entirely original in      the gloom   deep seamd with frequent streaks of moving fire  in his preface to the storm the glens how dark between is noble highland landscape the rain ploughing the red mould too is beautifully fancied benlomonds lofty pathless top is a good expression and the surrounding view from it is truly great the      silver mist   beneath the beaming sun  is well described and here he has contrived to enliven his poem with a little of that passion which bids fair i think to usurp the modern muses altogether i know not how far this episode is a beauty on the whole but the swains wish to carry some faint idea of the vision bright to entertain her partial listening ear is a pretty thought but in my opinion the most beautiful passages in the whole poem are the fowls crowding in wintry frosts to lochlomonds hospitable flood their wheeling round their lighting mixing diving etc and the glorious description of the sportsman this last is equal to anything in the seasons the idea of the floating tribes distant seen far glistering to the moon provoking his eye as he is obliged to leave them is a noble ray of poetic genius  the howling winds the hideous roar of the white cascades are all in the same style  i forget that while i am thus holding forth with the heedless warmth of an enthusiast i am perhaps tiring you with nonsense i must however mention that the last verse of the sixteenth page is one of the most elegant compliments i have ever seen i must likewise notice that beautiful paragraph beginning the gleaming lake etc i dare not go into the particular beauties of the last two paragraphs but they are admirably fine and truly ossianic i must beg your pardon for this lengthened scrawl i had no idea of it when i begani should like to know who the author is but whoever he be please present him with my grateful thanks for the entertainment he has afforded me90  a friend of mine desired me to commission for him two books letters on the religion essential to man a book you sent me before and the world unmasked or the philosopher the greatest cheat send me them by the first opportunity the bible you sent me is truly elegant i only wish it had been in two volumes r b     footnote 90 the poem entitled an address to lochlomond is said    to have been written by one of the masters of the high school of    edinburgh                                       cviilto the editor of the star  november 8th 1788  sirnotwithstanding the opprobrious epithets with which some of our philosophers and gloomy sectarians have branded our naturethe principle of universal selfishness the proneness to all evil they have given usstill the detestation in which inhumanity to the distressed or insolence to the fallen are held by all mankind shows that they are not natives of the human heart even the unhappy partner of our kind who is undone the bitter consequence of his follies or his crimeswho but sympathises with the miseries of this ruined profligate brother we forget the injuries and feel for the man  i went last wednesday to my parish church most cordially to join in grateful acknowledgment to the author of all good for the consequent blessings of the glorious revolution to that auspicious event we owe no less than our liberties civil and religious to it we are likewise indebted for the present royal family the ruling features of whose administration have ever been mildness to the subject and tenderness of his rights  bred and educated in revolution principles the principles of reason and common sense it could not be any silly political prejudice which made my heart revolt at the harsh abusive manner in which the reverend gentleman mentioned the house of stuart and which i am afraid was too much the language of the day we may rejoice sufficiently in our deliverance from past evils without cruelly raking up the ashes of those whose misfortune it was perhaps as much as their crime to be the authors of those evils and we may bless god for all his goodness to us as a nation without at the same time cursing a few ruined powerless exiles who only harboured ideas and made attempts that most of us would have done had we been in their situation  the bloody and tyrannical house of stuart may be said with propriety and justice when compared with the present royal family and the sentiments of our days but is there no allowance to be made for the manners of the times were the royal contemporaries of the stuarts more attentive to their subjects rights might not the epithets of bloody and tyrannical be with at least equal justice applied to the house of tudor of york or any other of their predecessors  the simple state of the case sir seems to be thisat that period the science of government the knowledge of the true relation between king and subject was like other sciences and other knowledge just in its infancy emerging from dark ages of ignorance and barbarity  the stuarts only contended for prerogatives which they knew their predecessors enjoyed and which they saw their contemporaries enjoying but these prerogatives were inimical to the happiness of a nation and the rights of subjects  in this contest between prince and people the consequence of that light of science which had lately dawned over europe the monarch of france for example was victorious over the struggling liberties of his people with us luckily the monarch failed and his unwarrantable pretensions fell a sacrifice to our rights and happiness whether it was owing to the wisdom of leading individuals or to the justling of parties i cannot pretend to determine but likewise happily for us the kingly power was shifted into another branch of the family who as they owed the throne solely to the call of a free people could claim nothing inconsistent with the covenanted terms which placed them there  the stuarts have been condemned and laughed at for the folly and impracticability of their attempts in 1715 and 1745 that they failed i bless god but cannot join in the ridicule against them who does not know that the abilities or defects of leaders and commanders are often hidden until put to the touchstone of exigency and that there is a caprice of fortune an omnipotence in particular accidents and conjunctures of circumstances which exalt us as heroes or brand us as madmen just as they are for or against us  man mr publisher is a strange weak inconsistent being who would believe sir that in this our augustan age of liberality and refinement while we seem so justly sensible and jealous of our rights and liberties and animated with such indignation against the very memory of those who would have subverted themthat a certain people under our national protection should complain not against our monarch and a few favourite advisers but against our whole legislative body for similar oppression and almost in the very same terms as our forefathers did of the house of stuart i will not i cannot enter into the merits of the cause but i dare say the american congress in 1776 will be allowed to be as able and enlightened as the english convention was in 1688 and that their posterity will celebrate the centenary of their deliverance from us as duly and sincerely as we do ours from the oppressive measures of the wrongheaded house of stuart  to conclude sir let every man who has a tear for the many miseries incident to humanity feel for a family illustrious as any in europe and unfortunate beyond historic precedent and let every briton and particularly every scotsman who ever looked with reverential pity on the dotage of a parent cast a veil over the fatal mistake of the kings of his forefathers  r b                                       cixto mrs dunlop at moreham mains  mauchline 13th november 1788  madami had the very great pleasure of dining at dunlop yesterday men are said to flatter women because they are weak if it is so poets must be weaker still for misses r and k and miss g mk with their flattering attentions and artful compliments absolutely turned my head i own they did not lard me over as many a poet does his patron but they so intoxicated me with their sly insinuations and delicate innuendos of compliment that if it had not been for a lucky recollection how much additional weight and lustre your good opinion and friendship must give me in that circle i had certainly looked upon myself as a person of no small consequence i dare not say one word how much i was charmed with the majors friendly welcome elegant manner and acute remark lest i should be thought to balance my orientalisms of applause overagainst the finest heifer in ayrshire which he made me a present of to help and adorn my farmstock as it was on hallowday i am determined annually as that day returns to decorate her horns with an ode of gratitude to the family of dunlop  so soon as i know of your arrival at dunlop i will take the first conveniency to dedicate a day or perhaps two to you and friendship under the guarantee of the majors hospitality there will soon be three score and ten miles of permanent distance between us and now that your friendship and friendly correspondence is entwisted with the heartstrings of my enjoyment of life i must indulge myself in a happy day of the feast of reason and the flow of soul  r b                                       cxto dr blacklock  mauchline november 15th 1788  reverend and dear siras i hear nothing of your motions but that you are or were out of town i do not know where this may find you or whether it will find you at all i wrote you a long letter dated from the land of matrimony in june but either it had not found you or what i dread more it found you or mrs blacklock in too precarious a state of health and spirits to take notice of an idle packet  i have done many little things for johnson since i had the pleasure of seeing you and i have finished one piece in the way of popes moral epistles but from your silence i have everything to fear so i have only sent you two melancholy things which i tremble to fear may too well suit the tone of your present feelings  in a fortnight i move bag and baggage to nithsdale till then my direction is at this place after that period it will be at ellisland near dumfries it would extremely oblige me were it but half a line to let me know how you are and where you are can i be indifferent to the fate of a man to whom i owe so mucha man whom i not only esteem but venerate  my warmest good wishes and most respectful compliments to mrs blacklock and miss johnson if she is with you  i cannot conclude without telling you that i am more and more pleased with the step i took respecting my jean two things from my happy experience i set down as apophthegms

december 1788  my dear honoured friendyours dated edinburgh which i have just read makes me very unhappy almost blind and wholly deaf are melancholy news of human nature but when told of a muchloved and honoured friend they carry misery in the sound goodness on your part and gratitude on mine began a tie which has gradually entwisted itself among the dearest chords of my bosom and i tremble at the omens of your late and present ailing habit and shattered health you miscalculate matters widely when you forbid my waiting on you lest it should hurt my worldly concerns my small scale of farming is exceedingly more simple and easy than what you have lately seen at moreham mains but be that as it may the heart of the man and the fancy of the poet are the two grand considerations for which i live if miry ridges and dirty dunghills are to engross the best part of the functions of my soul immortal i had better been a rook or a magpie at once and then i should not have been plagued with any ideas superior to breaking of clods and picking up grubs not to mention barndoor cocks of mallards creatures with which i could almost exchange lives at any time if you continue so deaf i am afraid a visit will be no great pleasure to either of us but if i hear you are got so well again as to be able to relish conversation look you to it madam for i will make my threatenings good i am to be at the newyearday fair of ayr and by all that is sacred in the world friend i will come and see you  your meeting which you so well describe with your old schoolfellow and friend was truly interesting out upon the ways of the world they spoil these social offsprings of the heart two veterans of the men of the world would have met with little more heartworkings than two old hacks worn out on the road apropos is not the scotch phrase auld lang syne exceedingly expressive there is an old song and tune which has often thrilled through my soul you know i am an enthusiast in old scotch song i shall give you the verses on the other sheet as i suppose mr kerr92 will save you the postage    should auld acquaintance be forgot  light be the turf on the breast of the heaveninspired poet who composed

my cask of whisky for the first time and i assure you it does you great credit it will bear five waters strong or six ordinary toddy the whisky of this country is a most rascally liquor and by consequence only drunk by the most rascally part of the inhabitants i am persuaded if you once get a footing here you might do a great deal of business in the way of consumpt and should you commence distiller again this is the native barley country i am ignorant if in your present way of dealing you would think it worth your while to extend your business so far as this countryside i write you this on the account of an accident which i must take the merit of having partly designed too a neighbour of mine a john currie miller in carse milla man who is in a word a very good man even for a £500 bargainhe and his wife were in my house the time i broke open the cask they keep a country publichouse and sell a great deal of foreign spirits but all along thought that whisky would have degraded their house they were perfectly astonished at my whisky both for its taste and strength and by their desire i write you to know if you could supply them with liquor of an equal quality and what price please write me by first post and direct to me at ellisland near dumfries if you could take a jaunt this way yourself i have a spare spoon knife and fork very much at your service my compliments to mrs tennant and all the good folks in glenconnel and barguharrie  r b                                       cxiiito mrs dunlop  ellisland newyearday morning 1789  this dear madam is a morning of wishes and would to god that i came under the apostle jamess descriptionthe prayer of a righteous man availeth much in that case madam you should welcome in a year full of blessings everything that obstructs or disturbs tranquillity and selfenjoyment should be removed and every pleasure that frail humanity can taste should be yours i own myself so little a presbyterian that i approve of set times and seasons of more than ordinary acts of devotion for breaking in on that habituated routine of life and thought which is so apt to reduce our existence to a kind of instinct or even sometimes and with some minds to a state very little superior to mere machinery  this day the first sunday of may a breezy blueskyed noon some time about the beginning and a hoary morning and calm sunny day about the end of autumn these time out of mind have been with me a kind of holiday  i believe i owe this to that glorious paper in the spectator the vision of mirza a piece that struck my young fancy before i was capable of fixing an idea to a word of three syllables on the fifth day of the moon which according to the custom of my forefathers i always keep holy after having washed myself and offered up my morning devotions i ascended the high hill of bagdat in order to pass the rest of the day in meditation and prayer  we know nothing or next to nothing of the substance or structure of our souls so cannot account for those seeming caprices in them that one should be particularly pleased with this thing or struck with that which on minds of a different cast makes no extraordinary impression i have some favourite flowers in spring among which are the mountaindaisy the harebell the foxglove the wild brierrose the budding birch and the hoary hawthorn that i view and hang over with particular delight i never hear the loud solitary whistle of the curlew in a summer noon or the wild mixing cadence of a troop of grey plovers in an autumnal morning without feeling an elevation of soul like the enthusiasm of devotion or poetry tell me my dear friend to what can this be owing are we a piece of machinery which like the Æolian harp passive takes the impression of the passing accident or do these workings argue something within us above the trodden clod i own myself partial to such proofs of those awful and important realitiesa god that made all thingsmans immaterial and immortal natureand a world of weal or woe beyond death and the grave  r b                                       cxivto dr moore london  ellisland 4th jan 1789  siras often as i think of writing to you which has been three or four times every week these six months it gives me something so like the idea of an ordinarysized statue offering at a conversation with the rhodian colossus that my mind misgives me and the affair always miscarries somewhere between purpose and resolve i have at last got some business with you and business letters are written by the stylebook i say my business is with you sir for you never had any with me except the business that benevolence has in the mansion of poverty  the character and employment of a poet were formerly my pleasure but are now my pride i know that a very great deal of my late éclat was owing to the singularity of my situation and the honest prejudice of scotsmen but still as i said in the preface to my first edition i do look upon myself as having some pretensions from nature to the poetic character i have not a doubt but the knack the aptitude to learn the muses trade is a gift bestowed by him who forms the secret bias of the soul but i as firmly believe that excellence in the profession is the fruit of industry labour attention and pains at least i am resolved to try my doctrine by the test of experience another appearance from the press i put off to a very distant day a day that may never arrivebut poesy i am determined to prosecute with all my vigour nature has given very few if any of the profession the talents of shining in every species of composition i shall try for until trial it is impossible to know whether she has qualified me to shine in any one the worst of it is by the time one has finished a piece it has been so often viewed and reviewed before the mental eye that one loses in a good measure the powers of critical discrimination here the best criterion i know is a friendnot only of abilities to judge but with goodnature enough like a prudent teacher with a young learner to praise perhaps a little more than is exactly just lest the thinskinned animal fall into that most deplorable of all poetic diseasesheartbreaking despondency of himself dare i sir already immensely indebted to your goodness ask the additional obligation of your being that friend to me i inclose you an essay of mine in a walk of poesy to me entirely new i mean the epistle addressed to r g esq or robert graham of fintry esq a gentleman of uncommon worth to whom i lie under very great obligations the story of the poem like most of my poems is connected with my own story and to give you the one i must give you something of the other i cannot boast of mr creechs ingenuous fair dealing to me he kept me hanging about edinburgh from the 7th august 1787 until the 13th april 1788 before he would condescend to give a statement of affairs nor had i got it even then but for an angry letter i wrote him which irritated his pride i could not a tale but a detail unfold but what am i that should speak against the lords anointed bailie of edinburgh93  i believe i shall in whole £100 copyright included clear about £400 some little odds and even part of this depends upon what the gentleman has yet to settle with me i give you this information because you did me the honour to interest yourself much in my welfare i give you this information but i give it to yourself only for i am still much in the gentlemans mercy perhaps i injure the man in the idea i am sometimes tempted to have of himgod forbid i should a little time will try for in a month i shall go to town to wind up the business if possible  to give the rest of my story in brief i have married my jean and taken a farm with the first step i have every day more and more reason to be satisfied with the last it is rather the reverse i have a younger brother who supports my aged mother another still younger brother and three sisters in a farm on my last return from edinburgh it cost me about £180 to save them from ruin  not that i have lost so muchi only interposed between my brother and his impending fate by the loan of so much i give myself no airs on this for it was mere selfishness on my part i was conscious that the wrong scale of the balance was pretty heavily charged and i thought that throwing a

mr robert ainslie  ellisland january 6th 1789  many happy returns of the season to you my dear sir may you be comparatively happy up to your comparative worth among the sons of men which wish would i am sure make you one of the most blessed of the human race  i do not know if passing a writer to the signet be a trial of scientific merit or a mere business of friends and interest however it be let me quote you my two favourite passages which though i have repeated them ten thousand times still they rouse my manhood and steel my resolution like inspiration      on reason build resolve   that

compeers seventenths of them come short of your advantages natural and accidental while two of those that remain either neglect their parts as flowers blooming in a desert or misspend their strength like a bull goring a bramble bush  but to change the theme i am still catering for johnsons publication and among others i have brushed up the following old favourite song a little with a view to your worship i have only altered a word here and there but if you like the humour of it we shall think of a stanza or two to add to it r b                                       cxvito professor dugald stewart  ellisland 20th jan 1789  sirthe inclosed sealed packet i sent to edinburgh a few days after i had the happiness of meeting you in ayrshire but you were gone for the continent i have now added a few more of my productions those for which i am indebted to the nithsdale muses the piece inscribed to r g esq is a copy of verses i sent mr graham of fintry accompanying a request for his assistance in a matter to me of very great moment to that gentleman i am already doubly indebted for deeds of kindness of serious import to my dearest interests done in a manner grateful to the delicate feelings of sensibility this poem is a species of composition new to me but i do not intend it shall be my last essay of the kind as you will see by the poets progress these fragments if my design succeed are but a small part of the intended whole i propose it shall be the work of my utmost exertions ripened by years of course i do not wish it much known the fragment beginning a little upright pert tart etc i have not shown to man living till i now send it you it forms the postulata the axioms the definition of a character which if it appear at all shall be placed in a variety of lights this particular part i send you merely as a sample of my hand at portraitsketching but lest idle conjecture should pretend to point out the original please to let it be for your single sole inspection  need i make any apology for this trouble to a gentleman who has treated me with such marked benevolence and peculiar kindness who has entered into my interests with so much zeal and on whose critical decisions i can so fully depend a poet as i am by trade these decisions are to me of the last consequence my late transient acquaintance among some of the mere rank and file of greatness i resign with ease but to the distinguished champions of genius and learning i shall be ever ambitious of being known the native genius and accurate discernment in mr stewarts critical strictures the justness iron justice for he has no bowels of compassion for a poor poetic sinner of dr gregorys remarks and the delicacy of professor dalzels taste i shall ever revere  i shall be in edinburgh some time next monthi have the honour to be sir your highly obliged and very humble servant r b                                       cxviito mr robert cleghorn saughton mills  ellisland 23rd jan 1789  i must take shame and confusion of face to myself my dear friend and brother farmer that i have not written you much sooner the truth is i have been so tossed about between ayrshire and nithsdale that till now i have got my family here i have had time to think of nothing except now and then a stanza or so as i rode along were it not for our gracious monarchs cursed tax of postage i had sent you one or two pieces of some length that i have lately done i have no idea of the press i am more able to support myself and family though in a humble yet an independent way and i mean just at my leisure to pay court to the tuneful sisters in the hope that they may one day enable me to carry on a work of some importance the following are a few verses which i wrote in a neighbouring gentlemans hermitage to which he is so good as let me have a key                                       cxviiito bishop geddes edinburgh  ellisland 3rd feb 1789  venerable fatheras i am conscious that wherever i am you do me the honour to interest yourself in my welfare it gives me pleasure to inform you that i am here at last stationary in the serious business of life and have now not only the retired leisure but the hearty inclination to attend to those great and important questionswhat i am where i am and for what i am destined  in that first concern the conduct of the man there was ever but one side on which i was habitually blameable and there i have secured myself in the way pointed out by nature and natures god i was sensible that to so helpless a creature as a poor poet a wife and family were incumbrances which a species of prudence would bid him shun but when the alternative was being at eternal warfare with myself on account of habitual follies to give them no worse name which no general example no licentious wit no sophistical infidelity would to me ever justify i must have been a fool to have hesitated and a madman to have made another choice besides i had in my jean a long and muchloved fellowcreatures happiness or misery among my hands and who could trifle with such a deposit  in the affair of a livelihood i think myself tolerably secure i have good hopes of my farm but should they fail i have an excise commission which on my simple petition will at any time procure me bread there is a certain stigma affixed to the character of an excise officer but i do not pretend to borrow honour from my profession and though the salary be comparatively small it is luxury to anything that the first twentyfive years of my life taught me to expect  thus with a rational aim and method in life you may easily guess my reverend and muchhonoured friend that my characteristical trade is not forgotten i am if possible more than ever an enthusiast to the muses i am determined to study man and nature and in that view incessantly and to try if the ripening and corrections of years can enable me to produce something worth preserving  you will see in your book which i beg your pardon for detaining so long that i have been tuning my lyre on the banks of nith some large poetic plans that are floating in my imagination or partly put in execution i shall impart to you when i have the pleasure of meeting with you which if you are then in edinburgh i shall have about the beginning of march  that acquaintance worthy sir with which you were pleased to honour me you must still allow me to challenge for with whatever unconcern i give up my transient connection with the merely great i cannot lose the patronising notice of the learned and good without the bitterest regret  r b                                       cxixto mr james burness  ellisland 9th feb 1789  my dear sirwhy i did not write to you long ago is what even on the rack i could not answer if you can in your mind form an idea of indolence dissipation hurry cares change of country entering on untried scenes of life all combined you will save me the trouble of a blushing apology it could not be want of regard for a man for whom i had a high esteem before i knew himan esteem which has much increased since i did know him and this caveat entered i shall plead guilty to any other indictment with which you shall please to charge me  after i parted from you for many months my life was one continued scene of dissipation here at last i am become stationary and have taken a farm anda wife  the farm is beautifully situated on the nith a large river that runs by dumfries and falls into the solway frith i have gotten a lease of my farm as long as i please but how it may turn out is just a guess and it is yet to improve and inclose etc however i have good hopes of my bargain on the whole  my wife is my jean with whose story you are partly acquainted i found i had a muchloved fellowcreatures happiness or misery among my hands and i durst not trifle with so sacred a deposit indeed i have not any reason to repent the step i have taken as i have attached myself to a very good wife and have shaken myself loose of every bad failing  i have found my book a very profitable business and with the profits of it i have begun life pretty decently should fortune not favour me in farming as i have no great faith in her fickle ladyship i have provided myself in another resource which however some folks may affect to despise it is still a comfortable shift in the day of misfortune in the heyday of my fame a gentleman whose name at least i daresay you know as his estate lies somewhere near dundee mr graham of fintry one of the commissioners of excise offered me the commission of an excise officer i thought it prudent to accept the offer and accordingly i took my instructions and have my commission by me whether i may ever do duty or be a penny the better for it is what i do not know but i have the comfortable assurance that come whatever ill fate will i can on my simple petition to the excise board get into employ  we have lost poor uncle robert this winter he has long been very weak and with very little alteration on him he expired 3rd january  his son william has been with me this winter and goes in may to be an apprentice to a mason his other son the eldest john comes to me i expect in summer they are both remarkably stout young fellows and promise to do well his only daughter fanny has been with me ever since her fathers death and i purpose keeping her in my family till she is woman grown and fit for better service she is one of the cleverest girls and has one of the most amiable dispositions i have ever seen  all friends in this country

relation merited all the    commendations he has here bestowed i remember her while she lived at    ellisland and better still as the wife of adam armour the brother    of bonnie jeancunningham

like mine the scene of domestic comfortthe bustle of edinburgh will soon be a business of sickening disgust    vain pomp and glory of this world i hate you  when i must skulk into a corner lest the rattling equipage of some gaping blockhead should mangle me in the mire i am tempted to exclaimwhat merits has he had or what demerit have i had in some state of preexistence that he is ushered into this state of being with the sceptre of rule and the key of riches in his puny fist and i am kicked into the world the sport of folly or the victim of pride i have read somewhere of a monarch in spain i think it was who was so out of humour with the ptolemean system of astronomy that he said had he been of the creators council he could have saved him a great deal of labour and absurdity i will not defend this blasphemous speech but often as i have glided with humble stealth through the pomp of princes street it has suggested itself to me as an improvement on the present human figure that a man in proportion to his own conceit of his consequence in the world could have pushed out the longitude of his common size as a snail pushes out his horns or as we draw out a perspective this trifling alteration not to mention the prodigious saving it would be in the tear and wear of the neck and limbsinews of many of his majestys liegesubjects in the way of tossing the head and tiptoe strutting would evidently turn out a vast advantage in enabling us at once to adjust the ceremonials in making a bow or making way to a great man and that too within a second of the precise spherical angle of reverence or an inch of the particular point of respectful distance which the important creature itself requires as a measuringglance at its towering altitude would determine the affair like instinct  you are right madam in your idea of poor mylnes poem which he has addressed to me the piece has a good deal of merit but it has one great faultit is by far too long besides my success has encouraged such a shoal of illspawned monsters to crawl into public notice under the title of scottish poets that the very term scottish poetry borders on the burlesque when i write to mr carfrae i shall advise him rather to try one of his deceased friends english pieces i am prodigiously hurried with my own matters else i would have requested a perusal of all mylnes poetic performances and would have offered his friends my assistance in either selecting or correcting what would be proper for the press what it is that occupies me so much and perhaps a little oppresses my present spirits shall fill up a paragraph in some future letter in the meantime allow me to close this epistle with a few lines done by a friend of mine i give you them that as you have seen the original you may guess whether one or two alterations i have ventured to make in them be any real improvement    like the fair plant that from our touch withdraws   shrink mildly fearful even from applause   be all a mothers fondest hope can dream   and all you are my charming rachel seem   straight as the foxglove ere her bells disclose   mild as the maidenblushing hawthorn blows   fair as the fairest of each lovely kind

ellisland mar 9th 1789  madamthe letter you wrote me to herons carried its own answer you forbade me to write you unless i was willing to plead guilty to a certain indictment you were pleased to bring against me as i am convinced of my own innocence and though conscious of high imprudence and egregious folly can lay my hand on my breast and attest the rectitude of my heart you will pardon me madam if i do not carry my complaisance so far as humbly to acquiesce in the name of villain merely out of compliment to your opinion much as i esteem your judgment and warmly as i regard your worth  i have already told you and i again aver it that at the time alluded to i was not under the smallest moral tie to mrs burns nor did i nor could i then know all the powerful circumstances that omnipotent necessity was busy laying in wait for me when you call over the scenes that have passed between us you will survey the conduct of an honest man struggling successfully with temptations the most powerful that ever beset humanity and preserving untainted honour in situations where the austerest virtue would have forgiven a fall situations that i will dare to say not a single individual of all his kind even with half his sensibility and passion could have encountered without ruin and i leave you madam to guess how such a man is likely to digest an accusation of perfidious treachery                                       when i shall have regained your good opinion perhaps i may venture to solicit your friendship but be that as it may the first of her sex i ever knew shall always be the

much needs your assistance and where you can effectually serve him mr nielson is on his way for france to wait on his grace of queensberry on some little business of a good deal of importance to him and he wishes for your instructions respecting the most eligible mode of travelling etc for him when he has crossed the channel i should not have dared to take this liberty with you but that i am told by those who have the honour of your personal acquaintance that to be a poor honest scotsman is a letter of recommendation to you and that to have it in your power to serve such a character gives you much pleasure  the inclosed ode is a compliment to the memory of the late mrs oswald of auchencruive you probably knew her personally an honour of which i cannot boast but i spent my early years in the neighbourhood and among her servants and tenants i know that she was detested with the most heartfelt cordiality however in the particular part of her conduct which roused my poetic wrath she was much less blameable in january last on my road to ayrshire i had put up at bailie whighams in sanquhar the only tolerable inn in the place the frost was keen and the grim evening and howling wind were ushering in a night of snow and drift my horse and i were both much fatigued with the labours of the day and just as my friend the bailie and i were bidding defiance to the storm over a smoking bowl

christened pegasus twelve miles farther on through the wildest moors and hills of ayrshire to new cumnock the next inn the powers of poesy and prose sink under me when i would describe what i felt

you cannot easily imagine what thinskinned animalswhat sensitive plants poor poets are how do we shrink into the imbittered corner of selfabasement when neglected or condemned by those to whom we look

nor your friend but the legislature by express proviso in their postage laws should frank a letter informed with the soul of friendship is such an honour to human nature that they should order it free ingress and egress to and from their bags and mails as an encouragement and mark of distinction to supereminent virtue  i have just put the last hand to a little poem which i think will be something to your taste99 one morning lately as i was out pretty early in the fields sowing some grass seeds i heard the burst of a shot from a neighbouring plantation and presently a poor little wounded hare came crippling by me you will guess my indignation at the inhuman fellow who could shoot a hare at this season when all of them have young ones indeed there is something in that business of destroying for our sport individuals in the animal creation that do not injure us materially which i could never reconcile to my ideas of virtue  let me know how you like my poem i am doubtful whether it would not be an improvement to keep out the last stanza but one altogether  cruikshank is a glorious production of the author of man you he and the noble colonel100 of the crochallan fencibles are to me

friend of my heart and the companion of my peregrinations but i have been condemned to drudgery beyond sufferance though not thank god beyond redemption i have had a collection of poems by a lady put into my hands to prepare them for the press which horrid task with sowing corn with my own hand a parcel of masons wrights plasterers etc to attend to roaming on business through ayrshireall this was against me and the very first dreadful article was of itself too much for me  13th i have not had a moment to spare from incessant toil since the 8th life my dear sir is a serious matter you know by experience that a mans individual self is a good deal but believe me a wife and family of children whenever you have the honour to be a husband and a father will show you that your present and most anxious hours of solitude are spent on trifles the welfare of those who are very dear to us whose only support hope and stay we arethis to a generous mind is another sort of more important object of care than any concerns whatever which centre merely in the individual on the other hand let no young rakehelly dog among you make a song of his pretended liberty and freedom from care if the relations we stand in to king country kindred and friends be anything but the visionary fancies of dreaming metaphysicians if religion virtue magnanimity generosity humanity and justice be ought but empty sounds then the man who may be said to live only for others for the beloved honourable female whose tender faithful embrace endears life and for the helpless little innocents who are to be the men and women the worshippers of his god the subjects of his king and the support nay the very vital existence of his country in the ensuing agecompare such a man with any fellow whatever who whether he bustle and push in business among labourers clerks statesmen or whether he roar and rant and drink and sing in tavernsa fellow over whose grave no one will breathe a single heighho except from the cobwebtie of what is called good fellowshipwho has no view nor aim but what terminates in himselfif there be any grovelling earthborn wretch of our species a renegade to common sense who would fain believe that the noble creature man is no better than a sort of fungus generated out of nothing nobody knows how and soon dissipating in nothing nobody knows where such a stupid beast such a crawling reptile might balance the foregoing unexaggerated comparison but no one else would have the patience  forgive me my dear sir for this long silence to make you amends i shall send you soon and more

effusions the miserable effusions of low spirits just as they flow from their bitter spring i know not of any particular cause for this worst of all my foes besetting me but for some time my soul has been beclouded with a thickening atmosphere of evil imaginations and gloomy presages  monday evening  i have just heard mr kilpatrick preach a sermon he is a man famous for his benevolence and i revere him but from such ideas of my creator good lord deliver me religion my honoured friend is surely a simple business as it equally concerns the ignorant and the learned the poor and the rich that there is an incomprehensible great being to whom i owe my existence and that he must be intimately acquainted with the operations and progress of the internal machinery and consequent outward deportment of this creature which he has made these are i think selfevident propositions that there is a real and eternal distinction between virtue and vice and consequently that i am an accountable creature that from the seeming nature of the human mind as well as from the evident imperfection nay positive injustice in the administration of affairs both in the natural and moral worlds there must be a retributive scene of existence beyond the grave must i think be allowed by every one who will give himself a moments reflection i will go farther and affirm that from the sublimity excellence and purity of his doctrine and precepts unparalleled by all the aggregated wisdom and learning of many preceding ages though to appearance he himself was the obscurest and most illiterate of our species therefore jesus christ was from god  whatever mitigates the woes or increases the happiness of others this is my criterion of goodness and whatever injures society at large or any individual in it this is my measure of iniquity  what think you madam of my creed i trust that i have said nothing that will lessen me in the eye of one whose good opinion i value almost next to the approbation of my

extraordinarythat he shall go on from day to day from week to week from month to month or perhaps from year to year suffering a hundred times more in an hour from the impotent consciousness of neglecting what he ought to do than the very doing of it would cost him i am deeply indebted to you first for a most elegant poetic compliment then for a polite obliging letter and lastly for your excellent poem on the slave trade and yet wretch that i am though the debts were debts of honour and the creditor a lady i have put off and put off even the very acknowledgment of the obligation until you must indeed be the very angel i take you for if you can forgive me  your poem i have read with the highest pleasure i have a way whenever i read a booki mean a book in our own trade madam a poetic one and when it is my own propertythat i take a pencil and mark at the ends of verses or note on margins and odd paper little criticisms of approbation or disapprobation as i peruse along i will make no apology for presenting you with a few unconnected thoughts that occurred to me in my repeated perusals of your poem i want to show you that i have honesty enough to tell you what i take to be truths even when they are not quite on the side of approbation and i do it in the firm faith that you have equal greatness of mind to hear them with pleasure here follows a list of strictures  i had lately the honour of a letter from dr moore where he tells me that he has sent me some books they are not yet come to hand but i hear they are on the way  wishing you all success in your progress in the path of fame and that you may equally escape the danger of stumbling through incautious speed or losing ground through loitering neglect i am etc  r b                                       cxxxito mr robert graham of fintry  ellisland 31st july 1789  sirthe language of gratitude has been so prostituted by servile adulation and designing flattery that i know not how to express myself when i would acknowledge receipt of your last letter i beg and hope everhonoured friend of my life and patron of my rhymes that you will always give me credit for the sincerest chastest gratitude i dare call the searcher of hearts and author of all goodness to witness how truly grateful i am  mr mitchell101 did not wait my calling on him but sent me a kind letter giving me a hint of the business and yesterday he entered with the most friendly ardour into my views and interests he seems to think and from my private knowledge i am certain he is right that removing the officer who now does and for these many years has done duty in the division in the middle of which i live will be productive of at least no disadvantage to the revenue and may likewise be done without any detriment to him should the honourable board of excise think so and should they deem it eligible to appoint me to officiate in his present place i am then at the top of my wishes the emoluments in my office will enable me to carry on and enjoy those improvements on my farm which but for this additional assistance i might in a year or two have abandoned should it be judged improper to place me in this division i am deliberating whether i had not better give up my farming altogether and go into the excise whenever i can find employment now that the salary is £50 per annum the excise is surely a much superior object to a farm which without some foreign assistance must for half a lease be a losing bargain the worst of it isi know there are some respectable characters who do me the honour to interest themselves in my welfare and behaviour and as leaving the farm so soon may have an unsteady giddyheaded appearance i had better perhaps lose a little money than hazard their esteem  you see sir with what freedom i lay before you all my little matterslittle indeed to the world but of the most important magnitude to me were it not for a very few of our kind the very existence of magnanimity generosity and all their kindred virtues would be as much a question with metaphysicians as the existence of witchcraft perhaps the nature of man is not so much to blame for this as the situation in which by some miscarriage or other he is placed in this world the poor naked helpless wretch with such voracious appetites and such a famine of provision for them is under a cursed necessity of turning selfish in his own defence except a few instances of original scoundrelism thoroughpaced selfishness is always the work of time indeed in a little time we generally grow so attentive to ourselves and so regardless of others that i have often in poetic frenzy looked on this world as one vast ocean occupied and commoved by innumerable vortices each whirling round its centre these vortices are the children of men the great design and if i may say so merit of each particular vortex consists in how widely it can extend the influence of its circle and how much floating trash it can suck in and absorb  i know not why i have got into this preaching vein except it be to show you that it is not my ignorance but my knowledge of mankind which makes me so much admire your goodness to me  i shall return your books very soon i only wish to give dr adam smith one other perusal which i will do in one or two days  r b     footnote 101 a collector in the excise

john logan of knock shinnock  ellisland near dumfries 7th aug 1789  dear siri intended to have written you long ere now and as i told you i had gotten three stanzas on my way in a poetic epistle to you but that old enemy of all good works the devil threw me into a prosaic mire and for the soul of me i cannot get out of it i dare not write you a long letter as i am going to intrude on your time with a long ballad i have as you will shortly see finished the kirks alarm but now that it is done and that i have laughed once or twice at the conceits in some of the stanzas i am determined not to let it get into the public so i send you this copy the first that i have sent to ayrshire except some few of the stanzas which i wrote off in embryo for gavin hamilton under the express provision and request that you will only read it to a few of us and do not on any account give or permit to be taken any copy of the ballad if i could be of any service to dr mgill i would do it though it should be at a much greater expense than irritating a few bigoted priests but i am afraid serving him in his present embarras is a task too hard for me i have enemies enow god knows though i do not wantonly add to the number still as i think there is some merit in two or three of the thoughts i send it to you as a small but sincere testimony how much and with what respectful esteem i am dear sir your obliged

poet at all seasons will i hope plead my excuse for neglecting so long to answer your obliging letter of the 5th august   when i received your letter i was transcribing for the star my letter to the magistrates of the canongate of edinburgh begging their permission to place a tombstone over poor fergusson 102a poor fergusson if there be a life beyond the grave which i trust there is and if there be a good god presiding over all nature which i am sure there is thou art now enjoying existence in a glorious world where worth of heart alone is distinction in the man where riches deprived of their pleasurepurchasing powers return to their native sordid matter where titles and honours are the disregarded reveries of an idle dream and where that heavy virtue which is the negative consequence of steady dulness and those thoughtless though often destructive follies which are the unavoidable aberrations of frail human nature will be thrown into equal oblivion as if they had never been  r b

ellisland 6th sept 1789  dear madami have mentioned in my last my appointment to the excise and the birth of little frank who by the bye i trust will be no discredit to the honourable name of wallace as he has a fine manly countenance and a figure that might do credit to a liltle fellow two months older and likewise an excellent good temper though when he pleases he has a pipe only not quite so loud as the horn that his immortal namesake blew as a signal to take out the pin of stirling bridge  i had some time ago an epistle part poetic and part prosaic from your poetess miss j little104 a very ingenious but modest composition i should have written her as she requested but for the hurry of this new business i have heard of her and her compositions in this country and i am happy to add always to the honour of her character the fact is i knew not well how to write to her i should sit down to a sheet of paper that i knew not how to stain i am no dab at finedrawn letterwriting and except when prompted by friendship or gratitude or which happens extremely rarely inspired by the muse i know not her name that presides over epistolary writing i sit down when necessitated to write as i would sit down to beat hemp  some parts of your letter of the 2oth august struck me with the most melancholy concern for the state of your mind at present  would i could write you a letter of comfort i would sit down to it with as much pleasure as i would to write an epic poem of my own composition that should equal the iliad religion my dear friend is the true comfort a strong persuasion in a future state of existence a proposition so obviously probable that setting revelation aside every nation and people so far as investigation has reached for at least near four thousand years have in some mode or other firmly believed it in vain would we reason and pretend to doubt i have myself done so to a very daring pitch but when i reflected that i was opposing the most ardent wishes and the most darling hopes of good men and flying in the face of all human belief in all ages i was shocked at my own conduct  i know not whether i have ever sent you the following lines or if you have ever seen them but it is one of my favourite quotations which i keep constantly by me in my progress through life in the language of the book of job    against the day of battle and of war  spoken of religion    tis this my friend that streaks our morning bright   tis this that gilds the horror of our night   when wealth forsakes us and when friends are few   when friends are faithless or when foes pursue   tis this that wards the blow or stills the smart   disarms affliction or repels his dart   within the breast bids purest raptures rise   bids smiling conscience spread her cloudless skies  i have been busy with zeluco the doctor is so obliging as to request my opinion of it and i have been revolving in my mind some kind of criticisms on novelwriting but it is a depth beyond my research i shall however digest my thoughts on the subject as well as i can zeluco is a most sterling performance  farewell a dieu le bon dieu je vous commende     footnote 104 a maid servant at

elements and skies in the full persuasion that they would announce it to the astonished world by some phenomena of terrific portent yesternight until a very late hour did i wait with anxious horror for the appearance of some comet firing half the sky or aerial armies of sanguinary scandinavians darting athwart the startled heavens rapid as the ragged lightning and horrid as those convulsions of nature that bury nations  the elements however seem to take the matter very quietly they did not even usher in this morning with triple suns and a shower of blood symbolical of the three potent heroes105 and the mighty claretshed of the day for meas thomson in his winter says of the stormi shall hear astonished and astonished sing    the whistle and the man i sing     the man that won the whistle etc  to leave the heights of parnassus and come to the humble vale of prose i have some misgivings that i take too much upon me when i request you to get your guest sir robert lawrie to frank the two inclosed covers for me the one of them to sir william cunningham of robertland bart at kilmarnockthe other to mr allan masterton writingmaster edinburgh the first has a kindred claim on sir robert as being a brother baronet and likewise a keen foxite the other is one of the worthiest men in the world and a man of real genius so allow me to say he has a fraternal claim on you i want them

i have guessed where to find you for i am sure you have more good sense than to waste the precious days of vacation time in the dirt of business and edinburgh wherever you are god bless you and lead you not into temptation but deliver you from evil  i do not know if i have informed you that i am now appointed to an excise division in the middle of which my house and farm lie in this i was extremely lucky without ever having been an expectant as they call their journeymen excisemen i was directly planted down to all intents and purposes an officer of excise there to flourish and bring forth fruitsworthy of repentance  you need not doubt that i find several very unpleasant and disagreeable circumstances in my business but i am tired with and disgusted at the language of complaint against the evils of life human existence in the most favourable situations does not abound with pleasures and has its inconveniences and ills capricious foolish man mistakes these inconveniences and ills as if they were the peculiar property of his particular situation and hence that eternal fickleness that love of change which has ruined and daily does ruin many a fine fellow as well as many a blockhead and is almost without exception a constant source of disappointment and misery  i long to hear from you how you go onnot so much in business as in life are you pretty well satisfied with your own exertions and tolerably at ease in your internal reflections tis much to be a great character as a lawyer but beyond comparison more to be a great character as a man that you may be both the one and the other is the earnest wish and that you will be both is the firm persuasion of my dear sir etc  r b                                       cxxxixto mr richard brown portglasgow  ellisland 4th november 1789  i have been so hurried my ever dear friend that though i got both your letters i have not been able to command an hour to answer them as i wished and even now you are to look on this as merely confessing debt and craving days few things could have given me so much pleasure as the news that you were once more safe and sound on terra firma and happy in that place where happiness is alone to be found in the fireside circle may the benevolent director of all things peculiarly bless you in all those endearing connections consequent on the tender and venerable names of husband and father i have indeed been extremely lucky in getting an additional income of £50 ayear while at the same time the appointment will not cost me above £10 or £12 per annum of expenses more than i must have inevitably incurred the worst circumstance is that the excise division which i have got is so extensive no less than ten parishes to ride over and it abounds besides with so much business that i can scarcely steal a spare moment however labour endears rest and both together are absolutely necessary for the proper enjoyment of human existence i cannot meet you anywhere  no less than an order from the board of excise at edinburgh is necessary before i can have so much time as to meet you in ayrshire but do you come and see me we must have a social day and perhaps lengthen it out with half the night before you go again to sea you are the earliest friend i now have on earth my brothers excepted and is not that an endearing circumstance when you and i first met we were at the green period of human life the twig would easily take a bent but would as easily return to its former state you and i not only took a mutual bent but by the melancholy though strong influence of being both of the family of the unfortunate we were entwined with one another in our growth towards advanced age and blasted be the sacrilegious hand that shall attempt to undo the union you and i must have one bumper to my favourite toast may the companions of our youth be the friends of our old age come and see me one year i shall see you at portglasgow the next and if we can contrive to have a gossiping between our two bedfellows it will be so much additional pleasure mrs burns joins me in kind compliments to you and mrs brown adieui am ever my dear sir yours  r b                                       cxlto mr r graham of fintry  9th december 1789  siri have a good while had a wish to trouble you with a letter and had certainly done it long ere now but for a humiliating something that throws cold water on the resolution as if one should say you have found mr graham a very powerful and kind friend indeed and that interest he is so kindly taking in your concerns you ought by everything in your power to keep alive and cherish now though since god has thought proper to make one powerful and another helpless the connection of obliger and obliged is all fair and though my being under your patronage is to me highly honourable yet sir allow me to flatter myself thatas a poet and an honest man you first interested yourself in my welfare and principally as such still you permit me to approach you  i have found the excise business go on a great deal smoother with me than i expected owing a good deal to the generous friendship of mr mitchell my collector and the kind assistance of mr findlater my supervisor i dare to be honest and i fear no labour nor do i find my hurried life greatly inimical to my correspondence with the muses their visits to me indeed and i believe to most of their acquaintance like the visits of good angels are short and far between but i meet them now and then as i jog through the hills of nithsdale just as i used to do on the banks of ayr i take the liberty to inclose you a few bagatelles all of them the productions of my leisure thoughts in my excise rides  if you know or have ever seen captain grose the antiquarian you will enter into any humour that is in the verses on him perhaps you have seen them before as i sent them to a london newspaper though i dare say you have none of the solemnleagueandcovenant fire which shone so conspicuous in lord george gordon and the kilmarnock weavers yet i think you must have heard of dr mgill one of the clergymen of ayr and his heretical book god help him poor man though he is one of the worthiest as well as one of the ablest of the whole priesthood of the kirk of scotland in every sense of that ambiguous term yet the poor doctor and his numerous family are in imminent danger of being thrown out to the mercy of the winterwinds the inclosed ballad on that business is i confess too local but i laughed myself at some conceits in it though i am convinced in my conscience that there are a good many heavy stanzas in it too106  the election ballad107 as you will see alludes to the present canvass in our string of boroughs i do not believe there will be such a hard run match in the whole general election  i am too little a man to have any political attachments i am deeply indebted to and have the warmest veneration for individuals of both parties but a man108 who has it in his power to be the father of a country and who is only known to that country by the mischiefs he does in it is a character that one cannot speak of with patience  sir j j does what man can do but

13th december 1789  many thanks dear madam for your sheetful of rhymes though at present i am below the veriest prose yet from you everything pleases i am groaning under the miseries of a diseased nervous system a system the state of which is most conducive to our happinessor the most productive of our misery for now near three weeks i have been so ill with a nervous headache that i have been obliged for a time to give up my excisebooks being scare able to lift my head much less to ride once a week over ten muir parishes what is man today in the luxuriance of health exulting in the enjoyment of existence in a few days perhaps in a few hours loaded with conscious painful being counting the tardy pace of the lingering moments by the repercussions of anguish and refusing or denied a comforter day follows night and night comes after day only to curse him with life which gives him no pleasure and yet the awful dark termination of that life is something at which he recoils    tell us ye dead will none of you in pity   disclose the secret   whattis you are and we must shortly be     tis no matter   a little time will make us learnd as you are  can it be possible that when i resign this frail feverish being i shall still find myself in conscious existence when the last gasp of agony has announced that i am no more to those that knew me and the few who loved me when the cold stiffened unconscious ghastly corse is resigned into the earth to be the prey of unsightly reptiles and to become in time a trodden clod shall i be yet warm in life seeing and seen enjoying and enjoyed ye venerable sages and holy flamens is there probability in your conjectures truth in your stories of another world beyond death or are they all alike baseless visions and fabricated fables if there is another life it must be only for the just the benevolent the amiable and the humane what a flattering idea then is a world to come would to god i as firmly believed it as i ardently wish it there i should meet an aged parent now at rest from the many buffetings of an evil world against which he so long and so bravely struggled there should i meet the friend the disinterested friend of my early life the man who rejoiced to see me because he loved me and could serve me muir thy weaknesses were the aberrations of human nature but thy heart glowed with everything generous manly and noble and if ever emanation from the allgood being animated a human form it was thine there should i with speechless agony of rapture again recognise my lost my ever dear mary whose bosom was fraught with truth honour constancy and love    my mary dear departed shade     where is thy place of heavenly rest   seest thou thy lover lowly laid     hearst thou the groans that rend his breast  jesus christ thou amiablest of characters i trust thou art no impostor and that thy revelation of blissful scenes of existence beyond death and the grave is not one of the many impositions which time after time have been palmed on credulous mankind i trust that in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed by being yet connected together in a better world where every tie that bound heart to heart in this state of existence shall be far beyond our present conceptions more endearing  i am a good deal inclined to think with those who maintain that what are called nervous affections are in fact diseases of the mind i cannot reason i cannot think and but to you i would not venture to write anything above an order to a cobbler you have felt too much of the ills of life not to sympathise with a diseased wretch who has impaired more than half of any faculties he possessed your goodness will excuse this distracted scrawl which the writer dare scarcely read and which he would throw into the fire were he able to write anything better or indeed anything at all  rumour told me something of a son of yours who was returned from the east or west indies if you have gotten news from james or anthony it was cruel in you not to let me know as i promise you on the sincerity of a man who is weary of one world and anxious about another that scarce anything could give me so much pleasure as to hear of any good thing befalling my honoured friend  if you have a minutes leisure take up your pen in pity to le pauvre miserable  r b                                       cxliito lady winifred m

tinwald and it was impossible not from your ladyships accessibility but from my own feelings that i could go alone lately indeed mr maxwell of currachan in his usual goodness offered to accompany me when an unlucky indisposition on my part hindered my embracing the opportunity to court the notice or the tables of the great except where i sometimes have had a little matter to ask of them or more often the pleasanter task of witnessing my gratitude to them is what i never have done and i trust never shall do but with your ladyship i have the honour to be connected by one of the strongest and most endearing ties in the whole moral world common sufferings in a cause where even to be unfortunate is gloriousthe cause of heroic loyalty though my fathers had not illustrious honours and vast properties to hazard in the contest though they left their humble cottages only to add so many units more to the unnoted crowd that followed their leaders yet what they could they did and what they had they lost with unshaken firmness and unconcealed political attachments they shook hands with ruin for what they esteemed the cause of their king and their country this language and the inclosed verses are for your ladyships eye alone poets are not very famous for their prudence but as i can do nothing for a cause which is now nearly no more i do not wish to hurt myselfi have the honour to be

the same family with you and on that score i now address you you will perhaps suspect that i am going to claim affinity with the ancient and honourable house of kirkpatrick no no sir i cannot indeed be properly said to belong to any house or even any province or kingdom as my mother who for many years was spouse to a marching regiment gave me into this bad world aboard the packetboat somewhere between donaghadee and portpatrick by our common family i mean sir the family of the muses i am a fiddler and a poet and you i am told play an exquisite violin and have a standard taste in the belles lettres the other day a brother catgut gave me a charming scots air of your composition if i was pleased with the tune i was in raptures with the title you have given it and taking up the idea i have spun it into the three stanzas inclosed will you allow me sir to present you them as the dearest offering that a misbegotten son of poverty and rhyme has to give i have a longing to take you by the hand and unburden my heart by saying sir i honour you as a man who supports the dignity of human nature amid an age when frivolity and avarice have between them debased us below the brutes that perish but alas sir to me you are unapproachable it is true the muses baptised me in castalian streams but the thoughtless gipsies forgot to give me a name as the sex have served many a good fellow the nine have given me a great deal of pleasure but bewitching jades they have beggared me would they but spare me a little of their castlinen were it only to put it in my power to say that i have a shirt on my back but the idle wenches like solomons lilies they toil not neither do they spin so i must een continue to tie my remnant of a cravat like the hangmans rope round my naked throat and coax my galligaskins to keep together their manycoloured fragments as to the affair of shoes i have given that up my pilgrimages in my balladtrade from town to town and on your stonyhearted turnpikes too are not what even the hide of jobs behemoth could bear the coat on my back is no more i shall not speak evil of the dead it would be equally unhandsome and ungrateful to find fault with my old surtout which so kindly supplies and conceals the want of that coat my hat indeed is a great favourite and though i got it literally for an old song i would not exchange it for the best beaver in britain i was during several years a kind of factotum servant to a country clergyman where i picked up a good many scraps of learning particularlyin some branches of the mathematics whenever i feel inclined to rest myself on my way i take my seat under a hedge laying my poetic wallet on the one side and my fiddlecase on the other and placing my hat between my legs i can by means of its brim or rather brims go through the whole doctrine of the conic sections however sir dont let me mislead you as if i would interest your pity fortune has so much forsaken me that she has taught me to live without her and amid all my rags and poverty i am as independent and much more happy than a monarch of the world according to the hackneyed metaphor i value the several actors in the great drama of life simply as they act their parts i can look on a worthless fellow of a duke with unqualified contempt and can regard an honest scavenger with sincere respect as you sir go through your role with such distinguished merit permit me to make one in the chorus of universal applause and assure you that with the highest respect i have the honour to be etc     footnote 109 here burns plays high jacobite

fight it out and be off with it  we have gotten a set of very decent players here just now i have seen them an evening or two david campbell in ayr wrote to me by the manager of the company a mr sutherland who is a man of apparent worth on newyearday evening i gave him the following prologue which he spouted to his audience with applause    no song nor dance i bring from yon great city etc  i

between us and bar the enjoyment of a mutual correspondence we are not shapen out of the common heavy methodical clod the elemental stuff of the plodding selfish race the sons of arithmetic and prudence our feelings and hearts are not benumbed and poisoned by the cursed influence of riches which whatever blessing they may be in other respects are no friends to the nobler qualities of the heart in the name of random sensibility then let never the moon change on our silence any more i have had a tract of bad health the most part of this winter else you had heard from me long ere now thank heaven i am now got so much better as to be able to partake a little in the enjoyments of life  our friend cunningham will perhaps have told you of my going into the excise the truth is i found it a very convenient business to have £50 per annum nor have i yet felt any of these mortifying circumstances in it that i was led to fear  feb 2ndi have not for sheer hurry of business been able to spare five minutes to finish my letter besides my farm business i ride on my excise matters at least two hundred miles every week i have not by any means given up the muses you will see in the third volume of johnsons scots songs that i have contributed my mite there  but my dear sir little ones that look up to you for paternal protection are an important charge i have already two fine healthy stout little fellows and i wish to throw some light upon them i have a thousand reveries and schemes about them and their future destiny not that i am an utopian projector in these things i am resolved never to breed up a son of mine to any of the learned professions i know the value of independence and since i cannot give my sons an independent fortune i shall give them an independent line of life what a chaos of hurry chance and changes is this world when one sits soberly down to reflect on it to a father who himself knows the world the thought that he shall have sons to usher into it must fill him with dread but if he have daughters the prospect in a thoughtful moment is apt to shock him  i hope mrs fordyce and the two young ladies are well do let me forget that they are nieces of yours and let me say that i never saw a more interesting sweeter pair of sisters in my life i am the fool of my feelings and attachments i often take up a volume of my spenser to realise you to my imagination 109a and think over the social scenes we have had together god grant that there may be another world more congenial for honest fellows beyond this a world where these rubs and plagues of absence distance misfortunes illhealth etc shall no more damp hilarity and divide friendship this i know is your throng season but half a page will much oblige my dear sir yours sincerely  r b

business that i have not written to you madam long ere now my health is greatly better and i now begin once more to share in satisfaction and enjoyment with the rest of my fellowcreatures  many thanks my much esteemed friend for your kind letters but why will you make me run the risk of being contemptible and mercenary in my own eyes when i pique myself on my independent spirit i hope it is neither poetic licence nor poetic rant and i am so flattered with the honour you have done me in making me your compeer in friendship and friendly correspondence that i cannot without pain and a degree of mortification be reminded of the real inequality between our situations  most sincerely do i rejoice with you dear madam in the good news of anthony not only your anxiety about his fate but my own esteem for such a noble warmhearted manly young fellow in the little i had of his acquaintance has interested me deeply in his fortunes  falconer the unfortunate author of the shipwreck which you so much admire is no more after witnessing the dreadful catastrophe he so feelingly describes in his poem and after weathering many hard gales of fortune he went to the bottom with the aurora frigate  i forget what part of scotland had the honour of giving him birth but he was the son of obscurity and misortune110 he was one of those daring adventurous spirits which scotland beyond any other country is remarkable for producing little does the fond mother think as she hangs delighted over the sweet little leech at her bosom where the poor fellow may hereafter wander or what may be his fate i remember a stanza in an old scottish ballad which notwithstanding its rude simplicity speaks feelingly to the heart    little did my mother think     that day she cradled me   what land i was to travel in     or what death i should dee  old scottish songs are you know a favourite study and pursuit of mine and now i am on that subject allow me to give you two stanzas of another old simple ballad which i am sure will please you the catastrophe of the piece is a poor ruined female lamenting her fate she concludes with this pathetic wish    o that my father had neer on me smild     o that my mother had neer to me sung   o that my cradle had never been rockd     but that i had died when i was young    o that the grave it were my bed     my blankets were my winding sheet   the clocks and the worms my bedfellows a     and o sad sound as i should sleep  i do not remember in all my reading to have met with anything more truly the language of misery than the exclamation in the last line misery is like love to speak its language truly the author must have felt it  i am every day expecting the doctor to give your little godson the smallpox they are rife in the country and i tremble for his fate by the way i cannot help congratulating you on his looks and spirit every person who sees him acknowledges him to be the finest handsomest child he has ever seen i am myself delighted with the manly swell of his little chest and a certain miniature dignity in the carriage of his head and the glance of his fine black eye which promise the undaunted gallantry of an independent mind  i thought to have sent you some rhymes but time forbids i promise you poetry until you are tired of it next time i have the honour of assuring you how truly i am etc  r b     footnote 110 he was of poor

mr w nicol  ellisland feb 9th 1790  my dear sirthat damnd mare of yours is dead i would freely have given her price to have saved her she has vexed me beyond description indebted as i was to your goodness beyond what i can ever repay i eagerly grasped at your offer to have the mare with me that i might at least show my readiness in wishing to be grateful i took every care of her in my power she was never crossed for riding above half a score of times by me or in my keeping i drew her in the plough one of three for one poor week i refused fiftyfive shillings for her which was the highest bode i could squeeze for her i fed her up and had her in fine order for dumfries fair when four or five days before the fair she was seized with an unaccountable disorder in the sinews or somewhere in the bones of the neckwith a weakness or total want of power in her fillets and in short the whole vertebrae of her spine seemed to be diseased and unhinged and in eight and forty hours in spite of the two best farriers in the country she died and be damnd to her the farriers said that she had been quite strained in the fillets beyond cure before you had bought her and that the poor devil though she might keep a little flesh had been jaded and quite worn out with fatigue and oppression while she was with me she was under my own eye and i assure you my much valued friend everything was done for her that could be done and the accident has vexed me to the heart in fact i could not pluck up spirits to write to you on account of the unfortunate business  there is little new in this country our theatrical company of which you must have heard leave us this week their merit and character are indeed very great both on the stage and in private life not a worthless creature among them and their encouragement has been accordingly their usual run is from eighteen to twentyfive pounds a night seldom less than the one and the house will hold no more than the other there have been repeated instances of sending away six and eight and ten pounds a night for want of room a new theatre is to be built by subscription the first stone is to be laid on friday first to come three hundred guineas

met with some of our clergy have slipt in by stealth now and then but they have got up a farce of their own you must have heard how the rev mr lawson of kirkmahoe seconded by the rev mr kirkpatrick of dunscore and the rest of that faction have accused in formal process the unfortunate and rev mr heron of kirkgunzeon that in ordaining mr nielson to the cure of souls in kirkbean he the said heron feloniously and treasonably bound the said nielson to the confession of faith so far as it was agreeable to reason and the word of god  mrs b begs to be remembered most gratefully to you little bobby

but not my will consents  but to make amends since of modish post i have none except one poor widowed halfsheet of gilt which lies in my drawer among my plebeian foolscap pages like the widow of a man of fashion whom that unpolite scoundrel necessity has driven from burgundy and pineapple to a dish of bohea with the scandalbearing helpmate of a villagepriest or a glass of whiskytoddy with a rubynosed yokefellow of a footpadding excisemani make a vow to inclose this sheetfull of epistolary fragments in that my only scrap of gilt paper  i am indeed your unworthy debtor for three friendly letters i ought to have written to you long ere now but it is a literal fact i have scarcely a spare moment it is not that i will not write to you miss burnet is not more dear to her guardian angel nor his grace the duke of queensberry to the powers of darkness than my friend cunningham to me it is not that i cannot write to you should you doubt it take the following fragment which was intended for you some time ago and be convinced that i can antithesize sentiment and circumvolute periods as well as any coiner of phrase in the regions of philology  december 1789  my dear cunninghamwhere are you and what are you doing can you be that son of levity who takes up a friendship as he takes up a fashion or are you like some other of the worthiest fellows in the world the victim of indolence laden with fetters of everincreasing weight  what strange beings we are since we have a portion of conscious existence equally capable of enjoying pleasure happiness and rapture or of suffering pain wretchedness and misery it is surely worthy of an inquiry whether there be not such a thing as a science of life whether method economy and fertility of expedients be not applicable to enjoyment and whether there be not a want of dexterity in pleasure which renders our little scantling of happiness still less and a profuseness an intoxication in bliss which leads to satiety disgust and selfabhorrence there is not a doubt but that health talents character decent competency respectable friends are real substantial blessings and yet do we not daily see those who enjoy many or all of these good things contrive notwithstanding to be as unhappy as others to whose lot few of them have fallen i believe one great source of this mistake or misconduct is owing to a certain stimulus with us called ambition which goads us up the hill of life not as we ascend other eminences for the laudable curiosity of viewing an extended landscape but rather for the dishonest pride of looking down on others of our fellowcreatures seemingly diminutive in humbler stations etc etc  sunday 14th february 1790  god help me i am now obliged to join    night to day and sunday to the week  if there be any truth in the orthodox faith of these churches i am damnd past redemption and what is worse damnd to all eternity i am deeply read in bostons fourfold state marshal on sanctification guthries trial of

prevented from the discussion of the knotty point at which i had just made a full stop all my fears and cares are of this world if there is another an honest man has nothing to fear from it i hate a man that wishes to be a deist but i fear every fair unprejudiced inquirer must in some degree be a sceptic it is not that there are any very staggering arguments against the immortality of man but like electricity phlogiston etc the subject is so involved in darkness that we want data to go upon one thing frightens me much that we are to live for ever seems too good news to be true that we are to enter into a new scene of existence where exempt from want and pain we shall enjoy ourselves and our friends without satiety or separationhow much should i be indebted to any one who could fully assure me that this was certain  my time is once more expired i will write to mr cleghorn soon god bless him and all his concerns and may all the powers that preside over conviviality and friendship

display of the secession act and testimony by mr gib herveys meditations beveridges thoughts and another copy of watsons body of divinity  i wrote to mr a masterton three or four months ago to pay some money he owed me into your hands and lately i wrote to you to the same purpose but i have heard from neither one nor other of you  in addition to the books i commissioned in my last i want very much an index to the excise laws or an abridgment of all the statutes now in force relative to the excise by jellinger symons i want three copies of this book if it is now to be had cheap or dear get it for me an honest country neighbour of mine wants too a family bible the larger the better but secondhanded for he does not choose to give above ten shillings for the book i want likewise for myself as you can pick them up secondhanded or cheap copies of otways dramatic works ben jonsons drydens congreves wycherleys vanbrughs gibbers or any dramatic works of the more modern macklin garrick foote colman or sheridan a good copy too of moliere in french i much want any other good dramatic authors in that language i want also but comic authors chiefly though i should wish to have racine corneille and voltaire too i am in no hurry for all or any of these but if you accidentally meet with them verycheap get them for me  and now to quit the dry walk of business how do you do my dear friend and how is mrs hill i trust if now and then not so elegantly handsome at least as amiable and sings as divinely as ever my good wife too has a charming woodnote wild now could we four get together etc  i am out of all patience with this vile world for one thing mankind are by nature benevolent creatures except in a few scoundrelly instances i do not think that avarice of the good things we chance to have is born with us but we are placed here amid so much nakedness and hunger and poverty and want that we are under a cursed necessity of studying selfishness in order that we may exist still there are in every age a few souls that all the wants and woes of life cannot debase to selfishness or even to the necessary alloy of caution and prudence if ever i am in danger of vanity it is when i contemplate myself on this side of my disposition and character god knows i am no saint i have a whole host of follies and sins to answer for but if i couldand i believe i do it as far as i cani would

reading a paper of the lounger you know my national prejudices i had often read and admired the spectator adventurer rambler and world but still with a certain regret that they were so thoroughly and entirely english alas have i often said to myself what are all the boasted advantages which my country reaps from the union that can counterbalance the annihilation of her independence and even her very name i often repeat that couplet of my favourite poet goldsmith      states of native liberty possest   tho very poor may yet be very blest  nothing can reconcile me to the common terms english ambassador english court etc and i am out of all patience to see that equivocal character hastings impeached by the commons of england tell me my friend is this weak prejudice i believe in my conscience such ideas as my country her independence her honour the illustrious names that mark the history of my native land etci believe these among your men of the world men who in fact guide for the most part and govern our world are looked on as so many modifications of wrongheadedness they know the use of bawling out such terms to rouse or lead the rabble but for their own private use with almost all the able statesmen that ever existed or now exist when they talk of right and wrong they only mean proper and improper and their measure of conduct is not what they ought but what they dare for the truth of this i shall not ransack the history of nations but appeal to one of the ablest judges of men that ever livedthe celebrated earl of chesterfield in fact a man who could thoroughly control his vices whenever they interfered with his interests and who could completely put on the appearance of every virtue as often as it suited his purposes is on the stanhopian plan the perfect man a man to lead nations but are great abilities complete without a flaw and polished without a blemish the standard of human excellence this is certainly the staunch opinion of men of the world but i call on honour virtue and worth to give the stygian doctrine a loud negative however this must be allowed that if you abstract from man the idea of an existence beyond the grave then the true measure of human conduct is proper and improper virtue and vice as dispositions of the heart are in that case of scarcely the same import and value to the world at large as harmony and discord in the modifications of sound and a delicate sense of honour like a nice ear for music though it may sometimes give the possessor an ecstacy unknown to the coarser organs of the herd yet considering the harsh gratings and inharmonic jars in this illtuned state of being it is odds but the individual would be as happy and certainly would be as much respected by the true judges of society as it would then stand without either a good ear or a good heart  you must know i have just met with the mirror and lounger for the first time and i am quite in raptures with them i should be glad to have your opinion of some of the papers the one i have just read lounger no 61 has cost me more honest tears than anything i have read for a long time mackenzie has been called the addison of the scots and in my opinion addison would not be hurt at the comparison if he has not addisons exquisite humour he as certainly outdoes him in the tender and the pathetic his man of feeling but i am not counsel learned in the laws of criticism i estimate as the first performance in its kind i ever saw from what book moral or even pious will the susceptible young mind receive impressions more congenial to humanity and kindness generosity and benevolence in short more of all that ennobles the soul to herself or endears her to othersthan from the simple affecting tale of poor harley  still with all my admiration of mackenzies writings i do not know if they are the fittest reading for a young man who is about to set out as the phrase is to make his way into life do you not think madam that among the few favoured of heaven in the structure of their minds for such there certainly are there may be a purity a tenderness a dignity an elegance of soul which are of no use nay in some degree absolutely disqualifying for the truly important business of making a mans way into life if i am not much mistaken my gallant young friend antony is very much under these disqualifications and for the young females of a family i could mention well may they excite parental solicitude for i a common acquaintance or as my vanity will have it an humble friend have often trembled for a turn of mind which may render them eminently happyor peculiarly miserable  i have been manufacturing some verses lately but as i have got the most hurried season of excise business over i hope to have more leisure to transcribe any thing that may show how much i have the honour to be madam yours etc  r b                                        cliito dr john moore london  dumfries exciseoffice 14th july 1790

franking is at present under a temporary death i shall have some snatches of leisure through the day amid our horrid business and bustle and i shall improve them as well as i can but let my letter be as stupid as as miscellaneous as a newspaper as short as a hungry gracebeforemeat or as long as a lawpaper in the douglas cause as ill spelt as country johns billetdoux or as unsightly a scrawl as betty byremuckers answer to it i hope considering circumstances you will forgive it and as it will put you to no expense of postage i shall have the less reflection about it  i am sadly ungrateful in not returning you my thanks for your most valuable present zeluco in fact you are in some degree blameable for my neglect you were pleased to express a wish for my opinion of the work which so flattered me that nothing less would serve my overweening fancy than a formal criticism on the book in fact i have gravely planned a comparative view of you fielding richardson and smollett in your different qualities and merits as novelwriters this i own betrays my ridiculous vanity and i may probably never bring the business to bear but i am fond of the spirit young elihu shows in the book of joband i said i will also declare my opinion i have quite disfigured my copy of the book with my annotations i never take it up without at the same time taking my pencil and marking with asterisms parentheses etc wherever i meet with an original thought a nervous remark on life and manners a remarkably wellturned period or a character sketched with uncommon precision  though i should hardly think of fairly writing out my comparative view i shall certainly trouble you with my remarks such as they are  i have just received from my gentleman that horrid summons in the book of revelationthat time shall be no more  the little collection of sonnets have some charming poetry in them if indeed i am indebted to the fair author for the book and not as i rather suspect to a celebrated author of the other sex i should certainly have written to the lady with my grateful acknowledgments and my own idea of the comparative excellence of her pieces112 i would do this last not from any vanity of thinking that my remarks could be of much consequence to mrs smith but merely from my own feelings as an author doing as i would be done by  r b     footnote 112 sonnets of charlotte smith

an acquaintance of yours and by his means and mediation i hope to replace that link which my unfortunate negligence had so unluckily broke in the chain of our correspondence i was the more vexed at the vile accident as my brother william a journeyman saddler has been for some time in london and wished above all things for your direction that he might have paid his respects to his fathers friend  his last address he sent me was wm burns at mr barbers saddler no 181 strand i writ him by mr kennedy but neglected to ask him for your address so if you find a spare half minute please let my brother know by a card where and when he will find you and the poor fellow will joyfully wait on you as one of the few surviving friends of the man whose name and christian name too he has the honour to bear

the busy life i lead  i laid down my goose feather to beat my brains for an apt simile and had some thoughts of a country grannum at a family christening a bride on the marketday before her marriage or a tavernkeeper at an election dinner but the resemblance that hits my fancy best is that blackguard miscreant satan who roams about like a roaring lion seeking searching whom he may devour however tossed about as i am if i choose and who would not choose to bind down with the crampets of attention the brazen foundation of integrity i may rear up the superstructure of independence and from its daring turrets bid defiance to the storms of fate and is not this a consummation devoutly to be wished    thy spirit independence let me share     lord of the lionheart and eagleeye   thy steps i

glitter and stately hauteur is but a creature formed as thou artand perhaps not so well formed as thou artcame into the world a puling infant as thou didst and must go out of it as all men must a

friend of mine whom i have long known and long loved his father whose only son he is has a decent little property in ayrshire and has bred the young man to the law in which department he comes up an adventurer to your good town i shall give you my friends character in two words as to his head he has talents enough and more than enough for common life as to his heart when nature had kneaded the kindly clay that composes it she said i can no more  you my good sir were born under kinder stars but your fraternal sympathy i well know can enter into the feelings of the young man who goes into life with the laudable ambition to do something and to be something among his fellowcreatures but whom the consciousness of friendless obscurity presses to the earth and wounds to the soul  even the fairest of his virtues are against him that independent spirit and that ingenuous modesty qualities inseparable from a noble mind are with the million circumstances not a little disqualifying what pleasure is in the power of the fortunate and the happy by their notice and patronage to brighten the countenance and glad the heart of such depressed youth i am not so angry with mankind for their deaf economy of the pursethe goods of this world cannot be divided without being lessenedbut why be a niggard of that which bestows bliss on a fellowcreature yet takes nothing from our own means of enjoyment we wrap ourselves up in the cloak of our own better fortune and turn away our eyes lest the wants and woes of our brothermortals should disturb the selfish apathy of our souls  i am the worst hand in the world at asking a favour that indirect address that insinuating implication which without any positive request plainly expresses your wish is a talent not to be acquired at a ploughtail tell me then for you can in what periphrasis of language in what circumvolution of phrase i shall envelope yet not conceal the plain story my dear mr tait my friend mr duncan whom i have the pleasure of introducing to you is a young lad of your own profession and a gentleman of much modesty and great worth perhaps it may be in your power to assist him in the to him important consideration of getting a place but at all events your notice and acquaintance will be a very great acquisition to him and i dare pledge myself that he will never disgrace your favour  you may possibly be surprised sir at such a letter from me tis i own in the usual way of calculating these matters more than our acquaintance entitles me to but my answer is short of all the men at your time of life whom i knew in edinburgh you are the most accessible on the side on which i have assailed you you are very much altered indeed from what you were when i knew you if generosity point the path you will not tread or humanity call to you in vain  as to myself a being to whose interest i believe you are still a wellwisher i am here breathing at all times thinking sometimes and rhyming now and then every situation has its share of the cares and pains of life and my situation i am persuaded has a full ordinary allowance of its pleasures and enjoyments  my best compliments to your father and

it only the family of worth that have reason to complain of thee the children of folly and vice though in common with thee the offspring of evil smart equally under thy rod owing to thee the man of unfortunate disposition and neglected education is condemned as a fool for his dissipation despised and shunned as a needy wretch when his follies as usual bring him to want and when his unprincipled necessities drive him to dishonest practices he is abhorred as a miscreant and perishes by the justice of his country but far otherwise is the lot of the man of family and fortune his early follies and extravagance are spirit and fire his consequent wants are the embarrassments of an honest fellow and when to remedy the matter he has gained a legal commission to plunder distant provinces or

answer the principal end i have in view it will give me another opportunity of thanking you for all your goodness to the rustic bard and also of showing you that the abilities you have been pleased to commend and patronise are still employed in the way you wish  the elegy on captain henderson is a tribute to the memory of the man i loved much poets have in this the same advantage as roman catholics they can be of service to their friends after they have passed that bourne where all other kindness ceases to be of avail whether after all either the one or the other be of any real service to the dead is i fear very problematical but i am sure they are highly gratifying to the living and as a very orthodox text i forget where in scripture says whatsoever is not of faith is sin so say i whatsoever is not detrimental to society and is of positive enjoyment is of god the giver of all good things and ought to be received and enjoyed by his creatures with thankful delight as almost all my religious tenets originate from my heart i am wonderfully pleased with the idea that i can still keep up a tender intercourse with the dearly beloved friend or still more dearly beloved mistress

deference i am disposed to think unequal to the merits of the book i have sometimes thought to transcribe these marked passages or at least so much of them as to point where they are and send them to you original strokes that strongly depict the human heart is your and fieldings province beyond any other novelist i have ever perused richardson indeed might perhaps be excepted but unhappily his

am not yet employed as such but in a few years i shall fall into the file of supervisorship by seniority i have had an immense loss in the death of the earl of glencairnthe patron from whom all my fame and fortune took its rise independent of my grateful attachment to him which was indeed so strong that it pervaded my very soul and was entwined with the thread of my existence so soon as the princes friends had got in and every dog you know has his day my getting forward in the excise would have been an easier business than otherwise it will be though this was a consummation devoutly to be wished yet thank heaven i can live and rhyme as i am and as to my boys poor little fellows if i cannot place them on as high an elevation in life as i could wish i shall if i am favoured so much of

is too good an apology for my seemingly ungrateful silence i am now getting better and am able to rhyme a little which implies some tolerable ease as i cannot think that the most poetic genius is able to compose on the rack  i do not remember if ever i mentioned to you my having an idea of composing an elegy on the late miss burnet of monboddo i had the honour of being pretty well acquainted with her and have seldom felt so much at the loss of an acquaintance as when i heard that so amiable and accomplished a piece of gods work was no more i have as yet gone no farther than the following fragment of which please let me have your opinion you know that elegy is a subject so much exhausted that any new idea on the business is not to be expected tis well if we can place an old idea in a new light how far i have succeeded as to this last you will judge from what follows i have proceeded no further  your kind letter with your kind remembrance of your godson came safe this last madam is

me down as one of the most ungrateful of men you did me the honour to present me with a book which does honour to science and the intellectual powers of man and i have not even so much as acknowledged the receipt of it the fact is you yourself are to blame for it flattered as i was by your telling me that you wished to have my opinion of the work the old spiritual enemy of mankind who knows well that vanity is one of the sins that most easily beset me put it into my head to ponder over the performance with the lookout of a critic and to draw up forsooth a deep learned digest of strictures on a composition of which in fact until i read the book i did not even know the first principles i own sir that at first glance several of your propositions startled me as paradoxical that the martial clangour of a trumpet had something in it vastly more grand heroic and sublime than the twingle twangle of a jewsharp that the delicate flexure of a rosetwig when the halfblown flower is heavy with the tears of the dawn was infinitely more beautiful and elegant than the upright stub of a burdock and that from something innate and independent of all associations of ideasthese i had set down as irrefragable orthodox truths until perusing your book shook my faith in short sir except euclids elements of geometry which i made a shift to unravel by my fathers fireside in the winter evening of the first season i held the plough i never read a book which gave me such a quantum of information and added so much to my stock of ideas as your essays on the principles of taste one thing sir you must forgive my mentioning as an uncommon merit in the work i mean the language to clothe abstract philosophy in elegance of style sounds something like a contradiction in terms but you have convinced me that they are quite compatible  i inclose you some poetic bagatelles of my late composition the one in print is my first essay in the way of telling a talei am sir etc  r b

came to my hand this moment i should have directly put you out of suspense on the subject i only ask that some prefatory advertisement in the book as well as the subscription bills may bear that the publication is solely for the benefit of bruces mother i would not put it in the power of ignorance to surmise or malice to insinuate that i clubbed a share in the work from mercenary motives nor need you give me credit for any remarkable generosity in my part of the business i have such a host of peccadilloes failings follies and backslidings anybody but myself might perhaps give some of them a worse appellation that by way of some balance however trifling in the account i am fain to do any good that occurs in my very limited power to a fellowcreature just for the selfish purpose of clearing

cunningham writer edinburgh  ellisland 2th march 1791  if the foregoing piece be worth your strictures let me have them for my own part a thing i have just composed always appears through a double portion of that partial medium in which an author will ever view his own works i believe in general novelty has something in it that inebriates the fancy and not unfrequently dissipates and fumes away like other intoxication and leaves the poor patient as usual with an aching heart a striking instance of this might be adduced in the revolution of many a hymeneal honeymoon but lest i sink into stupid prose and so sacrilegiously intrude on the office of my parish priest i shall fill up the page in my own way and give you another song of my late composition which will appear perhaps in johnsons work as well as the former  you must know a beautiful jacobite air therell never be peace till jamie comes hame when political combustion ceases to be the object of princes and patriots it then you know becomes the lawful prey of historians and poets    by yon castle wa at the close of the day   i heard a man sing tho his head it was grey   and as he was singing the tears fast down came   therell never be peace till jamie comes hame  if you like the air and if the stanzas hit your fancy you cannot imagine my dear friend how much you would oblige me if by the charms of your delightful voice you would give my honest effusion to the memory of joys that are past to the few friends whom you indulge in that pleasure but i have scribbled on till i hear the clock has intimated the near

many instances of your friendship and particularly for your kind anxiety in this last disaster that my evil genius had in store for me however life is chequeredjoy and sorrowfor on saturday morning last mrs burns made me a present of a fine boy rather stouter but not so handsome as your godson was at his time of life indeed i look on your little namesake to be my chef doeuvre in that species of manufacture as i look on tam o shanter to be my standard performance in the poetical line tis true both the one and the other discover a spice of roguish waggery that might perhaps be as well spared but then they also show in my opinion a force of genius and a finishing polish that i despair of ever excelling mrs burns is getting stout again and laid as lustily about her today at breakfast as a reaper from the cornridge that is the peculiar privilege and blessing of our hale sprightly damsels that are bred among the hay and heather we cannot hope for that highly polished mind that charming delicacy of soul which is found among the female world in the more elevated stations of life and which is certainly by far the most bewitching charm in the famous cestus of venus it is indeed such an inestimable treasure that where it can be had in its native heavenly purity unstained by some one or other of the many shades of affectation and unalloyed by some one or other of the many species of caprice i declare to heaven i should think it cheaply purchased at the expense of every other earthly good but as this angelic creature is i am afraid extremely rare in any station and rank of life and totally denied to such an humble one as mine we meaner mortals must put up with the next rank of female excellence as fine a figure and face we can produce as any rank of life whatever rustic native grace unaffected modesty and unsullied purity natures motherwit and the rudiments of taste a simplicity of soul unsuspicious of because unacquainted with the crooked ways of a selfish interested disingenuous world and the dearest charm of all the rest a yielding sweetness of disposition and a generous warmth of heart grateful for love on our part and ardently glowing with a more than equal return these with a healthy frame a sound vigorous constitution which your higher ranks can scarcely ever hope to enjoy are the charms of lovely woman in my humble walk of life  this is the

and is at present suffering severely under the persecution of one or two powerful individuals of his employers he is accused of harshness to boys that were placed under his care god help the teacher if a man of sensibility and genius and such is my friend clarke when a booby father presents him with his booby son and insists on lighting up the rays of science in a fellows head whose skull is impervious and inaccessible by any other way than a positive fracture with a cudgel a fellow whom in fact it savours of impiety to attempt making a scholar of as he has been marked a blockhead in the book of fate at the almighty fiat of his creator  the patrons of moffat school are the ministers magistrates and town council of edinburgh and as the business comes now before them let me beg my dearest friend to do every thing in his power to serve the interests of a man of genius and worth and a man whom i particularly respect and esteem you know some good fellows among the magistracy and council but particularly you have much to say with a reverend gentleman to whom you have the honour of being very nearly related and whom this country and age have had the honour to produce i need not name the historian of charles v121 i tell him through the medium of his nephews influence that mr clarke is a gentleman who will not disgrace even his patronage i know the merits of the cause thoroughly and say it that my friend is falling a sacrifice to prejudiced ignorance  god help the children of dependence hated and persecuted by their enemies and too often alas almost unexceptionally always received by their friends with disrespect and reproach under the thin disguise of cold civility and humiliating advice o to be a sturdy savage stalking in the pride of his independence amid the solitary wilds of his deserts rather than in civilised life helplessly to tremble for a subsistence precarious as the caprice of a fellowcreature every man has his virtues and no man is without his failings and plague on that privileged plaindealing of friendship which in the hour of my calamity cannot reach forth the helping hand without at the same time pointing out those failings and apportioning them their share in procuring my present distress my friends for such the world calls ye and such ye think yourselves to be pass by my virtues if you please but do also spare my follies the first will witness in my breast for themselves and the last will give pain enough to the ingenuous mind without you and since deviating more or less from the paths of propriety and rectitude must be incident to human nature do thou fortune put it in my power always from myself and of myself to bear the consequence of those errors i do not want to be independent that i may sin but i want to be independent in my sinning  to return in this rambling letter to the subject i set out with let me recommend my friend mr clarice to your acquaintance and good offices his worth entitles him to the one

was not worth presenting besides so strongly am i interested in miss daviess fate and welfare in the serious business of life amid its chances and changes that to make her the subject of a silly ballad is downright mockery of these ardent feelings tis like an impertinent jest to a dying friend  gracious heaven why this disparity between our wishes and our powers why is the most generous wish to make others blest impotent and ineffectual as the idle breeze that crosses the pathless desert in my walks of life i have met with a few people to whom how gladly would i have saidgo be happy i know that your hearts have been wounded by the scorn of the proud whom accident has placed above you or worse still in whose hands are perhaps placed many of the comforts of your life but there ascend that rock independence and look justly down on their littleness of soul make the worthless tremble under your indignation and the foolish sink before your contempt and largely impart that happiness to others which i am certain will give yourselves so much pleasure to bestow  why dear madam must i wake from this delightful reverie and find it all a dream why amid my generous enthusiasm must i find myself poor and powerless incapable of wiping one tear from the eye of pity or of adding one comfort to the friend i love out upon the world say i that its affairs are administered so ill they talk of reformgood heaven what a reform would i make among the sons and even the daughters of men down immediately should go fools from the high places where misbegotten chance has perked them up and through life should they skulk ever haunted by their native insignificance as the body marches accompanied by its shadow as for a much more formidable class the knaves i am at a loss what to do with them had i a world there should not be a knave in it  but the hand that could give i would liberally fill and i would pour delight on the heart that could kindly forgive and generously love  still the inequalities of life are among men comparatively tolerable but there is a delicacy a tenderness accompanying every view in which we can place lovely woman that are grated and shocked at the rude capricious distinctions of fortune woman is the bloodroyal of life let there be slight degrees of precedency among thembut let them be all sacred whether this last sentiment be right or wrong i am not

other day when i with great formality produced my whigmeleerie cup and told them that it had been a familypiece among the descendants of william wallace this roused such an enthusiasm that they

lady in the first ranks of fashion too what a task to youwho care no more for the herd of animals called young ladies than you do for the herd of animals called young gentlemen to youwho despise and detest the groupings and combinations of fashion as an idiot painter that seems industrious to place staring fools and unprincipled knaves in the foreground of his picture while men of sense and honesty are too often thrown in the dimmest shades mrs riddell who will take this letter to town with her and send it to you is a character that even in your own way as a naturalist and a philosopher would be an acquisition to your acquaintance the lady too is a votary of the muses and as i think myself somewhat of a judge in my own trade i assure you that her verses always correct and often elegant are much beyond the common run of the lady poetesses of the day she is a great admirer of your book and hearing me say that i was acquainted with you she begged to be known to you as she is just going to pay her first visit to our caledonian capital i told her that her best way was to desire her near relation and your intimate friend craigdarroch to have you at his house while she was there and lest you might think of a lively west indian girl of eighteen as girls of eighteen too often deserve to be thought of i should take care to remove that prejudice to be impartial however in appreciating the ladys merits she has one unlucky failinga failing which you will easily discover as she seems rather pleased with indulging in it and a failing that you will easily pardon as it is a sin which very much besets yourselfwhere she dislikes or despises she is apt to make no more a secret of it than where she esteems and respects  i will not present you with the unmeaning compliments

thy supereminent goodness that from the luminous path of thy own rightlined rectitude thou lookest benignly down on an erring wretch of whom the zigzag wanderings defy all the powers of calculation from the simple copulation of units up to the hidden mysteries of fluxions may one feeble ray of that light of wisdom which darts from thy sensorium straight as the arrow of heaven and bright as the

be the quotation of the wise and my countenance be the delight of the godly like the illustrious lord of laggans many hills124 as for him his works are perfect never did the pen of calumny blur the fair page of his reputation nor the bolt of hatred fly at his dwelling  thou mirror of purity when shall the elfin lamp of my glimmerous understanding purged from sensual appetites and gross desires shine like the constellation of thy intellectual powers as for thee thy thoughts are pure and thy lips are holy never did the unhallowed breath of the powers of darkness and the pleasures of darkness pollute the sacred flame of thy skydescended and heavenbound desires never did the vapours of impurity stain the unclouded serene of thy cerulean imagination o that like thine were the tenor of my life like thine the tenor of my conversation then should no friend fear for my strength no enemy rejoice in my weakness then should i lie down and rise up and none to make me afraid may thy pity and

heard relating to alloway kirk i distinctly remember only two or three  upon a stormy night amid whistling squalls of wind and bitter blasts of hail in short on such a night as the devil would choose to take the air in a farmer or farmers servant was plodding and plashing homeward with his ploughirons on his shoulder having been getting some repairs on them at a neighbouring smithy his way lay by the kirk of alloway and being rather on the anxious look out in approaching a place so well known to be a favourite haunt of the devil and the devils friends and emissaries he was struck aghast by discovering through the horrors of the storm and stormy night a light which on his nearer approach plainly showed itself to proceed from the haunted edifice whether he had been fortified from above on his devout supplication as is customary with people when they suspect the immediate presence of satan or whether according to another custom he got courageously drunk at the smithy i will not pretend to determine but so it was that he ventured to go up to nay into the very kirk as luck would have it his temerity came off unpunished  the members of the infernal junto were all out on some midnight business or other and he saw nothing but a kind of kettle or caldron depending from the roof over the fire simmering some heads of unchristened children limbs of executed malefactors etc for the business of the night it was in for a penny in for a pound with the honest ploughman so without ceremony he unhooked the caldron from off the fire and pouring out the damnd ingredients inverted it on his head and carried it fairly home where it remained long in the family a living evidence of the truth of the story  another story which i can prove to be equally authentic is as follows  on a market day in the town of ayr a farmer from carrick and consequently whose way lay by the very gate of alloway kirkyard in order to cross the river doon at the old bridge which is about two or three hundred yards farther on than the said gate had been detained by his business till by the time he reached alloway it was the wizard hour between night and morning  though he was terrified with a blaze streaming from the kirk yet as it is a wellknown fact that to turn back on these occasions is running by far the greatest risk of mischief he prudently advanced on his road when he had reached the gate of the kirkyard he was surprised and entertained through the ribs and arches of an old gothic window which still faces the highway to see a dance of witches merrily footing it round their old sooty blackguard master who was keeping them all alive with the power of his bagpipe the farmer stopping his horse to observe them a little could plainly descry the faces of many old women of his acquaintance and neighbourhood how the gentleman was dressed tradition does not say but that the ladies were all in their smocks and one of them happening unluckily to have a smock which was considerably too short to answer all the purpose of that piece of dress our farmer was so tickled that he involuntarily burst out with a loud laugh weel luppen maggy wi the short sark and recollecting himself instantly spurred his horse to the top of his speed i need not mention the universally known fact that no diabolical power can pursue you beyond the middle of a running stream lucky it was for the poor farmer that the river doon was so near for notwithstanding the speed of his horse which was a good one against he reached the middle of the arch of the bridge and consequently the middle of the stream the pursuing vengeful hags were so close at his heels that one of them actually sprung to seize him but it was too late nothing was on her side of the stream but the horses tail which immediately gave way at her infernal grip as if blasted by a stroke of lightning but the farmer was beyond her reach however the unsightly tailless condition of the vigorous steed was to the last hour of the noble creatures life an awful warning to the carrick farmers not to stay too late in ayr markets  the last relation i shall give though equally true is not so well identified as the two former with regard to the scene but as the best authorities give it for alloway i shall relate it  on a summers evening about the time nature puts on her sables to mourn the expiry of the cheerful day a shepherd boy belonging to a farmer in the immediate neighbourhood of alloway kirk had just folded his charge and was returning home as he passed the kirk in the adjoining field he fell in with a crew of men and women who were busy pulling stems of the plant ragwort he observed that as each person pulled a ragwort he or she got astride of it and called out up horsie on which the ragwort flew off like pegasus through the air with its rider the foolish boy likewise pulled his ragwort and cried with the rest up horsie and strange to tell away he flew with the company the first stage at which the cavalcade stopt was a merchants winecellar in bourdeaux where without saying by your leave they quaffed away at the best the cellar could afford until the morning foe to the imps and works of darkness threatened to throw light on the matter and frightened them from their carousals  the poor shepherd lad being equally a stranger to the scene and the liquor heedlessly got himself drunk and when the rest took horse he fell asleep and was found so next day by some of the people belonging to the merchant somebody that understood scotch asking him what he was he said such aones herd in alloway and by some means or other getting home again he lived long to tell the world the wondrous tale125  r b  footnote 125 cp hoggs witch of fife                                        clxxiilto mrs dunlop

punish me sufficiently  do you think it possible my dear and honoured friend that i could be so lost to gratitude for many favours to esteem for much worth and to the honest kind pleasurable tie of now old acquaintance and i hope and am sure of progressive increasing friendshipas for a single day not to think of you nor to ask the fates what they are doing and about to do with my much loved friend and her wide scattered connections and to beg of them to be as kind to you and yours as they possibly can  apropos though how it is apropos i have not leisure to explain do you know that i am almost in love with an acquaintance of yoursalmost said ii am in love souse over head and ears deep as the most unfathomable abyss of the boundless ocean but the word love owing to the intermingledoms of the good and the bad the pure and the impure in this world being rather an equivocal term for expressing ones sentiments and sensations i must do justice to the sacred purity of my attachment know then that the heartstruck awe the distant humble approach the delight we should have in gazing upon and listening to a messenger of heaven appearing in all the unspotted purity of his celestial home among the coarse polluted far inferior sons of men to deliver to them tidings that make their hearts swim in joy and their imaginations soar in transportsuch so delighting and so pure were the emotions of my soul on meeting the other day with miss lesley baillie your neighbour at mayfield mr b with his two daughters accompanied by mr h of g passing through dumfries a few days ago on their way to england did me the honour of calling on me on which i took my horse though god knows i could ill spare the time and accompanied them fourteen or fifteen miles and dined and spent the day with them twas about nine i think when i left them and riding home i composed the following ballad of which you will probably think you have a dear bargain as it will cost you another groat of postage you must know that there is an old ballad beginning with    my bonnie lizzie bailie   ill lowe thee in my plaidie etc  so i parodied it as follows which is literally the first copy unanointed unanneald as hamlet says    o saw ye bonny lesley     as she gaed oer the border   shes gane like alexander     to spread her conquests farther etc  so much for ballads i regret that you are gone to the east country as i am to be in ayrshire in about a fortnight this world of ours notwithstanding it has many good things in it yet it has ever had this curse that two or three people who would be the happier the oftener they met together are almost without exception always so placed as never to meet but once or twice ayear which considering the few years of a mans life is a very great evil under the sun which i do not recollect that solomon has mentioned in his catalogue of the miseries of man i hope and believe that there is a state of existence beyond the grave where the worthy of this life will renew their former intimacies with this endearing addition that we meet to part no more      tell us ye dead   will none of you in pity disclose the secret   what tis you are and we must shortly be  a thousand times have i made this apostrophe to the departed sons of men but not one of them has ever thought fit to answer the question o that some courteous ghost would blab it out but it cannot be you and i my friend must make the experiment by ourselves and for ourselves however i am so convinced that an unskaken faith in the doctrines of religion is not only necessary by making us better men but also by making us happier men that i shall take every care that your little godson and every little creature that shall call me father shall be taught them so ends this heterogeneous letter

insinuate that in my way of life i want exercise of that i have enough but occasional hard drinking is the devil to me against this i have again and again bent my resolution and have greatly succeeded taverns i have totally abandoned it is the private parties in the family way among the harddrinking gentlemen of this country that do me the mischiefbut even this i have more than half given over  mr

anything to do individuals both republican and reform we have though not many of either but if they have associated it is more than i have the least knowledge of and if such an association exist it must consist of such obscure nameless beings as precludes any possibility of my being known to them or they to me  i was in the playhouse one night when cà ira was called for i was in the middle of the pit and from the pit the clamour arose one or two persons with whom i occasionally associate were of the party but i neither knew of nor joined in the plot nor at all opened my lips to hiss or huzza that or any other political tune whatever i looked on myself as far too obscure a man to have any weight in quelling a riot and at the same time as a person of higher respectability than to yell to the howlings of a rabble i never uttered any invectives against the king his private worth it is altogether impossible that such a man as i can appreciate but in his public capacity i always revered and always will with the soundest loyalty revere the monarch of great britain asto speak in masonicthe sacred keystone of our royal arch constitution as to reform principles i look upon the british constitution as settled at the revolution to be the most glorious on earth or that perhaps the wit of man can frame at the same time i think not alone that we have a good deal deviated from the original principles of that constitutionparticularly that an alarming system of corruption has pervaded the connection between the executive and the house of commons this is the whole truth of my reform opinions which before i knew the complexion of these innovating times i too unguardedly as i now see sported with henceforth i seal up my lips but i never dictated to corresponded with or had the least connection with any political association whatever of johnstone the publisher of the edinburgh gazetteer i know nothing one evening in company with four or five friends we met with his prospectus which we thought manly and independent and i wrote to him ordering his paper for us if you think i act improperly in allowing his paper to come addressed to me i shall immediately countermand it i never wrote a line of prose to the gazetteer in my life an address spoken by miss fontenelle on her benefit night and which i called the rights of woman i sent to the gazetteer as also some stanzas on the commemoration of the poet thomson both of these i will subjoin for your perusal you will see they have nothing whatever to do with politics  as to france i was her enthusiastic votary in the beginning of the business when she came to shew her old avidity for conquest by annexing savoy and invading the rights of holland i altered my sentiments  this my honoured

leave me a five minutes fragment to take up a pen in  thank heaven i feel my spirits buoying upwards with the renovating year now i shall in good earnest take up thomsons songs i dare say he thinks i have used him unkindly and i must own with too much appearance of truth  there is one commission that i must trouble you with i lately lost a valuable seal a present from a departed friend which vexes me much i have gotten one of your highland pebbles which i fancy would make a very decent one and i want to cut my armorial bearing on it will you be so obliging as inquire what will be the expense of such a business i do not know that my name is matriculated as the heralds call it at all but i have invented arms for myself so you know i shall be chief of the name and by courtesy of scotland will likewise be entitled to supporters these however i do not intend having on my seal i am a bit of a herald and shall give you secundum artem my arms on a field azure a holly bush seeded proper in base a shepherds pipe and crook saltierwise also proper in chief on a wreath of the colours a woodlark perching on a sprig of baytree proper for crest two mottoes round the top of the crest wood notes wild at the bottom of the shield in the usual place better a wee bush than nae bield by the shepherds pipe and crook i do not mean the nonsense of painters of arcadia but a stock and horn and a club such as you see at the head of allan ramsay in allans quarto edition of the gentle shepherd bythebye do you know allan he must be a man of very great geniuswhy is he not more knownhas he no patrons or do povertys cold wind and crushing rain beat keen and heavy on him i once and but once got a glance of that noble edition of the noblest pastoral in the world and dear as it was i mean dear as to my pocket i would have bought it but i was told that it was printed and engraved for subscribers only he is the only artist who has hit genuine pastoral costume what my dear cunningham is there in riches that they narrow and harden the heart so i think that were i as rich as the sun i should be as generous as the day but as i have no reason to imagine my soul a nobler one than any other mans i must conclude that wealth imparts a birdlime quality to the possessor at which the man in his native poverty would have revolted what has led me to this is the idea of such merit as mr allan possesses and such riches as a nabob or government contractor possesses and why they do not form a mutual league let wealth shelter and cherish unprotected merit and the gratitude and celebrity of that merit will richly repay it  r b                                       clxxxiiito miss benson york afterwards mrs basil montagu  dumfries 21st march 1793  madamamong many things for which i envy those hale longlived old fellows before the flood is this in particular that when they met with anybody after their own heart they had a charming long prospect of many many happy meetings with them in afterlife  now in this short stormy winter day of our fleeting existence when you now and then in the chapter of accidents meet an individual whose acquaintance is a real acquisition there are all the probabilities against you that you shall never meet with that valued character more on the other hand brief as this miserable being is it is none of the least of the miseries belonging to it that if there is any miscreant whom you hate or creature whom you despise the illrun of the chances shall be so against you that in the over takings turnings and jostlings of life pop at some unlucky corner eternally comes the wretch upon you and will not allow your indignation or contempt a moments repose as i am a sturdy believer in the powers of darkness i take these to be the doings of that old author of mischief the devil it is well known that he has some kind of shorthand way of taking down our thoughts and i make no doubt that he is perfectly acquainted with my sentiments respecting miss benson how much i admired her abilities and valued her worth and how very fortunate i thought myself in her acquaintance for this last reason my dear madam i must entertain no hopes of the very great pleasure of meeting with you againi am etc  r b                                clxxxivto mr john francis erskine of mar  dumfries 13th april 1793  sirdegenerate as human nature is said to beand in many instances worthless and unprincipled it isstill there are bright examples to the contrary examples that even in the eyes of superior beings must shed a lustre on the name of man  such an example have i now before me when you sir came forward to patronise and befriend a distant and obscure stranger merely because poverty had made him helpless and his british hardihood of mind had provoked the arbitrary of wantonness and power my much esteemed friend mr riddel of glenriddel has just read me a paragraph of a letter he had from you accept sir of the silent throb of gratitude for words would but mock the emotions of my soul  you have been misinformed as to my final dismissal from the excise i am still in the service indeed but for the exertions of a gentleman who must be known to you mr graham of fintry a gentleman who has ever been my warm and generous friend i had without so much as a hearing or the slightest previous intimation been turned adrift with my helpless family to all the horrors of want had i had any other resource probably i might have saved them the trouble of a dismissal but the little money i gained by my publication is almost every guinea embarked to save from ruin an only brother who though one of the worthiest is by no means one of the most fortunate of men  in my defence to their accusations i said that whatever might be my sentiments of republics ancient or modern as to britain i abjured the idea that a constitution which in its original principles experience had proved to be every way fitted for our happiness in society it would be insanity to sacrifice to an untried visionary theory that in consideration of my being situated in a department however humble immediately in the hands of people in power i had forborne taking any active part either personally or as an author in the present business of reform but that where i must declare my sentiments i would say there existed a system of corruption between the executive power and the representative part of the legislature which boded no good to our glorious constitution and which every patriotic briton must wish to see amended some such sentiments as these i stated in a letter to my generous patron mr graham which he laid before the board at large where it seems my last remark gave great offence and one of our supervisorsgeneral a mr corbet was instructed to inquire on the spot and to document methat my business was to act not to think and that whatever might be men or measures it was for me to be silent and obedient  mr corbet was likewise my steady friend so between mr graham and him i have been partly forgiven only i understand that all hopes of my getting officially forward are blasted  now sir to the business in which i would more immediately interest you the partiality of my countrymen has brought me forward as a man of genius and has given me a character to support in the poet i have avowed manly and independent sentiments which i trust will be found in the man reasons of no less weight than the support of a wife and family have pointed out as the eligible and situated as i was the only eligible line of life for me my present occupation still my honest fame is my dearest concern and a thousand times have i trembled at the idea of those degrading epithets that malice or misrepresentation may affix to my name i have often in blasting anticipation listened to some future hackney scribbler with the heavy malice of savage stupidity exulting in his hireling paragraphsburns notwithstanding the fanfaronade of independence to be found in his works and after having been held forth to public view and to public estimation as a man of some genius yet quite destitute of resources within himself to support his borrowed dignity he dwindled into a paltry exciseman and slunk out the rest of his insignificant existence in the meanest of pursuits and among the vilest of mankind  in your illustrious hands sir permit me to lodge my disavowal and defiance of these slanderous falsehoods burns was a poor man from birth and an exciseman by necessity buti will say it the sterling of his honest worth no poverty could debase and his independent british mind oppression might bend but could not subdue have not i to me a more precious stake in my countrys welfare than the richest dukedom in iti have a large family of children and the prospect of more i have three sons who i see already have brought into the world souls ill qualified to inhabit the bodies of slavescan i look tamely on and see any machinations to wrest from them the birthright of my boysthe little independent britons in whose veins runs my own bloodno i will not should my hearts blood stream around my attempt to defend it  does any man tell me that my full efforts can be of no service and that it does not belong to my humble station to meddle with the concerns of a nation  i can tell him that it is on such individuals as i that a nation has to rest both for the hand of support and the eye of intelligence the uninformed mob may swell a nations bulk and the titled tinsel courtly throng may be its feathered ornament but the number of those who are elevated enough in life to reason and to reflect yet low enough to keep clear of the venal contagion of a courtthese are a nations strength  i know not how to apologise for the impertinent length of this epistle but one small request i must ask of you fartherwhen you have honoured this letter with a perusal please to commit it to the flames burns in whose behalf you have so generously interested yourself i have here in his native colours drawn as he is but should any of the people in whose hands is the very bread he eats get the least knowledge of the picture it would ruin the poor bard for ever  my poems having just come out in another edition i beg leave to present you with a copy as a small mark of that high esteem and ardent gratitude with which i have the honour to be sir your deeply indebted and ever devoted humble servant  r b129     footnote 129 this letter was penned in response to the sympathy    which mr erskine had expressed for burns in a letter to captain    riddell of carse when burns was taken to task by the board of excise    for his political opinions                                       clxxxvto miss mmordo drumlanrig  dumfries juy 1793   now let me

may you my young madam escape that frivolity which threatens universally to pervade the minds and manners of fashionable life the mob of fashionable female youthwhat are they are they anything they prattle laugh sing dance finger a lesson or perhaps turn the pages of a fashionable novel but are their minds stored with any information worthy of the noble powers of reason and judgment and do their hearts glow with sentiment ardent generous or humane were i to poetize on the subject i would call them the butterflies of the human kind remarkable only for the idle variety of their ordinary glare sillily straying from one blossoming weed to another without a meaning or an aim the idiot prey of every pirate of the skies who thinks them worth his while as he wings his way by them and speedily by

fine employment for a poets pen there is a species of human genus that i call the ginhorse class what enviable dogs they are round and round and round they gomundells ox that drives his cotton mill is

forfeited your esteem his strictures must lose their value  if it is true that offences come only from the heart before you i am guiltless to admire esteem and prize you as the most accomplished of women and the first of friendsif these are crimes i am the most offending thing alive  in a face where i used to meet the kind complacency of friendly confidence now to find cold neglect and contemptuous scornis a wrench that my heart can ill bear it is however some kind of miserable good luck that while dehautenbas rigour may depress an unoffending wretch to the ground it has a tendency to rouse a stubborn something in his bosom which though it cannot heal the wounds of his soul is at least an opiate to blunt their poignancy  with the profoundest respect for your abilities the most sincere esteem and ardent regard for your gentle heart and amiable manners and the most fervent wish and prayer for your welfare peace and bliss i have the honour to be madam your most devoted humble servant  r b                                       cxcito mr cunningham  25th february 1794  canst thou minister to a mind diseased canst thou speak peace and rest to a soul tost on a sea of troubles without one friendly star to guide her course and dreading that the next surge may overwhelm her canst thou give to a frame tremblingly alive to the tortures of suspense the stability and hardihood of the rock that braves the blast if thou canst not do the least of these why wouldst thou disturb me in my miseries with thy inquiries after me  for these two months i have not been able to lift a pen my constitution and frame were ab origine blasted with a deep incurable taint of hypochondria which poisons my existence of late a number of domestic vexations and some pecuniary share in the ruin of these cursed times losses which though trifling were yet what i could ill bear have so irritated me that my feelings at times could only be envied by a reprobate spirit listening to the sentence that dooms it to perdition  are you deep in the language of consolation i have exhausted in reflection every topic of comfort a heart at ease would have been charmed with my sentiments and reasonings but as to myself i was like judas iscariot preaching the gospel he might melt and mould the hearts of those around him but his own kept its native incorrigibility  still there are two great pillars that bear us up amid the wreck of misfortune and misery the one is composed of the different modifications of a certain noble stubborn something in a man known by the names of courage fortitude magnanimity the other is made up of those feelings and sentiments which however the sceptic may deny them or the enthusiast disfigure them are yet i am convinced original and component parts of the human soul those senses of the mind if i may be allowed the expression which connect us with and link us to those awful obscure realitiesan allpowerful and equally beneficent god and a world to come beyond death and the grave the first gives the nerve of combat while a ray of hope beams on the field the last pours the balm of comfort into the wounds which time can never cure  i do not remember my dear cunningham that you and i ever talked on the subject of religion at all i know some who laugh at it as the trick of the crafty few to lead the undiscerning many or at most as an uncertain obscurity which mankind can never know anything of and with which they are fools if they give themselves much to do nor would i quarrel with a man for his irreligion any more than i would for his want of a musical ear i would regret that he was shut out from what to me and to others were such superlative sources of enjoyment it is in this point of a view and for this reason that i will deeply imbue the mind of every child of mine with religion if my son should happen to be a man of feeling sentiment and taste i shall thus add largely to his enjoyments let me flatter myself that this sweet little fellow who is just now running about my desk will be a man of a melting ardent glowing heart and an imagination delighted with the painter and rapt with the poet let me figure him wandering out in a sweet evening to inhale the balmy gales and enjoy the glowing luxuriance of the spring himself the while in the blooming youth of life he looks abroad on all nature and through nature up to natures god his soul by swift delighting degrees is rapt above this sublunary sphere until he can be silent no longer and bursts out into the glorious enthusiasm of thomson    these as they change almighty father these   are but the varied god the rolling year   is full of thee  and so on in all the spirit and ardour of that charming hymn these are no ideal pleasures they are real delights and i ask what of the delights among the sons of men are superior not to say equal to them and they have this precious vast addition that conscious virtue stamps them for her own and lays hold on them to bring herself into the presence of a witnessing judging and approving god  r b                                       cxciito mrs dunlop  castle douglas 25th june 1794  here in a solitary inn in a solitary village am i set by myself to amuse my brooding fancy as i may solitary confinement you know is howards favourite idea of reclaiming sinners so let me consider by what fatality it happens that i have so long been exceeding sinful as to neglect the correspondence of the most valued friend i have on earth to tell you that i have been in poor health will not be excuse enough though it is true i am afraid that i am about to suffer for the follies of my youth my medical friends threaten me with a flying gout but i trust they are mistaken  i am just going to trouble your critical patience with the first sketch of a stanza i have been framing as i passed along the road the subject is liberty you know my honoured friend how dear the theme is to me i design it an irregular ode for general washingtons birthday after having mentioned the degeneracy of other kingdoms i come to scotland thus    thee caledonia thy wild heaths among   thee famed for martial deed and sacred song     to thee i

i send you by my friend mr wallace fortyone songs for your fifth volume if we cannot finish it any other way what would you think of scotch words to some beautiful irish airs in the meantime at your leisure give a copy of the museum to my worthy friend mr peter hill bookseller to bind for me interleaved with blank leaves exactly as he did the laird of glenriddels that i may insert every anecdote i can learn together with my own criticisms and remarks on the songs a copy of this kind i shall leave with you the editor to publish at some after period by way of making the museum a book famous to the end of time and you renowned for ever  i have got a highland dirk for which i have great veneration as it once was the dirk of lord balmerino it fell into bad hands who stripped it of the silver

despised all consequences that might have ensued  my prospect in the excise is something at least it isencumbered as i am with the welfare the very existence of near halfascore of helpless

after your character of him i cannot doubt if he will give me an address and channel by which anything will come safe from those spies with which he may be certain that his correspondence is beset i will now and then send him any bagatelle that i may write in the present hurry of europe nothing but news and politics will be regarded but against the days of peace which heaven send soon my little assistance may perhaps fill up an idle column of a newspaper i have long had it in my head to try my hand in the way of little prose essays which i propose sending into the world through the medium of some newspaper and should these be worth his while to these mr perry shall be welcome and all my reward shall be his treating me with his paper which bytheby to anybody who has the least relish for wit is a high treat indeed  with the most grateful esteem i am ever dear sir  r b     footnote 131 he had offered burns a post on the staff of the    morning chronicle of which newspaper mr perry was

dumfries 4th july 1796  how are you my dear friend and how comes on your fifth volume134 you may probably think that for some time past i have neglected you and your work but alas the hand of pain and sorrow and care has these many months lain heavy on me personal and domestic affliction have almost entirely banished that alacrity and life with which i used to woo the rural muse of scotia  you are a good worthy honest fellow and have a good right to live in this worldbecause you deserve it many a merry meeting this publication has given us and possibly it may give us more though alas i fear it this protracting slow consuming illness which hangs over me will i doubt much my dear friend arrest my sun before he has well reached his middle career and will turn over the poet to far more important concerns than studying the brilliancy of wit or the pathos of sentiment however hope is the cordial of the human heart and i endeavour to cherish it as well as i can  i am ashamed to ask another favour of you because you have been so very good already but my wife has a very particular friend a young lady who sings well to whom she wishes to present the scots musical museum if you have

literary circle inferior to none in the two kingdoms alas my friend i fear the voice of the bard will soon be heard among you no more for these eight or ten months i have been ailing sometimes bedfast and sometimes not but these last three months i have been tortured with an excruciating rheumatism which has reduced me to nearly the last stage you actually would not know me if you saw me pale emaciated and so feeble as occasionally to need help from my chair my spirits fled fledbut i can no more on the subjectonly the medical folks tell me that my last and only chance is bathing and country quarters and riding the deuce of the matter is thiswhen an exciseman is off duty his salary is reduced to £35 instead of £50 what way in the name of thrift shall i maintain myself and keep a horse in country quarters with a wife and five children at home on 35 pounds i mention this because i had intended to beg your utmost interest and that of all the friends you can muster to move our commissioners of excise to grant me the full salary i dare say you know them all personally if they do not grant it me i must lay my account with an exit truly en poete if i die not of disease i must perish with hunger136  i have sent you one of the songs the other my memory does not serve me with and i have no copy here but i shall be at home soon when i will send it you apropos to being at home

father this is the very last of burnss    compositions being written only three days before his death                                   the thomson letters   prefatory note  this correspondence began in september 1792 when burns had already been domiciled nine months in the town of dumfries and ended only with his death in july 1796 it originated in the request of a stranger for a series of songs to suit a projected collection of the best scottish airs the stranger was george thomson a young man of about burnss own age and head clerk in the office of the board of manufactures in edinburgh thomson outlived his great correspondent by more than half a century he died so recently as 1851 at the advanced age of ninetytwo robert chambers has described him as a most honourable man of singularly amiable character and cheerful manners it may interest some people to know that his granddaughter was the wife of dickens the famous novelist   the thomson letter  i  dumfries 16th september 1792  siri have just this moment got your letter as the request you make to me will positively add to my enjoyments in complying with it i shall enter into your undertaking with all the small portion of abilities i have strained to their utmost exertion by the impulse of enthusiasm only dont hurry me deil tak the hindmost is by no means the crie de guerre of my muse will you as i am inferior to none of you in enthusiastic attachment to the poetry and music of old caledonia and since you request it have cheerfully promised my mite of assistancewill you let me have a list of your airs with the first line of the printed verses you intend for them that i may have an opportunity of suggesting any alteration that may occur to me you know tis in the way of my trade still leaving you gentlemen139 the undoubted rights of publishers to approve or reject at your pleasure for your own publication apropos if you are for english verses there is on my part an end of the matter whether in the simplicity of the ballad or the pathos of the song i can only hope to please myself in being allowed at least a sprinkling of our native tongue english verses particularly the works of scotsmen that have merit are certainly very eligible tweedside ah the poor shepherds mournful fate ah chloris could i now but sit etc you cannot mend but such insipid stuff as to fanny fair could i impart etc usually set to the mill mill o is a disgrace to the collections in which it has already appeared and would doubly disgrace a collection that will have the very superior merit of yours but more of this in the farther prosecution of the business if i am to be called on for my strictures and amendmentsi say amendments for i will not alter accept where i myself at least think that i amend  as to any renumeration you may think my songs either above or below price for they shall absolutely be the one or the other in the honest enthusiasm with which i embark in your undertaking to talk of money wages fee hire etc would be downright sodomy of soul a proof of each of the songs that i compose or amend i shall receive as a favour in the rustic phrase of the season gude speed the warki am sir your very humble servant  r burns  psi have some particular reasons for wishing my interference to be known as little as possible     footnote 139 thomson in his letter spoke of coadjutors but in less    than a year he became sole editor of the collection                                        ii  my dear sirlet me tell you that you are too fastidious in your ideas of songs and ballads i own that your criticisms are just the songs you specify in your list have all but one the faults you remark in them but how shall we mend the matter who shall rise up and saygo to i will make a better for instance on reading over the learig i immediately set about trying my hand on it and after all i could make nothing more of it than the following which heaven knows is poor enough    when oer the hill the eastern star   tells bughtintime is near my jo etc  your observation as to the aptitude of dr percys ballad to the air nannie o is just it is besides perhaps the most beautiful ballad in the english language but let me remark to you that in the sentiment and style of our scottish airs there is a pastoral simplicity a something that one may call the doric style and dialect of vocal music to which a dash of our native tongue and manners is particularly nay peculiarly apposite for this reason and upon my honour for this reason alone i am of opinion but as i told you before my opinion is yours freely yours to approve or reject as you please that my ballad of nannie o might perhaps do for one set of verses to the tune now dont let it enter into your head that you are under any necessity of taking my verses i have long ago made up my mind as to my own reputation in the business of authorship and have nothing to be pleased or offended at in your adoption or rejection of my verses though you should reject one half of what i give you i shall be pleased with your adopting the other half and shall continue to serve you with the same assiduity  in the printed copy of my nannie o the name of the river is horridly prosaic i will alter it    behind yon hills where lugar flows  girvan is the name of the river that suits the idea of the stanza best but lugar is the most agreeable modulation of syllables  i will soon give you a great many more remarks on this business but i have just now an opportunity of conveying you this scrawl free of postage an expense that it is ill able to pay so with my best compliments to honest allan140 goodbye to ye    friday night   saturday morning  as i find i have still an hour to spare this morning before my conveyance goes away i will give you nannie o at length  your remarks on ewebughts marion are just still it has obtained a place among our more classical scottish songs and what with many beauties in its composition and more prejudices in its favour you will not find it easy to supplant it  in my very early years when i was thinking of going to the west indies i took the following farewell of a dear girl it is quite trifling and has nothing of the merits of ewebughts but it will fill up this page you must know that all my earlier lovesongs were the breathings of ardent passion and though it might have been easy in aftertimes to have given them a polish yet that polish to me whose they were and who perhaps alone cared for them would have defaced the legend of my heart which was so faithfully inscribed on them their uncouth simplicity was as they say of wines their race    will ye go to the indies my mary etc  gala water and auld rob morris i think will most probably be the next subject of my musings however even on my verses speak out your criticisms with equal frankness my wish is not to stand aloof the uncomplying bigot of opiniâtretè but cordially to join issue with you in the furtherance of the work gude speed the wark  amen  footnote 140 david allan the artist                                       iii  november 8th 1792  if you mean my dear sir that all the songs in your collection shall be poetry of the first merit i am afraid you will find more difficulty in the undertaking than you are aware of there is a peculiar rhythmus in many of our airs and a necessity of adapting syllables to the emphasis or what i would call the featurenotes of the tune that cramp the poet and lay him under almost insuperable difficulties for instance in the air my wifes a wanton wee thing if a few lines smooth and pretty can be adapted to it it is all you can expect the enclosed were made extempore to it and though on farther study i might give you something more profound yet it might not suit the lighthorse gallop of the air so well as this random clink  i have just been looking over the colliers bonny dochter and if the enclosed rhapsody which i composed the day on a charming ayrshire girl miss baillie as she passed through this place to england will suit your taste better than the collier lassie fall on and welcome  i have hitherto deferred the sublimer more pathetic airs until more leisure as they will take and deserve a greater effort however they are all put into your hands as clay into the hands of the potter to make one vessel to honour and another to dishonour farewell etc                                       iv  inclosing highland marytunekatharine ogie  ye banks and braes and streams around etc  14th november 1792  my dear siri agree with you that the song katharine ogie is very poor stuff and unworthy altogether unworthy of so beautiful an air i tried to mend it but the awkward sound ogie recurring in the rhyme spoils every attempt at introducing sentiment into the piece the foregoing song pleases myself i think it is in my happiest manner you will see at the first glance that it suits the air the subject of the song is one of the most interesting passages of my youthful days and i own that i should be much flattered to see the verses set to an air which would ensure celebrity perhaps after alltis the still glowing prejudice of my heart that throws a borrowed lustre over the merits of the composition  i have partly taken your idea of auld rob morris i have adopted the two first verses and am going on with the song on a new plan which promises pretty well i take up one or another just as the bee of the moment buzzes in my bonnetlug and do you sans ceremonie make what use you choose of the productions adieu etc                                       v  26th january 1793  i approve greatly my dear sir of your plans dr beatties essay will of itself be a treasure on my part i mean to draw up an appendix to the doctors essay containing my stock of anecdotes etc of our scots songs all the late mr tytlers anecdotes i have by me taken down in the course of my acquaintance with him from his own mouth i am such an enthusiast that in the course of my several peregrinations through scotland i made a pilgrimage to the individual spot from which every song took its rise lochaber and the braes of ballendean excepted so far as locality either from the title of the air or the tenor of the song could be ascertained i have paid my devotions at the particular shrine of every scots muse  i do not doubt but you might make a very valuable collection of jacobite songsbut would it give no offence in the meantime do not you think that some of them particularly the sows tail to geordie as an air with other words might be well worth a place in your collection of lively songs  if it were possible to procure songs of merit it would be proper to have one set of scots words to every air and that the set of words to which the notes ought to be set there is a naïvetè a pastoral simplicity in a slight intermixture of scots words and phraseology which is more in unison at least to my taste and i will add to every genuine caledonian taste with the simple pathos or rustic sprightliness of our native music than any english verses whatever  the very name of peter pindar is an acquisition to your work his gregory is beautiful i have tried to give you a set of stanzas in scots on the same subject which are at your service not that i intend to enter the lists with peter that would be presumption indeed my song though much inferior in poetic merit has i think more of the ballad simplicity in it      lord gregory   o mirk mirk is this midnight hour etc  your remark on the first stanza of my highland mary is just but i cannot alter it without injuring the poetry                                       vi  20th march 1793  my dear sirthe song prefixed mary morison is one of my juvenile works i leave it in your hands i do not think it very remarkable either for its merits or demerits it is impossible at least i feel it so in my stinted powers to be always original entertaining and witty  what is become of the list etc of your songs i shall be out of all temper with you by and by i have always looked on myself as the prince of indolent correspondents and valued myself accordingly and i will not cannot bear rivalship from you nor anybody else                                       vii  7th april 1793   thank you my dear sir for your packet you cannot imagine how much this business of composing for your publication has added to my enjoyments what with my early attachment to ballads your book etc balladmaking is now as completely my hobbyhorse as ever fortification was uncle tobys so ill een canter it away till i come to the limit of my race god grant that i may take the right side of the winningpost and then cheerfully looking back on the honest folks with whom i have been happy i shall say or sing sae merry as we a hae been and raising my last looks to the whole human race the last words of the voice of coila shall be good night and joy be wi you a so much for my last words now for a few present remarks as they have occurred at random on looking over your list  the first lines of the last time i came oer the moor and several other lines in it are beautiful but in my opinionpardon me revered shade of ramsaythe song is unworthy of the divine air i shall try to make or mend for ever fortune wilt thou prove is a charming song but logan burn and logan braes are sweetly susceptible of rural imagery ill try that likewise and if i succeed the other song may class among the english ones i remember the two last lines of a verse in some of the old songs of logan water for i know a good many different ones which i think pretty    now my dear lad maun face his faes   far far frae me and logan braes  my patie is a lover gay is unequal his mind is never muddy is a muddy expression indeed    then ill resign and marry pate   and syne my cockernony  this is surely far unworthy of ramsay or your book my song rigs of barley to the same tune does not altogether please me but if i can mend it and thresh a few loose sentiments out of it i will submit it to your consideration the lass o paties mill is one of ramsays best songs but there is one loose sentiment in it which my muchvalued friend mr erskine will take into his critical consideration in sir j sinclairs statistical volumes are two claims one i think from aberdeenshire and the other from ayrshire for the honour of this song the following anecdote which i had from the present sir william cunningham of robertland who had it of the late john earl of loudon i can on such authorities believe  allan ramsay was residing at loudon castle with the then earl father to earl john and one forenoon riding or walking out together his lordship and allan passed a sweet romantic spot on irwine water still called paties mill where a bonnie lass was tedding hay bareheaded on the green my lord observed to allan that it would be a fine theme for a song ramsay took the hint and lingering behind he composed the first sketch of it which he produced at dinner  one day i heard mary say is a fine song but for consistencys sake alter the name adonis was there ever such banns published as a purpose of marriage between adonis and mary i agree with you that my song theres nought but care on every hand is much superior to poortith cauld the original song the mill mill o though excellent is on account of delicacy inadmissible still i like the title and think a scottish song would suit the notes best and let your chosen song which is very pretty follow as an english set the banks of dee is you know literally langolee to slow time the song is well enough but has some false imagery in it for instance    and sweetly the nightingale sung from the tree  in the first place the nightingale sings in a low bush but never from a tree and in the second place there never was a nightingale seen or heard on the banks of the dee or on the banks of any other river in scotland exotic rural imagery is always comparatively flat if i could hit on another stanza equal to the small birds rejoice etc i do myself honestly avow that i think it a superior song john anderson my jothe song to this tune in johnsons museum is my composition and i think it not my worst if it suit you take it and welcome your collection of sentimental and pathetic songs is in my opinion very complete but not so your comic ones where are tullochgorum lumps o puddin tibbie fowler and several others which in my humble judgment are well worthy of preservation there is also one sentimental song of mine in the museum which never was known out of the immediate neighbourhood until i got it taken down from a country girls singing it is called craigieburn wood and in the opinion of mr clarke is one of our sweetest scottish songs he is quite an enthusiast about it and i would take his taste in scottish music against the taste of most connoisseurs  you are quite right in inserting the last five in your list though they are certainly irish shepherds i have lost my love is to me a heavenly airwhat would you think of a set of scottish verses to it i have made one a good while ago which i think is the best love song141 i ever composed in my life but in its original state it is not quite a ladys song i enclose an altered not amended copy for you if you choose to set the tune to it and let the irish verses follow  mr erskines songs are all pretty but his lone vale is divineyours etc  let me know just how you like these random hints     footnote 141 yestreen i had a pint o wine                                       viii  april 1793  my dear siri own my vanity is flattered when you give my songs a place in your elegant and superb work but to be of service to the work is my first wish as i have often told you i do not in a single instance wish you out of compliment to me to insert anything of mine one hint let me give youwhatever mr peyel does let him not alter one iota of the original scottish airs i mean in the song department but let our national music preserve its native features they are i own frequently wild and irreducible to the more modern rules but on that very eccentricity perhaps depends a great part of their effect                                       ix  june 1793  when i tell you my dear sir that a friend of mine in whom i am much interested has fallen a sacrifice to these accursed times you will easily allow that it might unhinge me for doing any good among ballads my own loss as to pecuniary matters is trifling but the total ruin of a muchloved friend is a loss indeed pardon my seeming inattention to your last commands  i cannot alter the disputed lines in the mill mill o142 what you think a defect i esteem as a positive beauty so you see how doctors differ i shall now with as much alacrity as i can muster go on with your commands  you know frazer the hautboy player in edinburghhe is here instructing a band of music for a fencible corps quartered in this country among many of the airs that please me there is one well known as a reel by the name of the quakers wife and which i remember a grandaunt of mine used to sing by the name of liggeram cosh my bonnie wee lass mr frazer plays it slow and with an expression that quite charms me i became such an enthusiast about it that i made a song for it which i here subjoin and inclose frazers set of the tune if they hit your fancy they are at your service if not return me the tune and i will put it in johnsons museum i think the song is not in my worst manner    blithe hae i been on yon hill etc  i should wish to hear how this pleases you     footnote 142 the lines were the third and fourth     wi mony a sweet babe fatherless    and mony a widow mourning                                x  june 25th 1793  have you ever my dear sir felt your bosom ready to burst with indignation on reading of those mighty villains who divide kingdom against kingdom desolate provinces and lay nations waste out of the wantonness of ambition or often from still more ignoble passions in a mood of this kind today i recollected the air of logan water and it occurred to me that its querulous melody probably had its origin from the plaintive indignation of some swelling suffering heart fired at the tyrannic strides of some public destroyer and overwhelmed with private distress the consequence of a countrys ruin if i have done anything at all like justice to my feelings the following song composed in three quarters of an hours meditation in my elbowchair ought to have some merit    here follows logan water  do you know the following beautiful little fragment in witherspoons collection of scots songs  airhughie graham    o gin my love were yon red rose     that grows upon the castle wa   and i mysel a drap o dew     into her bonnie breast to fa    oh there beyond expression blest     id feast on beauty a the night   seald on her silk saft faulds to rest     till fleyd awa by phoebus light  this thought is inexpressibly beautiful and quite so far as i know original it is too short for a song else i would forswear you altogether unless you gave it a place i have often tried to eke a stanza to it but in vain after balancing myself for a musing five minutes on the hind legs of my elbowchair i produced the following the verses are far inferior to the foregoing i frankly confess but if worthy of insertion at all they might be first in place as every poet who knows anything of his trade will husband his best thoughts for a concluding stroke    o were my love yon lilac fair     wi purple blossoms to the spring   and i a bird to shelter there     when wearied on my little wing    how i wad mourn when it was torn     by autumn wild and winter rude   but i wad sing on wanton wing     when youthfu may its bloom renewd                                       xi  july 1793  i assure you my dear sir that you truly hurt me with your pecuniary parcel it degrades me in my own eyes however to return it would savour of affectation but as to any more traffic of that debtor or creditor kind i swear by that honour which crowns the upright statue of robert burnss integrityon the least motion of it i will indignantly spurn the bypast transaction and from that moment commence entire stranger to you burnss character for generosity of sentiment and independence of mind will i trust long outlive any of his wants which the cold unfeeling ore can supply at least i will take care that such a character he shall deserve  thank you for my copy of your publication never did my eyes behold in any musical work such elegance and correctness your preface too is admirably written only your partiality to me has made you say too much however it will bind me down to double every eifort in the future progress of the work the following are a few remarks on the songs in the list you sent me i never copy what i write to you so i may be often tautological or perhaps contradictory  the flowers of the forest is charming as a poem and should be and must be set to the notes but though out of your rule the three stanzas beginning    i hae seen the smiling o fortune beguiling  are worthy of a place were it but to immortalise the author of them who is an old lady143 of my acquaintance and at this moment living in edinburgh she is a mrs cockburn i forget of what place but from roxburghshire what a charming apostrophe is    o fickle fortune why this cruel sporting   why why torment uspoor sons of a day  the old ballad i wish i were where helen lies is silly to contemptibility my alteration of it in johnsons is not much better     footnote 142 nee rutherford of selkirkshire she was then 81    years old                                       xii  august 1793  that tune cauld kail is such a favourite of yours that i once more roved out yesterday for a gloaminshot at the muses when the muse that presides oer the shores of nith or rather my old inspiring dearest nymph coila whispered me the following i have two reasons for thinking that it was my early sweet simple inspirer that was by my elbow smooth gliding without step and pouring the song on my glowing fancy in the first place since i left coilas haunts not a fragment of a poet has arisen to cheer her solitary musings by catching inspiration from her so i more than suspect she has followed me hither or at least makes me occasional visits secondly the last stanza of this song i send you is the very words that coila taught me many years ago and which i set to an old scots reel in johnsons museum  autumn is my propitious season i make more verses in it than in all the year else god bless you                                xiii  sept 1793  you may readily trust my dear sir that any exertion in my power is heartily at your service but one thing i must hint to you the very name of peter finder is of great service to your publication so get a verse from him now and then though i have no objection as well as i can to bear the burden of the business  you know that my pretensions to musical taste are merely a few of natures instincts untaught and untutored by art for this reason many musical compositions particularly where much of the merit lies in counterpoint however they may transport and ravish the ears of your connoisseurs affect my simple lug no otherwise than merely as melodious din on the other hand by way of amends i am delighted with many little melodies which the learned musician despises as silly and insipid i do not know whether the old air hey tuttie taittie may rank among this number but well i know that with frazers hautboy it has often filled my eyes with tears there is a tradition which i have met with in many places of scotland that it was robert bruces march at the battle of bannockburn this thought in my solitary wanderings warmed me to a pitch of enthusiasm on the theme of liberty and independence which i threw into a kind of scottish ode fitted to the air that one might suppose to be the gallant royal scots address to his heroic followers on that eventful morning      bruce to his troops   on the eve of the battle of bannockburn     hey tuttie taittie   scots wha hae wi wallace bled etc  so may god ever defend the cause of truth and liberty as he did that dayamen  psi showed the air to urbani who was highly pleased with it and begged me to make soft verses for it but i had no idea of giving myself any trouble on the subject till the accidental recollection of that glorious struggle for freedom associated with the glowing ideas of some other struggles of the same nature not quite so ancient roused my rhyming mania clarkes set of the tune with his bass you will find in the museum though i am afraid that the air is not what will entitle it to a place in your elegant selection                                       xiv  september 1793  i have received your list my dear sir and here go my observations on it143  down the burn davie i have this moment tried an alteration leaving out the last half of the third stanza and the first half of the last stanza thus    as down the burn they took their way     and thro the flowery dale   his cheek to hers he aft did lay     and love was aye the tale    with mary when shall we return     sic pleasure to renew   quoth mary love i like the burn     and aye shall follow you  thro the wood laddie i am decidedly of opinion that both in this and therell never be peace till jamie comes hame the second or high part of the tune being a repetition of the first part an octave higher is only for instrumental music and would be much better omitted in singing  cowdenknowes remember in your index that the song in pure english to this tune beginning             when summer comes the swains on tweed  is the production of crawford robert was his christian name  laddie lie near me must lie by me for some time i do not know the air and until i am complete master of a tune in my own singing such as it is i never can compose for it my way is i consider the poetic sentiment correspondent to my idea of the musical expression then choose my theme begin one stanza when that is composed which is generally the most difficult part of the business i walk out sit down now and then look out for objects in nature around me that are in unison or harmony with the cogitations of my fancy and workings of my bosom humming every now and then the air with the verses i have framed when i feel my muse beginning to jade i retire to the solitary fireside of my study and there commit my effusions to paper swinging at intervals on the hind legs of my elbow chair by way of calling forth my own critical strictures as my pen goes on seriously this at home is almost invariably my way what cursed egotism  gil morice i am for leaving out it is a plaguy length the air itself is never sung and its place can well be supplied by one or two songs for fine airs that are not in your list for instance craigieburnwood and roys wife the first besides its intrinsic merit has novelty and the last has high merit as well as great celebrity i have the original words of a song for the last air in the handwriting of the lady who composed it and they are superior to any edition of the song which the public has yet seen  highland laddie the old set will please a mere scotch ear best and the new an italianised one there is a third and what oswald calls the old highland laddie which pleases we more than either of them it is sometimes called jinglan johnnie it being the air of an old humorous tawdry song of that name you will find it in the museum i hae been at crookieden etc i would advise you in this musical quandary to offer up your prayers to the muses for inspiring direction and in the meantime waiting for this direction bestow a libation to bacchus and there is not a doubt but you will hit on a judicious choice probatum est  auld sir simon i must beg you to leave out and put in its place the quakers wife  blythe hae i been on yon hill is one of the finest songs ever i made in my life and besides is composed on a young lady positively the most beautiful lovely woman in the world as i purpose giving you the names and designations of all my heroines to appear in some future edition of your work perhaps half a century hence you must certainly include the bonniest lass in a the warld in your collection  daintie davie i have heard sung nineteen thousand nine hundred and ninetynine times and always with the low part of the tune and nothing has surprised me so much as your opinion on this subject if it will not suit as i propose we will lay two of the stanzas together and then make the chorus follow  fee him father i enclose you frazers set of this tune when he plays it slow in fact he makes it the language of despair i shall here give you two stanzas in that style merely to try if it will be any improvement were it possible in singing to give it half the pathos which frazer gives it in playing it would make an admirable pathetic song i do not give these verses for any merit they have i composed them at the time at which patie allans mither died that was the back o midnight and by the leeside of a bowl of punch which had overset every mortal in the company except the hautbois and the muse    thou hast left me ever jamie etc  jockie and jenny i would discard and in its place would put theres nae luck about the house which has a very pleasant air and which is positively the finest loveballad in that style in the scottish or perhaps in any other language when she came ben she bobbet as an air is more beautiful than either and in the andante way would unite with a charming sentimental ballad  saw ye my father is one of my greatest favourites the evening before last i wandered out and began a tender song in what i think its native style i must premise that the old way and the way to give most effect is to have no starting note as the fiddlers call it but to burst at once into the pathos every country girl singssaw ye my father etc  my song is just begun and i should like before i proceed to know your opinion of it i have sprinkled it with the scottish dialect but it may be easily turned into correct english      fragmenttunesaw ye my father   where are the joys i hae met in the morning etc  todlin hame urbani mentioned an idea of his which has long been mine and this air is highly susceptible of pathos accordingly you will soon hear him at your concert try it to a song of mine in the museumye banks and braes o bonnie doon one song more and i have done auld lang syne the air is but mediocre but the following song the old song of the olden times and which has never been in print nor even in manuscript until i took it down from an old mans singing is enough to recommend any air144      auld lang syne   should auld acquaintance be forgot etc  now i suppose i have tired your patience fairly you must after all is over have a number of ballads properly so called gil morice tranent muir mphersons farewell battle of sheriffmuir or we ran and they ran i know the author of this charming ballad and his history hardiknute barbara allan i can furnish a finer set of this tune than any that has yet appeared and besides do you know that i really have the old tune to which the cherry and the slae was sung and which is mentioned as a wellknown air in scotlands complaint a book published before poor marys days it was then called the banks o helicon an old poem which pinkerton has brought to light you will see all this in tytlers history of scottish music the tune to a learned ear may have no great merit but it is a great curiosity i have a good many original things of this kind     footnote 143 songs for his publication burns goes through the    whole but only his remarks of any importance are presented here     footnote 144 it is believed to have been his own composition                                       xv  september 1793  who shall decide when doctors disagree my ode145 pleases me so much that i cannot alter it your proposed alterations would in my opinion make it tame i am exceedingly obliged to you for putting me on reconsidering it as i think i have much improved it instead of sodger hero i will have it caledonian on wi me  i have scrutinised it over and over and to the world some way or other it shall go as it is at the same time it will not in the least hurt me should you leave it out altogether and adhere to your first intention of adopting logans verses  i have finished my song to saw ye my father and in english as you will see that there is a syllable too much for the expression of the air is true but allow me to say that the mere dividing of a dotted crotchet into a crotchet and a quaver is not a great matter however in that i have no pretensions to cope in judgment with you of the poetry i speak with confidence but the music is a business where i hint my ideas with the utmost diffidence     footnote 145 scots wha hae                                       xvi  may 1794  my dear siri return you the plates with which i am highly pleased i would humbly propose instead of the younker knitting stockings to put a stock and horn into his hands a friend of mine who is positively the ablest judge on the subject i have ever met with and though an unknown is yet a superior artist with the burin is quite charmed with allans manner i got him a peep of the gentle shepherd and he pronounces allan a most original artist of great excellence  for my part i look on mr allans choosing my favourite poem for his subject to be one of the highest compliments i have ever received  i am quite vexed at pleyels being cooped up in france as it will put an entire stop to our work now and for six or seven months i shall be quite in song as you shall see byandby i got an air pretty enough composed by lady elizabeth heron of heron which she calls the banks of cree cree is a beautiful romantic stream and as her ladyship is a particular friend of mine i have written the following song to it    here is the glen and here the bower etc                                       xvii  sept 1794  i shall withdraw my on the seas and far away altogether it is unequal and unworthy of the work making a poem is like begetting a son you cannot know whether you have a wise man or a fool until you produce him to the world and try him  for that reason i have sent you the offspring of my brain abortions and all and as such pray look over them and forgive them and burn them i am flattered at your adopting ca the yowes to the knowes as it was owing to me that it ever saw the light about seven years ago i was well acquainted with a worthy little fellow of a clergyman a mr clunie who sung it charmingly and at my request mr clarke took it down from his singing when i gave it to johnson i added some stanzas to the song and mended others but still it will not do for you in a solitary stroll which i took today i tried my hand on a few pastoral lines following up the idea of the chorus which i would preserve here it is with all its crudities and imperfections on its head    ca the yowes etc  i shall give you my opinion of your other newly adopted songs my first scribbling fit                                       xviii  19th october 1794  my dear friendby this mornings post i have your list and in general i highly approve of it i shall at more leisure give you a critique on the whole clarke goes to your town by todays fly and i wish you would call on him and take his opinion in general you know his taste is a standard he will return here again in a week or two so please do not miss asking for him one thing i hope he will dopersuade you to adopt my favourite craigieburn wood in your selection it is as great a favourite of his as of mine the lady on whom it was made is one of the finest women in scotland and in fact entre nous is in a manner to me what sternes eliza was to hima mistress a friend or what you will in the guileless simplicity of platonic love now dont put any of your squinting constructions on this or have any clishmaclaiver about it among our acquaintances i assure you that to my lovely friend you are indebted for many of your best songs of mine do you think that the sober ginhorse routine of existence could inspire a man with life and love and joycould fire him with enthusiasm or melt him with pathos equal to the genius of your book no no whenever i want to be more than ordinary in songto be in some degree equal to your diviner airsdo you imagine i fast and pray for the divine emanation tout au contraire i have a glorious recipethe very one that for his own use was invented by the divinity of healing and poetry when erst he piped to the flocks of admetus i put myself on a regimen of admiring a fine woman and in proportion to the adorability of her charms in proportion you are delighted with my verses the lightning of her eye is the godhead of parnassus and the witchery of her smile the divinity of helicon  to descend to business if you like my idea of when she cam ben she bobbit the enclosed stanzas of mine altered a little from what they were formerly when set to another air may perhaps do instead of worse stanzas  now for a few miscellaneous remarks the posie in the museum is my composition the air was taken down from mrs burnss voice it is well known in the west country but the old words are trash bythebye take a look at the tune again and tell me if you do not think it is the original from which roslin castle is composed the second part in particular for the first two or three bars is exactly the old air strathallans lament is mine the music is by our right trusty and deservedly well beloved allan masterton donocht head is not mine i would give ten pounds if it were it appeared first in the edinburgh herald and came to the editor of that paper with the newcastle postmark on it146  whistle oer the lave ot is mine the music is said to be by a john bruce a celebrated violin player in dumfries about the beginning of this century this i know bruce who was an honest man though a redwud highlandman constantly claimed it and by all the old musical people here is believed to be the author of it  andrew and his cutty gun the song to which this is set in the museum is mine and was composed on miss euphemia murray of lintrose commonly and deservedly called the flower of strathmore  how lang and dreary is the night i met with some such words in a collection of songs somewhere which i altered and enlarged and to please you and to suit your favourite air i have taken a stride or two across the room and have arranged it anew as you will find on the other page    tunecauld kail in aberdeen   how lang and dreary is the night etc  tell me how you like this i differ from your idea of the expression of the tune there is to me a great deal of tenderness in it  i would be obliged to you if you would procure me a sight of ritsons collection of english songs which you mention in your letter i will thank you for another information and that as speedily as you pleasewhether this miserable drawling hotchpotch epistle has not completely tired you of my correspondence     footnote 146      keen blaws the wind oer donocht head     the snaw drives snelly thro

begun my anecdotes etc for your work i intend drawing it up in the form of a letter to you which will save me from the tedious dull business of systematic arrangement indeed as all i have to say consists of unconnected remarks anecdotes scraps of old songs etc it would be impossible to give the work a beginning a middle and an end which the critics insist to be absolutely necessary in a work in my last i told you my objections to the song you had selected for my lodging is on the cold ground on my visit the other day to my fair chloris that is the poetic name of the lovely goddess of my inspiration she suggested an idea which i on my return from the visit wrought into the following song    my chloris mark how green the groves etc  how do you like the simplicity and tenderness of this pastoral i think it pretty well  i like you for entering so candidly and so kindly into the story of ma chlre amie i assure you i was never more in earnest in my life than in the account of that affair which i sent you in my last conjugal love is a passion which i deeply feel and highly venerate but somehow it does not make such a figure in poesy as that other species of the passion    where love is liberty and nature law  musically speaking the first is an instrument of which the gamut is scanty and confined but the tones inexpressibly sweet while the last has powers equal to all the intellectual modulations of the human soul still i am a very poet in my enthusiasm of the passion the welfare and happiness of the beloved object is the first and inviolate sentiment that pervades my soul and whatever pleasures i might wish for or whatever might be the raptures they would give me yet if they interfere with that first principle it is having these pleasures at a dishonest price and justice forbids and generosity disdains the purchase                                       xx  i am out of temper that you should set so sweet so tender an air as deil tak the wars to the foolish old verses you talk of the silliness of saw ye my father by heavens the odds is gold to brass besides the old song though now pretty well modernised into the scottish language is originally and in the early editions a bungling low imitation of the scottish manner by that genius tom durfey so has no pretensions to be a scottish production there is a pretty english song by sheridan in the duenna to this air which is out of sight superior to durfeys it begins    when sable night each drooping plant restoring  the air if i understand the expression of it properly is the very native language of simplicity tenderness and love i have again gone over my song to the tune as follows147  there is an air the caledonian hunts delight to which i wrote a song that you will find in johnson ye banks and braes o bonnie doon this air i think might find a place among your hundred as lear says of his knights do you know the history of the air it is curious enough a good many years ago mr james miller writer in your good town a gentleman whom possibly you know was in company with our friend clarke and talking of scottish music miller expressed an ardent ambition to be able to compose a scots air mr clarke partly by way of joke told him to keep to the black keys of the harpsichord and preserve some kind of rhythm and he would infallibly compose a scots air certain it is that in a few days mr miller produced the rudiments of an air which mr clarke with some touches and corrections fashioned into the tune in question ritson you know has the same story of the black keys but this account which i have just given you mr clarke informed me of several years ago now to shew you how difficult it is to trace the origin of our airs i have heard it repeatedly asserted that this was an irish air nay i met with an irish gentleman who affirmed he had heard it in ireland among the old women while on the other hand a countess informed me that the first person who introduced the air into this country was a baronets lady of her acquaintance who took down the notes from an itinerant piper in the isle of man how difficult then to ascertain the truth respecting our poesy and music i myself have lately seen a couple of ballads sung through the streets of dumfries with my name at the head of them as the author though it was the first time i had ever seen them  i am ashamed my dear fellow to make the request tis dunning your generosity but in a moment when i had forgotten whether i was rich or poor i promised chloris a copy of your songs it wrings my honest pride to write you this but an ungracious request is doubly so by a tedious apology to make you some amends as soon as i have extracted the necessary information out of them i will return you ritsons volumes  the lady is not a little proud that she is to make so distinguished a figure in your collection and i am not a little proud that i have it in my power to please her so much lucky it is for your patience that my paper is done for when i am in a scribbling humour i know not when to give over     footnote 147 our bard remarks upon it i could easily throw this    into an english mould but to my taste in the simple and the tender    of the pastoral song a sprinkling of the old scottish has an    inimitable effect                                       xxi  19th nov 1794  tell my friend allan for i am sure that we only want the trifling circumstance of being known to one another to be the best friends on earth that i much suspect he has in his plates mistaken the figure of the stock and horn i have at last gotten one but it is a very rude instrument it is composed of three parts the stock which is the hinder thighbone of a sheep such as you see in a muttonham the horn which is a common highland cows horn cut off at the smaller end until the aperture be large enough to admit the stock to be pushed up through the horn until it be held by the thicker end of the thighbone and lastly an oaten reed exactly cut and notched like that which you see every shepherd boy have when the corn stems are green and fullgrown the reed is not made fast in the bone but is held up by the lips and plays loose in the smaller end of the stock while the stock with the horn hanging on its larger end is held by the hands in playing the stock has six or seven ventiges on the upper side and one back ventige like the common flute this of mine was made by a man from the braes of athole and is exactly what the shepherds wont to use in that country  however either it is not quite properly bored in the holes or else we have not the art of blowing it rightly for we can make little of it if mr allan chooses i will send him a sight of mine as i look on myself to be a kind of brotherbrush with him pride in poets is nae sin and i will say it that i look on mr allan and mr burns to be the only genuine and real painters of scottish costume in the world                                       xxii  january 1795  i fear for my songs however a few may please yet originality is a coy feature in composition and in a multiplicity of efforts in the same style disappears altogether for these three thousand years we poetic folks have been describing the spring for instance and as the spring continues the same there must soon be a sameness in the imagery etc of these said rhyming folks  a great critic aikin on songs says that love and wine are the exclusive themes for songwriting the following is on neither subject and consequently is no song but will be allowed i think to be two or three pretty good prose thoughts inverted into rhyme    for a that and a that   is there for honest poverty etc                                       xxiii  ecclefechan148 7th feb 1795  my dear thomsonyou cannot have any

forward but snows of ten feet deep have impeded my progress i have tried to gae back the gate i cam again but the same obstacle has shut me up within insuperable bars to add to my misfortune since
