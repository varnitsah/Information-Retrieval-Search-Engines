53694428	proserpina  studies of wayside flowers  while the air was yet pure  among the alps and in the scotland and england which my father knew  by  john ruskin lld  honorary student of christchurch and honorary fellow of corpus christi college oxford  vol ii  1888                                       chapter i  viola  1 although i have not been able in the preceding volume to complete in any wise as i desired the account of the several parts and actions of plants in general i will not delay any longer our entrance on the examination of particular kinds though here and there i must interrupt such special study by recurring to general principles or points of wider interest but the scope of such larger inquiry will be best seen and the use of it best felt by entering now on specific study  i begin with the violet because the arrangement of the group to which it belongscytheridesis more arbitrary than that of the rest and calls for some immediate explanation  2 i fear that my readers may expect me to write something very pretty for them about violets but my time for writing prettily is long past and it requires some watching over myself i find to keep me even from writing querulously for while the older i grow very thankfully i recognize more and more the number of pleasures granted to human eyes in this fair world i recognize also an increasing sensitiveness in my temper to anything that interferes with them and a grievous readiness to find faultalways of course submissively but very articulatelywith whatever nature seems to me not to have managed to the best of her poweras for extreme instance her late arrangements of frost this spring destroying all the beauty of the wood sorrels nor am i less inclined looking to her as the greatest of sculptors and painters to ask every time i see a narcissus why it should be wrapped up in brown paper and every time i see a violet what it wants with a spur  3 what any flower wants with a spur is indeed the simplest and hitherto to me unanswerablest form of the question nevertheless when blossoms grow in spires and are crowded together and have to grow partly downwards in order to win their share of light and breeze one can see some reason for the effort of the petals to expand upwards and backwards also but that a violet who has her little stalk to herself and might grow straight up if she pleased should be pleased to do nothing of the sort but quite gratuitously bend her stalk down at the top and fasten herself to it by her waist as it werethis is so much more like a girl of the periods fancy than a violets that i never gather one separately but with renewed astonishment at it  4 one reason indeed there is which i never thought of until this moment a piece of stupidity which i can only pardon myself in because as it has chanced i have studied violets most in gardens not in their wild hauntspartly thinking their athenian honour was as a garden flower and partly being always fed away from them among the hills by flowers which i could see nowhere else with all excuse i can furbish up however it is shameful that the truth of the matter never struck me before or at least this bit of the truthas follows  5 the greeks and milton alike speak of violets as growing in meadows or dales but the greeks did so because they could not fancy any delight except in meadows and milton because he wanted a rhyme to nightingaleand after all was london bred but violas beloved knew where violets grew in illyriaand grow everywhere else also when they canon a bank facing the south  just as distinctly as the daisy and buttercup are meadow flowers the violet is a bank flower and would fain grow always on a steep slope towards the sun and it is so poised on its stem that it shows when growing on a slope the full space and opening of its flowernot at all in any strain of modesty hiding itself though it may easily be by grass or mossy stone half hiddenbut to the full showing itself and intending to be lovely and luminous as fragrant to the uttermost of its soft power  nor merely in its oblique setting on the stalk but in the reversion of its two upper petals the flower shows this purpose of being fully seen for a flower that does hide itself take a lily of the valley or the bell of a grape hyacinth or a cyclamen but respecting this matter of petalreversion we must now farther state two or three general principles  6 a perfect or pure flower as a rose oxalis or campanula is always composed of an unbroken whorl or corolla in the form of a disk cup bell or if it draw together again at the lips a narrownecked vase this cup bell or vase is divided into similar petals or segments which are petals carefully joined varying in number from three to eight and enclosed by a calyx whose sepals are symmetrical also  an imperfect or as i am inclined rather to call it an injured flower is one in which some of the petals have inferior office and position and are either degraded for the benefit of others or expanded and honoured at the cost of others  of this process the first and simplest condition is the reversal of the upper petals and elongation of the lower ones in blossoms set on the side of a clustered stalk when the change is simply and directly dependent on their position in the cluster as in aurora regina1 modifying every bell just in proportion as it declines from the perfected central one some of the loveliest groups of form are produced which can be seen in any inferior organism but when the irregularity becomes fixed and the flower is always to the same extent distorted whatever its position in the cluster the plant is to be rightly thought of as reduced to a lower rank in creation  7 it is to be observed also that these inferior forms of flower have always the appearance of being produced by some kind of mischiefblight bite or illbreeding they never suggest the idea of improving themselves now into anything better one is only afraid of their tearing or puffing themselves into something worse nay even the quite natural and simple conditions of inferior vegetable do not in the least suggest to the unbitten or unblighted human intellect the notion of development into anything other than their like one does not expect a mushroom to translate itself into a pineapple nor a betony to moralize itself into a lily nor a snapdragon to soften himself into a lilac  8 it is very possible indeed that the recent phrenzy for the investigation of digestive and reproductive operations in plants may by this time have furnished the microscopic malice of botanists with providentially disgusting reasons or demoniacally nasty necessities for every possible spur spike jag sting rent blotch flaw freckle filth or venom which can be detected in the construction or distilled from the dissolution of vegetable organism but with these obscene processes and prurient apparitions the gentle and happy scholar of flowers has nothing whatever to do i am amazed and saddened more than i can care to say by finding how much that is abominable may be discovered by an illtaught curiosity in the purest things that earth is allowed to produce for usperhaps if we were less reprobate in our own ways the grass which is our type might conduct itself better even though it has no hope but of being cast into the oven in the meantime healthy human eyes and thoughts are to be set on the lovely laws of its growth and habitation and not on the mean mysteries of its birth  9 i relieve therefore our presently inquiring souls from any farther care as to the reason for a violets spuror for the extremely ugly arrangements of its stamens and style invisible unless by vexatious and vicious peeping you are to think of a violet only in its green leaves and purple or golden petalsyou are to know the varieties of form in both proper to common species and in what kind of places they all most fondly live and most deeply glow  and the recreation of the minde which is taken heereby cannot be but verie good and honest for they admonish and stir up a man to that which is comely and honest for flowers through their beautie varietie of colour and exquisite forme do bring to a liberall and gentle manly minde the remembrance of honestie comeliness and all kinds of vertues for it would be an unseemely and filthie thing as a certain wise man saith for him that doth looke upon and handle faire and beautiful things and who frequenteth and is conversant in faire and beautiful places to have his mind not faire but filthie and deformed  10 thus gerarde in the close of his introductory notice of the violetspeaking of things honesty comeliness and the like scarcely now recognized as desirable in the realm of england but having previously observed that violets are useful for the making of garlands for the head and posies to smell toin which last function i observe they are still pleasing to the british public and i found the children here only the other day munching a confection of candied violet leaves what pleasure the flower can still give us uncandied and unbound but in its own place and life i will try to trace through some of its constant laws  11 and first let us be clear that the native colour of the violet is violet and that the white and yellow kinds though pretty in their place and way are not to be thought of in generally meditating the flowers quality or power a white violet is to black ones what a black man is to white ones and the yellow varieties are i believe properly pansies and belong also to wild districts for the most part but the true violet which i have just now called black with gerarde the blacke or purple violet hath a great prerogative above others and all the nobler species of the pansy itself are of full purple inclining however in the ordinary wild violet to blue in the laws of fésole chap vii §§ 20 21 i have made this dark pansy the representative of purple pure the viola odorata of the link between that full purple and blue and the heathblossom of the link between that full purple and red the reader will do well as much as may be possible to him to associate his study of botany as indeed all other studies of visible things with that of painting but he must remember that he cannot know what violet colour really is unless he watch the flower in its early growth it becomes dim in age and dark when it is gatheredat least when it is tied in bunchesbut i am under the impression that the colour actually deadens alsoat all events no other single flower of the same quiet colour lights up the ground near it as a violet will the bright houndstongue looks merely like a spot of bright paint but a young violet glows like painted glass  12 which when you have once well noticed the two lines of milton and shakspeare which seem opposed will both become clear to you the said lines are dragged from hand to hand along their pages of pilfered quotations by the hack botanistswho probably never saw them nor anything else in shakspeare or milton in their livestill even in reading them where they rightly come you can scarcely recover their fresh meaning but none of the botanists ever think of asking why perdita calls the violet dim and milton glowing  perdita indeed calls it dim at that moment in thinking of her own love and the hidden passion of it unspeakable nor is milton without some purpose of using it as an emblem of love mourningbut in both cases the subdued and quiet hue of the flower as an actual tint of colour and the strange force and life of it as a part of light are felt to their uttermost  and observe also that both of the poets contrast the violet in its softness with the intense marking of the pansy milton makes the opposition directly            the pansy freaked with jet   the glowing violet  shakspeare shows yet stronger sense of the difference in the purple with loves wound of the pansy while the violet is sweet with loves hidden life and sweeter than the lids of junos eyes  whereupon we may perhaps consider with ourselves a little what the difference is between a violet and a pansy  13 is i say and was and is to comein spite of florists who try to make pansies round instead of pentagonal and of the wise classifying people who say that violets and pansies are the same thingand that neither of them are of much interest as for instance dr lindley in his ladies botany  violetssweet violets and pansies or heartsease represent a small family with the structure of which you should be familiar more however for the sake of its singularity than for its extent or importance for the family is a very small one and there are but few species belonging to it in which much interest is taken as the parts of the heartsease are larger than those of the violet let us select the former in preference for the subject of our study whereupon we plunge instantly into the usual account of things with horns and tails the stamens are five in numbertwo of them which are in front of the others are hidden within the horn of the front petal etc etc etc note in passing by the horn of the front petal he means the spur of the bottom one which indeed does stand in front of the restbut if therefore it is to be called the front petalwhich is the back one you may find in the next paragraph description of a singular conformation and the interesting conclusion that no one has yet discovered for what purpose this singular conformation was provided but you will not in the entire article find the least attempt to tell you the difference between a violet and a pansyexcept in one statementand that false the sweet violet will have no rival among flowers if we merely seek for delicate fragrance but her sister the heartsease who is destitute of all sweetness far surpasses her in rich dresses and gaudy colours the heartsease is not without sweetness there are sweet pansies scented and dog pansies unscentedas there are sweet violets scented and dog violets unscented what is the real difference  14 i turn to another scientific gentlemanmore scientific in form indeed mr grindonand find for another interesting phenomenon in the violet that it sometimes produces flowers without any petals and in the pansy that the flowers turn towards the sun and when many are open at once present a droll appearance looking like a number of faces all on the qui vive but nothing of the difference between them except something about stipules of which it is important to observe that the leaves should be taken from the middle of the stemthose above and below being variable  i observe however that mr grindon has arranged his violets under the letter a and his pansies under the letter b and that something may be really made out of him with an hour or twos work i am content however at present with his simplifying assurance that of violet and pansy together six species grow wild in britainor as some believe only fourwhile the analysts run the number up to fifteen  15 next i try loudons cyclopædia which through all its 700 pages is equally silent on the business and next mr baxters british flowering plants in the index of which i find neither pansy nor heartsease and only the calathian violet where on earth is calathia which proves on turning it up to be a gentian  16 at last i take my figuier but what should i do if i only knew english and find this much of clue to the matter  quest ce que cest que la pensée cette jolie plante appartient aussi ou genre viola mais à un section de ce genre en effet dans les pensées les pétales supérieurs et lateraux sont dirigés en haut linférieur seul est dirigé en bas et de plus le stigmate est urcéole globuleux  and farther this general description of the whole violet tribe which i translate that we may have its full value  the violet is a plant without a stem tigesee vol i p 154whose height does not surpass one or two decimetres its leaves radical or carried on stolons vol i p 158 are sharp or oval crenulate or heartshape its stipules are ovalacuminate or lanceolate its flowers of sweet scent of a dark violet or a reddish blue are carried each on a slender peduncle which bends down at the summit such is for the botanist the violet of which the poets would give assuredly another description  17 perhaps or even the painters or even an ordinary unbotanical human creature i must set about my business at any rate in my own way now as i best can looking first at things themselves and then putting this and that together out of these botanical persons which they cant put together out of themselves and first i go down into my kitchen garden where the path to the lake has a border of pansies on both sides all the way down with clusters of narcissus behind them and pulling up a handful of pansies by the roots i find them without stems indeed if a stem means a wooden thing but i should say for a lowgrowing flower quiet lankily and disagreeably stalky and thinking over what i remember about wild pansies i find an impression on my mind of their being rather more stalky always than is quite graceful and for all their fine flowers having rather a weedy and littery look and getting into places where they have no business see again vol i chap vi § 5  18 and now going up into my flower and fruit garden i find june 2nd 1881 halfpast six morning among the wild saxifrages which are allowed to grow wherever they like and the rock strawberries and francescas which are coaxed to grow wherever there is a bit of rough ground for them a bunch or two of pale pansies or violets i dont know well which by the flower but the entire company of them has a ragged jagged unpurposelike look extremelyi should saydemoralizing to all the little plants in their neighbourhood and on gathering a flower i find it is a nasty big thing all of a feeble blue and with two things like horns or thorns sticking out where its ears would be if the pansys frequently monkey face were underneath them which i find to be two of the leaves of its calyx out of place and at all events for their part therefore weedy and insolent  19 i perceive farther that this disorderly flower is lifted on a lanky awkward springless and yet stiff flowerstalk which is not round as a flowerstalk ought to be vol i p 155 but obstinately square and fluted with projecting edges like a pillar run thin out of an ironfoundry for a cheap railway station i perceive also that it has set on it just before turning down to carry the flower two little jaggy and indefinable leavestheir colour a little more violet than the blossom  these and such undeveloping leaves wherever they occur are called bracts by botanists a good word from the latin bractea meaning a piece of metal plate so thin as to crackle they seem always a little stiff like bad parchmentborn to come to nothinga sort of infinitesimal fairylawyers deed they ought to have been in my index at p 255 under the head of leaves and are frequent in flower structurenever as far as one can see of the smallest use they are constant however in the flowerstalk of the whole violet tribe  20 i perceive farther that this lanky flowerstalk bending a little in a crabbed broken way like an obstinate person tired pushes itself up out of a still more stubborn nondescript hollow angular dogseared gaspipe of a stalk with a section something like this  illustration  but no bigger than  illustration  with a quantity of illmade and illhemmed leaves on it of no describable leafcloth or texturenot cressic though the thing does altogether look a good deal like a quite uneatable old watercress not salvian for theres no look of warmth or comfort in them not cauline for theres no juice in them not dryad for theres no strength in them nor apparent use they seem only there as far as i can make out to spoil the flower and take the good out of my garden bed nobody in the world could draw them they are so mixed up together and crumpled and hacked about as if some illnatured child had snipped them with blunt scissors and an illnatured cow chewed them a little afterwards and left them proved for too tough or too bitter  21 having now sufficiently observed it seems to me this incongruous plant i proceed to ask myself over it m figuiers question questce cest quun pensée is this a violetor a pansyor a bad imitation of both  whereupon i try if it has any scent and to my much surprise find it has a full and soft onewhich i suppose is what my gardener keeps it for according to dr lindley then it must be a violet but according to m figuierlet me see do its middle petals bend up or down  i think ill go and ask the gardener what he calls it  22 my gardener on appeal to him tells me it is the viola cornuta but that he does not know himself if it is violet or pansy i take my loudon again and find there were fiftythree species of violets known in his days of which as it chances cornuta is exactly the last  horned violet i said the green things were like hornsbut what is one to say of or to do to scientific people who first call the spur of the violets petal horn and then its calyx points horns and never define a horn all the while  viola cornuta however let it be for the name does mean something and is not false latin but whether violet or pansy i must look farther to find out  23 i take the flora danica in which i at least am sure of finding whatever is done at all done as well as honesty and care can and look what species of violets it gives  nine in the first ten volumes of it four in their modern sequel that i know ofi have had no time to examine the last issues namely in alphabetical order with their present latin or tentative latin names and in plain english the senses intended by the hapless scientific people in such their tentative latin  1   viola arvensis   field violet                  no 1748  2        biflora    twoflowered                    46  3

keeping if we could passing over the varieties however for the present wholly  1 arvensis fieldviolet good  2 biflora a good epithet but in false latin it is to be our viola aurea golden pansy  3 canina dog not pretty but intelligible and by common use now classical must stay  4 hirta late latin slang for hirsuta and always used of nasty places or nasty people it shall not stay the species shall be our viola seclusamonks violetmeaning the kind of monk who leads a rough life like elijahs or the baptists or esausin another kind this violet is one of the loveliest that grows  5 mirabilis stays so marvellous enough truly not more so than all violets but i am very glad to hear of scientific people capable of admiring anything  6 montana stays so  7 odorata not distinctivenearly classical however it is to be our viola regina else i should not have altered it  8 palustris stays so  9 tricolor true but intolerable the flower is the queen of the true pansies to be our viola psyche  10 elatior only a variety of our already accepted cornuta  11 the last is i believe also only a variety of palustris its leaves i am informed in the text are either pubescentreticulatevenose subreniform or latocordaterepandocrenate and its stipules are ovateacuminatefimbriodenticulate i do not wish to pursue the inquiry farther  24 these ten species will include noting here and there a local variety all the forms which are familiar to us in northern europe except only twothese as it singularly chances being the viola alpium noblest of all the wild pansies in the world so far as i have seen or heard of themof which consequently i find no picture nor notice in any botanical work whatsoever and the other the rockviolet of our own yorkshire hills  we have therefore ourselves finally then twelve following species to study i give them now all in their accepted names and proper orderthe reasons for occasional difference between the latin and english name will be presently given  1   viola regina     queen violet  2        psyche     ophelias pansy  3        alpium     frenelis pansy  4        aurea      golden violet  5        montana    mountain violet  6

    rupestris  crag violet  25 we will try presently what is to be found out of useful or pretty concerning all these twelve violets but must first find out how we are to know which are violets indeed and which pansies  yesterday after finishing my list i went out again to examine viola cornuta a little closer and pulled up a full grip of it by the roots and put it in water in a washhand basin which it filled like a truss of green hay  pulling out two or three separate plants i find each to consist mainly of a jointed stalk of a kind i have not yet describedroughly some two feet long altogether accurately one 1 ft 10½ in another 1 ft 10 in another 1 ft 9 inbut all these measures taken without straightening and therefore about an inch short of the truth and divided into seven or eight lengths by clumsy joints where the mangled leafage is knotted on it but broken a little out of the way at each joint like a rheumatic elbow that wont come straight or bend farther andwhich is the most curious point of all in itit is thickest in the middle like a viper and gets quite thin to the root and thin towards the flower also the lengths between the joints are longest in the middle here i give them in inches from the root upwards in a stalk taken at random  1st nearest root   0¾  2nd                  0¾  3rd                  1½  4th                  1¾  5th                  3  6th                  4  7th                  3¼  8th                  3  9th                  2¼  10th                 1½                       1 ft 9¾ in  but the thickness of the joints and length of terminal flower stalk bring the total to two feet and about an inch over i dare not pull it straight or should break it but it overlaps my twofoot rule considerably and there are two inches besides of root which are merely underground stem very thin and wretched as the rest of it is merely root above ground very thick and bloated i begin actually to be a little awed at it as i should be by a green snakeonly the snake would be prettier the flowers also i perceive have not their two horns regularly set in but the five spiky calyxends stick out between the petalssometimes three sometimes four it may be all five up and downand produce variously fanged or forked effects feebly ophidian or diabolic on the whole a plant entirely mismanaging itselfreprehensible and awkward with taints of worse than awkwardness and clearly no true species but only a link2 and it really is as you will find presently a link in two directions it is half violet half pansy a cur among the dogs and a thoughtless thing among the thoughtful and being so it is also a link between the entire violet tribe and the runnerspease strawberries and the like whose glory is in their speed but a violet has no business whatever to run anywhere being appointed to stay where it was born in extremely contented if not secluded places halfhidden from the eyeno but desiring attention or extension or corpulence or connection with anybody elses family still less  illustration fig ii  26 and if at the time you read this you can run out and gather a true violet and its leaf you will find that the flower grows from the very ground out of a cluster of heartshaped leaves becoming here a little rounder there a little sharper but on the whole heartshaped and that is the proper and essential form of the violet leaf you will find also that the flower has five petals and being held down by the bent stalk two of them bend back and up as if resisting it two expand at the sides and one the principal grows downwards with its attached spur behind so that the front view of the flower must be some modification of this typical arrangement fig m for middle form now the statement above quoted from figuier § 16 means if he had been able to express himself that the two lateral petals in the violet are directed downwards fig ii a and in the pansy upwards fig ii c and that in the main is true and to be fixed well and clearly in your mind but in the real orders one flower passes into the other through all kinds of intermediate positions of petal and the plurality of species are of the middle type fig ii b3  27 next if you will gather a real pansy leaf you will find itnot heartshape in the least but sharp oval or spearshape with two deep cloven lateral flakes at its springing from the stalk which in ordinary aspect give the plant the haggled and draggled look i have been vilifying it for these and such as these leaflets at the base of other leaves balfours glossary are called by botanists stipules i have not allowed the word yet and am doubtful of allowing it because it entirely confuses the students sense of the latin stipula see above vol i chap viii § 27 doubly and trebly important in its connection with stipulor not noticed in that paragraph but readable in your large johnson we shall have more to say of it when we come to straw itself  28 in the meantime one may think of these things as stipulations for leaves not fulfilled or stumps or sumphs of leaves but i think i can do better for them we have already got the idea of crested leaves see vol i plate now on each side of a knights crest from earliest etruscan times down to those of the scalas the fashion of armour held among the nations who wished to make themselves terrible in aspect of putting cut plates or bracts of metal like dragons wings on each side of the crest i believe the custom never became norman or english it is essentially greek etruscan or italianthe norman and dane always wearing a practical cone see the coins of canute and the frank or english knights the severely plain beavered helmet the black princes at canterbury and henry vs at westminster are kept hitherto by the great fates for us to see but the southern knights constantly wore these lateral dragons wings and if i can find their special name it may perhaps be substituted with advantage for stipule but i have not wit enough by me just now to invent a term  29 whatever we call them the things themselves are throughout all the species of violets developed in the running and weedy varieties and much subdued in the beautiful ones and generally the pansies have them large with spearshaped central leaves and the violets small with heartshaped leaves for more effective decoration of the ground i now note the characters of each species in their above given order  30 i viola regina queen violet sweet violet viola odorata l flora danica and sowerby the latter draws it with golden centre and white base of lower petal the flora danica all purple it is sometimes altogether white it is seen most perfectly for setting off its colour in group with primroseand most luxuriantly so far as i know in hollows of the savoy limestones associated with the pervenche which embroiders and illumines them all over i believe it is the earliest of its race sometimes called martia march violet in greece and south italy even a flower of the winter    the spring is come the violets gone   the firstborn child of the early sun   with us she is but a winters flower   the snow on the hills cannot blast her bower   and she lifts up her dewy eye of blue   to the youngest sky of the selfsame hue    and when the spring comes with her host   of flowers that flower beloved the most   shrinks from the crowd that may confuse   her heavenly odour and virgin hues    pluck the others but still remember   their herald out of dim december   the morning star of all the flowers   the pledge of daylights lengthened hours   nor midst the roses eer forget   the virgin virgin violet4  3 it is the queen not only of the violet tribe but of all lowgrowing flowers in sweetness of scentvariously applicable and serviceable in domestic economythe scent of the lily of the valley seems less capable of preservation or use  but respecting these perpetual beneficences and benignities of the sacred as opposed to the malignant herbs whose poisonous power is for the most part restrained in them during their life to their juices or dust and not allowed sensibly to pollute the air i should like the scholar to reread pp 251 252 of vol i and then to consider with himself what a grotesquely warped and gnarled thing the modern scientific mind is which fiercely busies itself in venomous chemistries that blast every leaf from the forests ten miles round and yet cannot tell us nor even think of telling us nor does even one of its pupils think of asking it all the while how a violet throws off her perfumefar less whether it might not be more wholesome to treat the air which men are to breathe in masses by administration of valelilies and violets instead of charcoal and sulphur  the closing sentence of the first volume just now referred top254should also be reread it was the sum of a chapter i had in hand at that time on the substances and essences of plantswhich never got finishedand in trying to put it into small space it has become obscure the terms logically inexplicable meaning that no words or process of comparison will define scents nor do any traceable modes of sequence or relation connect them each is an independent power and gives a separate impression to the senses above all there is no logic of pleasure nor any assignable reason for the difference between loathsome and delightful scent which makes the fungus foul and the vervain sacred but one practical conclusion i who am in all final ways the most prosaic and practical of human creatures do very solemnly beg my readers to meditate namely that although not recognized by actual offensiveness of scent there is no space of neglected land which is not in some way modifying the atmosphere of all the worldit may be beneficently as heath and pineit may be malignantly as pontine marsh or brazilian jungle but in one way or another for good and evil constantly by day and night the various powers of life and death in the plants of the desert are poured into the air as vials of continual angels and that no words no thoughts can measure nor imagination follow the possible change for good which energetic and tender care of the wild herbs of the field and trees of the wood might bring in time to the bodily pleasure and mental power of man  32 ii viola psyche ophelias pansy  the wild heartsease of europe its proper colour an exquisitely clear purple in the upper petals gradated into deep blue in the lower ones the centre gold not larger than a violet but perfectly formed and firmly set in all its petals able to live in the driest ground beautiful in the coast sandhills of cumberland following the wild geranium and burnet rose and distinguished thus by its power of life in waste and dry places from the violet which needs kindly earth and shelter  quite one of the most lovely things that heaven has made and only degraded and distorted by any human interference the swollen varieties of it produced by cultivation being all gross in outline and coarse in colour by comparison  it is badly drawn even in the flora danica no 623 considered there apparently as a species escaped from gardens the description of it being as follows  viola tricolor hortensis repens flore purpureo et coeruleo cbp 199 i dont know what cbp means passim juxta villas  viola tricolor caule triquetro diffuso foliis oblongis incisis stipulis pinnatifidis linn systema naturæ 185  33 near the country farmsdoes the danish botanist meanthe more luxuriant weedy character probably acquired by it only in such neighbourhood and i suppose various confusion and degeneration possible to it beyond other plants when once it leaves its wild home it is given by sibthorpe from the trojan olympus with an exquisitely delicate leaf the flower described as triste et pallide violaceus but coloured in his plate full purple and as he does not say whether he went up olympus to gather it himself or only saw it brought down by the assistant whose lovely drawings are yet at oxford i take leave to doubt his epithets that this should be the only violet described in a flora græca extending to ten folio volumes is a fact in modern scientific history which i must leave the professor of botany and the dean of christ church to explain  34 the english varieties seem often to be yellow in the lower petals see sowerbys plate 1287 of the old edition crossed i imagine with viola aurea but see under viola rupestris no 12 the names also varying between tricolor and bicolorwith no note anywhere of the three colours or two colours intended  the old english names are manylove in idlenessmaking lysander as titania much wandering in mind and for a time mere kits run the street or run the woodcall me to you gerarde ch 299 sowerby no 178 with herb trinity from its three colours blue purple and gold variously blended in different countries three faces under a hood describes the english variety only said to be the ancestress of all the florists pansies but this i much doubt the next following species being far nearer the forms most chiefly sought for  35 iii viola alpina frenelis pansymy own name for it from gotthelfs freneli in ulric the farmer the entirely pure and noble type of the bernese maid wife and mother  the pansy of the wengern alp in specialty and of the higher but still rich alpine pastures full darkpurple at least an inch across the expanded petals i believe the mater violarum of gerarde and true black violet of virgil remaining in italian viola mammola gerarde ch 298  36 iv viola aurea golden violet biflora usually but its brilliant yellow is a much more definite characteristic and needs insisting on because there is a viola lutea which is not yellow at all named so by the garden florists my viola aurea is the rockviolet of the alps one of the bravest brightest and dearest of little flowers the following notes upon it with its summer companions a little corrected from my diary of 1877 will enough characterize it  june 7ththe cultivated meadows now grow only dandelionsin frightful quantity too but for wild ones primula bell gentian golden pansy and anemoneprimula farinosa in mass the pansy pointing and vivifying in a petulant sweet way and the bell gentian here and there deepening allas if indeed the sound of a deep bell among lighter music  counted in order i find the effectively constant flowers are eight5 namely  1 the golden anemone with richly cut large leaf primrose colour and in masses like primrose studded through them with bell gentian and dark purple orchis  2 the dark purple orchis with bell gentian in equal quantity say six of each in square yard broken by sparklings of the white orchis and the white grassflower the richest piece of colour i ever saw touched with gold by the geum  3 and 4 these will be white orchis and the grass flower6  5 geumeverywhere in deep but pure gold like pieces of greek mosaic  6 soldanella in the lower meadows delicate but not here in masses  7 primula alpina divine in the rock clefts and on the ledges changing the grey to purpleset in the dripping caves with  8 viola pertinaxpert i want a latin word for various studiesfailures allto express its saucy little stuckup way and exquisitely trim peltate leaf i never saw such a lovely perspective line as the pure front leaf profile impossible also to get the least of the spirit of its lovely dark brown fibre markings intensely golden these dark fibres just browning the petal a little between them  and again in the defile of gondo i find viola saxatilis name yet wantedin the most delicate studding of its round leaves like a small fern more than violet and bright sparkle of small flowers in the dark dripping hollows assuredly delights in shade and distilling moisture of rocks  i found afterwards a much larger yellow pansy on the yorkshire high limestones with vigorously black crowfoot marking on the lateral petals  37 v viola montana mountain violet  flora danica 1329 linnæus no 13 caulibus erectis foliis cordatolanceolatis floribus serioribus apetalis ie on erect stems with leaves long heartshape and its later flowers without petalsnot a word said of its earlier flowers which have got those unimportant appendages in the plate of the flora it is a very perfect transitional form between violet and pansy with beautifully firm and wellcurved leaves but the colour of blossom very pale in subalpinis norvegiæ passim all that we are told of it means i suppose in the lower alpine pastures of norway in the flora suecica p 306 habitat in lapponica juxta alpes  38 vi viola mirabilis flora danica 1045 a small and exquisitely formed flower in the balanced cinquefoil intermediate between violet and pansy but with large and superbly curved and pointed leaves it is a mountain violet but belonging rather to the mountain woods than meadows in sylvaticis in toten norvegiæ  loudon 3056 broadleaved germany  linnæus flora suecica 789 says that the flowers of it which have perfect corolla and full scent often bear no seed but that the later cauline blossoms without petals are fertile caulini vero apetali fertiles sunt et seriores habitat passim upsaliæ  i find this and a plurality of other species indicated by linnæus as having triangular stalks caule triquetro meaning i suppose the kind sketched in figure 1 above  39 vii viola arvensis field violet flora danica 1748 a coarse running weed nearly like viola cornuta but feebly lilac and yellow in colour in dry fields and with corn  flora suecica 791 under titles of viola tricolor and bicolor arvensis and herba trinitatis habitat ubique in sterilibus arvis planta vix datur in qua evidentius perspicitur generationis opus quam in hujus cavo apertoque stigmate  it is quite undeterminable among present botanical instructors how far this plant is only a rampant and overindulged condition of the true pansy viola psyche but my own scholars are to remember that the true pansy is full purple and blue with golden centre and that the disorderly field varieties of it if indeed not scientifically distinguishable are entirely separate from the wild flower by their scattered form and faded or altered colour i follow the flora danica in giving them as a distinct species  40 viii viola palustris marsh violet flora danica 83 as there drawn the most finished and delicate in form of all the violet tribe warm white streaked with red and as pure in outline as an oxalis both in flower and leaf it is like a violet imitating oxalis and anagallis  in the flora suecica the petalmarkings are said to be black in viola lactea a connected species sowerby 45 purple sowerbys plate of it under the name palustris is pale purple veined with darker and the spur is said to be honeybearing which is the first mention i find of honey in the violet the habitat given sandy and turfy heaths it is said to grow plentifully near croydon  probably therefore a violet belonging to the chalk on which nearly all herbs that grow wildfrom the grass to the bluebellare singularly sweet and pure i hope some of my botanical scholars will take up this question of the effect of different rocks on vegetation not so much in bearing different species of plants as different characters of each species7  41 ix viola seclusa monks violet hirta flora danica 618 in fruticetis raro a true wood violet full but dim in purple sowerby 894 makes it paler the leaves very pure and severe in the danish onelonger in the english clothed on both sides with short dense hoary hairs  also belongs to chalk or limestone only sowerby  x viola canina dog violet i have taken it for analysis in my two plates because its grace of form is too much despised and we owe much more of the beauty of spring to it in english mountain ground than to the regina  xi viola cornuta cow violet enough described already  xii viola rupestris crag violet on the high limestone moors of yorkshire perhaps only an english form of viola aurea but so much larger and so different in habitgrowing on dry breezy downs instead of in dripping cavesthat i allow it for the present separate name and number8  42 for the present i say all this work in proserpina being merely tentative much to be modified by future students and therefore quite different from that of deucalion which is authoritative as far as it reaches and will stand out like a quartz dyke as the sandy speculations of modern gossiping geologists get washed away  but in the meantime i must again solemnly warn my girlreaders against all study of floral genesis and digestion how far flowers invite or require flies to interfere in their family affairswhich of them are carnivorousand what forms of pestilence or infection are most favourable to some vegetable and animal growthslet them leave the people to settle who like as toinette says of the doctor in the malade imaginairey mettre le nez i observe a paper in the last contemporary review announcing for a discovery patent to all mankind that the colours of flowers were made to attract insects9 they will next hear that the rose was made for the canker and the body of man for the worm  43 what the colours of flowers or of birds or of precious stones or of the sea and air and the blue mountains and the evening and the morning and the clouds of heaven were given forthey only know who can see them and can feel and who pray that the sight and the love of them may be prolonged where cheeks will not fade nor sunsets die  44 and now to close let me give you some fuller account of the reasons for the naming of the order to which the violet belongs cytherides  you see that the uranides are as far as i could so gather them of the pure blue of the sky but the cytherides of altered bluethe first viola typically purple the second veronica pale blue with a peculiar light the third giulietta deep blue passing strangely into a subdued green before and after the full life of the flower  all these three flowers have great strangenesses in them and weaknesses the veronica most wonderful in its connection with the poisonous tribe of the foxgloves the giulietta alone among flowers in the action of the shielding leaves and the viola grotesque and inexplicable in its hidden structure but the most sacred of all flowers to earthly and daily love both in its scent and glow  now therefore let us look completely for the meaning of the two leading lines    sweeter than the lids of junos eyes   or cythereas breath  45 since in my present writings i hope to bring into one focus the pieces of study fragmentarily given during past life i may refer my readers to the first chapter of the queen of the air for the explanation of the way in which all great myths are founded partly on physical partly on moral factso that it is not possible for persons who neither know the aspect of nature nor the constitution of the human soul to understand a word of them naming the greek gods therefore you have first to think of the physical power they represent when horace calls vulcan avidus he thinks of him as the power of fire when he speaks of jupiters red right hand he thinks of him as the power of rain with lightning and when homer speaks of junos dark eyes you have to remember that she is the softer form of the rain power and to think of the fringes of the raincloud across the light of the horizon gradually the idea becomes personal and human in the doves eyes within thy locks10 and doves eyes by the river of waters of the song of solomon  46 or cythereas breaththe two thoughts of softest glance and softest kiss being thus together associated with the flower but note especially that the island of cythera was dedicated to venus because it was the chief if not the only greek island in which the purple fishery of tyre was established and in our own minds should be marked not only as the most southern fragment of true greece but the virtual continuation of the chain of mountains which separate the spartan from the argive territories and are the natural home of the brightest spartan and argive beauty which is symbolized in helen  47 and lastly in accepting for the order this name of cytherides you are to remember the names of viola and giulietta its two limiting families as those of shakspeares two most loving maidsthe two who love simply and to the death as distinguished from the greater natures in whom earthly love has its due part and no more and farther still from the greatest in whom the earthly love is quiescent or subdued beneath the thoughts of duty and immortality  it may be well quickly to mark for you the levels of loving temper in shakspeares maids and wives from the greatest to the least  48 1 isabel all earthly love and the possibilities of it held in absolute subjection to the laws of god and the judgments of his will she is shakspeares only saint queen catherine whom you might next think of is only an ordinary woman of trained religious temperher maid of honour gives wolsey a more christian epitaph  2 cordelia the earthly love consisting in diffused compassion of the universal spirit not in any conquering personally fixed feeling                    mine enemys dog   though he had bit me should have stood that night   against my fire  these lines are spoken in her hour of openest direct expression and are all cordelia  shakspeare clearly does not mean her to have been supremely beautiful in person it is only her true lover who calls her fair and fairestand even that i believe partly in courtesy after having the instant before offered her to his subordinate duke and it is only his scorn of her which makes france fully care for her    gods gods tis strange that from their cold neglect   my love should kindle to inflamed respect  had she been entirely beautiful he would have honoured her as a lover should even before he saw her despised nor would she ever have been so despisedor by her father misunderstood shakspeare himself does not pretend to know where her girlheart wasbut i should like to hear how a great actress would say the peace be with burgundy  3 portia the maidenly passion now becoming great and chiefly divine in its humility is still held absolutely subordinate to duty no thought of disobedience to her dead fathers intention is entertained for an instant though the temptation is marked as passing for that instant before her crystal strength instantly in her own peace she thinks chiefly of her loversshe is a perfect christian wife in a moment coming to her husband with the gift of perfect peace    never shall you lie by portias side   with an unquiet soul  she is highest in intellect of all shakspeares women and this is the root of her modesty her unlettered girl is like newtons simile of the child on the seashore her perfect wit and stern judgment are never disturbed for an instant by her happiness and the final key to her character is given in her silent and slow return from venice where she stops at every wayside shrine to pray  4 hermione fortitude and justice personified with unwearying affection she is penelope tried by her husbands fault as well as error  5 virgilia perfect type of wife and mother but without definiteness of character nor quite strength of intellect enough entirely to hold her husbands heart else she had saved him he would have left rome in his wrathbut not her therefore it is his mother only who bends him but she cannot save  6 imogen the ideal of grace and gentleness but weak enduring too mildly and forgiving too easily but the piece is rather a pantomime than play and it is impossible to judge of the feelings of st columba when she must leave the stage in half a minute after mistaking the headless clown for headless arlecchino  7 desdemona ophelia rosalind they are under different conditions from all the rest in having entirely heroic and faultless persons to love i cant class them thereforefate is too strong and leaves them no free will  8 perdita miranda rather mythic visions of maiden beauty than mere girls  9 viola and juliet love the ruling power in the entire character wholly virginal and pure but quite earthly and recognizing no other life than his own viola is however far the noblest juliet will die unless romeo loves her if he be wed the grave is like to be my wedding bed but viola is ready to die for the happiness of the man who does not love her faithfully doing his messages to her rival whom she examines strictly for his sake it is not in envy that she says excellently doneif god did all the key to her character is given in the least selfish of all lovers songs the one to which the duke bids her listen    mark it cesarioit is old and plain   the spinsters and the knitters in the sun   and the free maids that weave their thread with bones   do use to chaunt it  they the unconscious fates weaving the fair vanity of life with death and the burden of it is    my part of death no one so true   did share it  therefore she says in the great first scene was not this love indeed and in the less heeded closing one her heart then happy with the knitters in the sun    and all those sayings will i overswear   and all those swearings keep as true in soul   as doth that orbed continent the fire   that severs day from night  or at least did once sever day from nightand perhaps does still in illyria old england must seek new images for her loves from gas and electric sparksnot to say furnace fire  i am obliged by press of other work to set down these notes in cruel shortness and many a reader may be disposed to question utterly the standard by which the measurement is made it will not be found on reference to my other books that they encourage young ladies to go into convents or undervalue the dignity of wives and mothers but as surely as the sun does sever day from night it will be found always that the noblest and loveliest women are dutiful and religious by continual nature and their passions are trained to obey them like their dogs homer indeed loves helen with all his heart and restores her after all her naughtiness to the queenship of her household but he never thinks of her as penelopes equal or iphigenias practically in daily life one often sees married women as good as saints but rarely i think unless they have a good deal to bear from their husbands sometimes also no doubt the husbands have some trouble in managing st cecilia or st elizabeth of which questions i shall be obliged to speak more seriously in another place content at present if english maids know better by proserpinas help what shakspeare meant by the dim and milton by the glowing violet                                       chapter ii  pinguicula  written in early june 1881  1 on the rocks of my little stream where it runs or leaps through the moorland the common pinguicula is now in its perfectest beauty and it is one of the offshoots of the violet tribe which i have to place in the minor collateral groups of viola very soon and must not put off looking at it till next year  there are three varieties given in sowerby 1 vulgaris 2 greaterflowered and 3 lusitanica white for the most part pink or carnea sometimes but the proper colour of the family is violet and the perfect form of the plant is the vulgar one the largerflowered variety is feebler in colour and ruder in form the white spanish one however is very lovely as far as i can judge from sowerbys old sowerbys pretty drawing  the frequent one i shall usually thus translate vulgaris is not by any means so frequent as the queen violet being a true wildcountry and mostly alpine plant and there is also a real pinguicula alpina which we have not in england who might be the regina if the group were large enough to be reigned over but it is better not to affect royalty among these confused intermediate or dependent families  2 in all the varieties of pinguicula each blossom has one stalk only growing from the ground and you may pull all the leaves away from the base of it and keep the flower only with its bunch of short fibrous roots half an inch long looking as if bitten at the ends two flowers characteristicallythree and four very oftenspring from the same root in places where it grows luxuriantly and luxuriant growth means that clusters of some twenty or thirty stars may be seen on the surface of a square yard of boggy ground quite to its mind but its real glory is in harder life in the crannies of wellwetted rock  3 what i have called stars are irregular clusters of approximately or tentatively five aloeine ground leaves of very pale greenthey may be six or seven or more but always run into a rudely pentagonal arrangement essentially first trine with two succeeding above taken as a whole the plant is really a main link between violets and droseras but the flower has much more violet than drosera in the make of itspurred and fivepetaled11 and held down by the top of its bending stalk as a violet is only its upper two petals are not revertedthe calyx of a dark soppy green holding them down with its three front sepals set exactly like a strong trident its two backward sepals clasping the spur there are often six sepals four to the front but the normal number is five tearing away the calyx i find the flower to have been held by it as a lion might hold his prey by the loins if he missed its throat the blue petals being really campanulate and the flower best described as a dark bluebell seized and crushed almost flat by its own calyx in a rage pulling away now also the upper petals i find that what are in the violet the lateral and wellordered fringes are here thrown mainly on the lower largest petal near its origin and opposite the point of the seizure by the calyx spreading from this centre over the surface of the lower petals partly like an irregular shower of fine venetian glass broken partly like the wildflung medusa like embroidery of the white lucia12  4 the calyx is of a dark soppy green i said like that of sugary preserved citron the root leaves are of green just as soppy but pale and yellowish as if they were half decayed the edges curled up and as it were watershrivelled as ones fingers shrivel if kept too long in water and the whole plant looks as if it had been a violet unjustly banished to a bog and obliged to live therenot for its own sins but for some emperor pansys far away in the gardenin a partly boggish partly hoggish manner drenched and desolate and with something of demoniac temper got into its calyx so that it quarrels with and bites the corollasomething of gluttonous and greasy habit got into its leaves a discomfortable sensuality even in its desolation perhaps a penguinish life would be truer of it than a piggish the nest of it being indeed on the rock or morassy rockinvestiture like a seabirds on her rock ledge  5 i have hunted through seven treatises on botany namely loudons encyclopædia balfour grindon oliver baxter of oxford lindley ladies botany and figuer without being able to find the meaning of lentibulariaceæ to which tribe the pinguicula is said by them all except figuier to belong it may perhaps be in sowerby13 but these abovenamed treatises are precisely of the kind with which the ordinary scholar must be content and in all of them he has to learn this long worse than useless word under which he is betrayed into classing together two orders naturally quite distinct the butterworts and the bladderworts  whatever the name may meanit is bad latin there is such a word as lenticularisthere is no lentibularis and it must positively trouble us no longer14  the butterworts are a perfectly distinct groupwhether small or large always recognizable at a glance their proper latin name will be pinguicula plural pinguiculætheir english bogviolet or more familiarly butterwort and their french as at present grassette  the families to be remembered will be only five namely  1 pinguicula major the largest of the group as bog plants ireland may rightly claim the noblest of them which certainly grow there luxuriantly and not i believe with us their colour is however more broken and less characteristic than that of the following species  2 pinguicula violacea violetcoloured butterwort instead of vulgaris the common english and swiss kind above noticed  3 pinguicula alpina alpine butterwort white and much smaller than either of the first two families the spur especially small according to d 453 much rarer as well as smaller than the other varieties in southern europe in britain known only upon the moors of rosehaugh rossshire where the progress of cultivation seems likely soon to efface it grindon  4 pinguicula pallida pale butterwort from sowerbys drawing 135 vol iii it would appear to be the most delicate and lovely of all the group the leaves like those of other species but rather more delicate and pellucid reticulated with red veins and much involute in the margin tube of the corolla yellow streaked with red the streaks like those of a pansy the petals pale violet it much resembles villosa our minima no 5 in many particulars the stem being hairy and in the lower part the hairs tipped with a viscid fluid like a sundew but the villosa has a slender sharp spur and in this the spur is blunt and thick at the end since the hairy stem is not peculiar to villosa i take for her instead the epithet minima which is really definitive  the pale one is commonly called lusitanica but i find no direct notice of its portuguese habitation sowerbys plant came from blandford dorsetshire and grindon says it is frequent in ireland abundant in arran and extends on the western side of the british island from cornwall to cape wrath my epithet pallida is secure and simple wherever the plant is found  illustration fig iii  5 pinguicula minima least butterwort in d 1021 called villosa the scape of it being hairy i have not yet got rid of this absurd word scape meaning in botanists latin the flowerstalk of a flower growing out of a cluster of leaves on the ground it is a bad corruption of sceptre and especially false and absurd because a true sceptre is necessarily branched15 in proserpina when it is spoken of distinctively it is called virgula see vol i pp 146 147 151 152 the hairs on the virgula are in this instance so minute that even with a lens i cannot see them in the danish plate of which fig 3 is a rough translation into woodcut to show the grace and mien of the little thing the trine leaf cluster is characteristic and the folding up of the leaf edges the flower in the danish plate full purple abundant in east of finmark finland but always growing in marsh moss sphagnum palustre  6 i call it minima only as the least of the five here named without putting forward any claim for it to be the smallest pinguicula that ever was or will be in such sense only the epithets minima or maxima are to be understood when used in proserpina and so also every statement and every principle is only to be understood as true or tenable respecting the plants which the writer has seen and which he is sure that the reader can easily see liable to modification to any extent by wider experience but better first learned securely within a narrow fence and afterwards trained or fructified along more complex trellises  7 and indeed my readersat least my newly found readersmust note always that the only power which i claim for any of my books is that of being right and true as far as they reach none of them pretend to be kosmosesnone to be systems of positivism or negativism on which the earth is in future to swing instead of on its old wornout polesnone of them to be works of geniusnone of them to be more than all true work must be piousand none to be beyond the power of common peoples eyes16 ears and noses æsthetic they tell you that the world is so big and cant be made biggerthat you yourself are also so big and cant be made bigger however you puff or bloat yourself but that on modern mental nourishment you may very easily be made smaller they tell you that two and two are four that ginger is hot in the mouth that roses are red and smuts black not themselves assuming to be pious they yet assure you that there is such a thing as piety in the world and that it is wiser than impiety and not themselves pretending to be works of genius they yet assure you that there is such a thing as genius in the world and that it is meant for the light and delight of the world  8 into these repetitions of remarks on my work often made before i have been led by an unlucky author who has just sent me his book advising me that it is neither critical nor sentimental he had better have said in plain english without either judgment or feeling and in which nearly the first sentence i read issolomon with all his acuteness was not wise enough to  etc etc etc give the jews the british constitution i believe the man means he is not a whit more conceited than mr herbert spencer or mr goldwin smith or professor tyndallor any lively london apprentice out on a sunday but this general superciliousness with respect to solomon his proverbs and his politics characteristic of the modern cockney yankee and anglicised scot is a difficult thing to deal with for us of the old school who were well whipped when we were young and have been in the habit of occasionally ascertaining our own levels as we grew older and of recognizing that here and there somebody stood higher and struck harder  9 a difficult thing to deal with i feel more and more hourly even to the point of almost ceasing to write not only every feeling i have but of late even every word i use being alike inconceivable to the insolence and unintelligible amidst the slang of the modern london writers only in the last magazine i took up i found an article by mr goldwin smith on the jews of which the gistas far as it had anywas that we had better give up reading the bible and in the text of which i found the word tribal repeated about ten times in every page now if tribe makes tribal tube must make tubal cube cubal and gibe gibal and i suppose we shall next hear of tubal music cubal minerals and gibal conversation and observe how all this bad english leads instantly to blunder in thought prolonged indefinitely the jewish tribes are not separate races but the descendants of brothers the roman tribes political divisions essentially trine and the whole force of the word tribune vanishes as soon as the ear is wrung into acceptance of his lazy innovation by the modern writer similarly in the last elements of mineralogy i took up the first order of crystals was called tesseral the writer being much too fine to call them foural and too much bent on distinguishing himself from all previous writers to call them cubic  10 what simple schoolchildren and sensible schoolmasters are to do in this atmosphere of egyptian marsh which rains fools upon them like frogs i can no more with any hope or patience conceivebut this finally i repeat concerning my own books that they are written in honest english of good johnsonian lineage touched here and there with colour of a little finer or elizabethan quality and that the things they tell you are comprehensible by any moderately industrious and intelligent person and accurate to a degree which the accepted methods of modern science cannot in my own particular fields approach  11 of which accuracy the reader may observe for immediate instance my extrication for him from among the uvularias of these five species of the butterwort which being all that need be distinctly named and remembered do need to be first carefully distinguished and then remembered in their companionship so alike are they that gerarde makes no distinction among them but masses them under the general type of the frequent english one described as the second kind of his promiscuous group of sanicle which clusius calleth pinguicula not before his time remembered hath sundry small thick leaves fat and full of juice being broad towards the root and sharp towards the point of a faint green colour and bitter in taste out of the middest whereof sprouteth or shooteth up a naked slender stalke nine inches long every stalke bearing one flower and no more sometimes white and sometimes of a bluish purple colour fashioned like unto the common monkshoods he means larkspurs called consolida regalis having the like spur or larks heel attached thereto then after describing a third kind of saniclecortusa mathioli a largeleaved alpine primula he goes on these plants are strangers in england their natural country is the alpish mountains of helvetia they grow in my garden where they flourish exceedingly except butterwoort which groweth in our english squally wet groundssqually i believe here from squalidus though johnson does not give this sense but one of his quotations from ben

preparation of milk in common use among them some fresh leaves are laid upon a filter and milk yet warm from the reindeer is poured over them after passing quickly through the filter this is allowed to rest for one or two days until it becomes ascescent17 when it is found not to have separated from the whey and yet to have attained much greater tenacity and consistence than it would have done otherwise the laplanders and swedes are said to be extremely fond of this milk which when once made it is not necessary to renew the use of the leaves for we are told that a spoonful of it will turn another quantity of warm milk and make it like the first18 baxter vol iii no 209  14 in the same page i find quoted dr johnstons observation that when specimens of this plant were somewhat rudely pulled up the flowerstalk previously erect almost immediately began to bend itself backwards and formed a more or less perfect segment of a circle and so also if a specimen is placed in the botanic box you will in a short time find that the leaves have curled themselves backwards and now conceal the root by their revolution  i have no doubt that this elastic and wiry action is partly connected with the plants more or less predatory or flytrap character in which these curiously degraded plants are associated with drosera i separate them therefore entirely from the bladderworts and hold them to be a link between the violets and the droseraceæ placing them however with the cytherides as a subfamily for their beautiful colour and because they are indeed a grace and delight in ground which but for them would be painfully and rudely desolate                                       chapter iii  veronica  1 the corolla of the foxglove says dr lindley beginning his account of the tribe at page 195 of the first volume of his ladies botany is a large inflated body with its throat spotted with rich purple and its border divided obliquely into five very short lobes of which the two upper are the smaller its four stamens are of unequal length and its style is divided into two lobes at the upper end a number of long hairs cover the ovary which contains two cells and a great quantity of ovules  this sc information will show you what is the usual character of the foxglove tribe and you will find that all the other genera referred to it in books agree with it essentially although they differ in subordinate points it is chiefly a in the form of the corolla b in the number of the stamens c in the consistence of the rind of the fruit d in its form e in the number of the seeds it contains and f in the manner in which the sepals are combined that these differences consist  2 the enumerative letters are of my insertionotherwise the above sentence is word for word dr lindleysand it seems to me an interesting and memorable one in the history of modern botanical science for it appears from the tenor of it that in a scientific botanists mind six particulars at least in the character of a plant are merely subordinate pointsnamely    1 f the combination of its calyx   2 a the shape of its corolla   3 b the number of its stamens   4 d the form of its fruit   5 c the consistence of its shelland   6 e the number of seeds in it  abstracting then from the primary description all the six inessential points i find the three essential ones left are that the style is divided into two lobes at the upper end that a number of glandular hairs cover the ovary and that this latter contains two cells  3 none of which particulars concern any reasonable mortal looking at a foxglove in the smallest degree whether hairs which he cant see are glandular or bristlywhether the green knobs which are left when the purple bells are gone are divided into two lobes or two hundredand whether the style is split like a snakes tongue into two lobes or like a rogues into any numberare merely matters of vulgar curiosity which he needs a microscope to discover and will lose a day of his life in discovering but if any pretty young proserpina escaped from the plutonic durance of london and carried by the tubular process which replaces charons boat over the lune at lancaster cares to come and walk on the coniston hills in a summer morning when the eyebright is out on the high fields she may gather with a little help from brantwood garden a bouquet of the entire foxglove tribe in flower as it is at present defined and may see what they are like altogether  4 she shall gather first the euphrasy which makes the turf on the brow of the hill glitter as if with newfallen manna then from one of the blue clusters on the top of the garden wall the common bright blue speedwell and from the garden bed beneath a dark blue spire of veronica spicata then at the nearest opening into the wood a little foxglove in its first delight of shaking out its bells thenwhat next does the doctor saya snapdragon we must go back into the garden for thathere is a goodly crimson one

relations to their contentment  5 she has only one kind of flowersin her hand as botanical classification stands at present and whether the system be more rational or in any human sense more scientific which puts calceolaria and speedwell togetherand foxglove and euphrasy and runs them on one side into the mints and on the other into the nightshadesnaming them meanwhile some from diseases some from vermin some from blockheads and the rest anyhowor the method i am pleading for which teaches us watchful of their seasonable return and chosen abiding places to associate in our memory the flowers which truly resemble or fondly companion or in time kept by the signs of heaven succeed each other and to name them in some historical connection with the loveliest fancies and most helpful faiths of the ancestral worldproserpina be judge with every maid that sets flowers on brow or breastfrom thule to sicily  6 we will unbind our bouquet then and putting all the rest of its flowers aside examine the range and nature of the little blue cluster only  and firstwe have to note of it that the plan of the blossom in all the kinds is the same an irregular quatrefoil and irregular quatrefoils are of extreme rarity in flower form i dont myself know one except the veronica the cruciform vegetablesthe heaths the olives the lilacs the little tormentillas and the poppies are all perfectly symmetrical two of the petals indeed as a rule are different from the other two except in the heaths and thus a distinctly crosslet form obtained but always an equally balanced one while in the veronica as in the violet the blossom always refers itself to a supposed place on the stalk with respect to the ground and the upper petal is always the largest  the supposed place is often very suppositious indeedfor clusters of the common veronicas if luxuriant throw their blossoms about anywhere but the idea of an upper and lower petal is always kept in the flowers little mind  7 in the second place it is a quite open and flat quatrefoilso separating itself from the belled quadrature of the heath and the tubed and primroselike quadrature of the cruciferæ and both as a quatrefoil and as an open one it is separated from the foxgloves and snapdragons which are neither quatrefoils nor open but are cinqfoils shut up  8 in the third place open and flat though the flower be it is monopetalous all the four arms of the cross strictly becoming one in the centre so that though the blue foils look no less sharply separate than those of a buttercup or a cistus and are so delicate that one expects them to fall from their stalk if we breathe too neardo but lay hold of oneand at the touch the entire blossom is lifted from its stalk and may be laid in perfect shape on our paper before us as easily as if it had been a nicely madeup blue bonnet lifted off its stand by the milliner  i pause here to consider a little because i find myself mixing up two characteristics which have nothing necessary in their relationnamely the unity of the blossom and its coming easily off the stalk the separate petals of the cistus and cherry fall as easily as the foxglove drops its bellson the other hand there are monopetalous things that dont drop but hold on like the convoluta19 and make the rest of the tree sad for their dying i do not see my way to any systematic noting of decadent or persistent corolla but in passing we may thank the veronica for never allowing us to see how it fades20 and being always cheerful and lovely while it is with us  9 and for a farther specialty i think we should take note of the purity and simplicity of its floral blue not sprinkling itself with unwholesome sugar like a larkspur nor varying into coppery or turquoiselike hue as the forgetmenot but keeping itself as modest as a blue print pale in the most frequent kinds but pure exceedingly and rejoicing in fellowship with the grey of its native rocks the palest of all i think it will be well to remember as veronica clara the poor clare of veronicas i find this note on it in my diary  the flower of an exquisite greywhite like lichen or shaded hoarfrost or dead silver making the longweathered stones it grew upon perfect with a finished modesty of paleness as if the flower could be blue and would not for their sake laying its fine small leaves along in embroidery like anagallis tenellaindescribable in the tender feebleness of itafterwards as it grew dropping the little blossoms from the base of the spire before the buds at the top had blown gathered it was happy beside me with a little water under a stone and put out one pale blossom after another day by day  10 lastly and for a high worthiness in my estimate note that it is wild of the wildest and proud in pure descent of race submitting itself to no follies of the curbreeding florist its species though many resembling each other are severally constant in aspect and easily recognizable and i have never seen it provoked to glare into any gigantic impudence at a flower show fortunately perhaps it is scentless and so despised  11 before i attempt arranging its families we must note that while the corolla itself is one of the most constant in form and so distinct from all other blossoms that it may be always known at a glance the leaves and habit of growth vary so greatly in families of different climates and those born for special situations moist or dry and the like that it is quite impossible to characterize veronic or veronique vegetation in general terms one can say comfortably of a strawberry that it is a creeper without expecting at the next moment to see a steeple of strawberry blossoms rise to contradict uswe can venture to say of a foxglove that it grows in a spire without any danger of finding farther on a carpet of prostrate and entangling digitalis and we may pronounce of a buttercup that it grows mostly in meadows without fear of finding ourselves at the edge of the next thicket under the shadow of a buttercupbush growing into valuable timber but the veronica reclines with the lowly21 upon occasion and aspires with the proud is here the pleased companion of the groundivies and there the unrebuked rival of the larkspurs on the rocks of coniston it effaces itself almost into the film of a lichen it pierces the snows of iceland with the gentian and in the falkland islands is a whiteblossomed evergreen of which botanists are in dispute whether it be veronica or olive  12 of these many and various forms i find the manners and customs alike inconstant and this of especially singular in themthat the alpine and northern species bloom hardily in contest with the retiring snows while with us they wait till the spring is past and offer themselves to us only in consolation for the vanished violet and primrose as we farther examine the ways of plants i suppose we shall find some that determine upon a fixed season and will bloom methodically in june or july whether in abyssinia or greenland and others like the violet and crocus which are flowers of the spring at whatever time of the favouring or frowning year the spring returns to their country i suppose also that botanists and gardeners know all these matters thoroughly but they dont put them into their books and the clear notions of them only come to me now as i think and watch  13 broadly however the families of the veronica fall into three main divisionsthose which have round leaves lobed at the edge like ground ivy those which have small thymelike leaves and those which have long leaves like a foxgloves only smallernever more than two or two and a half inches long i therefore take them in these connections though without any bar between the groups only separating the regina from the other thymeleaved ones to give her due precedence and the rest will then arrange themselves into twenty families easily distinguishable and memorable  illustration fig iv  i have chosen for veronica regina

cognizant of the common aspect of greek and english flowers under the term english comprehending the saxon celtic norman and danish floras of the evergreen shrub alluded to in § 11 above the veronica decussata of the pacific which is a bushy evergreen with beautifully set crossleaves and white blossoms scented like olea fragrans i should like him only to read with much surprise and some incredulity in pinkertons or other entertaining travellers voyages  16 and of the families given he is to note for the common simple characteristic that they are quatrefoils referred to a more or less elevated position on a central stem and having in that relation the lowermost petal diminished contrary to the almost universal habit of other flowers to develope in such a position the lower petal chiefly that it may have its full share of light you will find nothing but blunder and embarrassment result from any endeavour to enter into further particulars such as the relation of the dissepiment with respect to the valves of the capsule etc etc since in the various species of veronica almost every kind of dehiscence may be observed c under v perfoliata 1936 an australian species sibthorpe gives the entire definition of veronica with only one epithet added to mine corolla quadrifida rotata laciniâ infimâ angustiore but i do not know what rotata here means as there is no appearance of revolved action in the petals so far as i can see  17 of the mythic or poetic significance of the veronica there is less to be said than of its natural beauty i have not been able to discover with what feeling or at what time its sacred name was originally given and the legend of s veronica herself is in the substance of it irrational and therefore incredible the meaning of the term rational as applied to a legend or miracle is that there has been an intelligible need for the permission of the miracle at the time when it is recorded and that the nature and manner of the act itself should be comprehensible in the scope there was thus quite simple need for christ to feed the multitudes and to appear to s paul but no need so far as human intelligence can reach for the reflection of his features upon a piece of linen which could be seen by not one in a million of the disciples to whom he might more easily at any time manifest himself personally and perfectly nor i believe has the story of s veronica ever been asserted to be other than symbolic by the sincere teachers of the church and even so far as in that merely explanatory function it became the seal of an extreme sorrow it is not easy to understand how the pensive fable was associated with a flower so familiar so bright and so popularly of good omen as the speedwell  18 yet the fact being actually so and this consecration of the veronica being certainly far more ancient and earnest than the faintly romantic and extremely absurd legend of the forgetmenot the speedwell has assuredly the higher claim to be given and accepted as a token of pure and faithful love and to be trusted as a sweet sign that the innocence of affection is indeed more frequent and the appointed destiny of its faith more fortunate than our inattentive hearts have hitherto discerned  19 and this the more because the recognized virtues and uses of the plant are real and manifold and the ideas of a peculiar honourableness and worth of life connected with it by the german popular name honourprize while to the heart of the british race the same thought is brought home by shakespeares adoption of the flowers welsh name for the faithfullest common soldier of his ideal king as a lovers pledge therefore it does not merely mean memoryfor indeed why should love be thought of as such at all if it need to promise not to forgetbut the blossom is significant also of the lovers best virtues patience in suffering purity in thought gaiety in courage and serenity in truth and therefore i make it worthily the clasping and

crowding of emotions but the economy of themif thus taught we had i repeat the ordering of our house and estate in our own hands i believe no manner of temperance in pleasure would be better rewarded than that of making our gardens gay only with common flowers and leaving those which needed care for their transplanted life to be found in their native places when we travelled so long as i had crocus and daisy in the spring roses in the summer and hollyhocks and pinks in the autumn i used to be myself independent of farther horticultureand it is only now that i am old and since pleasant travelling has become impossible to me that i am thankful to have the white narcissus in my borders instead of waiting to walk through the fragrance of the meadows of clarens and pleased to see the milkwort blue on my scythemown banks since i cannot gather it any more on the rocks of the vosges or in the divine glens of jura  2 among the losses all the more fatal in being unfelt brought upon us by the fury and vulgarity of modern life i count for one of the saddest the loss of the wish to gather a flower in travelling the other daywhether indeed a sign of some dawning of doubt and remorse in the public mind as to the perfect jubilee of railroad journey or merely a piece of the common daily flattery on which the power of the british press first depends i cannot judgebut for one or other of such motives i saw lately in some illustrated paper a pictorial comparison of oldfashioned and modern travel representing as the type of things passed away the outside passengers of the mail shrinking into huddled and silent distress from the swirl of a winter snowstorm and for type of the present elysian dispensation the inside of a firstclass saloon carriage with a beautiful young lady in the

chariotandfour with outriders and courier of ancient noblesse i will compare only the actual facts in the former and in latter years of my own journey from paris to geneva as matters are now arranged i find myself at half past eight in the evening waiting in a confused crowd with which i am presently to contend for a seat in the dim light and cigarstench of the great station of the lyons line making slow way through the hostilities of the platform in partly real partly weak politeness as may be i find the corner seats of course already full of prohibitory cloaks and umbrellas but manage to get a middle back one the net overhead is already surcharged with a bulging extra portmanteau so that i squeeze my desk as well as i can between my legs and arrange what wraps i have about my knees and shoulders follow a couple of hours of simple patience with nothing to entertain ones thoughts but the steady roar of the line under the wheels the blinking and dripping of the oil lantern and the more or less ungainly wretchedness and variously sullen compromises and encroachments of posture among the five other passengers preparing themselves for sleep the last arrangement for the night being to shut up both windows in order to effect with our six breaths a salutary modification of the night air  4 the banging and bumping of the carriages over the turntables wakes me up as i am beginning to doze at fontainebleau and again at sens and the trilling and thrilling of the little telegraph bell establishes itself in my ears and stays there trilling me at last into a shivering suspicious sort of sleep which with a few vaguely fretful shrugs and fidgets carries me as far as tonnerre where the quinze minutes darret revolutionize everything and i get a turn or two on the platform and perhaps a glimpse of the stars with promise of a clear morning and so generally keep awake past mont bard remembering the happy walks one used to have on the terrace under buffons tower and thence watching if perchance from the mouth of the high tunnel any film of moonlight may show the far undulating masses of the hills of citeaux but most likely one knows the place where the great old view used to be only by the sensible quickening of the pace as the train turns down the incline and crashes through the trenched cliffs into the confusion and high clattering vault of the station at dijon  5 and as my journey is almost always in the springtime the twisted spire of the cathedral usually shows itself against the first grey of dawn as we run out again southwards and resolving to watch the sunrise i fall more complacently asleepand the sun is really up by the time one has to change carriages and get morning coffee at macon and from amberieux through the jura valley one is more or less feverishly happy and thankful not so much for being in sight of mont blanc again as in having got through the nasty and gloomy night journey and then the sight of the rhone and the salève seems only like a dream presently to end in nothingness till covered with dust and feeling as if one never should be fit for anything any more one staggers down the hill to the hotel des bergues and sees the dirtied rhone with its new iron bridge and the smoke of a new factory exactly dividing the line of the aiguilles of chamouni  6 that is the journey as it is nowand as for me it must be except on foot since there is now no other way of making it but this was the way we used to manage it in old days  very early in continental transits we had found out that the family travelling carriage taking much time and ingenuity to load needing at the least three usually fourhorses and on alpine passes six not only jolted and lagged painfully on bad roads but was liable in every way to more awkward discomfitures than lighter vehicles getting itself jammed in archways wrenched with damage out of ruts and involved in volleys of justifiable reprobation among market stalls so when we knew better my father and mother always had their own oldfashioned light twohorse carriage to themselves and i had one made with any quantity of front and side pockets for books and picked up stones and hung very low with a fixed sidestep which i could get off or on with the horses at the trot and at any rise or fall of the road relieve them and get my own walk without troubling the driver to think of me  7 thus leaving paris in the bright spring morning when the seine glittered gaily at charenton and the arbres de judée were mere pyramids of purple bloom round villeneuvestgeorges one had an afternoon walk among the rocks of fontainebleau and next day we got early into sens for new lessons in its cathedral aisles and the first saunter among the budding vines of the coteaux i finished my plate of the tower of giotto for the seven lamps in the old inn at sens which dickens has described in his wholly matchless way in the last chapter of mrs lirripers lodgings the next day brought us to the oolite limestones at mont bard and we always spent the sunday at the bell in dijon monday the drive of drives through the village of genlis the fortress of auxonne and up the hill to the vinesurrounded town of dole whence behold at last the limitless ranges of jura south and north beyond the woody plain and above them the derniers kochers and the white squareset summit worshipped ever anew then at poligny the same afternoon we gathered the first milkwort for that year and on tuesday at st laurent the wild lily of the valley and on wednesday at morez gentians  and on thursday the eighth or ninth day from paris days all spent patiently and well one saw from the gained height of jura the great alps unfold themselves in their chains and wreaths of incredible crest and cloud  8 unhappily during all the earliest and usefullest years of such travelling i had no thought of ever taking up botany as a study feeling well that even geology which was antecedent to painting with me could not be followed out in connection with art but under strict limits and with sore shortcomings it has only been the later discovery of the uselessness of old scientific botany and the abominableness of new as an element of education for youthand my certainty that a true knowledge of their native flora was meant by heaven to be one of the first heartpossessions of every happy boy and girl in flowerbearing lands that have compelled me to gather into system my fading memories and wandering thoughts25 and of course in the diaries written at places of which i now want chiefly the details of the flora i find none and in this instance of the milkwort whose name i was first told by the chamouni guide joseph couttet then walking with me on the unperilous turf of the first rise of the vosges west of strasburg and rebuking me indignantly for my complaint that being then thirtyseven years old and not yet able to draw the great plain and distant spire it was of no use trying in the poor remainder of life to do anything seriousthen and there i say for the first time examining the strange little flower and always associating it since with the limestone crags of alsace and burgundy i dont find a single note of its preferences or antipathies in other districts and cannot say a word about the soil it chooses or the height it ventures or the familiarities to which it condescends on the alps or apennines  9 but one thing i have ascertained of it lately at brantwood that it is capricious and fastidious beyond any other little blossom i know of in laying out the rock garden most of the terrace sides were trusted to remnants of the natural slope propped by fragments of stone among which nearly every other wild flower that likes sun and air is glad sometimes to root itself but at the top of all one terrace was brought to mathematically true level of surface and slope of side and turfed with delicately chosen and adjusted sods meant to be kept duly trim by the scythe and only on this terrace does the giulietta choose to show herselfand even there not in any consistent places but gleaming out here in one year there in another like little bits of unexpected sky through cloud and entirely refusing to allow either bank or terrace to be mown the least trim during her time of disport there so spared and indulged there are no more wayward things in all the woods or wilds no more delicate and perfect things to be brought up by watch through day and night than her recumbent clusters trickling sometimes almost gushing through the grass and meeting in tiny pools of flawless blue  10 i will not attempt at present to arrange the varieties of the giulietta for i find that all the larger and presumably characteristic forms belong to the cape and only since mr froude came back from his african explorings have i been able to get any clear idea of the brilliancy and associated infinitude of the cape flowers if i could but write down the substance of what he has told me in the course of a chat or two which have been among the best privileges of my recent stay in london prolonged as it has been by recurrence of illness it would be a better summary of what should be generally known in the natural history of southern plants than i could glean from fifty volumes of horticultural botany in the meantime everything being again thrown out of gear by the aforesaid illness i must let this piece of proserpina break off as most of my work doesand as perhaps all of it may soon doleaving only suggestion for the happier research of the students who trust me thus far  11 some essential points respecting the flower i shall note however before ending there is one large and frequent species of it of which the flowers are delicately yellow touched with tawny red forming one of the chief elements of wild foreground vegetation in the healthy districts of hard alpine limestone26 this is i believe the only european type of the large cape varieties in all of which judging from such plates as have been accessible to me the crests or fringes of the lower petal are less conspicuous than in the smaller species and the flower almost takes the aspect of a broomblossom or peaseblossom in the smaller european varieties the white fringes of the lower petal are the most important and characteristic part of the flower and they are among european wild flowers absolutely without any likeness of associated structure the fringes or crests which towards the origin of petals so often give a frosted or gemmed appearance to the centres of flowers are here thrown to the extremity of the petal and suggest an almost coralline structure of blossom which in no other instance whatever has been imitated still less carried out into its conceivable varieties of form how many such varieties might have been produced if these fringes of the giulietta or those already alluded to of lucia nivea had been repeated and enlarged as the type once adopted for complex bloom in the thistlehead is multiplied in the innumerable gradations of thistle teasel hawkweed and aster we might have had flowers edged with lace finer than was ever woven by mortal fingers or tasselled and braided with fretwork of silver never tarnishedor hoarfrost that grew brighter in the sun but it was not to be and after a few hints of what might be done in this kind the fate or folly or on recent theories the extreme fitnessand consequent survival of the thistles and dandelions entirely drives the fringed lucias and blueflushing milkworts out of common human neighbourhood to live recluse lives with the memories of the abbots of cluny and pastors of piedmont  12 i have called the giulietta blueflushing because it is one of the group of exquisite flowers which at the time of their own blossoming breathe their colour into the surrounding leaves and supporting stem very notably the grape hyacinth and jura hyacinth and some of the vestals empurpling all their green leaves even to the ground a quite distinct nature in the flower observe this possession of a power to kindle the leaf and stem with its own passion from that of the heaths roses or lilies where the determined bracts or calicos assert themselves in opposition to the blossom as little pineleaves or mosses or brown paper packages and the like  13 the giulietta however is again entirely separate from the other leafflushing blossoms in that after the two green leaves next the flower have glowed with its blue while it lived they do not fade or waste with it but return to their own former green simplicity and close over it to protect the seed i only know this to be the case with the giulietta regina but suppose it to be with variety of course in the colours a condition in other speciesthough of course nothing is ever said of it in the botanical accounts of them i gather however from curtiss careful drawings that the prevailing colour of the cape species is purple thus justifying still further my placing them among the cytherides and i am content to take the descriptive epithets at present given them for the following five of this southern group hoping that they may be explained for me afterwards by helpful friends  14 bracteolata c 345 oppositifolia c 492 speciosa c 1790 these three all purple and scarcely distinguishable from sweet peaseblossom only smaller  stipulacea c 1715 small and very beautiful lilac and purple with a leaf and mode of growth like rosemary the foxtail milkwort whose name i dont accept c 1006 is intermediate between this and the next species  15 mixta c 1714 i dont see what mingling is meant except that it is just like erica tetralix in the leaf only apparently having little fourpetalled pinks for blossoms this appearance is thus botanically explained i do not myself understand the description but copy it thinking it may be of use to somebody the apex of the carina is expanded into a twolobed plain petal the lobes of which are emarginate this appendix is of a bright rose colour and forms the principal part of the flower the describer relaxes or relapses into common language so far as to add that this appendix dispersed among the green foliage in every part of the shrub gives it a pretty lively appearance  perhaps this may also be worth extracting  carina deeply channeled of a saturated purple within sides folded together so as to include and firmly embrace the style and stamens which when arrived at maturity upon being moved escape elastically from their confinement and strike against the two erect petals or alæby which the pollen is dispersed  stem shrubby with long flexile branches length or height not told i imagine like an ordinary heaths  the term carina occurring twice in the above description is peculiar to the structure of the pease and milkworts we will examine it afterwards the european varieties of the milkwort except the chamæbuxus are all minuteand their ordinary epithets being at least inoffensive i give them for reference till we find prettier ones altering only the calcarea because we could not have a chalk juliet and two varieties of the regina changed for reason goodher name according to the last modern refinements of grace and ease in pronunciation being euvularis var genuina my readers may more happily remember her and her sister as follows  16 i giulietta regina pure blue the same in colour form and size throughout europe  ii giulietta sororreginæ pale reddishblue or white in the flower and smaller in the leaf otherwise like the regina  iii giulietta depressa the smallest of those i can find drawings of flowers blue lilac in the fringe and no bigger than pins heads the leaves quite gemlike in minuteness and order  iv giulietta cisterciana its present name calcarea is meant in botanic latin to express its growth on limestone or chalk mountains but we might as well call the south down sheep calcareous mutton my epithet will rightly associate it with the burgundian hills round cluny and citeaux its ground leaves are much larger than those of the depressa the flower a little larger but very pale  v giulietta austriaca pink and very lovely with bold cluster of ground leaves but itself minutealmost dwarf called small bitter milkwort by s how far distinct from the next following one norwegian is not told  the above five kinds are given by sowerby as british but i have never found the austriaca myself  vi giulietta amara norwegian very quaint in blossom outline like a little blue rabbit with long ears d 1169  17 nobody tells me why either this last or no 5 have been called bitter and gerardes five kinds are distinguished only by colourblue red white purple and the dark of an overworn illfavoured colour which maketh it to differ from all others of his kind i find no account of this illfavoured one elsewhere the white is my soror reginæ the red must be the austriaca but the purple and overworn ones are perhaps now overworn indeed all of them must have been more common in gerardes time than now for he goes on to say milkwoort is called ambarualis flos so called because it doth specially flourish in the crosse or gangweeke or rogationweeke of which flowers the maidens which use in the countries to walk the procession do make themselves garlands and nosegaies in english we may call it crosse flower gang flower rogation flower and milkwoort  18 above at page 197 vol i in first arranging the cytherides i too hastily concluded that the ascription to this plant of helpfulness to nursing mothers was more than ordinarily false thinking that its rarity could never have allowed it to be fairly tried if indeed true or in any degree true the flower has the best right of all to be classed with the cytherides and we might have as much of it for beauty and for service as we choose if we only took half the pains to garnish our summer gardens with living and lifegiving blossom that we do to garnish our winter gluttonies with dying and useless ones  19 i have said nothing of root or fruit or seed having never had the hardness of heart to pull up a milkwort clusternor the chance of watching one in seedthe pretty thing vanishes as it comes like the blue sky of april and leaves no sign of itselfthat i ever found the botanists tell me that its fruit dehisces loculicidally which i suppose is botanic for splits like boxes but boxes shouldnt split and didnt as we used to make and handle them before railways out of the split boxes fall seedstoo few and as aforesaid the plant never seems to grow again in the same spot i should thankfully receive any notes from friends happy enough to live near milkwort banks on the manner of its nativity  20 meanwhile the thistle and the nettle and the dock and the dandelion are cared for in their generations by the finest arts ofprovidence shall we say or of the spirits appointed to punish our own want of providence may i ask the reader to look back to the seventh chapter of the first volume for it contains suggestions of thoughts which came to me at a time of very earnest and faithful inquiry set down i now see too shortly under the press of reading they involved but intelligible enough if they are read as slowly as they were written and especially note the paragraph of summary of p 121 on the power of the earth mother as mother and as judge watching and rewarding the conditions which induce adversity and prosperity in the kingdoms of men comparing with it carefully the close of the fourth chapter p 8527 which contains for the now recklessly multiplying classes of artists and colonists truths essential to their skill and inexorable upon their labour  21 the pendrawing facsimiled by mr allen with more than his usual care in the frontispiece to this number of proserpina was one of many executed during the investigation of the schools of gothic german and later french which founded their minor ornamentation on the serration of the thistle leaf as the greeks on that of the acanthus but with a consequent and often morbid love of thorny points and insistance upon jagged or knotted intricacies of stubborn vegetation which is connected in a deeply mysterious way with the gloomier forms of catholic asceticism28  22 but also in beginning proserpina i intended to give many illustrations of the light and shade of foreground leaves belonging to the nobler groups of thistles because i thought they had been neglected by ordinary botanical draughtsmen not knowing at that time either the original drawings at oxford for the flora græca or the nobly engraved plates executed in the close of the last century for the flora danica and flora londinensis the latter is in the most difficult portraiture of the larger plants even the more wonderful of the two and had i seen the miracles of skill patience and faithful study which are collected in the first and second volumes published in 1777 and 1798 i believe my own work would never have been undertaken29 such as it is however i may still health being granted me persevere in it for my own leaf and branch studies express conditions of shade which even these most exquisite botanical plates ignore and exemplify uses of the pen and pencil which cannot be learned from the inimitable fineness of line engraving the frontispiece to this number for instance a seeding head of the commonest fieldthistle of our london suburbs copied with a steel pen on smooth grey paper and the drawing softly touched with white on the nearer thorns may well surpass the effect of the plate  23 in the following number of proserpina i have been tempted to follow with more minute notice than usual the conditions of adversity which as they fret the thistle tribe into jagged malice have humbled the beauty of the great domestic group of the vestals into confused likenesses of the dragonweed and nettle but i feel every hour more and more the necessity of separating the treatment of subjects in proserpina from the microscopic curiosities of recent botanic illustration nor shall this work close if my strength hold without fulfilling in some sort the effort begun long ago in modern painters to interpret the grace of the larger blossoming trees and the mysteries of leafy form which clothe the swiss precipice with gentleness and colour with softest azure the rich horizons of england and italy                                       chapter v  brunella  1 it ought to have been added to the statements of general law in irregular flowers in chapter i of this volume § 6 that if the petals while brought into relations of inequality still retain their perfect petal formand whether broad or narrow extended or reduced remain clearly leaves as in the pansy pea or azalea and assume no grotesque or obscure outlinethe flower though injured is not to be thought of as corrupted or misled but if any of the petals lose their definite character as such and become swollen solidified stiffened or strained into any other form or function than that of petals the flower is to be looked upon as affected by some kind of constant evil influence and so far as we conceive of any spiritual power being concerned in the protection or affliction of the inferior orders of creatures it will be felt to bear the aspect of possession by or pollution by a more or less degraded spirit30  2 i have already enough spoken of the special manifestation of this character in the orders contorta and satyrium vol i p 91 and the reader will find the parallel aspects of the draconidæ dwelt upon at length in the 86th and 87th paragraphs of the queen of the air where also their relation to the labiate group is touched upon but i am far more embarrassed by the symbolism of that group which i called vestales from their especially domestic character and their serviceable purity but which may be with more convenience perhaps simply recognizable as menthæ  3 these are to our northern countries what the spicebearing trees are in the tropicsour thyme lavender mint marjoram and their like separating themselves not less in the health giving or strengthening character of their scent from the flowers more or less enervating in perfume as the rose orange and violetthan in their humble colours and forms from the grace and splendour of those higher tribes thus allowing themselves to be summed under the general word balm more truly than the balsams from which the word is derived giving the most pure and healing powers to the air around them with a comfort of warmth also being mostly in dry places and forming sweet carpets and close turf but only to be rightly enjoyed in the open air or indoors when dried not tempting any one to luxury nor expressive of any kind of exultation brides do not deck themselves with thyme nor do we wreathe triumphal arches with mint  4 it is most notable also farther that none of these flowers have any extreme beauty in colour the blue sage is the only one of vivid hue at all and we never think of it as for a moment comparable to the violet or bluebell thyme is unnoticed beside heath and many of the other purple varieties of the group are almost dark and sad coloured among the flowers of summer while so far from gaining beauty on closer looking there is scarcely a blossom of them which is not more or less grotesque even to ugliness in outline and so hooded or lappeted as to look at first like some imperfect form of snapdragon for the most part spotted also wrinkled as if by old age or decay cleft or torn as if by violence and springing out of calices which in their clustering spines embody the general roughness of the plant  5 i take at once for example lest the reader should think me unkind or intemperate in my description a flower very dear and precious to me and at this time my chief comfort in field walks for now the reign of all the sweet reginas of the spring is overthe reign of the silvia and anemone of viola and veronica and at last and this year abdicated under tyrannous storm31 the reign of the rose and the last foxglovebells are nearly fallen and over all my fields and by the brooksides are coming up the burdock and the coarse and vainly white aster and the black knapweeds and there is only one flower left to be loved among the grassthe soft warmscented brunelle  6 prunell or brunellgerarde calls it and brunella rightly and authoritatively tournefort prunella carelessly linnæus and idly following him the moderns casting out all the meaning and help of its nameof which presently selfeheale gerarde and gray call it in englishmeaning that who has this plant needs no physician  7 as i look at it close beside me it seems as if it would reprove me for what i have just said of the poverty of colour in its tribe for the most glowing of violets could not be lovelier than each fine purple gleam of its hooded blossoms but their flush is broken and oppressed by the dark calices out of which they spring and their utmost power in the field is only of a saddened amethystine lustre subdued with furry brown and what is worst in the victory of the darker colour is the disorder of the scattered blossomsof all flowers i know this is the strangest in the way that here and there only in their cluster its bells rise or remain and it always looks as if half of them had been shaken off and the top of the cluster broken short away altogether  8 we must never lose hold of the principle that every flower is meant to be seen by human creatures with human eyes as by spiders with spider eyes but as the painter may sometimes play the spider and weave a mesh to entrap the heart so the beholder may play the spider when there are meshes to be disentangled that have entrapped his mind i take my lens thereforeto the little wonder of a brown wasps nest with bluewinged wasps in itand perceive therewith the following particulars  9 first that the blue of the petals is indeed pure and lovely and a little crystalline in texture but that the form and setting of them is grotesque beyond all wonder the two uppermost joined being like an old fashioned and enormous hood or bonnet and the lower one projecting far out in the shape of a cup or cauldron torn deep at the edges into a kind of fringe  looking more closely still i perceive there is a cluster of stiff white hairs almost bristles on the top of the hood for no imaginable purpose of use or decorationany more than a hearthbrush put for a helmetcrestand that as we put the flower full in front the lower petal begins to look like some threatening viperine or sharklike jaw edged with ghastly teethand yet more that the hollow within begins to suggest a resemblance to an open throat in which there are two projections where the lower petal joins the lateral ones almost exactly like swollen glands  i believe it was this resemblance inevitable to any careful and close observer which first suggested the use of the plant in throat diseases to physicians guided as in those first days of pharmacy chiefly by imagination then the german name for one of the most fatal of throat affections braune extended itself into the first name of the plant brunelle  10 the truth of all popular traditions as to the healing power of herbs will be tried impartially as soon as men again desire to lead healthy lives but i shall not in proserpina retain any of the names of their gathered and dead or distilled substance but name them always from the characters of their life i retain however for this plant its name brunella fr brunelle because we may ourselves understand it as a derivation from brune and i bring it here before the readers attention as giving him a perfectly instructive general type of the kind of degradation which takes place in the forms of flowers under more or less malefic influence causing distortion and disguise of their floral structure thus it is not the normal character of a flower petal to have a cluster of bristles growing out of the middle of it nor to be jagged at the edge into the likeness of a fanged fishs jaw nor to be swollen or pouted into the likeness of a diseased gland in an animals throat a really uncorrupted flower suggests none but delightful images and is like nothing but itself  11 i find that in the year 1719 tournefort defined with exactitude which has rendered the definition authoritative for all time the tribe to which this brownie flower belongs constituting them his fourth class and describing them in terms even more depreciatingly imaginative than any i have ventured to use myself i translate the passage vol i p 177  12 the name of labiate flower is given to a singlepetaled flower which beneath is attenuated into a tube and above is expanded into a lip which is either single or double it is proper to a labiate flowerfirst that it has a oneleaved calyx ut calycem habeat unifolium for the most part tubulated or reminding one of a paper hood cucullum papyraceum and secondly that its pistil ripens into a fruit consisting of four seeds which ripen in the calyx itself as if in their own seedvessel by which a labiate flower is distinguished from a personate one whose pistil becomes a capsule far divided from the calyx à calyce longò divisam and a labiate flower differs from rotate or bellshaped flowers which have four seeds in that the lips of a labiate flower have a gape like the face of a goblin or ludicrous mask emulous of animal form  13 this class is then divided into four sections      in the first the upper lip is helmeted or hookedgaleatum est vel     falcatum     in the second the upper lip is excavated like a spooncochlearis     instar est excavatum     in the third the upper lip is erect     and in the fourth there is no upper lip at all  the reader will i hope forgive me for at once rejecting a classification of lipped plants into three classes that have lips and one that has none and in which the lips of those that have got any are like helmets and spoons  linnaeus in 1758 grouped the family into two divisions by the form of the calyx fivefold or twofold and then went into the wildest confusion in distinction of speciessometimes by the form of corolla sometimes by that of calyx sometimes by that of the filaments sometimes by that of the stigma and sometimes by that of the seed as for instance thyme is to be identified by the calyx having hairs in its throat dead nettle by having bristles in its mouth lions tail by having bones in its anthers antheræ punctis osseis adspersæ and teucrium by having its upper lip cut in two  14 st hilaire in 1805 divides again into four sections but as three of these depend on form of corolla and the fourth on abortion of stamens the reader may conclude practically that logical division of the family is impossible and that all he can do or that there is the smallest occasion for his doing is first to understand the typical structure thoroughly and then to know a certain number of forms accurately grouping the others round them at convenient distances and finally to attach to their known forms such simple names as may be utterable by children and memorable by old people with more ease and benefit than the galeopsis eutetrahit lamium galeobdalon or scutellaria galericulataand the like of modern botany but to do this rightly i must review and amplify some of my former classification which it will be advisable to do in a separate chapter                                       chapter vi  monacha  1 it is not a little vexing to me in looking over the very little i have got done of my planned systema proserpinæ to discover a grave mistake in the specifications of veronica it is veronica chamædrys not officinalis which is our proper english speedwell and welsh fluellen and all the eighth paragraph p 74 properly applies to that veronica officinalis is an extremely small flower rising on vertical stems out of recumbent leaves and the drawing of it in the flora danica which i mistook for a stunted northern state is quite true of the english species32 except that it does not express the recumbent action of the leaves the proper representation of groundleafage has never yet been attempted in any botanical work whatever and as in recumbent plants their grouping and action can only be seen from above the plates of them should always have a dark and rugged background not only to indicate the position of the eye but to relieve the forms of the leaves as they were intended to be shown i will try to give some examples in the course of this year  2 i find also sorrowfully that the references are wrong in three if not more places in that chapter s 971 and 972 should be transposed in p 72 s 294 in p 74 should be 984 d 407 should be inserted after peregrina in p 76 and 203 in fourth line from bottom of p 78 should be 903 i wish it were likely that these errors had been corrected by my readersthe rarity of the flora danica making at present my references virtually useless but i hope in time that our public institutes will possess themselves of copies still more do i hope that some book of the kind will be undertaken by english artists and engravers which shall be worthy of our own country  3 farther i get into confusion by not always remembering my own nomenclature and have allowed gentianoides to remain for no 16 though i banish gentian it will be far better to call this eastern mountain species olympica according to sibthorpes localization in summâ parte nive solutâ montis olympi bithyni and the rather that curtiss plate above referred to shows it in luxuriance to be liker an asphodel than a gentian  4 i have also perhaps done wrong in considering veronica polita and agrestis as only varieties in no 3 no author tells me why the first is called polite but its blue seems more intense than that of agrestis and as it is above described with attention vol i p 75 as an example of precision in flowerform we may as well retain it in our list here it will be therefore our twentyfirst varietyit is loudons fiftyninth and last he translates polita simply polished which is nonsense i can think of nothing to call it but dainty and will leave it at present unchristened  5 lastly i cant think why i omitted v humifusa s 979 which seems to be quite one of the most beautiful of the familya mountain flower also and one which i ought to find here but hitherto i know only among the mantlings of the ground v thymifolia and officinalis all these however agree in the extreme prettiness and grace of their crowded leafagethe officinalis of which the leaves are shown much too coarsely serrated in s 984 forming carpets of finished embroidery which i have never yet rightly examined because i mistook them for st johns wort they are of a beautiful pointed oval form serrated so finely that they seem smooth in distant effect and covered with equally invisible hairs which seem to collect towards the edge in the variety hirsuta s 985  for the present i should like the reader to group the three flowers s 979 984 985 under the general name of humifusa and to distinguish them by a third epithet which i allow myself when in difficulties thus      v humifusa cærulea the beautiful blue one which resembles     spicata     v humifusa officinalis and     v humifusa hirsuta the last seems to me extremely interesting and i     hope to find it and study it carefully  by this arrangement we shall have only twentyone species to remember the one which chiefly decorates the ground again dividing into the above three  6 these matters being set right i pass to the business in hand which is to define as far as possible the subtle relations between the veronicas and draconidæ and again between these and the tribe at present called labiate in my classification above vol i p 200 the draconidæ include the nightshades but this was an oversight atropa belongs properly to the following class moiridæ and my draconids are intended to include only the two great families of personate and ringent flowers which in some degree resemble the head of an animal the representative one being what we call snapdragon but the french careless of its snapping power calfs muzzlemuflier muflande or muffle de veaurousseau lettres p 19  7 as i examine his careful and sensible plates of it i chance also on a bit of his text which extremely wise and generally useful i translate forthwith  i understand my dear that one is vexed to take so much trouble without learning the names of the plants one examines but i confess to you in good faith that it never entered into my plan to spare you this little chagrin one pretends that botany is nothing but a science of words which only exercises the memory and only teaches how to give plants names for me i know no rational study which is only a science of words and to which of the two i pray you shall i grant the name of botanistto him who knows how to spit out a name or a phrase at the sight of a plant without knowing anything of its structure or to him who knowing that structure very well is ignorant nevertheless of the very arbitrary name that one gives to the plant in such and such a country if we only gave to your children an amusing occupation we should miss the best half of our purpose which is in amusing them to exercise their intelligence and accustom them to attention before teaching them to name what they see let us begin by teaching them to see it that science forgotten in all educations ought to form the most important part of theirs i can never repeat it often enoughteach them never to be satisfied with words se payer de mots and to hold themselves as knowing nothing of what has reached no farther than their memories  8 rousseau chooses to represent his personees la mufflaude la linaire leuphraise la pediculaire la crêtedecoq lorobanche la cimbalaire la velvote la digitale giving plates of snapdragon foxglove and madonnaherb the cimbalaire and therefore including my entire class of draconidæ whether open or close throated but i propose myself to separate from them the flower which for the present i have called monacha but may perhaps find hereafter a better name this one which is the best latin i can find for a nun of the desert being given to it because all the resemblance either to calf or dragon has ceased in its rosy petals and they resemblethe lower ones those of the mountain thyme and the upper one a softly crimson cowl or hood  9 this beautiful mountain flower at present by the good grace of botanists known as pedicularis from a disease which it is supposed to give to sheep is distinguished from all other draconidæ by its beautifully divided leaves while the flower itself like as aforesaid thyme in the three lower petals rises in the upper one quite upright and terminates in the narrow and peculiar hood from which i have named it monacha  10 two deeper crimson spots with white centres animate the colour of the lower petals in our mountain kindmountain or morassit is vilely drawn in s 997 under the name of sylvatica translated procumbent as it is neither a wood flower nor a procumbent one33 and as its rosy colour is rare among morass flowers i shall call it simply monacha rosea  i have not the smallest notion of the meaning of the following sentence in supper lip of corolla not rostrate with the margin on each side furnished with a triangular tooth immediately below the apex but without any tooth below the middle why or when a lip is rostrate or has any tooth below the middle i do not know but the upper petal of the corolla is here a very close gathered hood with the style emergent downwards and the stamens all hidden and close set within  in this action of the upper petal and curve of the style the flower resembles the labiates34 and is the proper link between them and the draconidæ the capsule is said by s to be ovalovoid as eggs always are oval i dont feel farther informed by the epithet the capsule and seed both are of entirely indescribable shapes with any number of sidesvery foxglovelike and inordinately large the seeds of the entire family are ovoidsubtrigonouss  11 i find only two species given as british by s namely sylvatica and palustris but i take first for the regina the beautiful arctic species d 1105 flora suecica 555 rosecoloured in the stem pale pink in the flowers corollæ pallide incarnatæ the calices furry against the cold whence the present ugly name hirsuta only on the highest crests of the lapland alps  2 rosea d 225 there called sylvatica as by s presumably because in pascuis subhumidis non raræ beautifully drawn but as i have described it vigorously erect and with no decumbency whatever in any part of it root branched and enormous in proportion to plant and i fancy therefore must be good for something if one knew it but gerarde who calls the plant red rattle it having indeed much in common with the yellow rattle says it groweth in moist and moorish meadows the herbe is not only unprofitable but likewise hurtful and an infirmity of the meadows  3 palustris d 2055 s 996scarcely any likeness between the plates everywhere in the meadows according to d i leave the english name marsh monacha much doubting its being more marshy than others  12 i take next 4 and 5 two northern species lapponica d 2 and grönlandica d 1166 the first yellow the second red both beautiful the lap one has its divided leaves almost united into one lovely spearshaped single leaf the greenland one has its red hood much prolonged in front  6 ramosa also a greenland species yellow very delicate and beautiful three stems from one root but may be more or fewer i suppose  13 7 norvegica a beautifully clustered golden flower with thick stem d 30 the only locality given being the dovrefeldt alpina and flammea are the synonyms but i do not know it on the alps and it is no more flamecoloured than a cowslip  both the lapland and norwegian flowers are drawn with their stems wavy though uprighta rare and pretty habit of growth  14 8 suecica d 26 named awkwardly sceptrum carolinum in honour of charles xii it is the largest of all the species drawn in d and contrasts strikingly with 4 and 5 in the strict uprightness of its stem the corolla is closed at the extremity which is red the body of the flower pale yellow grows in marshy and shady woods near upsal linn flora suecica 553  the manylobed but united leaves at the root five or six inches long are irregularly beautiful  15 these eight species are all i can specify having no pictures of the others named by loudoneleven making nineteen altogether and i wish i could find a twentieth and draw them all but the reader may be well satisfied if he clearly know these eight the group they form is an entirely distinct one exactly intermediate between the vestals and draconids and cannot be rightly attached to either for it is draconid in structure and affinityvestal in formand i dont see how to get the connection of the three families rightly expressed without taking the draconidæ out of the groups belonging to the dark kora and placing them next the vestals with the monachæ between for indeed linaria and several other draconid forms are entirely innocent and beautiful and even the foxglove never does any real mischief like hemlock while decoratively it is one of the most precious of mountain flowers i find myself also embarrassed by my name of vestals because of the masculine groups of basil and thymus and i think it will be better to call them simply menthæ and to place them with the other cottagegarden plants not yet classed taking the easily remembered names mentha monacha draconida this will leave me a blank seventh place among my twelve orders at p 194 vol i which i think i shall fill by taking cyclamen and anagillis out of the primulaceæ and making a separate group of them these retouchings and changes are inevitable in a work confessedly tentative and suggestive only but in whatever state of imperfection i may be forced to leave proserpina it will assuredly be found up to the point reached a better foundation for the knowledge of flowers in the minds of young people than any hitherto adopted system of nomenclature  16 taking then this rearranged group mentha monacha and draconida as a sufficiently natural and convenient one i will briefly give the essentially botanical relations of the three families  mentha and monacha agree in being essentially hooded flowers the upper petal more or less taking the form of a cup helmet or hood which conceals the tops of the stamens of the three lower petals the lowest is almost invariably the longest it sometimes is itself divided again into two but may be best thought of as single and with the two lateral ones distinguished in the menthæ as the apron and the side pockets  plate xii represents the most characteristic types of the blossoms of menthæ in the profile and front views all a little magnified the upper two are white basil purple spottedgrowing here at brantwood always with two terminal flowers the two middle figures are the purplespotted dead nettle lamium maculatum and the two lower thyme but i have not been able to draw these as i wanted the perspectives of the petals being too difficult and inexplicable to the eye even in the flowers themselves without continually putting them in changed positions  17 the menthæ are in their structure essentially quadrate plants their stems are square their leaves opposite their stamens either four or two their seeds twocarpeled but their calices are fivesepaled falling into divisions of two and three and the flowers though essentially fourpetaled may divide either the upper or lower petal or both into two lobes and so present a sixlobed outline the entire plants but chiefly the leaves are nearly always fragrant and always innocent none of them sting none prick and none poison  18 the draconids easily recognizable by their aspect are botanically indefinable with any clearness or simplicity the calyx may be five or foursepaled the corolla five or fourlobed the stamens may be two four four with a rudimentary fifth or five with the two anterior ones longer than the other three the capsule may open by two three or four valvesor by pores the seeds generally numerous are sometimes solitary and the leaves may be alternate opposite or verticillate  19 thus licentious in structure they are also doubtful in disposition none that i know of are fragrant few useful many more or less malignant and some parasitic the following piece of a friends letter almost makes me regret my rescue of them from the dark kingdom of kora       and i find that the monacha rosea red rattle is its name besides     the ugly one is a perennial and several of the other draconidæ     foxglove etc are biennials born this year flowering and dying next     year and the size of roots is generally proportioned to the life of     plants except when artificial cultivation develops the root specially     as in turnips etc several of the draconidæ are parasites and suck     the roots of other plants and have only just enough of their own to     catch with the yellow rattle is one it clings to the roots of the     grasses and clovers and no cultivation will make it thrive without     them my authority for this last fact is grant allen but i have     observed for myself that the yellow rattle has very small white     sucking roots and no earth sticking to them the toothworts and broom     rapes are draconidæ i think and wholly parasites can it be that the     red rattle is the one member of the family that has proper pride and     is self supporting the others are mendicant orders we had what we     choose to call the dorcas flower show yesterday and we gave as usual     prizes for wild flower bouquets i tried to find out the local names of     several flowers but they all seemed to be called i dont know     maam i would not allow this name to suffice for the red poppy and i     said this red flower must be called somethingtell me what you     call it a few of the audience answered blind eyes is it because     they have to do with sleep that they are called blind eyesor because     they are dazzling  20 i think certainly from the dazzling which sometimes with the poppy scarlet geranium and nasturtium is more distinctly oppressive to the eye than a real excess of light  i will certainly not include among my rescued draconidæ the parasitic lathræa and orobanche and cannot yet make certain of any minor classification among those which i retainbut uniting bartsia with euphrasia i shall have in the main the three divisions digitalis linaria euphrasia and probably separate the moneyworts as links with veronica and rhinanthus as links with lathræa  and as i shall certainly be unable this summer under the pressure of resumed work at oxford to spend time in any new botanical investigations i will rather try to fulfil the promise given in the last number to collect what little i have been able hitherto to describe or ascertain respecting the higher modes of tree structure                                       chapter vii  science in her cells      the following chapter has been written six years it was delayed in     order to complete the promised clearer analysis of stemstructure     which after a great deal of chopping chipping and peeling of my oaks     and birches came to reverently hopeless pause what is here done may     yet have some use in pointing out to younger students how they may     simplify their language and direct their thoughts so as to attain in     due time to reverent hope  1 the most generally useful book to myself hitherto in such little time as i have for reading about plants has been lindleys ladies botany but the most rich and true i have yet found in illustration the histoire des plantes35 by louis figuier i should like those of my readers who can afford it to buy both these books the first named at any rate as i shall always refer to it for structural drawings and on points of doubtful classification while the second contains much general knowledge expressed with some really human intelligence and feeling besides some good and singularly just history of botanical discovery and the men who guided it the botanists indeed tell me proudly figuier is no authority but who wants authority is there nothing known yet about plants then which can be taught to a boy or girl without referring them to an authority  i for my own part care only to gather what figuier can teach concerning things visible to any boy or girl who live within reach of a bramble hedge or a hawthorn thicket and can find authority enough for what they are told in the sticks of them  2 if only he would or could tell us clearly that much but like other doctors though with better meaning than most he has learned mainly to look at things with a microscoperarely with his eyes and i am sorry to see on rereading this chapter of my own which is little more than an endeavour to analyze and arrange the statements contained in his second that i have done it more petulantly and unkindly than i ought but i cant do all the work over again nowmores the pity i have not looked at this chapter for a year and shall be sixty before i know where i ami find myself instead now sixtyfour  3 but i stand at once partly corrected in this second chapter of figuiers on the tige french from the latin tignum which authorities say is again from the sanscrit and means the thing hewn with an axe anyhow it is modern french for what we are to call the stem § 12 p 136  the tige then begins m louis is the axis of the ascending system of a vegetable and it is garnished at intervals with vital knots eyes from which spring leaves and buds disposed in a perfectly regular order the root presents nothing of the kind this character permits us always to distinguish in the vegetable axis what belongs really to the stem and what to the root  4 yes and that is partly a new idea to me for in this power of assigning their order for the leaves the stem seems to take a royal or commandant character and cannot be merely defined as the connexion of the leaf with the roots  in it is put the spirit of determination one cannot fancy the little leaf as it is born determining the point it will be born at the governing stem must determine that for it also the disorderliness of the root is to be noted for a condition of its degradation no less than its love and need of darkness  nor was i quite right above § 15 p 139 in calling the stem itself spiral it is itself a straightgrowing rod but one which as it grows lays the buds of future leaves round it in a spiral order like the basrelief on trajans column  i go on with figuier the next passage is very valuable  5 the tige is the part of plants which directed into the air supports and gives growing power to the branches the twigs the leaves and the flowers the form strength and direction of the tige depend on the part that each plant has to play among the vast vegetable population of our globe plants which need for their life a pure and oftenrenewed air are borne by a straight tige robust and tall when they have need only of a moist air more condensed and more rarely renewed when they have to creep on the ground or glide in thickets the tiges are long flexible and dragging if they are to float in the air sustaining themselves on more robust vegetables they are provided with flexible slender and supple tiges  6 yes but in that last sentence he loses hold of his main idea and to me the important onenamely the connexion of the form of stem with the quality of the air it requires and that idea itself is at present vague though most valuable to me a strawberry creeps with a flexible stem but requires certainly no less pure air than a woodfungus which stands up straight and in our own hedges and woods are the wild rose and honeysuckle signs of unwholesome air    and honeysuckle loved to crawl   up the lone crags and ruined wall   i deemed such nooks the sweetest shade   the sun in all his round surveyed  it seems to me in the nooks most haunted by honeysuckle in my own wood that the reason for its twining is a very feminine onethat it likes to twine and that all these whys and wherefores resolve themselves at last intowhat a modern philosopher of course cannot understandcaprice36  7 farther on figuier quoting st hilaire tells us of the creepers in primitive forestssome of them resemble waving ribands others coil themselves and describe vast spirals they droop in festoons they wind hither and thither among the trees they fling themselves from one to another and form masses of leaves and flowers in which the observer is often at a loss to discover on which plant each several blossom grows  for all this the real reasons will be known only when human beings become reasonable for except a curious naturalist or wistful missionary no christian has trodden the labyrinths of delight and decay among these garlands but men who had no other thought than how to cheat their savage people out of their gold and give them gin and smallpox in exchange but so soon as true servants of heaven shall enter these edens and the spirit of god enter with them another spirit will also be breathed into the physical air and the stinging insect and venomous snake and poisonous tree pass away before the power of the regenerate human soul  8 at length on the structure of the tige figuier begins his real work thus  a glance of the eye thrown on the section of a log of wood destined for warming permits us to recognize that the tige of the trees of our forests presents three essential parts which are in going from within to without the pith the wood and the bark the pith in french marrow forms a sort of column in the centre of the woody axis in very thick and old stems its diameter appears very little and it has even for a long time been supposed that the marrow ends by disappearing altogether from the stems of old trees but it does nothing of the sort37 and it is now ascertained by exact measures that its diameter remains sensibly invariable38 from the moment when the young woody axis begins to consolidate itself to the epoch of its most complete development  so far so good but what does he mean by the complete development of the young woody axis when does the axis become wooden and how far up the tree does he call it an axis if the stem divides into three branches which is the axis and is the pith in the trunk no thicker than in each branch  9 he proceeds to tell us the marrow is formed by a reunion of cellsyes and so is newgate and so was the bastille but what does it matter whether the marrow is made of a reunion of cells or cellars or walls or floors or ceilings i want to know whats the use of it why doesnt it grow bigger with the rest of the tree when does the tree consolidate itself when is it finally consolidated and how can there be always marrow in it when the weary frame of its age remains a mere scarred tower of war with the elements full of dust and bats  illustration fig 24  he will tell you if only you go on patiently thinks the reader he will not once your modern botanist gets into cells he stays in them hear how he goes onthis cell is a sort of sack this sack is completely closed sometimes it is empty sometimes itis fullno that would be unscientific simplicity sometimes it conceals a matter in its interior the marrow of young trees such as it is represented in figure 24 figuier figs 38 39 p 42 is nothing elseindeedthan an aggregation of cells which first of spherical form have become polyhedric by their increase and mutual compression  10 now these figures 38 and 39 which profess to represent this change show us sixteen oval cells such as at a fig 24 enlarged into thirteen larger and flattish hexagonsb placed at a totally different angle  and before i can give you the figure revised with any available accuracy i must know why or how the cells are enlarged and in what direction  do their walls lengthen laterally when they are empty or does the matière inside stuff them more out itself increased from what sources when they are full in either case during this change from circle to hexagon is the marrow getting thicker without getting longer if so the change in the angle of the cells is intentional and probably is so but the number of cells should have been the same and further the term hexagonal can only be applied to the section of a tubular cell as in honeycomb so that the floor and ceiling of our pith cell are left undescribed  11 having got thus much of partly conjectural idea of the mechanical structure of marrow here follows the solitary vital or mortal fact in the whole business given in one crushing sentence at the close  the medullary tissue first time of using this fine phrase for the marrowwhy cant he say marrowy tissuetissue moelleuse appears very early struck with atony atonic want of tone above all in its central parts and so ends all he has to say for the present about the marrow and it never appears to occur to him for a moment that if indeed the noblest trees live all their lives in a state of healthy and robust paralysis it is a distinction hitherto unheard of between vegetables and animals  12 two pages farther on however p 45 we get more about the marrow and of great interestto this effect for i must abstract and complete here instead of translating  the marrow itself is surrounded as the centre of an electric cable is by its guarding threadsthat is to say by a number of cords or threads coming between it and the wood and differing from all others in the tree  the entire protecting cylinder composed of them has been called the étui or needlecase of the marrow but each of the cords which together form this étui is itself composed of an almost infinitely delicate thread twisted into a screw like the common spring of a letterweigher or a jackinthebox but of exquisite fineness upon this two pages and an elaborate figure are given to these trachéestracheas the french call themand we are never told the measure of them either in diameter or length39 and still less the use of them  i collect however in my thoughts what i have learned thus far  13 a tree stem it seems is a growing thing cracked outside because its skin wont stretch paralysed inside because its marrow wont grow but which continues the process of its life somehow by knitted nerves without any nervous energy in them protected by spiral springs without any spring in them  stayi am going too fast that coiling is perhaps prepared for some kind of uncoiling and i will try if i cant learn something about it from some other booknoticing as i pause to think where to look the advantage of our english tongue in its pithy saxon word pith separating all our ideas of vegetable structure clearly from animal while the poor latin and french must use the entirely inaccurate words medulla and moelle all however concurring in their recognition of a vital power of some essential kind in this white cord of cells medulla sive illa vitalis anima est ante se tendit longitudinem impellens pliny of the vine liber x cap xxi vitalis animayesthat i accept but longitudinem impellens i pause at being not at all clear yet myself about any impulsive power in the pith40  14 however i take up first and with best hope dr asa gray who tells me art 211 that pith consists of parenchyma which is at first gorged with sap but that many stems expand so rapidly that their pith is torn into a mere lining or into horizontal plates and that as the stem grows older the pith becomes dry and light and is then of no farther use to the plant but of what use it ever was we are not informed and the doctor makes us his bow so far as the professed article on pith goes but farther on i find in his account of sapwood art 224 that in the germinating plantlet the sap ascends first through the parenchyma especially through its central portion or pith whereby we are led back to our old question what sap is and where it comes from with the now superadded question whether the young pith is a mere succulent sponge or an active power and constructive mechanism nourished by the abundant sap as columella has it  naturali enim spiritu omne alimentum virentis quasi quædam anima per medullam trunci veluti per siphonem trahitur in summum41  as none of these authors make any mention of a communication between the cells of the pith i conclude that the sap they are filled with is taken up by them and used to construct their own thickening tissue  15 next i take balfours structural botany and by his index under the word pith am referred to his articles 8 72 and 75 in article 8 neither the word pith nor any expression alluding to it occurs  in article 72 the stem of an outlaid tree is defined as consisting of pith fibrovascular and 42 woody tissue medullary rays bark and epidermis  a more detailed statement follows illustrated by a figure surrounded by twentythree lettersnamely two b s three c s four e s three f s one l four m s three p s one r and two v s  eighteen or twenty minute sputters of dots may with a good lens be discerned to proceed from this alphabet and to stop at various points or lose themselves in the texture of the represented wood and knowing now something of the matter beforehand guessing a little more and gleaning the rest with my finest glass i achieve the elucidation of the figure to the following extent explicable without letters at all by my more simple drawing figure 25  16 1 the inner circle full of little cells diminishing in size towards the outside represents the pith very large at this period of the growththe first year we are told in next page and very largehe means in proportion to the rest of the branch how large he does not say in his text but states in his note that the figure is magnified 26 diameters i have drawn mine by the more convenient multiplier of 30 and given the real size at b according to balfourbut without believing him to be right i never saw a maple stem of the first year so small  illustration fig 25  2 the black band with white dots round the marrow represents the marrowsheath  3 from the marrowsheath run the marrowrays dividing the vascular circle into numerous compact segments a ray cannot divide anything into a segment only a partition or a knife can do that but we shall find presently that marrow rays ought to be called marrowplates and are really mural forming more or less continuous partitions  4 the compact segments consist of woody vessels and of porous vessels this is the first we have heard of woody vessels he means the fibres ligneux of figuier and represents them in each compartment as at c fig 25 without telling us why he draws the woody vessels as radiating they appear to radiate indeed when wood is sawn across but they are really upright  5 a moist layer of greenish cellular tissue called the cambium layerblack in figure 25and he draws it in flat arches without saying why  6 7 8 three layers of bark called in his note endophloeum mesophloeum and epiphloeum with laticiferous vessels 43  9 epidermis the three layers of bark being separated by single lines i indicate the epidermis by a double one with a rough fringe outside and thus we have the parts of the section clearly visible and distinct for discussion so far as this first figure goeswithout wanting one letter of all his three and twenty  17 but on the next page this ingenious author gives us a new figure which professes to represent the same order of things in a longitudinal section and in retracing that order sideways instead of looking down he not only introduces new terms but misses one of his old layers in doing sothus  his order in explaining figure 96 contains as above nine members of the tree stem  but his order in explaining figure 97 contains only eight thus  1 the pith 2 medullary sheath circles  3 medullary ray  a radius  4 vascular zone with woody fibres not now vessels the fibres are composed of spiral annular pitted and other vessels  5 inner bark or liber with layer of cambium cells  6 second layer of bark or cellular envelope with laticiferous vessels  7 outer or tuberous layer of bark  8 epidermis  doing the best i can to get at the muddleheaded gentlemans meaning it appears by the lettering of his figure 97 my 25 above that the liber number 5 contains the cambium layer in the middle of it the part of the liber between the cambium and the wood is not marked in figure 96but the cambium is number 5 and the liber outside of it is number 6the endophloeum of his note  illustration fig 26  having got himself into this piece of lovely confusion he proceeds to give a figure of the wood in the second year which i think he has borrowed without acknowledgment from figuier omitting a piece of figuiers woodcut which is unexplained in figuiers text i will spare my readers the work i have had to do in order to get the statements on either side clarified but i think they will find if they care to work through the wilderness of the two authors wits that this which follows is the sum of what they have effectively to tell us with the collated list of the main questions they leave unansweredand worse unasked  18 an ordinary tree branch in transverse section consists essentially of three parts onlythe pith wood and bark  the pith is in full animation during the first yearthat is to say during the actual shooting of the wood we are left to infer that in the second year the pith of the then unprogressive shoot becomes collective only not formative and that the pith of the new shoot virtually energizes the new wood in its deposition beside the old one thus let a b figure 26 be a shoot of the first year and b c of the second the pith remains of the same thickness in both but that of the new shoot is i suppose chiefly active in sending down the new wood to thicken the old one which is collected however and fastened by the extending pithrays below you see i have given each shoot four fibres of wood for its own then the four fibres of the upper one send out two to thicken the lower the pithrays represented by the white transverse claws catch and gather all together mind i certify nothing of this to you but if this do not happenlet the botanists tell you what does  19 secondly the wood represented by these four lines is to be always remembered as consisting of fibres and vessels therefore it is called vascular a word which you may as well remember though rarely needed in familiar english with its roots vas a vase and vasculum a little vase or phial vascule may sometimes be allowed in botanical descriptions where cell is not clear enough thus at present we find our botanists calling the pith cellular but the wood vascular with i think the implied meaning that a vascule little or large is a long thing and has some liquid in it while a cell is a more or less round thing and to be supposed empty unless described as full but what liquid fills the vascules of the wood they do not tell us44 i assume that they absorb water as long as the tree lives  illustration fig 27  20 wood whether vascular or fibrous is however formed in outlaid plants first outside of the pith and then in shoots of the second year outside of the wood of the first and in the third year outside of the wood of the second so that supposing the quantity of wood sent down from the growing shoot distributed on a flat plane the structure in the third year would be as in figure 27 but since the new wood is distributed all round the stem in successive cords or threads if not at once the increase of substance after a year or two would be untraceable unless more shoots than one were formed at the extremity of the branch of actual bud and branch structure i gave introductory account long since in the fifth volume of modern painters45 to which i would now refer the reader but both then and today after twenty years further time allowed me i am unable to give the least explanation of the mode in which the wood is really added to the interior stem i cannot find even whether this is mainly done in springtime or in the summer and autumn when the young suckers form on the wood but my impression is that though all the several substances are added annually a little more pith going to the edges of the pithplates and a little more bark to the bark with a great deal more wood to the woodthere is a different or at least successive period for each deposit the carrying all these elements to their places involving a fineness of basket work or web work in the vessels which neither microscope nor dissecting tool can disentangle the result on the whole however is practically that we have outside the wood always a mysterious cambium layer and then some distinctions in the bark itself of which we must take separate notice  21 of cambium dr grays 220th article gives the following account it is not a distinct substance but a layer of delicate new cells full of sap the inner portion of the cambium layer is therefore nascent wood and the outer nascent bark as the cells of this layer multiply the greater number lengthen vertically into prosenchyma or woody tissue while some are transformed into ducts wood vessels and others remaining as parenchyma continue the medullary rays or commence new ones nothing is said here of the part of the cambium which becomes bark but at page 128 the thin walled cells of the bark are said to be those of ordinary parenchyma and in the next page a very important passage occurs which must have a paragraph to itself i close the present one with one more protest against the entirely absurd terms parenchyma for common cellular tissue prosenchyma for cellular tissue with longer cellscambium for an early state of both and diachyma for a peculiar position of one46 while the chemistry of all these substances is wholly neglected and we have no idea given us of any difference in pith wood and bark than that they are made of short or longyoung or oldcells  22 but in dr grays 230th article comes this passage of real value italics mineall while the newer layers of the wood abound in crude sap which they convey to the leaves those of the inner bark abound in elaborated sap which they receive from the leaves and convey to the cambium layer or zone of growth the proper juices and peculiar products of plants are accordingly found in the foliage and bark especially the latter in the bark therefore either of the stem or root medicinal and other principles are usually to be sought rather than in the wood nevertheless as the wood is kept in connection with the bark by the medullary rays many products which probably originate in the former are deposited in the wood  23 now at last i see my way to useful summary of the whole which i had better give in a separate chapter and will try in future to do the preliminary work of elaboration of the sap from my authorities above shown in its process to the reader without making so much fuss about it but i think in this case it was desirable that the floods of pros par peri dia and circumlocution through which one has to wade towards any emergent crag of fact in modern scientific books should for once be seen in the wasteful tide of them that so i might finally pray the younger students who feel or remember their disastrous sway to cure themselves for ever of the fatal habit of imagining that they know more of anything after naming it unintelligibly and thinking about it impudently than they did by loving sight of its nameless being and in wise confession of its boundless mystery                                       in rereading the text of this number i can secure my young readers of some things left doubtful as for instance in their acceptance of the word monacha for the flower described in the sixth chapter i have used it now habitually too long to part with it myself and i think it will be found serviceable and pleasurable by others neither shall i now change the position of the draconidae as suggested at p 118 but keep all as first planned see among other reasons for doing so the letter quoted in p 121  i also add to the plate originally prepared for this number one showing the effect of veronica officinalis in decoration of foreground merely by its green leaves see the paragraphs 1 and 5 of chapter vi i have not represented the fine serration of the leaves as they are quite invisible from standing height the book should be laid on the floor and looked down on without stooping to see the effect intended and so i gladly close this longlagging number hoping never to write such a tiresome chapter as this again or to make so long a pause between any readable one and its sequence                                       notes  1 vol i p 212 note  2 see deucalion vol ii chap i p 12 § 18  3 i am ashamed to give so rude

more of botany than i or have kindness enough to ascertain debateable things for me i mean in future to do sousing the letter a to signify amicus generally with acknowledgment by name when it is permitted of especial help or correction note first of this kind i find here on this word fivepetaled as applied to pinguicula qy twolipped it is monopetalous and monosepalous the calyx and corolla being each all in one piece  yes and i am glad to have the observation inserted but my term fivepetaled must stand for the question with me is always first not how the petals are connected but how many they are also i have accepted the term petalbut never the word lipas applied to flowers the generic term labiatæ is cancelled in proserpina vestales being substituted and these flowers when i come to examine them are to be described not as divided into two lips but into hood apron and sidepockets farther the depth to which either calyx or corolla is divided and the firmness with which the petals are attached to the torus may indeed often be an important part of the plants description but ought not to be elements in its definition three petaled and threesepaled fourpetaled and foursepaled fivepetaled and fivesepaled etc etc are essentialwith me primalelements of definition next whether resolute or stellar in their connection next whether round or pointed etc fancy for instance the fatality to a rose of pointing its petals and to a lily of rounding them but how deep cut or how hard holding is quite a minor question  farther that all plants are petaled and sepaled and never mere cups in saucers is a great fact not to be dwelt on in a note  12 our lucia nivea blanche lucy in present botany bog bean having no connection whatever with any manner of bean but only a

following three notes a must become a definitely and gratefully interpreted letter i am indebted for the first conclusive in itself but variously supported and confirmed by the two following to rj

which will be farther on useful to us to miss kemm the botanical lecturer at whitelands  1 there is no explanation of lentibulariaceæ in lindleys vegetable kingdom he was not great in that line the term is however taken from lenticula the lentil in allusion to the lentilshaped airbladders of the typical genus utricularia  the change of the c into b may possibly have been made only from some euphonic fancy of the contriver of the name who i think was rich  but i somewhat incline myself to think that the tibia a pipe or flute may have had something to do with it the tibia may possibly have been diminished into a little pipe by a stretch of licence and have become tibula but tibulus is a kind of pine tree in pliny when len tibula would be the lens or lentilshaped pipe or bladder i give you this only for what it is worth the lenticula as a derivation is reliable and has authority  lenticula a lentil a freckly eruption lenticularis lentilshaped so the nat ord ought to be if this be right lenticulariaceæ  2 botanic gardens chelsea feb 14 1882  lentibularia is an old generic name of tourneforts which has been superseded by utricularia but oddly enough has been retained in the name of the order lentibulareæ but it probably comes from lenticula which signifies the little root bladders somewhat resembling lentils  3 manual of scientific terms stormonth p 234 lentibulariaceæ neuter

century  29 see in the first volume the plates of sonchus arvensis and tussilago petasites in the second carduus tomentosus and picris echioides  30 for the sense in which this word is used throughout
