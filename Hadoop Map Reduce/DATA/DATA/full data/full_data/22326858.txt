in drawing up this little book at the request of several friends the author has been chiefly guided by experience of what children require to be told in order to come to an intelligent perception of the scope of the scripture narrative treated historically since a general view can hardly be obtained without brevity many events have been omitted in the earlier part and those only touched upon which have a peculiar significance in tracing the gradual preparation for the work of redemption and though one great object has been the illustration of prophecy the course of types has been passed over lest the plain narrative should be confused since types are rather subjects of devotional contemplation than of history and they should be perfectly comprehended as facts before being treated as allegorical  the next portion is little save an abridgement from prideauxs connexion taken in connection with the conclusions drawn by modern discoveries as detailed in mr g rawlinsons valuable edition of herodotus it is hoped that by thus filling up the interval between the new and old testaments that children may thus be fairly able to understand what they read in the gospels of the roman dominion the relation to herod the mutual hatred of the pharisees and sadducees and the enmity to the samaritans  the concluding lessons are offered with great diffidence and with many doubts whether the absence of detail may not prevent them from being easily remembered but it has been felt important that the connection of the actual church with that of the apostles and martyrs should be made evident to the general mind and the present condition of the church accounted for the choice of subjects has been very difficult but it is hoped that those selected may be those most needful to be known as evidence that our present church has every claim to the promise of him who will abide with her for ever  if older and more critical persons than those for whom the little work is intended should cast an eye over it the author hopes that they will bear in mind how the need of being both brief and clear is apt to render statements apparently bolder and sometimes harsher than where there is room for qualification or argument and that they will not always accuse the work of unthinking boldness of assertion where the softening is omitted for fear both of wearying and perplexing the young reader  the chronology for the sake of the convenience of teachers and scholars is that of the margin of our bibles  the questions at the end are chiefly intended to direct the mind of the learner to the point of each lesson it will be perceived that the answers must he prepared as well from the bible as from the book and in most cases the teacher will in use have to multiply and perhaps to simplify them one of their especial objects has been to show the ever brightening stream of prophecy and afterwards its accomplishment alike with regard to heathen nations to the history of the jews of the church and above all to the life of our blessed lord and it is hoped that those who examine into them cannot fail to be struck with the full and perfect accordance of the beginning with the end and if they learn no other lesson will have it impressed on them how the counsel of the lord endureth for ever  two tables have been added for the convenience of the scholar one giving the contemporary kings and prophets the other the course of historical chapters with as far as possible the prophetical didactic or poetical books of the same date ranged in parallel lines it is hoped that these may be found useful in arranging lessons for upper classes or pupil teachers  may 20th 1859       table of the books of holy scripture according to date    historical   books

lesson i   the promise  the creature was made subject unto vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hoperom viii 20  when the earth first came from the hand of god it was very good and man the best of all the beings it contained was subjected to a trial of obedience the fallen angel gained the ear of the woman and led her to disobey and to persuade her husband to do the same and that failure gave satan power over the world and over all adams children bringing sin and death upon the earth and upon all whether man or brute who dwelt therein  yet the merciful god would not give up all the creatures whom he had made to eternal destruction without a ray of hope and even while sentencing them to the punishment they had drawn on themselves he held out the promise that the seed of the woman should bruise the head of the serpent the devil and they were taught by the sight of sacrifices of animals that the death of the innocent might yet atone for the sin of the guilty though these creatures were not of worth enough really to bear the punishment for man  abels offering of the lamb proved his faith and thus was more worthy than cains gift of the fruits of the earth when cain in his envy slew his brother he and his children were cast off by god and those of his younger brother seth were accepted until they joined themselves to the ungodly daughters of cain and such sin prevailed that enoch the seventh from adam prophesied of judgment at hand before he was taken up alive into heaven when eight hundred and nine hundred years were the usual term of mens lives and the race was in full strength and freshness there was time for mind and body to come to great force and we find that the chief inventions of man belong to these sons of cainthe dwelling in tents workmanship in brass and iron and the use of musical instruments on the other hand the more holy of the line of seth handed on from one to the other the history of the blessed days of eden and of gods promise and lived upon hope and faith  noah whose father had been alive in the latter years of adams life was chosen from among the descendants of seth to be saved out of the general ruin of the corrupt earth and to carry on the promise his faith was first tried by the command to build the ark though for one hundred and twenty years all seemed secure without any token of judgment and the disobedient refused to listen to his preaching when the time came his own family of eight persons were alone found worthy to be spared from the destruction together with all the animals with them preserved in the ark two of each kind and a sevenfold number of those milder and purer animals which part the hoof and chew the cud and were already marked out as fit for sacrifice  it was the year 2348 bc that noah spent in floating upon the waste of waters while every living thing was perishing round him and afterwards in seeing the floods return to their beds in oceans lakes and rivers which they shall never again overpass  the ark first came aground on the mountain of ararat in armenia a sacred spot to this day and here god made his covenant with noah renewing his first blessing to adam permitting the use of animal food promising that the course of nature should never be disturbed again till the end of all things and making the glorious tints of the rainbow which are produced by sunlight upon water stand as the pledge of this assurance of man he required abstinence from eating the blood of animals and from shedding the blood of man putting as it were a mark of sacredness upon lifeblood so as to lead the mind on to the blood hereafter to be shed  soon a choice was made among the sons of noah ham mocked at his fathers infirmity while his two brothers veiled it and noah was therefore inspired to prophesy that canaan the son of the undutiful ham should be accursed and a servant of servants that shem should especially belong to the lord god and that japhets posterity should be enlarged and should dwell in the tents of shem thus shem was marked as the chosen yet with hope that japhet should share in his blessings  it seems as if ham had brought away some of the arts and habits of the giant sons of cain for in all worldly prosperity his sons had the advantage in 2247 b c the sons of men banded themselves together to build the tower of babel on the plain of shinar just below the hills of armenia where the two great rivers euphrates and tigris make the flats rich and fertile for their presumption god confounded their speech and the nations first were divided hams children got all the best regions nimrod the child of his son cush kept babel built the first city and became the first king canaans sons settled themselves in that goodliest of all lands which bore his name and mizraims children obtained the rich and beautiful valley of the nile called egypt all these were keen clever people builders of cities cultivators of the land weavers and embroiderers earnest after comfort and riches and utterly forgetting or grievously corrupting the worship of god others of the race seem to have wandered further south where the heat of the sun blackened their skins and their strong constitution and dull meek temperament marked them out to all future generations as a prey to be treated like animals of burden so as to bear to the utmost the curse of canaan  shems sons simpler than those of ham continued to live in tents and watch their cattle scattered about in the same plains called from the two great streams mesopotamia or the land of rivers some travelled westwards and settling in china and india became a rich and wealthy people but constantly losing more and more the recollection of the truth and some went on in time from isle to isle to the western hemispherelands where no other foot should tread till the world should be grown old  japhets children seemed at first the least favoured for no place save the cold dreary north was found for most of them some few the children of javan found a home in the fair isles of the mediterranean but the greater part were wild horsemen in northern asia and europe this was a dark and dismal training but it braced them so that in future generations they proved to have far more force and spirit than was to be found among the dwellers in milder climates     lesson ii  the patriarchs  the god of glory appeared unto our father abrahamacts vii 2  among the sons of shem called hebrews after his descendant heber who dwelt in mesopotamia was abram the good and faithful man whom god chose out to be the father of the people in whom he was going to set his light in the year 1921 he tried abrams faith by calling on him to leave his home and go into a land which he knew not but which should belong to his children after himabram who had no child at all  yet he obeyed and believed and was led into the beautiful hilly land then held by the sons of canaan where he was a stranger wandering with his flocks and herds and servants from one green pasture to another without a loot of land to call his own for showing his faith by thus doing as he was commanded abram was rewarded by the promise that in his seed should all the families of the earth be blessed his name was changed to abraham which means a father of a great multitude and as a sign that he had entered into a covenant with god he was commanded to circumcise his children  one son ishmael had by this time been born to him of the bondmaid hagar but the child of promise isaac the son of his wife sarah was not given till he was a hundred years old ishmael was cast out for mocking at his halfbrother the heir of the promises but in answer to his fathers prayers he too became the father of a great nation namely the arabs who still live in the desert with their tents their flocks herds and fine horses much as ishmael himself must have lived they are still circumcised and honour abraham as their father and with them are joined the midianites and other tribes descended from abrahams last wife keturah  isaac alone was to inherit the promise and it was renewed to him and to his father when their faith had been proved by their submission to gods command that isaac should be offered as a burntoffering upon mount moriah a sign of the great sacrifice long afterwards when god did indeed provide himself a lamb  when abraham bought the cave of machpelah for a burialplace it was in the full certainty that though he was now a stranger in the land it would be his childrens home and it was there that he and the other patriarchs were buried after their long and faithful pilgrimage  isaacs wife rebekah was fetched from abrahams former home in mesopotamia that he might not be corrupted by marrying a canaanite between his two sons esau and jacob there was again a choice for god had prophesied that the elder should serve the younger and esau did not value the birthright which would have made him heir to no lands that would enrich himself and to a faroff honour that he did not understand so despising the promises of god he made his right over to his brother for a little food when he was hungry and though he repented with tears when it was too late he could not win back what he had once thrown away  his revengeful anger when he found how he had been supplanted made jacob flee to his mothers family in mesopotamia and there dwell for many years ere returning to canaan with his large household there to live in the manner that had been ordained for the first heirs of the promise esau went away to mount seir to the south of the promised land and his descendants were called the edomites from his name meaning the red and so too the sea which washed their shores took the name of the sea of edom or the red sea they were also named kenites from his son kenaz their country afterwards called idumea was full of rocks and precipices and in these the edomites hollowed out caves for themselves making them most beautiful with pillars supporting the roof within and finelycarved entrances cut with borders flowers and scrolls so lasting that the cities of bosra and petra are still a wonder to travellers though they have been empty and deserted for centuries past the edomites did not at once lose the knowledge of the true god indeed as many believe of them was born the prophet job whom satan was permitted to try with every trouble he could conjure up so that his friends believed that such sufferings could only be brought on him for some great sin whereas he still maintained that the ways of god were hidden and gave utterance to one of the clearest ancient prophecies of the redeemer and the resurrection at length god answered him from the whirlwind and proclaimed his greatness through his unsearchable works and job for his patience in the time of adversity was restored to far more than his former prosperity  jacobs name was changed to israel which meant a prince before god and his whole family were taken into the covenant though the three elder sons for their crimes forfeited the foremost places which passed to judah and joseph and levi was afterwards chosen as the tribe set apart for the priesthood the number twelve being made up by reckoning ephraim and manasseh the sons of joseph as heads of tribes like their uncles long ago abraham had been told that his seed should sojourn in egypt and when the envious sons of israel sold their innocent brother joseph their sin was bringing about gods high purpose joseph was inspired to interpret pharaohs dreams which foretold the famine and when byandby his brothers came to buy the corn that he had laid up he made himself known forgave them with all his heart and sent them to fetch his father to see him once more then the whole family of israel seventy in number besides their wives came and settled in the land of goshen about the year 1707 and were there known by the name of hebrews after heber the greatgrandson of shem there in goshen jacob ended the days of his pilgrimage desiring his sons to carry his corpse back to the cave of machpelah there to be buried and await their return when the time of promise should come he gave his blessing to all his sons and was inspired to mark out joseph among them as the one whose children should have the choicest temporal inheritance but of the fourth son he said the sceptre shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come shiloh meant him that should be sent and judah was thus marked out to be the princely tribe which was to have the rule until the seed should come     lesson iii  egypt  when israel was a child then i loved him and called my son out of egypthosea xi 1  the country where the israelites had taken up their abode was the valley watered by the great river nile there is nothing but desert wherever this river does not spread itself for it never rains and there would be dreadful drought if every year when the snow melts upon the mountains far south where is the source of the stream it did not become so much swelled as to spread far beyond its banks and overflow all the flat space round it then as soon as the water subsides the hot sun upon the mud that it has left brings up most beautiful grass and fine crops of corn with seven or nine ears to one stalk grand fruits of all kinds melons pumpkins and cucumbers flax for weaving linen and everything that a people can desire indeed the water of the river is so delicious that it is said that those who have once tasted it are always longing to drink it again  the sons of mizraim son of ham who first found out this fertile country were a very clever race and made the most of the riches of the place they made dykes and ditches to guide the floodings into their fields and meadows they cultivated the soil till it was one beautiful garden they wove their flax into fine linen and they made bricks of their soft clay and hewed stone from the hills higher up the river so that their buildings have been the wonder of all ages since they had kings to rule them and priests to guide their worship but these priests had very wrong and corrupt notions themselves and let the poor ignorant people believe even greater folly than they did themselves  they thought that the great god lived among them in the shape of a bull with one spot on his back like an eagle and one on his tongue like a beetle and this creature they called apis and tended with the utmost care when he died they all went into mourning and lamented till a calf like him was found and was brought home with the greatest honour and for his sake all cattle were sacred and no one allowed to kill them besides the good power they thought there was an evil one as strong as the good and they worshipped him likewise to beg him to do them no harm so the dangerous crocodiles of the nile were sacred and it was forbidden to put them to death they had a doggod and a catgoddess and they honoured the beetle because they saw it rolling a ball of earth in which to lay its eggs and fancied it an emblem of eternity and thus all these creatures were consecrated and when they died were rolled up in fine linen and spices just as the egyptians embalmed their own dead  mummies as we call these embalmed egyptian corpses are often found now laid up in beautiful tombs cut out in the rock and painted in colours still fresh with picture writing called hieroglyphics telling in tokens all the history of the person whose body they contained the kings built tombs for themselves like mountains square at the bottom but each course of stones built within the last till they taper to a point at the top these are called pyramids and have within them very small narrow passages leading to a small chamber just large enough to hold a kings coffin  they had enormous idols hewn out of stone the head of one which you may see in the british museum is far taller than the tallest man and yet the face is really handsome and there are multitudes more both of them and of their temples still remaining on the banks of the nile the children of israel being chiefly shepherds kept apart from the egyptians at first but as time went on they learnt some of their habits and many of them had begun to worship their idols and forget the truth when their time of affliction came the king of egypt becoming afraid of having so numerous and rich a people settled in his dominions tried to keep them down by hard bondage and heavy labour he made them toil at his great buildings and oppressed them in every possible manner and when he found that they still throve and increased he made the cruel decree that every son who was born to them should be cast into the river  but man can do nothing against the will of god and this murderous ordinance proved the very means of causing one of these persecuted hebrew infants to be brought up in the palace of pharaoh and instructed in all the wisdom of the egyptians the only people who at that time had any human learning even in his early life moses seems to have been aware that he was to be sent to put an end to the bondage of his people for choosing rather to suffer with them than to live in prosperity with their oppressors he went out among them and tried to defend them and to set them at peace with one another but the time was not yet come and they thrust him from them so that he was forced to fly for shelter to the desert among the midianite descendants of abraham after he had spent forty years there as a shepherd god appeared to him and then first revealed himself as jehovah the name proclaiming his eternal selfexistence i am that i am a name so holy that the translators of our bible have abstained from repeating it where it occurs but have put the name the lord in capital letters in its stead moses was then sent to egypt to lead out the israelites on their way back to the land so long promised to their forefathers and when pharaoh obstinately refused to let them go the dreadful plagues and wonders that were sent on the country were such as to show that their gods were no gods since their river the glory of their land became a loathsome stream of blood creeping things came and went at the bidding of the lord and their adored cattle perished before their eyes at last on the night of the passover in each of the houses unmarked by the blood of the lamb there was a great cry over the death of the firstborn son and where the sign of faith was seen there was a mysterious obedient festival held by families prepared for a strange new journey then the hard heart yielded to terror and israel went oat of egypt as a nation they had come in in 1707 as seventy men they went out in 1491 as six hundred thousand and their enemies following after them sank like lead in the mighty waters of that arm of the red sea which had divided to let the chosen pass through     lesson iv  the wilderness  where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock where is he that put his holy spirit within himisaiah lxiii 11  when moses had led the 600000 men with their wives children and cattle beyond the reach of the egyptians they were in a small peninsula between the arms of the red sea with the wild desolate peaks of mount horeb towering in the midst and all around grim stony crags with hardly a spring of water and though there were here and there slopes of grass and bushes of hoaryleaved camelthorn and longspined shittim or acacia nothing bearing fruit for human beings there were strange howlings and crackings in the mountains the sun glared back from the arid stones and rocks and the change seemed frightful after the green meadows and broad river of egypt  frightened and faithless the israelites cried out reproachfully to moses to ask how they should live in this desert place forgetting that the pillar of cloud and fire proved that they were under the care of him who had brought them safely out of the hands of their enemies in his mercy god bore with their murmurs fed them with manna from heaven and water out of the flinty rock and gave them the victory over the edomite tribe of robber amalekites at rephidim where joshua fought and moses upheld by aaron and hur stretched forth his hands the whole day then fifty days after their coming out of egypt he called them round the peak of sinai to hear his own voice proclaim the terms of the new covenant  the covenant with abraham had circumcision for the token faith as the condition and the blessing to all nations as the promise this covenant remained in full force but in the course of the last four hundred years sin had grown so much that the old standard handed down from the patriarchs had been forgotten and men would not have known what was right nor how far they fell from it without a written law this law in ten rules all meeting together in teaching love to god and man commanded in fact perfection without which no man could be fit to stand in the sight of god he spoke it with his own mouth from amid cloud flame thunder and sounding trumpets on mount sinai while the israelites watched around in awe and terror unable to endure the dread of that presence the promise of this covenant was that if they would keep the law they should dwell prosperously in the promised land and be a royal priesthood and peculiar treasure unto god they answered with one voice all the words the lord hath said will we do and moses made a sacrifice and sprinkled them with the blood to consecrate them and confirm their oath it was the blood of the old testament then he went up into the darkness of the cloud on the mountain top there fasting to talk with god and to receive the two tables of stone written by the finger of god this was as some believe the first writing in the letters of the alphabet ever known in the world and the books of moses were the earliest ever composed and set down with the pen upon parchment  those laws were too strict for man in his fallen state keep them he could not breaking them he became too much polluted to be fit for mercy even while living in sight of the cloud on the mountain where moses was known to be talking with god the israelites lost faith and set up a golden calf in memory of the egyptian symbol of divinity making it their leader instead of moses such a transgression of their newlymade promise so utterly forfeited their whole right to the covenant that moses destroyed the precious tables the token of the mutual engagement and god threatened to sweep them off in a moment and to fulfil his oaths to their forefather in the children of moses alone then moses having purified the camp by slaying the worst offenders stood between the rest and the wrath of god mediating for them until he obtained mercy for them and a renewal of the covenant twice he spent forty days in that awful presence where glorious visions were revealed to him the courts of heaven itself to be copied by him by divine guidance in the ark and tabernacle where his brother aaron and his seed after him were to minister as priests setting forth to the eye how there was a holy place whence men were separated by sin and how it could only be entered by a high priest after a sacrifice of atonement every ordinance of this service was a shadow of good things to come and was therefore strictly enjoined on israel as part of the conditions of the covenant guiding their faith onwards by this acted prophecy and therewith god as king of his people put forth other commands some relating to their daily habits others to their government as a nation all tending to keep them separate from other nations for transgressions of such laws as these or for infirmities of human nature regarded as stains cleansing sacrifices were permitted for offences against the ten commandments there was no means of purchasing remission no animals nay no mans life could equal such a cost there was nothing for it but to try to dwell on the hope held out to adam and abraham and betokened by the sacrifices and the priesthood of some fuller expiation yet to come some means of not only obtaining pardon but of being worthy of mercy  the israelites could not even be roused to look for the present temporal promise and hankered after the fine soil and rich fruits of egypt rather than the beautiful land of hill and valley that lay before them and when their spies reported it to be full of hill forts held by canaanites of giant stature a cowardly cry of despair broke out that they would return to egypt only two of the whole host besides moses were ready to trust to him who had delivered them from pharaoh and had led them through the sea therefore those two alone of the grownup men were allowed to set foot in the promised land till all the rest should have fallen in the wilderness and a better race have been trained up god would not help them to take possession in their wilfulness they tried to advance and were defeated and thus were obliged to endure their forty years desert wandering  even moses had his patience worn out by their fretful faithlessness and committed an act of disobedience for which he was sentenced not to enter the land but to die on the borders after one sight of the promise of his fathers under him however began the work of conquest the rich pasture lands of gilead and basan were subdued and the tribes of reuben and gad and half the tribe of manasseh were permitted to take these as their inheritance though beyond the proper boundary the jordan the moabites took alarm though these as descended from abrahams nephew lot were to be left unharmed and their king balak sent as it appears even to mesopotamia for balaam a true prophet though a guilty man in hopes that he would bring down the curse of god on them balaam greedy of reward forced as it were consent from god to go to balak though warned that his words would not be in his own power as he stood on the hill top with balak vainly endeavouring to curse a glorious stream of blessing flowed from his lips revealing not only the fate of all the tribes around even for a thousand years but proclaiming the sceptre and star that should rise out of jacob to execute vengeance on his foes but finding himself unable to curse israel the miserable prophet devised a surer means of harming them he sent tempters among them to cause them to corrupt themselves and so effectual was this invention that the greater part of the tribe of simeon were ensnared and a great plague was sent in chastisement it was checked by the zeal of the young priest phineas under whose avenging hand so many of the guilty tribe fell that their numbers never recovered the blow then after a prayer of atonement a great battle was fought and the wretched balaam was among the slain  the forty years were over mosess time was come and he gave his last summing up of the covenant and sung his prophetic song his authority was to pass to his servant the faithful spy bearing the prophetic name of joshua and he was led by god to the top of mount nebo whence he might see in its length and breadth the pleasant land the free hills the green valleys watered by streams the wooded banks of jordan the pale blue expanse of the mediterranean joining with the sky to the west and to the north the snowy hills of hermon which sent their rain and dew on all the goodly mountain land it had been the hope of that old mans hundred and twenty years and he looked forth on it with his eye not dim nor his natural force abated but god had better things for him in heaven and there upon the mountain top he died alone and god buried him in the sepulchre whereof no man knoweth none was like to him in the old covenant who stood between god and the israelites but he left a promise that a prophet should be raised up like unto himself     lesson v  israel in canaan  but he was so merciful that he forgave their misdeeds and destroyed them notpsalm lxxviii 38  in the year 1431 joshua led the tribes through the divided waters of the jordan and received strength and skill to scatter the heathen before them conquer the cities and settle them in their inheritance  the land of canaan was very unlike egypt with its flat soil dry climate and single river it was a narrow strip inclosed between the mediterranean sea and the river jordan which runs due south down a steep wooded cleft into the dead sea the lowest water in the world in a sort of pit of its own with barren desolation all round it so as to keep in memory the ruin of the cities of the plain in the north rise the high mountains of libanus a spur from which goes the whole length of the land and forms two slopes whence the rivers flow either westward into the great sea or eastward into the jordan many of these hills are too dry and stony to be cultivated but the slopes of some have fine grassy pastures and the soil of the valleys is exceedingly rich bearing figs vines olive trees and corn in plenty wherever it is properly tilled with such hills rivers valleys and pastures it was truly a goodly land and when gods blessing was on it it was the fairest spot where man could live when the israelites entered it every hill was crowned by a stronglywalled and fortified town the abode of some little king of one of the seven canaanite nations who were given into their hands to be utterly destroyed though they were commanded to make a complete end of all the people in each place they took they were forbidden to seize more than they could till lest the empty ruins should serve as a harbour for wild beasts but they had their several lots marked out where they might spread when their numbers should need room as jacob had promised to joseph ephraim and half manaseh had the richest portion nearly in the middle and shiloh where the tabernacle was set up was in their territory judah and benjamin were in a very wild rocky part to the southwards between the two seas with only simeon beyond them then came north of manasseh the fine pasture lands of issachar and zebulon and a small border for asher between libanus and the sea while reuben gad and the rest of manasseh were to the east of the jordan where they had begged to settle themselves in the meadows of bashan and the balmy thickets of gilead  many a fortified town was still held by the canaanites in especial jebus on mount moriah between judah and benjamin and close to asher the two great merchant cities of the zidonians upon the seashore these were called tyre and zidon and their inhabitants were named phoenicians and were the chief sailors and traders of the old world from seeing a dogs mouth stained purple after eating a certain shellfish on their coast they had learnt how to dye woollen garments of a fine purple or scarlet which was thought the only colour fit for kings and these were sent out to all the countries round in exchange for balm and spices from gilead corn and linen from egypt ivory pearls and rubies from india gold from the beds of rivers in chittim or asia minor and silver from spain then called tarshish thus they grew very rich and powerful and were skilful in all they undertook the art of writing which they seem to have caught from the hebrews went from them to the greeks sons of japhet who lived more to the north in what were called the isles of the gentiles  the canaanites had a still fouler worship than the other sons of ham in egypt they had many gods whom they called altogether baalim or lords and goddesses whom they called ashtoreth and they thought that each had some one city or people to defend and that the lord jehovah of the israelites was such another as these instead of being the only god of heaven and earth among these there was one great baal to whom the phoenicians were devoted and an especial ashtoreth the moon or queen of heaven who was thought to have a lover named tammuz who died with the flowers in the autumn and revived in the spring and the women took delight in wailing and bemoaning his death and then dancing and offering cakes in honour of his revival besides these there was the planet saturn or as they called him moloch or remphan of whom they had a huge brazen statue with the hands held a little apart set up over a furnace they put poor little children between these brazen hands and left them to drop into the flames below as an offering to this dreadful god  well might such worship be called abomination and the israelites be forbidden to hold any dealings with those who followed it as long as the generation lived who had been bred up in the wilderness they obeyed and felt themselves under the rule of god their king who made his will known at shiloh by the signs on the breastplate of the high priest while judges and elders governed in the cities but afterwards they began to be tempted to make friends with their heathen neighbours and thus learnt to believe in their false deities and to hanker after the service of some god who made no such strict laws of goodness as those by which they were bound as certainly as they fell away so surely the punishment came and god stirred up some of these dangerous friends to attack them sometimes it was a canaanite tribe with iron chariots who mightily oppressed them sometimes the robber shepherds the midianites would burst in and carry off their cattle and their crops until distress brought the israelites back to a better mind and they cried out to the lord then he would raise up a mighty warrior and give him the victory so that he became ruler and judge over israel but no sooner was he dead than they would fall back again into idolatry and receive another chastisement repent and be again delivered this went on for about 400 years the israelites growing constantly worse in the latter part of this time their chief enemies were the philistines in the borders of simeon and judah near the sea these were not canaanites but had once dwelt in egypt and then after living for a time in cyprus had come and settled in gaza and ashkelon and three other very strong cities on the coast where they worshipped a fishgod called dagon they had no king but were ruled by lords of their five cities and made terrible inroads upon all the country round until at last the israelites in their selfwill fancied they could turn them to flight by causing the ark to be carried out to battle by the two corrupt young priests sons of eli whose doom had already been pronouncedthat they should both die in one day they were slain when the ark was taken by the enemies and their aged father fell back and broke his neck in the shock of the tidings the glory had departed and though god proved his might by shattering dagons image before the ark and plaguing the philistines wherever they carried it till they were forced to send it home in a manner which again showed the divine hand yet it never returned to shiloh god deserted the place where his name had not been kept holy the token of the covenant seemed to be lost the philistines ruled over the broken and miserable israelites and there was only one promise to comfort themthat the lord would raise up unto himself a faithful priest already there was growing up at shiloh the young levite samuel dedicated by his mother and bred up by eli he is counted as first of the prophets that long stream of inspired men who constantly preached righteousness and to whom occasionally future events were made known he was also last of the judges or heavensent deliverers as soon as he grew up he rallied the israelites restored the true worship as far as could be with the ark in concealment and sent them out to battle they defeated the philistines and under samuel again became a free nation     lesson vi  the kingdom of all israel  as is the fat taken away from the peaceoffering so was david chosen out of the children of israel  in all his works he praised the holy one most high with words of glory  the lord took away his sins and exalted his horn for ever he gave him a covenant of kings and a throne of glory in israelecclus xlvii ii  when samuel grew old the israelites would not trust to god to choose a fresh guardian for them but cried out for a king to keep them together and lead them to war like other nations their entreaty was granted and in 1094 b c saul the son of kish of the small but fierce tribe of benjamin was appointed by god and anointed like a priest by samuel on the understanding that he was not to rule by his own will like the princes around but as gods chief officer to enforce his laws and carry out his bidding  this saul would not do when instead of lurking in caves with no weapons save their tools for husbandry the israelites under his leading gradually became free and warlike and his son jonathan and uncle abner were able generals he fancied he could go his own way he took on him to offer sacrifice as the heathen kings did and when sent forth to destroy all belonging to the amalekites he spared the king and the choicest of the spoil for this he was sentenced not to be the founder of a line of kings and the doom filled him with wrath against the priesthood while an evil spirit was permittted to trouble his soul samuels last great act was to anoint the youngest son of jesse the bethlehemite the great grandchild of the loving moabitess ruth the same whom god had marked beside his sheepfolds as the man after his own heart the future father of the sceptred line of judah and of the root and offspring of david the bright and morning star  fair and young full of inspired song and of gallant courage the youth david was favoured as the minstrel able to drive the evil spirit from saul the champion who had slain the giant of gath he was the kings soninlaw the princes bosom friend but as the hopes of israel became set on him saul began to hate him as if he were a supplanter though jonathan submitted to the will that deprived himself of a throne and loved his friend as faithfully as ever at last by jonathans counsel david fled from court and saul in his rage at thinking him aided by the priests slew all who fell into his hands thus cutting off his own last link with heaven a trusty band of brave men gathered round david but he remained a loyal outlaw and always abstained from any act against his sovereign even though saul twice lay at his mercy patiently he tarried the lords leisure and the time came at last the philistines overran the country and chased saul even to the mountain fastnesses of gilboa where the miserable man deserted by god tried to learn his fate through evil spirits and only met the certainty of his doom in the next days battle his truehearted son met a soldiers death but saul when wounded by the archers tried in vain to put an end to his own life and was after a reign of forty years at last slain by an amalekite who brought his crown to david and was executed by him for having profanely slain the lords anointed  for seven years david reigned only in his own tribe of judah while the brave abner kept the rest of the kingdom for sauls son ishbosheth until taking offence because ishbosheth refused to give him one of sauls widows to wife he offered to come to terms with david but in leaving the place of meeting he was treacherously killed by davids overbearing nephew joab in revenge for the death of a brother whom he had slain in single combat ishbosheth was soon after murdered by two of his own servants and david becoming sole king ruled prudently with all his power and with anxious heed to the will of his true king he was a great conqueror and was the first to win for israel her great city on mount moriah it had once been called salem or peace when the mysterious priestking melchizedek reigned there in abrahams time but since it had been held by the jebusites and called jebus when david took it he named it jerusalem or the vision of peace fortified it built a palace there and fetched thither with songs and solemn dances the longhidden ark so that it might be the place where gods name was set the centre of worship and well was the spot fitted for the purpose it was a hill girdled round by other hills and so strong by nature that when built round with towers and walls an enemy could hardly have taken it david longed to raise a solid home for the ark but this was not a work permitted to a man of war and bloodshed and he could only collect materials and restore the priests to their offices giving them his own glorious book of psalms full of praise prayer and entreaty to be sung for ever before the lord by courses of levites relieving one another that so the voice of praise might never die out  david likewise made the philistines moabites ammonites and edomites pay him tribute and became the most powerful king in the east receiving the fulfilment of the promises to abraham but even he was far from guiltless he was a man of strong passions though of a tender heart and erred greatly both from hastiness and weakness but never without repentance and his psalms of contrition have ever since been the treasure of the penitent chastisement visited his sins and was meekly borne but bereavement and rebellion care sorrow and disappointment severely tried the sweet psalmist of israel shepherd prophet soldier and king ere in 1016 in his seventieth year he went to his rest after having been king for forty years he was assured that his seed should endure for ever  all promises of temporal splendour were accomplished in his peaceful son solomon who asked to be the wisest and therefore was likewise made the richest most prosperous and most peaceful of kings no enemy rose against him but all the nations sought his friendship and zidon for once had her merchandise hallowed by its being offered to build and adorn the temple solomons great work the spot chosen for it was that of isaacs sacrifice where was the threshingfloor bought by david from araunah but to give farther room he levelled the head of the mountain throwing it into the valley and thus forming an even space where silently built of huge stone quarried at a distance arose the courts for strangers women men and priests surrounded by cloisters supporting galleries of rooms for the lodging of the priests and levites many hundreds in number the main building was of white marble and the holy of holies was overlaid even to the roof outside with plates of gold flashing back the sunshine even this was but a poor token of the shechinah that glorious light which descended at solomons prayer of consecration and filled the sanctuary with the visible token of gods presence on the mercy beat to be seen by the high priest once a year  that consecration was the happiest moment of the history of israel what followed was mournful even david had been like the kings of other eastern nations in the multitude of his wives and solomon went far beyond him bringing in heathen women who won him into paying homage to their idols and outraging god by building temples to moloch and ashtoreth though as a prophet he had been inspired to speak in his proverbs of christ in his church as the holy wisdom of god a warning was sent that the power which had corrupted him should not continue in his family and that the kingdom should be divided but he only grew more tyrannical and when the ephraimite warrior jeroboam was marked by the prophet ahijah as the destined chief of the new kingdom solomon persecuted him and drove him to take refuge with the great shishak king of egypt where he seems to have learnt the idolatries from which israel had been so slowly weaned sick at heart solomon in his old age wrote the saddest book in the bible and though his first writing the canticles had been a joyful prophetic song of the love between the lord and his church his last was a mournful lamentation over the vanity and emptiness of the world and full of scorn of all that earth can give     lesson vii  the kingdom op judah  but if his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments if they break my statutes and keep not my commandments i will visit their offences with the rod and their sin with scourgesps lxxxix 31 32  rehoboam the son of solomon brought about by his own harshness and folly the punishment that god had decreed by the advice of his hasty young counsellors he made so violent a reply to the petition brought to him by his subjects that they took offence and the ten northern tribes broke away from him setting up as their king jeroboam who had been already marked out by the prophet  the lesson of meekness seems to have been the one chiefly appointed for rehoboam for when he assembled the fighting men of judah and benjamin to subdue the revolt shemaiah the prophet was sent to forbid him and he submitted at once and when again jeroboams friend shishak invaded his kingdom shemaiah told him it was as a punishment sent him by god against which he must not struggle so he gathered all the riches left him by his father paid the tribute that the egyptians required and for being thus patient and submissive he was again blessed by god and judah prospered no doubt rehoboams obedience saved him from sharing the fate of the other kings whom shishak conquered and dragged back to egypt where he yoked them to his chariot four abreast and made them draw him about shishak was a great conqueror and in nine years overran all asia as far as the river ganges all his victories were recorded in hieroglyphics and the learned have made out the picture of a people with the features of jews bringing their gifts to his feet no doubt the messengers of rehoboam he lost his sight in his old age and is said to have killed himself  in 955 abijah came to the throne instead of rehoboam and was permitted to gain a great victory over jeroboam but he died at the end of three years and was succeeded by his son asa the great temptation of the men of judah seems to have been at this time the resorting to hill tops and groves of trees as places of worship instead of going steadily to the temple at jerusalem and the kings though obedient in other respects did not dare to put down this forbidden custom asas mother maachah a daughter of absalom even had an idol in a grove but after the king had been strengthened to gain a great victory over the ethiopians he destroyed the idol and put her down from being queen his end was less good than his beginning he made a league with the syrians instead of trusting to god and threw the prophet hanani into prison for having rebuked him and in his latter years he was cruel and oppressive he died in 891  his son jehoshaphat was a very good and gentle prince but his very gentleness seemed to have led him into error for he became too friendly with the idolatrous house of ahab in samaria and allowed his son jehoram to take to wife the child of ahab and jezebel athaliah who proved even more wicked than her mother jehoshaphat was in alliance with ahab and went out with him to his last battle at ramothgilead where ahab tried to put his friend into danger instead of himself by making him appear as the only king present but entirely failed to deceive the hand appointed to bring death afterwards when the edomites ammonites and moabites came up against judah jehoshaphat was commanded to have no fears but to go out to meet them with the levites singing before him praise the lord for his mercy endureth for ever so the battle should be his without fighting for the three banded nations fought among themselves and made such a slaughter of one another that the jews had nothing to do but to gather the spoil which was in such heaps that they spent three days in collecting it and again when jehoshaphat went out with jehoram king of israel against the moabites with jehoshaphats tributary the king of edom another miraculous deliverance was granted by the hand of elisha and the water which was sent to relieve the thirsty hosts of israel and judah seemed to the moabites as blood so that thinking the three armies had quarrelled and slain each other they made an unguarded attack and suffered a total rout  jehoshaphat was succeeded in 891 by his son jehoram who though he had seen such signal proofs of gods power chose rather to follow the will of his wicked wife athaliah than to obey the commands of god to strengthen his dominion he followed the example of the worst heathen tyrants and killed his seven brethren and he permitted and encouraged idolatry in the most open manner he was first punished by the loss of the edomites who rose against him and set up a free kingdom according to the prophecy of isaac next by an inroad of the arabians and philistines who ravaged his very house and killed all his children except the youngest ahaziah and lastly by a loathsome and deadly disease which ended his life in the fortieth year of his age  ahaziah was only twentytwo and was ruled by his mother athaliah for the one year before going to visit his uncle jehoram of israel he was slain with him in jehus massacre of the house of ahab athaliah herself fulfilled the rest of the decree which she did not acknowledge she was bent on reigning and savagely murdered all her grandsons who fell into her hands but as the house of david was never to fail one tender branch the infant joash was hidden from her fury by his aunt the wife of the high priest jehoiada and when the fitting time was come the levites were armed and the people were shown their little king they acknowledged him with shouts of joy and athaliah coming to see the cause of the outcry was dragged out of the temple and put to death jerusalem was cleansed from the worship of baal and all prospered as long as the good jehoiada lived after his death however joash fell away grievously and promoted idol worship nay he even slew the son of his preserver jehoiada for bringing him a divine rebuke and for this iniquity his troops suffered a great defeat from the syrians and his servants slew him as he lay sick on his bed in 838 his son amaziah began well obeying the lord by dismissing the ephraimites whom he had hired to aid him against the edomites and he was therefore rewarded with a great victory but so strangely blind was he that he brought home the vain gods of edom and worshipped them he too was slain by rebels in the flower of his age leaving his son uzziah also called azariah to succeed him at sixteen years old uzziah met with such success at first that his heart was lifted up and in his pride he endeavoured to intrude into the priests office and burn incense on the altar but even while striving with the high priest the leprosy broke out white on his brow setting him apart to live as an outcast from religious services for ever his son jotham became the governor of the kingdom during his lifetime and afterwards reigned alone till the year 759 when he was succeeded by his son ahaz one of the worst and most idolatrous of the kings of judah the syrians made alliance with israel and terribly ravaged judea till jerusalem stood alone in the midst of desolation and ahaz instead of turning to the lord tried to strengthen himself by fresh heathen alliances though the prophet isaiah brought him certain messages that his foes should be destroyed and promised him for a sign that great blessing of the house of david that the virgins son should be born and should be god present with us     lesson viii  the kingdom of samaria  as for samaria her king is cut off as the foam upon the waterhosea x 7   many promises had marked out ephraim for greatness and at first the new kingdom seemed quite to overshadow the little rocky judah but the founder of the dominion of the ten tribes sowed the seeds of decay because like saul he would not trust to the god who had given him his crown he was afraid his subjects would return to the kings of the house of david if he let them go to worship at jerusalem and therefore revived the old symbol of a calf which he must have seen in egypt in his exile setting up two shrines at bethel and at dan the two ends of his kingdom bidding his people go thither to offer sacrifice thus he made israel to sin and while hoping to strengthen his power was the cause of its ruin prophets warned him in vain that his line should not remain on the throne and in the reign of his son nadab the rebel baasha arose and slew the whole family of this first king of the idolatrous realm in the year 952 baasha was not warned by the fate of nadab but followed the same courses and his son elah and all his house were destroyed in 928 when after the slaughter of two shortlived usurpers the captain of the army omri became king omri belonged to the city of jezreel in the inheritance of issachar but he built samaria in the midst of ephraim between the two hills of blessing and of cursing and this town becoming the capital gave its name to the whole kingdom in 918 omri left his crown to his son ahab who allied himself with the rich phoenicians and took the zidonian princess jezebel for his wife the most unfortunate marriage in the whole israelitish history sinful as had been the calfworship it was still meant for adoration of the true god but jezebel brought her foul phoenician faith with her and tried to force on the israelites the worship of baal as a separate god in the stead of the lord jehovah  ahab was weak and yielded and the greater number of the nation were so much corrupted by the breach of the second commandment that they were not slow to break the first although god had sent the most glorious of all his prophets to prove to them that the lord he is the god three years of drought showed who commands the clouds and then came elijahs challenge to the four hundred prophets of baal to prove who was the god who could send fire from heaven all day did the four hundred cry wildly on their idol while elijah mocked them at evening his offering was made and drenched with water to increase the wonder of the miracle he prayed the fire fell at once from heaven and the people shouted the lord he is the god and gave their deceivers up to punishment and when this partial purification was made he prayed upon mount carmel and the little cloud arose and grew into a mighty storm bringing abundance of rain on the thirsty land  who could withstand such wonders yet they only hardened jezebel into greater cruelty and elijah was forced to flee into the utmost desert where he communed with god on mount sinai even like moses only once more did he appear again to ahab and that was to rebuke him for having permitted the murder of a poor subject whose property he had coveted and to foretell the horrors in which his line should end  ahab was not wholly hardened and often had gleams of good which brought favour upon him a new enemy had risen up since the canaanites had been destroyed and the philistines repressed by david namely the syrians a powerful nation whose capital was at damascus a city which is said to be a perfect paradise so delicious is the climate and so lovely the two rivers one making the circuit of the walls the other flowing through the middle of the town these syrians were appointed to bring punishment upon samaria but at first two great victories were vouchsafed to ahab because benhadad king of syria fancied that the israelites only won because their gods were gods of the hills afterwards when ahab went out to recover ramoth gilead wilfully trusting to lying prophets and silencing the true one not all his disguise could avail to protect him he was slain in the battle and when his chariot was washed the dogs licked his blood as they had licked that of his victim naboth  ahaziah his son soon died of a fall from the top of his palace and the next brother jehoram reigned trying to make an agreement between the worship of god and of baal it was now that elijah was taken away into heaven by a whirlwind leaving behind him elisha to carry on his mission of prophecy and to execute the will of the lord it was elisha who sent a messenger to anoint jehu the warrior who performed the vengeance of the lord upon the house of ahab in the year 884 jehoram was slain in his chariot jezebel thrown out of window by her own slaves perished miserably among the ravenous flocks of street dogs and all the princes of the line were slaughtered by the rulers of samaria the worshippers of baal were massacred and the land purified from this idolatry still jehu would not part with the calves of dan and bethel and he was therefore warned that his family should likewise pass away after the fourth generation  elisha had already wept at the foreknowledge of the miseries which hazael of syria should bring upon israel and hazael murdering his master benhadad by stifling him with a wet cloth as he lay sick on his bed became a dreadful enemy to samaria so much broken was the force of jehoahaz jehus son that at one time he had only one thousand foot fifty horse and ten chariots but after this prosperity began to return to the israelites joash his son was a mighty king and would have been still greater if he would have believed that obeying the simple words of the prophet elisha on his deathbed would bring him victory yet so much greater was his force than that of judah that when amaziah sent him a challenge he replied by the insulting parable of the thistle and the cedar jeroboam ii his son was likewise prosperous but neither blessings nor warnings would induce these kings to forsake their golden calves amos the herdsmanprophet of tekoa was warned to say nothing against the kings chapel at bethel and hosea in vain declared that ephraim was feeding on wind and following after the eastwind namely putting his trust in mere empty air so in the time of zechariah son to jeroboam came the doom of the house of jehu and in 773 the king was murdered by shallum who only reigned a month being killed by his general menahem again menahems son pekahiah was killed by his captain pekah a great warrior who made an attack upon ahaz of judah and slew one hundred and twenty thousand jews in one day many more with all their spoil were brought captives to samaria but there was some good yet left in israel and at the rebuke of the prophet oded the ephraimites remembered that they were brethren gave back to the prisoners all their spoil fed them clothed them and mounted them on asses to carry them safely back to their own land but pekah and his ally rezin of damascus were sore foes to ahaz and cruelly ravaged his domains and though god encouraged him by the words of isaiah to trust in him alone and see their destruction ahaz obstinately resolved to turn to a new power for protection     lesson ix  nineveh  where is the dwellingplace of the lions and the feedingplace of the young lionsnahum ii 11   when the confusion of tongues took place at babel and men were dispersed the sons of hams grandson cush remained in mesopotamia which took the name of assyria from assur the officer of nimrod the first king this assur began building on the banks of the tigris the great city of nineveh one of the mightiest in all the world and the first to be ruined it was enclosed by a huge wall so wide that three chariots could drive side by side on the top and built of bricks made of the clay of the country dried in the sun and cemented with bitumen guarded at the base by a plinth fifty feet in height and with immense ditches round it about sixty miles in circumference within were huge palaces built of the same bricks faced with alabaster and the rooms decked with cedar gilding and ivory and raised upon terraces whence broad flights of steps led down to courts guarded by giant stone figures of bulls and lions with eagles wings and human faces as if some notion of the mysterious cherubim around the throne in heaven had floated to these assyrians the slabs against the walls were carved with representations of battles hunts sacrifices triumphs and all the scenes in the kings histories nay in the building of the city and there were explanations in the wedgeshaped letters of the old assyrian alphabet the ninevites had numerous idols but their honour for the lord had not quite faded away and about the year 830 about the time of amaziah in judah and jeroboam ii in israel the prophet jonah was sent to rebuke them for their many iniquities in trying to avoid the command by sailing to tarshish in a phoenician ship he underwent that strange punishment which was a prophetic sign of our lords burial and resurrection and thus warned he went to nineveh and startled the people by the cry yet forty days and nineveh shall be destroyed at that cry the whole place repented as one man and from the king to the beggar all fasted and wept till god had mercy on their repentance and ready faith and turned away his wrath in pity to the 120000 innocent children who knew not yet to do good or evil  the prophet nahum afterwards prophesied against the bloody city and foretold that her men should become like women and that in the midst of her feasting and drunkenness an overflowing flood should make an end of her but first god had a work for the ninevites to do namely to punish his own chosen who would not have him for their god therefore he strengthened the great king tiglath pileser who already held in subjection the other great assyrian city of babylon and the brave median mountaineers to come out against the syrians and israelites ahaz king of judah hoping to be delivered from his distresses sent messengers to tiglath pileser to say i am thy servant and thy son and to beg him to protect him from his two enemies promising to pay him tribute tiglath pileser did indeed take damascus and put the king to death destroying the old syrian kingdom for ever and he carried away the calf of dan and severely chastised samaria where pekah was shortly after murdered by his servant hoshea so that isaiahs prophecy of the ruin of these two tails of smoking firebrands pekah and rezin was fulfilled but as ahaz had tried to bring it about in his own way he gained nothing though he went to pay his service to the conqueror at damascus tiglath pileser did not help him but only distressed him and instead of learning who was his true guardian ahaz only came home delighted with the syrian temples and profanely altered the arrangements in the temple which moses and solomon had ordained by gods command as patterns of the greater and more perfect tabernacle revealed to moses in heaven he soon died in the year 725 when only thirtysix years old leaving his crown to hezekiah then only sixteen the king whose heart was more whole with god than had been that of any king since his father david and whose first thought was to purify the temple and to destroy all corrupt worship breaking down idols and destroying the high places and groves which had stood ever since solomons time  hoshea too was the best king of samaria that had yet reigned for he encouraged his subjects to go to worship at jerusalem whither hezekiah invited them to keep the passover and that feast had not been held so fully since solomons time they came back full of zeal and destroyed many of the idols but the reformation came too late the measure of israels sin was full hoshea offended shalmaneser who had succeeded tiglath pileser by making friends with so king of egypt and the assyrian army came down upon israel in the year 722 and killing hoshea carried off all the people as captives settling them in the cities of the medes never more to dwell in their own land sargon seems to have dethroned shalmaneser about this time and to have completed the conquest of israel of which he boasted on the tablets of a great palace near nineveh which has been lately brought to light  the remnant that was left the small realm of judah took warning and turned to god with all their heart and therefore were protected but they had much to suffer sargons son sennacherib was a proud and ambitious monarch who used his israelite captives in building up the walls of nineveh and making the most magnificent of all the palaces there eight acres in size and covered with inscriptions he invaded judea took fortysix cities and besieged jerusalem raising a mound to overtop the walls but on receiving large gifts from hezekiah he returned to his own land at babylon a prince named merodach baladan had set himself up against sennacherib and sought the friendship of hezekiah when the good king of judah recovered from his illness by a miracle the sign of which was that the sun seemed to retreat in his course it probably won the attention of the chaldeans who were great stargazers and merodach baladan sent messengers to compliment the king whose favour with heaven had thus been shown to all the earth for once hezekiah erred and was so much uplifted as to display his treasure and his newborn son in ostentation isaiah rebuked him telling him that his children should be slaves in the hands of the very nation who had heard his boast he meekly submitted thankful that there should be peace and truth in his days soon after babylon was reduced by sennacherib and merodach baladan driven into exile in the latter years of his reign sennacherib undertook an expedition into egypt and on his way sent a blasphemous message by his servant rabshakeh to summon hezekiah to submit and warning him and his people that their god could no more protect them than the gods of the conquered nations had saved their worshippers in answer to the prayer of hezekiah came by the mouth of isaiah an assurance that the boaster who insulted the living god was only an instrument in his hands unable to go one step against his will not one arrow should he shoot against the holy city but he should hear a rumour a blast should be sent on him and he should fall by the sword in his own land  accordingly on the report that tirhakah the great king of ethiopia was coming to the aid of the egyptians he hurried on to reinforce the army he had sent against him intending to take jerusalem on his way back but on the night when the two armies were in sight of each other ere the battle the blast of death passed over the assyrians and in early morning the host lay dead not by the sword but by the breath of the lord and sennacherib was left to return without the men in whom he had trusted even heathens recorded this deliverance but they strangely altered the story they said that it was the prayer of the egyptian king that prevailed on his gods to send a multitude of mice into the enemys camp to gnaw all the bowstrings so that they could not fight and they showed a statue of the king with a mouse in his hand which was they said a memorial of the wonder  sennacherib in rage and fury cruelly persecuted the israelites at nineveh for their connection with the jews and then it was that the pious tobit buried the corpses that were cast in the street until he lost his sight afterwards so wonderfully restored sennacherib was murdered in the year 720 by two of his sons while worshipping his god nisroch and another son esarhaddon became king  esarhaddon who is known by many different names soon after came out and marauded all over the adjacent country and it is believed that it was about this time that bethulia was so bravely defended and the ninevite general slain by the craft and courage of judith esarhaddon took away all the remaining israelites from their country and filled it up with phoenicians and medes from cities which had been conquered these bringing their idols into the land of the lord were chastised with lions and begging to be taught to worship the god of the land had priests sent them who taught them some of the truth though very imperfectly and these new inhabitants were called samaritans  in the time of hezekiah many more of the psalms than had been before collected were written down and applied to the temple service the latter part of the proverbs of solomon were first copied out and the inspired words of the prophets began to be added to the scriptures joels date is unfixed but hosea amos and jonah had recently been prophesying and the glorious evangelical predictions of isaiah and micah were poured out throughout this reign those of isaiah ranging from the humiliation and passion of the redeemer to the ingathering of the nations to his kingdom and micah marking out the little bethlehem as the birthplace of him whose goings are from everlasting  manasseh the son of the good hezekiah began to reign in 699 he was in his first years savagely wicked and very idolatrous it is believed that he caused the great evangelical prophet isaiah to be put to death by being sawn asunder and he set an image in the temple itself he soon brought down his punishment on his head for the assyrian captains invaded judea and took him captive dragging him in chains to babylon there he repented and humbled himself with so contrite a heart that god had mercy on him and caused his enemies to restore him to his throne but the free days of judah were over and they were thenceforth subjects paying tribute to the king of assyria and manasseh was only a tributary for the many remaining years of his reign while he strove in vain to undo the evil he had done by bringing in idolatry  meantime the greatness of nineveh came to an end the babylonians and medes revolted against it and it was ruined in the year 612 sardanapalus succeeded his father at nineveh but was weak and luxurious his brother saracus was so like him that what seems really to have been the end of saracus is generally told of sardanapalus he was so weary of all amusement and delight that by way of change he would dress like his wives and spin and embroider with them and he even offered huge rewards to anyone who would invent a new pleasure he said his epitaph should be that he carried with him that which he had eaten which said wise men was a fit motto only for a pig not a man at last his carelessness and violence provoked the babylonians and medes to rise against him and they besieged his city but he took no notice and feasted on putting his trust in an old prophecy perhaps nahums that nothing should harm nineveh till the river became her enemy at last he heard that the tigris had overflowed and broken down a part of the wall and so giving himself up he shut himself up in his palace and setting fire to it burnt himself with all his wives slaves and treasures rather than be taken by the enemy so ended nineveh in the year 612 no one ever lived there again the river made part a swamp and the rest was covered with sand brought by the desert winds it was all ruin and desolation but of late years many of its mighty remains have been brought to our country as witnesses of the dealings of god with his peoples foes     lesson x  the captivity  is this the city that men call the perfection of beauty the joy of the whole earthlarn ii 15   manassehs son amon undid all the reformation of his latter years and brought back idolatry and indeed the whole jewish people had become so corrupt that even when amon was murdered in 642 after only reigning two years and better days came back with the good josiah it was with almost all of them only a change of the outside and not of the heart josiah was but eight years old when he came to the throne and at sixteen he began to rule seeking the lord earnestly with his whole heart as david and hezekiah alone had done before him one of his first acts was to purify the temple and in so doing the book of the law of moses was found cast aside and forgotten by all josiah bade the scribes read it aloud and then for the first time he heard what blessings judah had forfeited what curses she had deserved and how black was her disobedience in the sight of god well might he rend his clothes weep aloud and send to the prophetess huldah to ask whether the anger of the lord could yet be turned aside she made answer by the word of the god of justice that the doom must come on the guilty nation but that in his mercy he would spare josiah the sight of the ruin and that he should be gathered into his grave in peace and at the same time zephaniah likewise spoke of judgment and jeremiah the priest of anathoth was foretelling that treacherous judah should soon suffer like backsliding israel yet even this hopeless future did not daunt josiahs loving heart from doing his best he collected his people and renewed the covenant he rooted out every trace of idolatry even more thoroughly than hezekiah had done overthrowing even solomons idol temples and he went to bethel which he seems to have held under the king of assyria and defiled the old altar there by burning bones on it as the disobedient prophet had foretold of him by name when that altar was first set up he likewise caused copies of the law to be made so that it might never be lost again and the jews have a story that knowing the temple was to be destroyed he saved the ark of the covenant aarons rod and the pot of manna from sacrilege by hiding them away in the hollow of mount nebo where they have never since been found but this is quite uncertain  josiah lived between two mighty powers the king of babylon who had newly taken nineveh and pharaoh necho king of egypt a very bold and able man who hired phoenician ships to sail round africa and then did not believe the crews when they came back because they said they had seen the sun to the north at noon and wool growing on trees he tried to cut a canal from the nile to the red sea and wishing to check the power of babylon he brought an army by sea to make war upon assyria landing at acre under mount carmel and intending to march through gilead josiah being a tributary of babylon thought it his duty to endeavour to stop him and going out to battle with him at megiddo was there mortally wounded and died on his way home in the year 611 the mourning of the jews over their good king was so bitter that it was a proverb long after and they had indeed reason to lament for he was the last who stood between them and their sin and their punishment  jehoahaz or shallum his third son a wicked young man only reigned while necho was fighting a battle with the babylonians on the euphrates and then was carried off in chains to egypt while necho set up eliakim or jehoiakim another brother in his stead jehoiakim was idolatrous cruel and violent he persecuted the prophets and did everything to draw on himself the punishment of heaven necho making another invasion was defeated by the great nebuchadnezzar of babylon and hunted back by him into egypt on his way nebuchadnezzar seized jerusalem in the year 606 and carried off some of the treasures of the temple and many of the royal family to babylon among them the four holy children but he let jehoiakim continue to reign as his vassal jeremiah prophesied that the time of captivity and desolation should last seventy years from this time but the worst was not yet come jehoiakim was bent on trusting for help to the egyptians who had made him king and treated jeremiah as a traitor for counselling him to be loyal to the assyrians he threw jeremiah into prison and when baruch read the roll of his prophecies in the temple he caused it to be cut to pieces and destroyed at last he rebelled relying on help from egypt but it did not come for necho was dying and in the year 598 nebuchadnezzar himself came up against jerusalem and besieged it jehoiakim died in the midst of the war and his equally wicked son jehoiachin coniah or jeconiah was soon forced to come out and surrender to nebuchadnezzar who dishonoured his fathers corpse and carried him away to babylon with the chief treasures of the temple and a great multitude of warriors and mechanics among them was the prophet ezekiel who on the banks of the chebar saw mighty visions of the chariot of god borne up by the cherubim and while he rebuked the present jews for their crimes promised restoration and beheld the new and more perfect building of god measured out by the angel a marble cylinder with most of this prophecy engraven on it in assyrian characters has lately been found in the ruins near the tigris  the last son of josiah mattanias or zedekiah was set up as king and reigned for eleven years like his brothers wavering and sinning and trusting to false prophets instead of jeremiah who gave him hopes of rest if he would only bear his present fallen state meekly and not trust to egypt the counsellors who loved egypt however persuaded him to rebel as pharaoh hophra was actually coming out to his assistance and he put jeremiah into prison for prophesying that he would bring ruin on himself nebuchadnezzar soon marched upon him and besieged jerusalem and his friend pharaoh hophra left him to his fate showing himself the broken reed that jeremiah had said he would prove the siege of jerusalem lasted a year and no one suffered more than the prophet who was thrown into a noisome prison and afterwards lowered into a pit where he nearly died but not for all this did he cease to denounce the judgments of god on the rebellious city horrible famine prevailed and the streets were full of dead but jeremiah told the king that if he would go out and make terms with nebuchadnezzar all might yet be saved but zedekiah would not listen and at last broke out with his men of war to cut his way through the enemy his selfwill met its deserts he was taken by nebuzaradan the captain who had been left to carry on the siege and brought a prisoner to babylon after his sons had been slain in his very sight and his eyes then put out according to a prophecy of ezekiel which he is said to have thought impossible namely that he should die at babylon and yet never see it  the temple was stripped of the last remains of its glory and utterly overthrown the walls were broken down and the place left desolate the edomites who were in the conquerors army savagely exulting in the fall of their kindred nation but both psalm cxxxvii and the prophet obadiah spoke of vengeance in store for them likewise all the jews of high rank were carried away and none left but the poorer sort who were to till the ground under a ruler named gedaliah jeremiah who was offered his choice of going to babylon or remaining in judea preferred to continue near the once glorious city whose solitude and ruin he bewailed in the mournful book of lamentations and he did his utmost to persuade the remaining jews to rest quietly under the dominion of assyria had they done so there would yet have been peace but ishmael a prince of the seed royal who had fled to the ammonites during the invasion came back and in the hope of making himself king murdered gedaliah at a harvest feast with many jews and chaldeans and was on his way to his friend the king of ammon when johanan a friend of gedaliah came upon him and slew many of his party so that he escaped with only eight men to the ammonites so shocked were the jews at this murder of gedaliah that they ever after kept a fast on the anniversary johanan now asked counsel from jeremiah who still enjoined him to submit to the assyrians but assured him that if he went to egypt it would only be to share the ruin of that country but johanan and his friends would not listen and carried all the remnant of judah and jeremiah himself off by force into egypt all this happened in the miserable year 588 and jerusalem remained utterly waste the land enjoying a long sabbath of desolation what became of jeremiah afterwards is not known he is said to have been stoned in egypt but this is not at all certain he left behind him the promise that a deliverer should comethe lord our righteousnessand that the former redemption out of bondage in egypt should be as nothing in comparison with the ingathering of the new covenant from the north country and from all countries also that the new covenant should be within written upon the hearts and minds of the faithful     lesson xi  babylon  by the waters of babylon we sat down and wept when we remembered thee o sionpsalm cxxxvii 1   babylon the city which was to be the place of captivity of the jews was the home of the chaldeans who are believed not to have been the sons of gush like the assyrians whom they had conquered at nineveh but to have been at first a wandering tribe of the north and to have descended from japhet they had nearly the same gods as the ninevites but thought the special protector of their city was belmerodach the name by which they called the planet jupiter they were such great observers of the courses of the stars that astronomy is said to have begun with them but this was chiefly because they fancied that the heavenly bodies would help them to foretel coming events for they put great faith in soothsayers they settled upon the bank of the euphrates near the ruins of the tower of babel round which a city arose sometimes free sometimes under the power of the king of nineveh  in the time of the weak and luxurious saracus nabopolassar was governor of babylon he joined himself to the medea giving his son nebuchadnezzar in marriage to the median princess amytis and as has already been said the two nations together destroyed nineveh after which babylon became the head of the assyrian empire and nebuchadnezzar was the king  he made the city exceedingly grand and beautiful it was fifty five miles in circuit square surrounded by a wall eightyseven feet thick and three hundred and fifty high with houses and a street on the top and an enormous ditch filled with water all round another lesser wall some way within there were one hundred brazen gates in the wall besides two larger gateways upon the euphrates which ran through the middle dividing the city into two parts it was full of streets and houses with such fields and vineyards that it was like a whole country walled in and the soil was exceedingly rich being all brought down from the armenian hills by the euphrates as this river rose in the mountains of armenia it used to overflow in the spring when the snows melted and swelled the stream but to prevent mischief the country was covered with a network of canals to draw off the water in safety the pride of the city was the temple of bel which is thought to have been built on a fragment of the tower of babel it was a pile of enormous height with seven stages in honour of the seven planets then known and with a winding ascent leading from one to the other on the top was the shrine where stood bels golden image twelve cubits high and before it a golden table where meats and wine were served up to him on either side of the river were two palaces joined together by a bridge and the nearer one four miles round with wonderful grounds containing what were called the hanging gardens namely a hill which nebuchadnezzar had caused to be raised by heaping up earth and planted with trees to please his median queen whose eye pined for her native mountains in the flats of babylon  there must have been other eyes at babylon wearying for their own free heights for there the captives of judah bore the punishment of their fathers sins and their own and repented so completely that they never returned to their idolatry when in 606 nebuchadnezzar carried to babylon jehoiachin and the nobles of judah he commanded that some of the royal children should be brought up as slaves to serve in his palace and gave them new names after his gods daniel ananias azarias and misael gave their first proof of their obedience to the law of their god in their exile and slavery by denying themselves the choice meats set before them lest they should eat of some forbidden thing and living only on dry beans and water so blessed was their abstinence that they excelled all the other youths both in beauty and in wisdom and were soon promoted above them soon after daniel was shown to be a prophet for god inspired him not merely with the meaning of nebuchadnezzars perplexing dream but revealed to him the dream itself which the king had forgotten that dream was the emblematic history of the world it was an image with a head of gold shoulders of silver thighs of brass legs of iron feet partly of iron partly of clay all overthrown together by a stone cut out without hands from a mountain great babylon was the head soon to give way to the less splendid persian power then again to the greek dominion and lastly to the iron rule of rome which would grow weak and mixed with miry clay till at last all would be overthrown and subdued by the stone which the builders rejected  after this wonderful interpretation daniel became a chief ruler under nebuchadnezzar and even in his youth his name was a very proverb for wisdom and holiness he judged among the jews and confuted the two wicked elders who sought to bring about the death of susanna and he probably stood too high to be accused when soon after the taking of zedekiah nebuchadnezzar threw the three other princes into the fiery furnace for refusing to bow down to the golden image on the plains of dura then the fiery blast was to them as a moist whistling wind and even the tyrant beheld the form like the son of god walking with them in the midst of the flame while they sung that hymn which calls every created thing to praise the lord the miracle seems not to have been witnessed by a heart hardened against belief nebuchadnezzar proclaimed the glory of the god who could work such miracles and whose instrument of vengeance he himself was edom was soon after conquered by nebuchadnezzar thus fulfilling many prophecies  another great work which was set for him to do was to give the first great overthrow to the phoenicians and fulfil the prophecies of isaiah and ezekiel by destroying tyre the siege lasted thirteen years and the besiegers suffered as much as the besieged till as ezekiel had foretold every head was bald every shoulder peeled with the burdens that were carried but at last it was taken in the year 573 and so utterly destroyed that not a trace was left of it it had been said by isaiah that after seventy years tyre should take her harp and sing again and return for a time to her former splendour and corruption and thus it happened for a new tyre arose upon a little island at some little distance from the shore  ezekiel had promised the chaldeans that the toils of tyre should be repaid by the spoil of egypt the land that was henceforth to be a slave for ever and in 574 nebuchadnezzar marched thither and conquered it with the utmost ease there being at that time a quarrel among the egyptians which weakened their hands hophra the last of the pharaohs was slain by a rebel and egypt has never more been free or under native rulers the ammonites too were put down for ever by nebuchadnezzar and he came home puffed up with the pride of conquest then came another warning dream of a tree great and spreading the rest and stay of bird and beast till a watcher and a holy one came down and bade that it should be cut down and only a stump to be left to be wet with the dew of heaven until it should recover it was no wonder that daniel was astonished for one hour ere he explained the vision which bore that the great conqueror should lose his reason be chased from the haunts of men and live like the beasts with hair like eagles feathers and nails like eagles claws nebuchadnezzar does not seem to have punished him for thus revealing the will of god and time went on while the city grew more magnificent under the builders hand till at last in the pride of his heart the king made his boast is not this great babylon that i have builded for the house of the kingdom and for the honour of my majesty  that moment the watcher cried from heaven and sense and strength fled from the mighty nebuchadnezzar he was driven from men and lived seven years among the beasts of the field till for one year reason was mercifully restored to him and he made the best use of it in publishing to all the world the story of his pride and of his fall and with all his heart honouring the king of heaven whose works are truth and his ways are judgment  this humbled conqueror died in 563 and was succeeded by his son evilmerodach who released the captive jehoiachin and made him eat at his own table until his death two more kings succeeded each reigning but a few years and then came belshazzar in the first year of whose reign daniel had a vision where the like events as were shown by the dream of nebuchadnezzar were foreshadowed under the form of animals typifying the several empires four beasts came from the sea the lion with eagles wings was his own assyria but was set aside by the devouring bear of persia then followed the flying fourheaded leopard of greece and lastly the dreadful and terrible destroying creature meaning rome which ground with iron teeth and brake all in pieces it had ten horns which are believed to mean the kingdoms into which rome was divided in later times and one which destroyed some of the others and became blasphemous till all was lost in an awful manifestation of the ancient of days coming to judgment this little horn is thought to mean the spirit of antichrist and the great falling away which is to prevail in the latter days but the end is not yet  a second vision was sent two years after likewise of emblematic beasts and was likewise explained by an angel a ram pushing west north and southwards was persia whose victory was already nigh even at the door but in his full power came from the west the grecian hegoat who overthrew the ram and stamped on him and waxed great but then his one great horn was broken and four others rose up four lesser kings instead of one great conqueror and one of these produced a lesser horn which wrought woe and ruin to the pleasant land this horn was not meant like the first to typify the sinful one of the latter christian days but a terrible foe who was to try the faith of the jews and all these visions seem to have been intended to show that though prophecy and gods visible dealings with his people were so nearly over yet all kingdoms and empires are his and are founded flourish and decay at his will     lesson xii  cyrus  when the lord turned again the captivity of sion then were we like unto them that dreampsalm cxxvi 1  the persian power prefigured by the silver shoulders the bear and the ram was indeed nigh the ram had two horns because two nations were joined together the medes who had revolted from nineveh and the persians the medes lived in the slopes towards the tigris and had learnt to be luxurious and indolent from their assyrian neighbours but the persians who lived in the mountains to the eastward were much more spirited and simpler and purer in life they are thought to be sons of japhet and their religion had not lost all remains of truth for they believed in but one god and had no idols except that they adored the sun as the emblem of divine power and kept horses in his honour because they thought he drove his car of light round the sky they worshipped fire likewise as the sign of the lightgiving and consuming godhead and this notion is not entirely gone yet so that there are many parsees or fireworshippers still in the east their priests were called magi and their faith was therefore termed magian though it went astray in adoring these created things yet it did not teach wickedness as did the religions of the sons of ham and the persians were a brave upright race who loved hardy simple ways and said the chief things their sons ought to learn were to ride to draw the bow and speak the truth  cyrus was the son of a persian king and median princess and had been so well brought up at home that when as a little boy he visited his grandfather at echatana in media he was very much shocked to see the court drinking to intoxication and said wine must be poison since it made people lose their senses and he was much puzzled by the hosts of slaves who would not let people do anything for themselves he thought only those who were old and helpless could like being waited on and he kept these hardy simple ways even after he was a great king over both nations  when he was about forty years old one of the kings in asia minor made war on him and he not only overthrew this monarch but won that whole country which was kept by the persians for many years afterwards in the year 540 he marched against assyria which had insulted him in the time of evilmerodach he beat belshazzar in battle and then besieged him in his city but the babylonians had no fears they trusted to their walls and brazen gates and knew that he could not starve them out as they had so much corn growing within the walls for two years they remained in security and laughed at the persian army outside but at last cyrus devised a new plan and set his men to dig trenches to draw off the water of the euphrates and leave the bed of the river dry still there were the great gates upon the river which he expected to have to break down but on the very day his trenches were ready belshazzar was giving a great feast in his palace and drinking wine out of the golden vessels that nebuchadnezzar had brought from the temple  full in the midst of his revelry appeared a strange sight near the sevenbranched candlestick that once had burnt in the holy place came forth a bodiless hand and the fingers wrote upon the wall in characters such as no man knew the hearts of the revellers failed them for fear and the kings knees smote together then nitocris his mother a brave and wise woman bethought her of all that daniel had done in the days of nebuchadnezzar and at her advice he was called for he knew the words they were in the hebrew tongue the language of his own scriptures the same in which the finger of god revealed the commandments he read them and they signified god hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it thou art weighed in the balances and found wanting thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians  at that moment cyrus and his persians were entering by the river gates which had been left open in that time of careless festivity one end of the city knew not that the other was taken and ere the night was past belshazzar lay dead in his palace and the assyrian empire was over for ever  it was 170 years since by the mouth of isaiah god had called cyrus by name had said he would give the nations as dust to his sword and stubble to his bow had said of him that he was his anointed and his shepherd and that he would build up the holy city and temple and let the captives go free without money or price moreover it was seventy years since daniel himself had been carried away from the pleasant land and well had he counted the weary days prophesied of by jeremiah till now he hoped the time was come and most earnestly did he pray looking towards jerusalem as solomon had entreated when his people should turn to god in the land of their captivity pleading gods goodness and mercy though owning that judah had done wickedly even while he was yet speaking came the answer by the mouth of the angel gabriel and not only was it the present deliverance that it announced but that from the building of the street and wall in troublous times seventy weeks of years were appointed to bring the anointed so long promised the real deliverer  daniels prayers had won and in the first year of cyrus 536 forth went the joyful decree that judah should return build up the city and temple and receive back their sacred vessels and treasure from the king to aid them in their work daniel being nearly ninety years old did not go with them but remained to protect them at the court of babylon cyrus set up his uncle who is commonly called darius to be king in babylon while he returned to persia and daniel though so old a man was made one of the chief rulers under him one of the three presidents over the hundred and twenty satraps or princes over the provinces of the great persian empire the envy of the medes caused them to persuade darius by foolish flattery to say that whoever for a month should make request of god or man save of the king should be cast into a den of lions and daniel who was not likely in his old age to cease from prayer to his god for any terror of man endured the penalty much against the kings will but only that again gods power might be known among the heathen and his glory proclaimed by the shutting the mouths of the hungry lions about the same time he seems to have shown darius who though not an idolater himself was puzzled by seeing that the victuals daily spread on bels golden table always disappeared that after all the idol was not the consumer he spread ashes on the floor at night and in the morning showed the king the telltale footmarks of men women and children the priests and their families the true devourers of the feast no wonder that after this the persians ruined the temple of bel while decay began in babylon and the river never being turned back into its proper bed spread into unwholesome marshes daniel when at susa a median city on the river ulai beheld his last vision when the angel gabriel prophesied to him in detail all the wars of the persians and afterwards of the greek kings of egypt and syria who should make judea their battlefield and the afflictions of the jews under the great syrian persecutor he ended with a sure promise to daniel himself that he should stand in his lot when the end of all things should come and some time after this blessed assurance died this man greatly beloved a prince a slave an exile and a statesman perhaps the most wonderful of all the sons of david except the great anointed one of whom he spoke his tomb is still deeply reverenced and no one is allowed to fish near the part of the river where he is said to have seen his vision  cyrus died about seven years after daniel much loved by his people who for many years would not believe him dead but trusted he would yet return to rule over them     lesson xiii  the rebuilding of the temple  the lord doth build up jerusalem and gather together the outcasts of israelpsalm clxxvii 2   42360 was the number of jews who returned to their own land by the permission of cyrus they were under the keeping of joshua the high priest and of zerubbabel son of salathiel who was either by birth son of king jehoiachin or else had been adopted by him from the line of nathan son of david in either way he was head of the house of david and would have been king had not the crown been taken away because of the sin of his fathers he had it is said won favour at the court of darius the mede by his cleverness in a contention of wits where each man was asked what was the strongest thing in existence one said it was wine because it made men lose their senses another said it was the king because of his great power but zerubbabel said it was woman and so ingeniously proved how women could sway the minds of men that the king was delighted and promised to give him whatever he would ask what zerubbabel requested was that the decree of cyrus might at once be put in force so that his people might go home to their own country darius consented and put into his hands orders that the vessels of the temple and all the other sacred things together with a large sum of money should be given to him and thus he went forth praising and blessing god some of the dispersed of israel joined the returning jews and were thenceforth counted among them but so many of judah itself had become settled in the place of their exile that they never returned though they sent gifts to assist in rebuilding jerusalem it used to be said that only the bran or coarse sort of people returned the fine flour remained but it must have in truth been in general the lovers of ease who stayed the faithful who loved poverty in the promised land better than wealth at babylon  zerubbabel was called tirshatha or governor his kingdom was gone but his right remained to the fields of boaz and jesse at bethlehem and thence should he come forth whose goings are from everlasting the true birthright was not lost by this son of solomon whom god blessed by the lips of zechariah for having laid the foundation of his temple and not having despised the day of small things the blessings to the priest joshua were foreshadowings of him whose name he bore and whose office he represented  all was ruin and desolation heaps of stones lay where beauteous buildings had been and the fields and vineyards lay waste but glad promises came by the mouth of zechariah that these empty streets should yet be filled with merry children at play and with aged men leaning on their staves at peace and at ease  the first thing done by these faithful men was to set up an altar among the ruins where they might offer the daily sacrifice once more then they began the temple in the second year after their return the trumpeters blew with silver trumpets the levites sang and the people shouted but what was joy to the young whose hope was fulfilled was grief to the old who had seen solomons temple in its glory where was the ark where the manna where the urim and thummim where the light upon the mercyseat gone for ever and heaps of ruins around the old men wept as the youths cried out for joy and the shout of rejoicing could barely be heard for the sound of wailing but haggai was sent to console them with the promise that though this house was as nothing in their eyes its glory should exceed that of the former one for the desire of all nations should come and fill this house with glory haggai had likewise to rebuke the people for their slackness in the work and for building their own houses instead of the temple and soon they fell into trouble the men of samaria children of those whom esarhaddon had planted there came saying that they worshipped the god of the jews and wished to be one with them but these half idolaters would soon have corrupted the jews so zerubbabel and joshua refused their offers this made them bitter foes to the jewish nation and they wrote to the persian court saying that these newly returned exiles were no better than a set of rebels who would destroy the kings power if they were allowed to rebuild their city cyrus was dead and his son cambyses called also ahasuerus who was a cruel selfish tyrant at once forbade the work to go on so that it was at a standstill for many years  the wealth and luxury of babylon were fast spoiling the persians who were losing their hardy ways and with them their honour mercy and truth and cambyses was a very savage wretch almost mad he made war on egypt where he gained a battle by putting a number of cows dogs and cats in front of his army and as the egyptians thought these creatures sacred they dared not throw their darts at them and so fled away he won the whole country and he afterwards marched into ethiopia where he nearly lost his whole army by thirst in a desert the egyptians hated him because he struck his sword into their sacred bull apis in his anger at their feasting in honour of this creature when he himself had just met with such misfortunes he had but one brother named smerdis whom he caused to be secretly put to death and when his sister wept for him he kicked her so that she died no one grieved when he was killed by a chance wound from his own sword in the year 522 but a young magian priest pretending to be smerdis whose death was not generally known became king however some of the nobles suspected the deceit and one of them whose daughter was among the many wives of the king sent word to her to find out whether the king were the real smerdis she could not tell having never seen the prince smerdis but her father who knew that the young magian had had his ears cut off for some offence told her to examine she answered that the king was earless and the fraud being thus detected seven of the great lords combined and slew him one daughter of cyrus still remained and the seven agreed that one of them should marry her and reign the rest should have the right of visiting him whenever they pleased and wearing the same sort of tiara or high cap with the point upright instead of having it turned back like the rest of the persians the choice was to be settled by heaven as they thought namely by seeing whose horse would first neigh at the rise of their god the sun darius hystaspes who thus became king in 521 was a good and upright man in whose reign the jews ventured to go on with the temple when the samaritans came and stopped them they wrote to beg that search might be made among the records of the kingdom for cyruss decree in their favour which no one could change because the laws of the medes and persians could not be altered the decree was found and darius gave the jews farther help and forbade anyone to molest them but they were very poor and the restoration went on but feebly  in dariuss reign babylon revolted and he laid siege to it so determined were the inhabitants to hold out that they killed their wives and children in order that the provisions might last longer and thus they fulfilled what isaiah had foretoldthat in one day the loss of children and widowhood would come on them the place was at last betrayed by a friend of darius who cut off his own nose and ears and showed himself bleeding at the gates pretending the king had done him this cruel injury the babylonians received and trusted him and he soon opened the gates to his master who terribly punished the rebels destroyed as much as he could of the temple of bel and left the city to go to decay so that she never again was the lady of kingdoms darius was a great king and records of his history are still to be read cut out in the face of the rocks but he tried two conquests that were far beyond his strength he led an army into the bare and dreary country of the scythians the wild sons of japhet near the mouth of the danube and there would have been almost starved to death but that a faithful camel loaded with provisions kept close to him he also sent a large fleet and army to subdue the brave and wise greeks who lived in the isles and peninsulas opposite to asia minor thinking he should easily bring them under his dominion but they met his troops at marathon and gained a great victory driving the persians home with great loss  darius died in 485 and his son xerxes who daniel had said should stir up all the east against grecia led a huge army to conquer that brave little country all the nations of the east were there and xerxes made a bridge of boats chained together over the hellespont for them to cross over so proud and hasty was he that when a storm destroyed his works he caused the waves to be scourged and fetters to be thrown into the sea to punish it for having dared to resist him he sat on his throne to see the army pass over the bridge and as he saw the multitudes he wept to think how soon they must all be dead but he did not cease from sending them to their death though they were so many the greeks were much braver and though they overran all the north part of the country after they had killed the few brave defenders of the little pass of thermopylae they could not keep what they had taken they were beaten both by land and sea and a very small remnant came home to persia in a wretched state xerxes was a weak vain boaster and was very angry he wanted to make another attempt but never did so he stayed at home feasting with his wives and living in luxury till he was murdered in the year 464     lesson xiv  the wall rebuilt  they that be of thee shall build the old waste places thou shall raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breachisaiah lviii 12   there is great difficulty as to what the persian kings were called their real names were very hard to pronounce and they are commonly known by words that mean a king instead of by their real names this makes people uncertain whether the king who is called ahasuerus in the book of esther be the same with him whom the greeks call xerxes or with artaxerxes the longarmed his son it was one or other of these kings who made a great banquet at his palace at shuahan or susa where the remains of the pillars that supported the manycoloured hangings of his palace are still to be seen after seven days feasting he sent in his pride for vashti his queen to show her beauty to his companions it was as it is still in persia and most eastern countries a shame and disgrace for a womans face to be seen by any man save her husband and vashti refused this insulting command of the king he was persuaded by the satraps that her example would teach all other ladies to think for themselves which did not suit these selfish men who did not care to have a wife for a helpmeet but only for a slave and toy so that poor vashti was set aside and degraded for being a modest woman and the tyrant sent and swept away every beautiful girl from her home to be brought to his palace on trial and if she did not become queen to be a slave for ever thus the young benjamite orphan esther whom her kinsman mordecai had tenderly trained in the right way was taken away never to see his face again but to live in the multitude of slavish heathen women who were taught no kind of employment and thought even spinning and embroidery unworthy of a queen but even the kings passion was made to serve gods ends it was for no vain purpose that the noble beauty of the family of saul had come down to esther and though she alone demanded no ornaments to set her off to advantage she was the only maiden who took the kings fancy mordecai her cousin soon after found out a plot against the kings life and sending her warning she told the king and he was thus saved mordecai daily sat at the palace gate to hear of his beloved cousin and there daily saw the kings new counsellor pass byhaman an agagite descended from that hateful amalekite nation whom saul ought to have totally destroyed mordecai would not bow before the man whom his law had taught him to loathe and haman taking offence and remembering the old enmity between the two nations that had begun at the battle of rephidim promised the king 10000 talents of silver for permission to let their enemies loose upon the jews in their still unwalled city and destroy them everywhere by a general slaughter the king actually granted this horrible request though without taking the bribe and haman setting the royal seal to his decree made it one of the unalterable persian laws the day was fixed for the massacre and haman prepared an enormous gallows on which to hang mordecai or as is supposed to nail him up alive but mordecai contrived to warn esther and order her to persuade the king to save their lives she was in a great strait for it was death to enter the kings presence unbidden unless he were in the mood to show mercy and should hold out his golden sceptre but in her extremity she took courage arrayed herself royally and came before him fainting with fear the power above stirred his heart and he held out the sceptre but she dared not accuse his favourite and only asked him and haman together to a banquet in her apartments twice she received them before she took courage to speak but at last she told the king that she and her people were sold to utter destruction he demanded in anger who had dared to do this the adversary and enemy is this wicked haman she said and when the king found how horrible a decree had been surprised from him and that the gallows had been made ready for the queens cousin the man who had saved his life he flew into such a rage that he caused haman to be hung on his own gallows at once and all his sons to be slain with him still the order to destroy the jews had gone forth and could not be repealed but mordecai obtained that the jews should be allowed to arm themselves and having due notice they defended themselves so well that they killed 800 of their enemies at susa and 75000 of the spiteful samaritans and other foes who had come upon them at jerusalem  esthers power with the king seems to have done more for the jews and a new gift was sent from the treasury to jerusalem under the care of ezra a man of the seed of aaron and very learned in the law he gave himself up to the work which had sadly languished since zerubbabels time and he began in the right way for ere entering the glorious land he halted all the companions of his pilgrimage and fasted three days entreating the lord for forgiveness and protection from their enemies it is from this time about 458 that the seventy weeks of years mentioned by daniel began to be counted perhaps because till this time the work hardly proceeded in earnest another great helper soon followed ezra namely nehemiah one of the palace slaves who hearing of the miserable state of jerusalem prayed with all his heart weeping so bitterly that when he went to wait upon the king and queen esther at their meal they remarked his trouble and on their asking the cause he told them with secret prayers how his heart was grieved that his city and his fathers sepulchres lay waste and begged for permission to go with authority to jerusalem to assist in the rebuilding his request was granted authority was given to him and he set off with a train of servants and guards for he was a very rich man but when he came near he left them all and rode on by night to examine the state of the city most sad was the sight the gates broken and burnt and the walls lying in ruins the streets blocked up so that no one could pass nehemiah at once encouraged the jews to set to work and build up the breaches and they heartily began while he kept open house at his own expense for all his poor brethren down upon them came the samaritans again scoffing at those feeble jews saying that a fox could break down their wall and then attacking them so that nehemiah was forced to set a constant watch and the workmen built with their swords ever ready for use when the walls once more girded around the city built upon the hill the inhabitants were no longer easily molested by their foes and a great assembly was held when ezra read and explained the law for seven days at the feast of the tabernacles after which there was a great fast and confession of sin and the covenant was solemnly renewed still a great purification was needed the sabbath had become ill observed many of the people even priests and levites had married heathen wives and one of the sons of the high priest was soninlaw to sanballat the worst enemy of the jews ezra and nehemiah brought many to a sense of their sin no burdens were allowed to be touched on the sabbath and the heathen wives were put away but this priest refusing to part with his wife was thrust out from the priesthood and was received by the samaritans who afterwards built a schismatical temple upon gerizim the mount of blessing  at this time lived malachi the last of the prophets who left the promise of the coming of the prophet elijah as the forerunner of the messiah and of the rising of the sun of righteousness ezra is believed to have composed the books of kings from older writings under the guidance of inspiration to have collected the latter part of the book of psalms and to have been taught to discern which histories and which books of the prophets to keep and which to cast aside the scriptures were all put under the keeping of scribes who wrote the copies out with the utmost care and were held guilty if the smallest point or mark failed and a roll was placed under the care of the priests besides many others which were dispersed through the country that they might never be forgotten again ezra likewise arranged that in places too far from jerusalem for people to come weekly to worship at the temple there should be synagogues or places of meeting for prayer though of course not for sacrifice there every sabbath day eighteen prayers were appointed to be said and lessons from the scripture were read aloud and explained in their exile the jews had forgotten their hebrew tongue and learnt to speak chaldean so that after the law was read in their own language a scribe stood up to translate and explain it and thus they were saved from forgetting the scripture as they had done in the time of josiah and from resorting to groves and high places for worship idolatry was so thoroughly purged out of them that they never returned to it and their hope of the messiah was kept alive though they had no new prophets  they enjoyed quiet and peace for many years and most of the jews who were settled in other countriesin persia babylon and egyptcame from time to time to keep the feasts and make offerings while those settled near enough kept the three yearly pilgrimages to jerusalem singing as it is believed the beautiful psalms called in the bible the songs of degrees as the parties from towns and villages went up together in procession towards the hill of sion  in the meantime their masters the persian kings grew worse and worse brother killed brother son rose against father and the women even committed horrible crimes they invented tortures too horrid to mention and lived between savage cruelty and vain luxury till there was no strength nor courage in them and in less than 200 years from the time that cyrus had conquered babylon their realm was rotten and their time of ruin was come all through this time the jews were chiefly ruled by the high priests though paying tribute to the persian king and sometimes visited by the satrap of the province of syria to which palestine belonged     lesson xv  alexander  ships shall come from chittim and shall afflict eber and shall afflict assurnum xxiv 24   mountain lands small islets and peninsulas broken into by deep bays and gulfs rise to the northward of the east end of the mediterranean and were known to the jews as the isles of the gentiles the people who dwelt in them have been named greeks they were sons of japhet and were the race whom god endowed above all others with gifts of the body and mind though without bestowing on them the light of his truth they had many idols of whom zeus the thunderer was the chief but they did not worship them with cruel rites like the phoenicians and some of their beautiful stories about them were full of traces of better things their best and wisest men were always straining their minds to feel after more satisfying knowledge of him who they felt sure must rule and govern all things and sometimes these philosophers as they were called came very near the truth every work of the greeks was well done whether poems history speeches buildings statues or painting and the remains have served for patterns ever since at first there were many separate little states but all held together as one nation and used to meet for great feasts especially for games there were the olympian games by which they reckoned the years and the isthmean which were held at the isthmus of corinth everyone came to see the wrestling boxing racing and throwing heavy weights and to hear the poems sung or recited and the men who excelled all the rest were carried high in air with shouts of joy and crowned with wreaths of laurel bay oak or parsley one of the greatest honours a greek could obtain of all the cities athens had the ablest men and sparta the most hardy and these two had been the foremost in beating and turning back the great persian armies of darius and xerxes but since that time there had been quarrels between these two powers and they grew weak so that philip king of macedon who had a kingdom to the north of them and was but half a real greek contrived to conquer them all and make them his subjects  the ensign of macedon was a hegoat the rough goat that daniel had seen in his vision and the time was come for the fall of the ram of persia philips son alexander set his heart on conquering the old enemy of greece and as soon as he came to the crown in the year 333 though he was but twenty years of age he led his army across the hellespont into asia minor his army was very brave and excellently trained by his father and he himself was one of the most highlygifted men who ever lived brave and prudent seldom cruel and trying to do good to all who fell under his power the poor weak luxurious persian king darius could do little against such a man and indeed did not come out to battle in the way to conquer for he carried with him all the luxuries of his palace his mother and all his wives and slaves before his army marched a number of men carrying silver altars on which burnt the sacred fire then came three hundred and sixtyfive youths in scarlet dresses to represent the days of the year then the magi and the gilded chariot and white horses of the sun and next the kings favourite soldiers called the immortal band whose robes were white their breastplates set with jewels and the handles of their spears golden they had small chance with the bold active greeks and at the battle of the issus they were routed and darius fled away leaving all his women to the mercy of the conqueror the poor old persian queen his mother had never met with such gentle respect and courtesy as alexander showed to her old age he always called her mother never sat down before her but at her request and never grieved her but once and that was by showing her a robe that his mother and sisters had spun woven and embroidered for him and offering to have her grandchildren taught the like works she fancied this meant that he was treating them like slaves and he could hardly make her understand that the greeks deemed such works an honour to the highest ladies and indeed thought their goddess of wisdom presided over them  while darius fled away alexander came south to palestine and laid siege to tyre upon the little isle to which he began to build a causeway across the water the tyrians had an image of the greek god apollo which they had stolen from a temple in greece and they chained this up to the statue of moloch their own god to hinder apollo from going over to help the greeks but neither this precaution nor their bravery could prevent them from being overcome as the prophet zechariah had foretold the lord will cast her out and will smite her power in the sea and she shall be devoured with fire  gaza also shall see it and shall be very sorrowful alexander took this brave philistine city after a siege of two months and behaved more cruelly there than was his wont it was the turn of jerusalem next but the lord had promised to encamp about his house because of him that passeth by and in answer to the prayers and sacrifices offered up by the jews god appeared to the high priest jaddua in a dream and bade him adorn the city and go out to meet the conqueror in his beautiful garments with all his priests in their ephods they obeyed and as alexander came up the hill sapha in front of the city be beheld the long ranks of priests and levites in their white array headed by the high priest with his robes bordered with bells and pomegranates and the fair mitre on his head inscribed with the words holiness unto the lord one moment and alexander was down from his horse adoring upon his knees his friends were amazed but he told them he adored not the man but him who had given him the priesthood and that just before he had left home the same figure had stood by his bed and told him that he should cross the sea and win all the chief lands of asia he then took jaddua by the hand and was led by him into the temple where he attended a sacrifice and was shown daniels prophecies of him as the brazen thighs the hegoat and the leopard he was much pleased and promised all jaddua asked that the jews might follow their own laws and pay no tribute on the sabbath years when the land lay fallow  alexander next passed on to egypt where he built at the mouth of the nile the famous city that still is called by his name alexandria indeed he founded cities everywhere and made more lasting changes than ever did conqueror in the short space of twelve years he then hunted darius into the mountain parts of the north of persia and after two more victories the greeks found the poor persian king dying on the ground from wounds given by his own subjects so the soft silver of persia yielded to the brazen might of greece after this alexander called himself king of persia and wore the tiara like an eastern king he took his men on to the borders of india but they thought they were getting beyond the end of the world and grew so frightened that he had to turn back all that the medes and persians had possessed now belonged to him and he wanted to make babylon his capital he made his court there and received messengers who paid him honour from all quarters but he was hurt by so much success he grew proud and passionate he feasted and drank too much and did violent and hasty things but worst of all he fancied himself a god and insisted that at home in greece sacrifices should be offered to him he tried to restore babylon to what it had been and set multitudes to work to clear away the rubbish and build up the temple of bel but when he ordered the jews to share in the work they answered that it was contrary to their law to labour at an idol temple and he listened to them releasing them from the command he wished to turn the waters of the euphrates back into their stream and drain the swamps into which they had spread but babylon was under the curse of god and was never to recover alexander caught a fever while going about surveying the unwholesome swamps and after trying to hold out against it for nine days his strength gave way he said there would be a mighty strife at his funeral perhaps recollecting how the prophecy had said that his kingdom should not continue and instead of trying to choose an heir he put his ring on the finger of his friend and very soon died he was but thirtytwo and had not reigned quite twelve years but perhaps no one ever did greater things in so short a time he died in the year 323 and so the great horn of the goat was broken when it was at the strongest no one hated him for though sometimes violent he had generally been kind he was frank open and freehanded warmhearted to his friends and seldom harsh to his enemies and he had done his best to educate and improve all the people whom he conquered it was owing to him that greek manners and habits prevailed and the greek tongue was spoken everywhere around the eastern end of the mediterranean though persia itself soon fell back into the old eastern ways babylon became almost deserted after his death the swamps grew worse till no one could live there and at last the only use of the great walls was to serve as an enclosure for a hunting ground where the wild beasts had their home and kept court for ever     lesson xvi  the greek kings of egypt  why hast thou then broken down her hedge that all they that go by pluck off her grapesps lxxx 12   the leopard of daniels vision had four headsthe great horn of the rough goat gave place to four horns so when alexander was taken away so suddenly from the midst of his conquests leaving no one in his room his great officers divided them between themselves and after much violence and bloodshed four greek kingdoms were formed out of the fragments of his conquests thrace macedon egypt and syria it is only the two last of which we have to speak the angel who spake to daniel called their princes the kings of the north and south the north or second kingdom of syria was very large and went from asia minor to the borders of india and it had two great capital cities antioch in syria and seleucia upon the tigris where the babylonians went to live when their city became deserted and uninhabitable both these places were named after the greek kings of syria who were by turns called seleucus and antiochus  it would have seemed natural for palestine to have belonged to syria but the greek king of egypt whose name was ptolemy lagos contrived to secure it he entered jerusalem on the sabbathday when the jews thought it wrong to fight and so he gained the city without a blow but this was no great misfortune to them for the first ptolemies were milder masters than the seleucidæ and did not oppress their subjects ptolemy however brought a colony of jews and samaritans to live in lybia and cyrene parts of egypt and so fulfilled isaiahs prophecy that five cities in egypt should speak the language of canaan they were treated with much favour for he saw that they were the most trustworthy of all his people indeed the greeks respected them much and one of ptolemys soldiers tells this story he says that while travelling in a large company by the red sea he fell in with a very brave strong jew called masollam presently the whole company came to a halt masollam asked why and a soothsayer pointing to a bird told him that if the bird stopped it would be lucky for them to stop if it flew on they might go on if it went back so must they all the answer masollam made was to fit an arrow to his bowstring and shoot the bird dead and when the greeks cried out at him he rebuked them for thinking the poor bird could know their future when he could not even save himself from the arrow  at this time the high priest was simon the just son of onias the same who is so highly praised in the fiftieth chapter of the book of ecclesiasticus and compared to the morning star and to a young cedar of libanus when he stood before the altar in his beautiful robes and turned round and blessed the people he was the last of the hundred and twenty great prophets or wise men whom the jews called the great synagogue and it was he who sealed up the old testament adding to the former collection the books of ezra nehemiah and malachi and it is thought compiling the books of chronicles from older writings for the genealogy of the house of david there given comes down to about the year 300 when he was alive since he died in 292 the jews thought nothing went so well with them after his time and were alarmed when the scapegoat with the band of scarlet wool on his brow instead of rushing down a precipice as usual and being killed at once ran off into the desert and was eaten by the arabs they enjoyed tolerable peace for the whole of the time they were under the greeks of egypt ptolemy lagos wanted to make his new city of alexandria as much famed for learning as athens and for this purpose he founded a great library there collecting from every quarter books written either on parchment or on the paper rush of egypt when he died in the year 284 his son ptolemy philadelphus or lover of his brethren went on still more eagerly seeking for curious writings and among those for which he wished were the holy scriptures as they were in hebrew he caused them to be translated into greek and the jews believe that this was done by seventytwo elders who were shut up all day two and two in thirtysix little cells in a palace on a little island in the nile each pair taking one book of the bible and going back every evening to sup with the king this history does not seem likely to be true but it is quite certain that a version of the old testament from the hebrew into greek was made about this time and is called the septuagint from this tradition about the seventy it came more and more into use as greek was considered the language of all learned men in the east most of the quotations in the new testament are taken from it and it is of great value in helping to show the exact meaning of the old hebrew  but if ptolemy did desire to have the scriptures in his own tongue it was only for curiosity not for edification for he was a great idolater and when his wife died he tried to build a temple to her at alexandria which was to have a loadstone arch with a steel statue of her in the middle where he hoped the equal attraction would keep it as if flying in the air but of course the fancy could not be carried out he had a quarrel with antiochus theos king of syria but it was made up by his giving his daughter berenice in marriage to the syrian as daniel had foretold the kings daughter of the south came to make an agreement with the king of the north but antiochus had another wife before whom he loved better so when in 246 ptolemy philadelphus died he put berenice away and took her back she requited him by poisoning him for fear her favour should not last and her son seleucus became king and taking berenice prisoner put her to death  but out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate which shall come with an army and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north this was the brother of berenice ptolemy euergetes or the benefactor who came out of egypt overran syria and killed the murderess carrying home much spoil and many of the egyptian gods which had been taken from the temples there in the time of cambyses ptolemy euergetes himself came to jerusalem and attended a sacrifice in the temple but greek learning was doing the jews no good and some began to reason like the heathen philosophers a man named joseph taught that people ought to be holy for the love of goodness and not for the sake of a reward after death and his follower zadok or sadoc went still farther saying that there was no promise of any reward his disciples who were called sadducees declared that the soul was not separate from the body but died with it that there were no angels nor spirits and that only the five books of moses were the real word of god thus casting aside all the prophecies such jews as abhorred this falling away kept themselves apart and were called pharisees from a word meaning separate and these grew the more strict in the observance of all that had come down to them from their fathers adding to it much that had gradually been put into the explanations and interpretations of the law which were read on the sabbath in the synagogue  ptolemy the benefactor was the last brave man of his family his son ptolemy philopator or lover of his father was weak and violent and had a disastrous war with antiochus the great of syria in the course of the conflict he came to jerusalem and tried to force his way into the holy of holies though the high priest and all the priests and levites withstood him and prayed aloud that the profanation might be hindered when he came to the court of the priests such a strange horror and terror fell on him that he reeled and fell and was carried out half dead but he was only hardened by this great wonder and on his return revenged himself by collecting the jews at alexandria and insisting that they should be marked with the ivy leaf the sign of the greek god of wine or else be made slaves or put to death out of many thousands only three hundred submitted to this disgraceful badge so in his rage he collected all the others in the theatre and caused elephants to be made drunken with wine and frankincense so that when driven in on them they might trample them to death but for two days following the king was too drunk himself to be present at the horrible spectacle and the jews had all that time for prayer and when on the third day the execution was to take place the beasts ran upon the spectators instead of upon the martyrs so that though numbers of greeks were killed not one jew was hurt and ptolemy gave up his attempt though he did afterwards commit one savage massacre on his jewish subjects he died when only thirtyseven years of age worn out by drunkenness and the jews who had learnt to hate the egyptian dominion gladly received the soldiers of his enemy antiochus the great into jerusalem deserting his young son who was only five years old and thus in the year 197 jerusalem came to belong to the seleucidæ of syria instead of to the ptolemies of egypt the history of ptolemy philopator in predicted from the 10th to the 13th verse of the 11th chapter of daniels prophecy the jews suffered terribly all through these wars which were usually fought out on their soil each sovereign robbed them in turn while they were too few to guard themselves and could do no otherwise than fall to the strongest     lesson xvii  the syrian persecution  the dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the air and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the landps lxxix 2   the history of antiochus the great is foretold in the 11th chapter of the prophet daniel from the 14th to the 19th verse on the death of ptolemy philopator this king entered palestine with a great army and easily obtained from the timeserving jews the surrender of jerusalem some of them who had forsaken their law to gain the favour of ptolemy were punished by antiochus because he knew that no trust could be placed in men who cared for their own profit more than for their god he then laid siege to gaza and to sidon and won great victories ravaging and consuming the adjoining lands with his armies and afterwards made peace with young ptolemy epiphanes giving him his daughter in marriage hoping that she would betray her husband to him she however entirely forsook him and made common cause with her husband after this the prophecy declared that he would turn his face to the isles and take many this meant that he should make an expedition to greece where he gained a good deal of land but here he came in contact with the iron power shadowed out by the great and terrible beast of daniels second vision  some four hundred years before this time the city of rome had begun to grow up on some of the seven hills on the banks of the tiber in italy the inhabitants were a stern earnest brave honest set of men not great thinkers like the greeks but great doers and caring for nothing so much as for their city and her honour they thought their own lives and happiness as nothing in comparison with rome and all the free citizens had a share in the government so that their citys concerns were their own their religion seems in early times to have been more solemn and grave than that of the greeks jupiter was their chief god the king of gods and men who held thunderbolts in his hand and they had eleven other principal gods but by the time they had learnt to write books they had begun to think these were the same gods as the greeks worshipped under other names they said jupiter was the same as zeus and told of him all the foolish stories which the worse sort of greeks had invented of zeus and as their religion grew worse they became more selfish proud and cruel at first their neighbours in italy were always fighting with them and their wars were for life or death but after nearly three hundred years of hard struggling without one years peace the romans had conquered them all and had safety at home but they had grown too fond of war to rest quietly so they built ships and attacked countries farther off beginning with the great phoenician city of carthage in africa which it is said was settled by canaanites who fled away from joshua and whose first queen was dido jezebels niece a great carthaginian general named hannibal who had been banished from home came to antiochus and offered to help him in his war upon greece this hannibal did chiefly out of hatred to the romans who were pretending to assist the greeks only that they might become their masters if antiochus had taken the advice of hannibal he might have succeeded better but he was selfwilled the romans gave him a terrible defeat and he was obliged to promise to pay a great sum of money and a heavy tribute afterwards to keep no elephants to be used in war and to give up his younger son antiochus as security for his performance of the conditions the tribute he had to pay to rome quite ruined him and while he was trying to rob an idol temple at elymais the people rose on him and slew him in the year 187  his son seleucus called by daniel a raiser of taxes was very poor in consequence of the tribute and therefore greedy he tried to raise money by sending his servant heliodorus to rob the temple at jerusalem onias the high priest and all the people were in great distress and made most earnest entreaties to god to deliver them from such profanation heliodorus came however to the temple and was pressing on to the treasury when suddenly a horse with a terrible rider appeared in armour like gold and cast the spoiler to the ground while two young men of marvellous beauty scourged him on either side so that when the heavenly champions had vanished he lay as one dead onias prayed for him and he was restored the same beings who had struck him down coming to reveal to him that his life was granted at the intercession of the high priest when he returned to his master and was consulted as to who might be a fit man to send to jerusalem he answered if thou hast any enemy or traitor send him thither and thou shalt receive him well scourged so little impression did such a revelation of glory make on that hard selfish heart the man who had been smitten by a visible angel could jest about it and soon went on to greater crime he poisoned his master in the hope of becoming king as seleucuss son was a hostage at rome that is he had been given as a pledge that the tribute should be paid but seleucuss brother antiochus who was on his way home from captivity at rome flattered the adjoining kings into helping him drove heliodorus away and became king in 178 he was the little horn of the grecian goat the vile person to whom they should not give the honour of the kingdom so much was it fallen since the time of his father antiochus the great vile indeed he was nearly mad with violence and excess going drunk about the streets of antioch crowned with roses and pelting with stones those who followed him so that the greeks laughed at him for calling himself antiochus epiphanes or the illustrious and said he was really antiochus the madman he cared little for the old greek gods but the roman jupiter a god whom his fathers knew not was his chief object of devotion and in his honour he instituted games like those of greece some of the jews had begun to weary of their perfect law and fancy it narrow and vulgar and the brothers of the good onias were among the worst joshua the next in age changed his glorious prophetic name to the greek jason and going to antioch offered a great sum of money to be made high priest and for leave to set up at jerusalem a place for the practice of the heathenish games of strength where men fought naked antiochus was but too glad of the offer so the good high priest was carried off to die a prisoner at antioch and the apostate was set up in his room in order to pervert the jewish youth to idolatry however he was soon overthrown by his apostate brother menelaus whom he had sent to pay the tribute at antioch and who when there promised the king a larger revenue and to bring all the jews to embrace the heathen worship jason fled to the ammonites and menelaus and his brother sold the gold vessels of the temple to the phoenicians the jews sent complaints to the king at tyre but instead of attending he murdered the messengers so much to the horror of the tyrians that they gave them honourable burial  antiochus now began a war with egypt dan xi 25 and while he was there jason came back from the ammonites and regained jerusalem but the news brought the king back in the utmost rage jason fled to greece and antiochus coming to jerusalem cruelly treated the people robbed the treasury himself went into the holy place led by that horrible traitor menelaus and uttering blasphemy he sacrificed a hog upon the altar and boiling the flesh sprinkled the temple with the broth carried off the candlestick and all the rest of the gold and when he went away to continue his wars he left a captain and garrison to oppress the jews and an old man to teach them the worship of jupiter a little altar for sacrifice to jupiter was raised on the true altar the temple was dedicated to jupiter as was also that of the samaritans on mount gerizim the sabbath was abolished so was circumcision and on the day of the kings birth in each month the jews were forced to eat swines flesh and partake of idol sacrifices and at the feast of the god of wine to carry ivy in the mad drunken processions in his honour  it was the most utter misery that had yet befallen the jews temple priesthood all gone we see not our tokens there is not one prophet more and yet that was the great time of glorious jewish martyrdoms numbers of the faithful were burnt to death together in a cave where they had met to keep the sabbath day two women who had circumcised their babes had them hung round their necks and were then pitched from the highest part of the wall of jerusalem and the aged scribe eleazar who was ninety years old when swines flesh was forced into his mouth spat it out again and was scourged to death saying with his last breath that he bore all this suffering because he feared the lord a mother and her seven sons were taken and as each refused to share in the idol rite and break the law they were put to death one by one with horrible tortures each before the eyes of his remaining brethren but the parting words of all were full of high hope and constancy the lord looketh on us and hath comfort in us said one the king of the world shall raise us up who have died for his laws unto everlasting life was spoken by another think not our nation is forsaken of god but abide awhile and behold his great power how he will torment thee and thy seed said another for they were as yet only faithful jews hope and forgiveness for their persecutors was for the christian the mother stood firmly by while each sons limbs were cut off and he was roasted to death over a fire and all her words were to exhort them to be stedfast and to assure them their creator could raise them if they died for him when the turn of the last son came the persecutors pitying his youth entreated him to change his resolution promising him riches and prosperity if he would adore the idol and even calling his mother to plead with him then the noble woman laughed the tyrant to scorn have pity on me my son she began but it was not by saving his life but by losing it that she bade him show pity on her so that she might receive him again with his brethren he made a still fuller confession than the resthe was slain by a still more savage torture and then his mother blessing god died gloriously like her sons others fled and lived in the mountains lurking in caves and feeding on wild roots and herbs of such st paul says they were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy     lesson xviii  the maccabees  in that day will i make jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people all that burden

his name there was a small town named modin near the sea shore whither a greek officer called apelles was sent to force the people into idolatry he set up an altar to one of his gods and having ordered all the inhabitants to assemble insisted on their doing sacrifice among them came a family of priests who from their ancestor hasmon were known as the asmoneans the father mattathias declared with a loud voice that he would permit no such dishonour to his god and the first jew who approached to offer incense was by him struck down and slain then with his five brave sons and others emboldened by his example he fell upon apelles drove him away and pulled down the idolatrous altar he then fled away to the hills where so many people joined him that he had a force sufficient to defend themselves from their enemies and he went round judea circumcising the children and rescuing the copies of the law which the greeks had seized from the synagogues some of these holy books which had been defiled by paintings of the heathen idols were destroyed by order of mattathias after the writing had been carefully copied it was at this time that the jews began to read lessons from the prophets in the synagogue because antiochus had only forbidden reading the law without specifying the prophetic books mattathias who was already an old man soon fell sick and gathering his sons about him reminded them of the deeds that god had wrought by the holy men of old and exhorting them to do boldly in defence of his covenant he appointed as their leader his third son judas who for his warlike might was called maccabæus or the hammerer and the second simon surnamed thassi one who increases was to be his chief adviser  in the year 166 judas maccabæus set up his standard with the motto who is like unto thee o lord among the gods the first letters of which words in hebrew made his surname maccabee he went through the land enforcing the law and putting the cities in a state of defence antiochus meantime was holding a mad and hateful festival at daphne but on hearing of the revolt of the jews he went into a great rage and sent a huge army to punish them maccabæus defeated this force drove it back to antioch and then marched to jerusalem and forced the greek garrison to take refuge in a fortress called akra on mount zion the courts of the temple were overgrown with shrubs which stood like a forest the priests chambers had been pulled down and the sanctuary lay desolate these brave men rent their clothes and wept at the sight and then set at once to repair the holy place their priestleader choosing out the most spotless among them for the work they pulled down the altar that had been defiled and setting aside its stones built a new one and out of the spoil that was in their hands renewed the candlestick the shewbread table and the altar of incense and then they newly dedicated the temple after three years of desolation the anniversary was ever after kept with gladness and was called the winter feast of dedication still judas was not strong enough to take the castle on mount zion but he built strong walls round the temple so that it too became a fortress and he then went to bethshan to defend the south border of judea against the edomites  these tidings terribly enraged antiochus who was gone on an expedition to persia and he designed to form a league with his neighbours for the utter destruction of the jews but he came to his end and none could help him for an overturn of his chariot so much increased an inward disease that had already begun that he fell into most horrible tortures and was in such a state of decay that scarcely anyone could bear to come near him horrible fears tormented him and in his remorse he repented of all the evil he had done to the jews and sent them a letter assuring them of his favour but it was now too late and he died in great misery in 164 his son antiochus eupator was only nine years old and his affairs were managed by a governor named lysias who continued the persecution and led an army to the relief of the garrison in mount zion judas marched out to meet him but was repulsed with the loss of six hundred men and of his younger brother eleazar who seeing an elephant of huge size with a tower of unusual height on its back thought the king himself must be there and running beneath it stabbed it so as to be crushed himself in its fall lysias then advanced upon jerusalem and laid close siege to it placing the jews in extreme peril just then another regent rose up against lysias and he made a hasty peace with maccabæus and was admitted into the city but when he saw its strength he broke his promises and overthrew the wall on his return to antioch he punished the apostate highpriest menelaus as the author of all these misfortunes by smothering him in a tower filled with ashes woe to the idol shepherd who had left his flock another half heathen named alcimus was appointed in his place and when the jews would not receive him brought down their enemies upon them again judas gained a victory and wrote to entreat the alliance and protection of the romans but ere the answer to his letter arrived he had with only 800 men fallen on a whole army of the syrians and was killed in the battle bc 161 his brothers jonathan and simon took up his body and buried it at modin in the tomb of their fathers and they continued to lead the faithful jews while alcimus held jerusalem and there began to alter the temple taking down the wall of separation between the courts of the jews and that of the gentiles but in the midst of the work he was smitten with palsy and died  it was the plan of the romans to take the part of a weak nation against a strong one because it afforded them an excuse for conquering the mightier of the two so they gave notice that the quarrels of the jews were their own and after much fighting jonathan obtained two years of peace and became highpriest onias the son of the good onias whom jason had set aside went to egypt and ministered in a temple built by the jews who had settled there  ever since the syrian kings had begun to misuse the jews they had grown weak and miserable antiochus eupator was dethroned and murdered by his cousin demetrius but shortly after a man named balas came forward calling himself the son of antiochus epiphanes and begging jonathan to take his part sending him a golden crown and purple robe and naming him commander of the jewish force in a battle in the year 153 demetrius was slain and balas became king both balas and his son antiochus treated jonathan with great favour and he fortified jerusalem got possession of many other towns and considerably strengthened the rightful cause but a wicked rebel named trypho who designed the murder of his young master antiochus began his conspiracy by treacherously assassinating jonathan in the land of gilead bc 143 and soon after succeeded in killing the young king  simon thassi was the only survivor of the brave maccabaean brothers but he finished their work and obtained from rome egypt and syria an acknowledgment that the jews were a free people and that he was their prince and priest he took the castle on mount zion from the syrians and so fortified the temple that it became like another citadel and he was honoured by all his neighbours he built a noble tomb for all his family at modin consisting of seven pyramids in honour of his father and mother and their five sons all covered in by a portico supported on seven pillars the whole of white marble and the pediment so high that it served for a mark for sailors at sea he died like his brave brethren by a bloody death being murdered at jericho bc 135 by his own soninlaw who hoped to usurp the government but his eldest son john hyrcanus was able to punish the murderer and to obtain the full authority by giving large presents both to the romans and syrians it is said that he found laid up in the sepulchre of david 3000 talents of silver which he used for this purpose hyrcanus was a very powerful and mighty prince and not only reigned over all judea but conquered edom with all the curious dwellings in the rocky caves of petra he brought the country under subjection circumcised the inhabitants and brought them under the mosaic law from that time idumea decayed and now has become an utter wilderness the carved faces of the rocks still witnessing to the truth of prophecy as they stand forth lonely and deserted in their grandeur though glowing freshly with the rosy marblings of the rocks of seir     lesson xix  the roman power  and he shall put a yoke of iron on thy neck until he have destroyed theedeut xxviii48   aristobulus the son of hyrcanus was called king as well as high priest of the jews but the mixture of worldly policy with the sacred office did not suit well and the asmonean kings were not like their fathers the maccabees still their courage and steadiness made the jews much respected and the greeks and romans around them began to read their books and there were some few who perceived that the religion there taught was purer than idolatry and wiser than the beat philosophy the kings were assisted in government by what was called the sanhedrim a council of a hundred and twenty of the scribes and of the chief priests namely the heads of the courses of priests this council met daily in a hall near the great gate of the temple and heard cases brought before them for judgment after the example of the seventy elders appointed by moses alexander janneus the son of aristobulus reigned from bc 104 to bc 77 and left his kingdom to his wife alexandra who trusted much to the pharisees and raised them to great power her eldest son hyrcanus was high priest and she left the kingdom to him at her death bc 69 but his brother aristobulus rebelling with the help of the sadducees defeated him and drove him from his throne  hyrcanua was indolent and was rather glad to be relieved from the trouble of reigning but his friend antipas an edomite by birth and of the jewish religion persuaded him that his life would not be safe in judea and stirred him up to ask help first from the arabs and when they were beaten from the romans to whom however aristobulus had already sent a present of a golden vine in hopes of winning their support  the great awfulness of the roman power was in the sureness of its conquests it did not fly onward without touching the earth like the great eastern conquerors but let it set one claw on a nation and the doom of that nation was fixed first the help of the romans was asked and readily given then in return a tribute was demanded and paid then the romans would meddle with the government till their interference became intolerable and there was a rising against it which they called rebellion then they sent an army and ruined the nation for ever the king queen generals and all the riches were carried to rome where the conqueror came in to enjoy what was called a triumph he was seated in a chariot drawn by white horses a laurel wreath round his head and all his captives and spoils displayed behind him the senate or council coming out to meet him and the people shouting for joy as they led him to the temple of jupiter to give thanks the captives were afterwards slain and as a farther festival the people were entertained with shows of gladiators namely slaves trained to fight even to death with each other or with wild beasts then the conquered land became a roman province after the magistrates had served a year at rome they were allowed to choose which province they would govern and there they did as they pleased and laid heavy burthens on the poor inhabitants for all men not of roman birth they called barbarian and used like slaves nor was there any hope of breaking this heavy bondage for each city was a station of roman soldiers who were the bravest and best disciplined in the world the army was divided into legions each about 6000 men strong with a silver eagle for the standard these were again subdivided into cohorts and again into hundreds each commanded by a centurion whose helmet had some mark by which his men might know him no soldier could miss his place either in battle on a march or in the perfect square camps which they set up wherever they halted they obeyed the least word and feared nothing and nothing could hold out against their steady skill perseverance and progress wherever they went they built fortresses and made wonderful straight solid roads some of which remain to this day and their ships and messengers going for ever from one province to another made their empire all like one country where the stern roman was the lord and the native was crushed down under his feet  they had just at this time put down the kingdom of syria and conquered nearly all asia minor their great general pompey was holding a court at damascus whither among ten other suppliant princes hyrcanus and aristobulus came to lay their cause before him thus asking a heathen who should be the priest of the most high pompey took the part of the elder as the rightful heir and led an army against jerusalem the siege lasted three months and so strong was the place that it would have held out much longer but that the jews would not defend themselves on the sabbath at least no more than enough to protect their own lives they would not disturb any of the operations of the siege nor keep the engines from the walls on that day and thus bc 63 the gentiles again entered jerusalem on the very day observed as a fast in memory of nebuchadnezzars conquest  pompey spared the city from plunder and touched none of the treasure in the temple but he would not be withheld from going into every part even into the holy of holies and though no immediate judgment followed it was remarked that from that time his prosperity left him he set up hyrcanus as high priest but not as kingmade him pay a tribute put him under the control of antipas and forbade him to extend his domains aristobulus and his sons were carried off to appear in pompeys triumph but their lives were spared thus judea by her own fault fell under the dominion of the fourth power with the teeth of iron  rome had hitherto been ruled by two consuls who were chosen every year and after their rule at home was over went to make war in the provinces but of late this plan had been wearing our and the great general julius caesar who had conquered france then called gaul and had visited britain was making himself overpowerful pompey stood up for the old laws but caesar was too strong for him and at last hunted him to egypt where he was murdered by the last of the ptolemies julius caesar who was one of the greatest warriors and most able men who ever lived managed rome as he chose and coming to syria confirmed hyrcanus in his rank and finding him careless and indolent made antipas procurator or governor for the romans and thus antipas and his son herod held all the real power in their hands though still under the romans going back to rome julius caesar became so powerful that it was thought he would make himself king and after four years some of the friends of the old laws killed him with their daggers in the senate house b c 44 after this there was great confusion and while augustus cæsar the nephew of julius gained power in the west mark antony another roman general came to egypt to attend to the affairs of the east he was a selfish licentious man who cared more for cleopatra the beautiful sister of the last ptolemy and queen of egypt than for rome or for his duty and he took bribes from herod to support his power over the old prince hyrcanus to whose daughter mariamne herod was betrothed  the son of the deposed aristobulus antigonus by name made friends with the parthians the descendants of the old persians and bursting into judæa when the nation was unprepared carried off poor old hyrcanus as a prisoner and cut off his ears that such a blemish might prevent him from ministering again as high priest herod escaping went to rome where he represented his case so ably that augustus and antony gave him men and money that he might drive out antigonus and promised that he should himself be king under them the roman army helped him to win back the country and as the caves in the hills were full of robbers he let down soldiers in boxes over the face of the precipices and thus contrived to destroy them all after a siege of six months he took jerusalem and antigonus surrendered to the romans who kept him prisoner for some time and then at herods entreaty put him to death  herod thus became king of the jews bc 37 he married mariamne who was very beautiful and amiable and thus he hoped to please the jews who were attached to the old line but as he was an idumean and therefore could not be high priest he gave the holy office to her brother until becoming fearful of the young princes just rights to the crown he caused his attendants to drown him while bathing and afterwards appointed high priests as he chose from the chief priests of the sanhedrim indeed herod lived in constant fear and hatred of every asmonean and at last even turned against his own wife mariamne he caused her to be put to death and then nearly broke his heart with grief for her and afterwards the same dread of the old royal stock led him to kill the two sons she had left to him  the seventy weeks of daniel were drawing to a close and everyone expected that the longpromised deliverer and king would appear some flatterers said it was herod himself the bloodstained edomite and he did all in his power to maintain the notion by repairing the temple with great care and cost making restorations there that were fortysix years in progress and spreading a golden vine over the front of the sanctuary  there were others who said the one great king whom even the heathen expected was coming to rome augustus cæsar had gained all the power he had beaten antony and cleopatra in a seafight and following them to egypt found that they had both killed themselves antony with his sword cleopatra by the bite of an asp in order to save themselves from being made prisoners augustus was welcomed at rome with a great triumph and was called emperor the name always given to a victorious general the romans gave him all their offices of state and he ruled over all their great dominions without anyone to dispute his power any enemy to conquer at home or abroad there was a great lull and hush all over the world for the time was come at last but the king was neither herod in judea nor augustus at rome nay herod as a son of edom was but proving that the sceptre had departed from judah and the reign of augustus was a time when darkness covered the earth and gross darkness the people for the greeks and romans had lost all the good that had been left in them and were given up to wicked cruelty and foul selfindulgence when one of their own heathen oracles was caused to announce to augustus that the greatest foe of the roman power should be a child born among the hebrews     lesson xx  the gospel  it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heelgen iii 15   it was in the 4004th year of the world the 30th of the empire of caesar augustus the 37th of the reign of herod the edomite that augustus wishing to know the number of his subjects so as to regulate the taxes paid by the conquered countries to provide corn for the poorer roman citizens sent out an edict that each person should enroll his name at his native place and there pay a piece of money thus the divine power brought it to pass that the blessed virgin who was about to bring forth a son should travel with her betrothed husband to the home of their fathers rachels burial place bethlehem the little city whence david had once been called away from the sheepfolds  there the stable of the ox and ass received the master of heaven and earth when his people considered him not and shut their doors when unto us a child was born unto us a son was given there the shepherds on the hills heard the angels sing their song of peace on earth good will to men there on the eighth day of his life on earth that child was circumcised and received the greek form of the divine name jehovah the saviour the same which had been borne before by the captain and by the priest who had led his people to their inheritance thence the desire of all nations was carried to his presentation in the temple he was truly the firstborn of all creation but he was only known to the aged simeon and devout anna as the messenger of the covenant the lord for whom they had waited to bethlehem came the mysterious wise men from the east they had been led by the star to jerusalem and were there directed on by the scribes learned in the prophecies but their inquiries had alarmed herods jealousy and he sent forth the savage order that the babes of bethlehem should all be murdered in hopes of cutting off the newborn king of the jews but while the mothers wept for the children who should come again to them in a better inheritance the holy one was safe in egypt whither joseph had carried him by the warning of god  this massacre was well nigh the last of herods cruelties he was already in failing health and after having killed his innocent sons because of their asmonean blood he was obliged to put to death the son of another of his wives for rebelling against him a terrible disease came on and fearing that the jews would rejoice at his death he declared they should have something to mourn for and sending for all the chief men to jericho where he lay sick he shut them all up in the circus or place for roman games and made his sister promise that the moment he expired soldiers should be sent in to kill them all in this devillike frame herod died in the seventieth year of his age and the thirtyfourth of his reign the first year of our lorda and his sister at once released the captives he had had nine wives and many children of whom he had himself put three to death archelaus and herod antipas were the sons of one mother herod philip of another and the murdered son of mariamne had left two children named herod agrippa and herodias archelaus took the kingdom but had not power to control either the people or the army three thousand jews were massacred by the soldiers in the temple and archelaus went to rome to beg to be confirmed on his throne and assisted in keeping his people in order but his brother herod antipas was there already begging for a share in the kingdom and the jews sent after archelaus saying we will not have this man to reign over us augustus thereupon refused to give to either the title of king but split palestine into four divisions called tetrarchies from tetra the greek word for four giving to archelaus judea samaria and idumea to antipas galilee to philip iturea the part beyond the jordan and to a greek named lysanias abilene in the north near mount hermon after this joseph returned from egypt but avoided the dominions of the cruel archelaus by going to his former abode in galilee  footnote a from the birth of our lord time is counted onwards and the years marked as ad anno domini year of the lord  archelaus grew so wicked that in the year 12 ad an accusation against him was sent to rome by the jews and samaritans and augustus deposed him sending him into banishment to vienne in gaul his brothers did not obtain his domain but it was joined to the province of syria and put under the charge of a roman procurator or governor who kept down disturbances by the strong hand but this made the pharisees very discontented as they fancied it was against the divine law to pay tribute to strangers augustus had been all his life busy in setting his empire in order and making laws for it it stretched from the atlantic ocean nearly to the river euphrates and bordered the mediterranean sea on both sides the alps shutting it in to the north and the deserts of africa to the south the roman citizens considered themselves the lords of all this space and though at first only the trueborn romans were citizens augustus gave the honour to many persons of the subject nations it freed them from being taxed gave them a right to vote for magistrates and saved them from being under the authority of the governors of the provinces every educated person spoke latin and greek but the latter tongue was most used in the east as the romans themselves learnt it as an accomplishment augustus died ad 17 leaving his power to his stepson tiberius whom he had adopted as his own son and thus given him the name of caesar tiberius had not been kindly treated in his youth and he was gloomy and harsh and exceedingly disliked by the romans under him pontius pilate was made procurator of judea and took up his abode in caesarea a city built by herod and him son philip on the coast and named after the emperors pilate set up shields with idolatrous inscriptions in jerusalem but the jews petitioned tiberius who ordered them to be removed and there was much hatred between the procurator and the jews the thirty years of silent bearing of the common lot of man were now nearly over and six months ere the messiah began to make himself known his messenger john the desert priest began to prepare his way by preaching repentance in the spirit and power of the great elijah and then baptizing in the jordan unto repentance such washing was the manner in which the jews accepted their proselytes as they called the strangers who embraced the law the great purpose of the old covenant was accomplished when john having made his followers feel all the weight of their sins against the commandments pointed out him whom he had already baptized and said behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world a few faithful galileans followed and believed and miracles began to testify that here was indeed the christ the prophet like to moses giving bread to the hungry eyes to the blind feet to the lame decreasing as he increased john offended herod antipas by boldly rebuking vice this antipas had forsaken his own wife the daughter of an arabian king and had taken in her stead his niece herodias the wife of his brother philip and for bearing witness against this crime john was thrown into prison and afterwards beheaded to gratify the wicked woman and her daughter salome the arab king avenged his daughters wrongs by a war in which antipas met with a great defeat  meanwhile the pharisees and sadducees their heads full of the prophecies of greatness and deliverance to which their minds gave a temporal not a spiritual meaning grew more and more enraged at every token that the lowly nazarene was indeed the saviour the hope of the whole world each token of perfection each saying too pure for them each undoubted miracle only made them more furious and for once they made common cause together the passover came herod antipas came to jerusalem to observe the feast pilate to keep the peace among the jews and jerusalem saw her king coming meek and riding on an ass and amid the hosannas of the children weeping at the vengeance that he foresaw for the favoured city where he had been despised and rejected and where he was himself about to become the true passover which should purchase everlasting redemption  the traitor sold him to the sanhedrim or council in which the last words of the prophecy through the priesthood had declared that one man must die for the people and a band of roman soldiers was obtained from pilate meanwhile our blessed lord instituted the new passover the communion by which all the faithful should be enabled to partake of the great sacrifice then he went out to the garden among the grey olives which still stand beside the brook kedron and there after his night of agony he was betrayed by a kiss and dragged before the high priest under an accusation of blasphemy but as the sanhedrim had not power of life and death and such a charge would have mattered little to a roman a political offence was invented to bring before pilate the procurator perceived the innocence of the holy one but feared to befriend him because of the raging multitude and after vainly trying to shift the responsibility on herod antipas he washed his hands to show that it was no affair of his own and gave the victim up to the murderers they chose the most shameful death of roman slaves that they might show their hatred and contempt unwitting that each act and each word had been foretold and foreshown in their own law and prophets for six hours he hung on his cross while the sun was dark and awe crept on the most ignorant hearts then came the cry it is finished and the work was done the sinless sacrifice had died the price of adams sin was paid the veil of the temple was rent in twain to show that the way to the true mercyseat was opened the rich man buried himthe women watched and when the sabbath was over the tomb was broken through and the

law were fulfilled the shadows passed away and substance took their place so that the comers thereunto might be made perfect instead of being admitted to the covenant by circumcision which was only a type of putting away the uncleanness of the flesh the believers were washed from sin in the now fully revealed name of the holy trinity in the fountain of christs blood open for all sin and uncleanness and the penitent had a right to be constantly purified in the living cleansing streams of grace and pardon the one great passover had been offered to redeem the chosen from the slavery of satan and the highway was opened for the ransomed to pass over with songs of joy keeping the resurrection day instead of the sabbath means had been given of their constantly partaking of that passover the lamb slain from the foundation of the world and thus tasting of the eternal sacrifice in right of which they prayed to the father to whom they were united as members of his son the one great day of atonement was over and the true high priest had entered for ever into the holy place opening a way where all might follow to the mercy seat there offering his own sacrifice and presenting their prayers and even in heaven he still was the shepherd of the little flock to whom it was his good pleasure to give the kingdom feeding them appointing under shepherds and guarding them gently from his throne above the sealed book of type and prophecy was open and clear at his touch and the old testament found full explanation and fulfilment in the new and now it remained to make known the good tidings and gather in all nations jew and gentile alike to the lords flock the church or house of the lord as it was called  one hundred and twenty believers in their risen lord awaited together the coming of the promised comforter who should abide with them for ever to guide them into all truth and to enable them to proclaim the accomplishment of all the promises the eleven apostles who as their name1 implied had been sent forth by their lord added to their number matthias in the place of the traitor judas laying hands on him in order to carry on the gift that the saviour had breathed upon them besides these there were the seventy whom our lord had sent out in pairs and whose order was afterwards called the elders presbyters or priests  they were all gathered in the upper room to keep the feast of weeks in memory of the giving the law when he came upon them who could enable that law to be kept bringing the divine presence which is the pervading life of the whole body his coming was marked by such open signs as to draw the attention of all the pilgrim jews who had come from their distant homes to keep the feast st peter expounded to them that the time of fulfilment was come and that jesus crucified and risen was their salvation 3000 at once accepted the new covenant and were baptized and thus on the day of pentecost ad 33 the church of christ sprang into full life many of the converts sold their goods and brought the price to the apostles all living on one common stock and giving bounteous alms but the new converts of greek education found their poor less well provided than the native jews and to supply them seven deacons or ministers were set apart as the serving order of the ministry foremost of these was stephen who about two years after the ascension bore the

before his illness herod agrippa the son of herod the greats murdered son aristobulus while driving in a chariot with him had said how glad everyone would be to see him reigning the charioteer reported the speech and tiberius punished it by keeping herod in prison chained to a soldier but to make up for his sufferings caligula no sooner became emperor than he set him free gave him a crown made him king of trachonitis and abilene and presented him with a gold chain of the same weight as the fetters which he had worn in prison this chain herod hung up in the temple for he was a zealous jew although such a friend of heathen princes and he seems to have been greatly puffed up with admiration of his own good management his sister herodias envious of his crown persuaded her husband herod antipas to go and sue for another at rome but all he gained by his journey was an inquiry into his conduct which ended in his being exiled to gaul and his domain being given to herod agrippa in ad 41 the miserable madman caligula was killed but herod agrippa continued in high favour with the next emperor the moody claudius and under him the jews had again the power of giving sentence of death they used it to persecute the disciples and this led to many leaving jerusalem and carrying the knowledge of the faith to more distant parts saul or paul a benjamite born at tarsus in asia minor a place where the inhabitants were reckoned as roman citizens was learned in greek philosophy and deeply versed in the jewish doctrines he was a zealous pharisee and a vehement persecutor till he was called by the lord himself from heaven and told that his special mission should be to the gentiles and about the same time it was revealed to st peter in a vision that the hedge of the ceremonial law was taken down and no distinction should henceforth be made between the nations who had been all alike cleansed by the blood of redemption the roman soldier cornelius was the firstfruits of a mighty harvest and the greeks and romans in general gave far more ready audience to the apostles than did the jews  the hatred of the jews moved herod agrippa to put to death james the son of zebedee the first apostle to drink of his masters cup and he would likewise have slain peter had not the angel delivered that saint out of prison in answer to the prayers of the church the pride of herod had come to a height he celebrated games at cæsarea in honour of the emperor and in the midst came forth in a robe of cloth of silver to give audience to an embassy from tyre and zidon at his speech the people shouted it is the voice of a god not the voice of a man but while herod listened and took the glory to himself he felt a deadly stroke which made him cry your god is dying and in five days he was dead his son agrippa was too young to take the government and a roman procurator was appointed  about this time the apostles departed on their several missions it is said that ere doing so they agreed on the creed or watchword of the church but it was not written down till more than three hundred years later lest the heathen should learn it and blaspheme it wherever they went they ordained elders and deacons and in most cities they left one to whom they had conveyed their own apostolic powers these were not called apostles as that name was kept for those sent by our lord in person but sometimes angels or messengers and usually bishops or overlookers of the shepherds st james the cousin of our lord remained as apostle of jerusalem while his brothers sts simon and jude went into mesopotamia st andrew to arabia his brother st peter to the dispersed jews st john and st philip to asia minor sts thomas and bartholomew to india sts matthew and matthias to ethiopia but not till the former had written his gospel which several of the apostles carried with them and which has been found in possession of the most ancient churches by them converted  little is known of their labours as from this time the acts of the apostles chiefly dwell on the history of st paul but it seems certain that everywhere they began by preaching to the dispersed jews and when these rejected the offer of salvation they turned to the heathen by whom in general it was far more readily received the romans heeding this worlds greatness more than any spiritual matter were not inclined to interfere with any ones religion and only fancied the church a sect of the jews they usually gave the apostles their protection if the jews raged against them and their ships their roads and the universality of their dominion made the spread of the gospel much more easy so that they were made to prepare the way of the lord even while seeking only their own grandeur it was about this time that the emperor claudius came to britain and his generals won all the southern part of the island rooting out the cruel worship of the druids in their groves of oak and circles of huge stones he died in the year 55 and was succeeded by his stepson nero a halfmad tyrant who used to show off like a gladiator racing in a chariot before all the romans at the games collecting them all to listen to his verses and putting those to death who showed their weariness he was so jealous and afraid of plots on his life that he killed almost all his relations even his mother for fear they should conspire against him and all the richer and nobler romans lived in terror under him though the common people liked him for being openhanded and amusing them with the cruel gladiator shows     lesson xxii  the apostle of the gentiles  of benjamin he said the beloved of the lord shall dwell in safety by him and the lord shall cover him all the day long and he shall dwell between his shouldersdeut xxxiii 12  after sauls marvellous call from heaven he spent three years in solitude in arabia ere entering on his work then returning to damascus he began to set forth the gospel the jews were so angry at his change that they stirred up the soldiers of the arabian king aretas and he only escaped them by being let down over the wall in a basket coming to jerusalem the gentle levite barnabas was the first to welcome him and present him to the company of the apostles but he spent some years in retirement at his home at tarsus before barnabas summoned him to come and aid in his preaching at antioch there the word was heartily received and the precious title of christians was first bestowed upon the disciples there too on the occasion of a famine in judea the first collection of alms for brethren at a distance was made  at antioch a heavenly revelation signified that paul and barnabas were to be set apart for a special mission and after prayer and consecration they set out on their mission accompanied by the nephew of barnabas john surnamed mark barnabas had once had great possessions in the isle of cyprus and thither they first repaired preaching in all the chief places and then going into asia minor where they showed such power from on high that the rude people of lycaonia fancied them gods in the likeness of men and had wellnigh done sacrifice to them though afterwards the spiteful jews led the same men to draw paul out of the city stone him and leave him for dead in such perils marks heart failed him and he departed from them  returning to antioch they found the church in doubt whether the christians of greek birth were bound to obey the rites of the jewish law to decide this paul and barnabas went to jerusalem after fourteen years absence taking with them a greek named titus and here was held the first general council of the church a meeting of her apostles and elders in the full certainty that the divine grace would inspire a right judgment according to the promise that christ would be with those who should meet in his name st james presided and st peter spoke and it was decided that the whole object of these rites had been fulfilled therefore that they were among the old things that had passed away and that no such rule need be imposed on the gentiles save that given to noah ere the parting of the nations it was agreed that st paul should go especially to the gentiles and st peter and st john to the scattered jews while st james remained at jerusalem two jewish christians silas and barsabas went back with the two apostles to notify the resolution to the church at antioch and st peter shortly followed them but there continued to be a great tendency among the christians of jewish blood to avoid their gentile brethren and st peter was drawn in to do the same so that st paul always more stedfast was forced to rebuke him paul and barnabas intended to set out on a second journey and barnabas wished again to take his now repentant nephew but paul would not trust him a second time and after a dispute on the subject barnabas left him and took mark to cyprus where it is believed that the son of consolation was at length martyred  paul taking silas as his companion went over the former ground in asia minor and at iconium ordained a disciple named timothy whose father was a greek but whose jewish mother and grandmother had faithfully bred him up in the knowledge of the scriptures a greek physician named luke likewise at this time joined him and with these faithful companions he obeyed a call sent him in a dream and crossed over into macedon where he gained many souls at philippi and thessalonica but the jews stirred up such persecution that he was forced to go southward into greece athens was no longer a powerful city but it served as a sort of college for all the youths of the roman empire who wished to be highly educated and it was full of philosophers who spent their time in the porticos and groves arguing on questions of their ownsuch as whether this life being all of which they were sure it was best to live well or to live in pleasure the stoics were the philosophers who upheld the love of virtue and honour the epicureans said that it was of no use to vex themselves in this life but that they might as well enjoy themselves while they had time st paul was well learned in all these questions and set forth to the athenian students in glorious words that the truth was come for which they had so long yearned and declared to them the unknown god whom they already worshipped in ignorance some few believed but the others were too fond of their own empty reasonings and athens long continued the stronghold of heathenism he had better success at corinth where he spent eighteen months working at his trade as a tentmaker and whence he wrote his two epistles to his thessalonian converts about the time that st luke was writing his gospel it is thought by direct revelation since neither he nor st paul had been with our lord the jews hunted them away at last after a short stay at jerusalem they went back to asia minor and passed three years at ephesus whence were written the epistle to the galatians against the jewish practices and the first to the corinthians on some disorders in their church ephesus was the chief city in asia minor and contained an image of the greek goddess of the moon diana placed in a temple so beautiful that it was esteemed one of the seven wonders of the world and thither came a great concourse of worshippers there was a silversmith who made great gain by selling small models of her temple and he growing afraid that his trade would be ruined if idols were deserted stirred up the mechanics to such a frenzy of rage that for two hours they shouted great is diana of the ephesians and they would have torn paul to pieces had they not been with much difficulty appeased he was obliged to leave the city and go to macedonia whence he again wrote to the corinthians to console them in their repentance and he also wrote to the church at rome which he had never yet seen after visiting the greek churches a divine summons called him back to keep the feast of pentecost at jerusalem though well knowing that bonds and imprisonment awaited him there and on his way he had a most touching meeting at miletus with the elders of ephesus who sorrowed grievously that they should see his face no more his beloved timothy was left with them as their bishop  at jerusalem a terrible tumult arose against him for having as the jews fancied brought greeks into the temple and he was only rescued by the roman garrison who treated him well on finding that he was a citizen then the jews laid a plot to murder him and to prevent this he was sent to the seat of government at cæsarea where he was brought before the procurator felix and his wife drusilla a daughter of herod agrippa his words made felix tremble but the timeserver put them aside and neither released him nor sent him to rome for judgment but on going out of office left him in prison festus the new procurator could not understand his case and asked the young agrippa and his sister bernice to help him to find out under what accusation to send him to rome again st pauls speech struck his hearers with awe and agrippa declared himself almost persuaded to be a christian but he loved too well the favour of the jews and romans and his petty tetrarchy of trachonitis to become one of the despised sect the noble captive would have been set free but that he had sent his appeal to rome and therefore could only be tried there  on his way coasting along as sailors did before the compass was known came his shipwreck at malta when the life of his shipmates was granted to him the emperor nero was so much more disposed to amusement than business that st pauls cause was not heard but he lived in his own hired house under charge of a soldier seeing the christians freely and writing three beautiful epistles full of hope and encouragement to his children at ephesus colosse and philippi also a friendly intercession for a runaway slave to philemon and letters of pastoral counsel to timothy at ephesus and to titus who was bishop of crete it is thought that the epistle to the hebrews which shows how the old covenant points throughout to the new must be also of this date but we have no longer the inspired pen of st luke to tell of st pauls history and it is not certain whether he were ever at liberty again though some think that he was free for a short time and went to spain gaul and even to britain st peter had likewise come to rome he had met with st mark and taken him as his companion and as it is believed assisted in composing his gospel st peter likewise wrote two epistles to the jews dispersed abroad but dark times were coming on the church st james who left an epistle was in his old age slain by the jews who cast him from the top of the temple and then beat out his brains the emperor nero had also broken out in sudden rage in a fit of folly he set rome on fire to see how the flames would look and then persuaded the citizens that it was done by the christians st peter who is considered as the first bishop of rome and st paul were thrown into a dungeon and about that time paul wrote his last letter to call to his side timothy and also the once weak mark now profitable to the ministry even as the ever faithful luke the fight was over the crown was ready and on the same day the two apostles went to receive it the roman citizen by the sword the jewish fisherman by the cross esteemed dishonour by the romans but overmuch glory by the saint who begged to suffer with his head downwards so as not to presume on the very same death as that of his master many christians likewise perished thrown to wild beasts or smeared with grease and then slowly burnt to light the romans at their horrible sports but to them death was gain and the church was only strengthened st timothy went back to his post at ephesus and st mark founded a church at alexandria where many years later he was martyred by being dragged to death through the streets     lesson xxiii  the fall of jerusalem  the lord hath accomplished his fury he hath poured out his fierce anger and hath kindled a fire in zion and it hath devoured the foundations thereoflam iv 11  in his triumphal entry into jerusalem oar lord had wept for the woes of the city which would not own him and had foretold that the present generation should not pass away until his mournful words had been fulfilled one alone of his apostles was left to tarry until this coming for vengeance the rest had all gone through the pains of martyrdom to their thrones in heaven st andrew died in greece bound on a cross shaped like the letter x and preaching to the last his friend st philip had likewise received the glory of the cross in asia and the last of the bethsaida band st bartholomew was tied to a tree and flayed alive in armenia st matthew and st matthias died in ethiopia or abyssinia leaving a church which is still in existence and st thomas was slain by the brahmins in india where the christians of st thomas ever after kept up their faith among the heathen around st jude died in mesopotamia after writing an epistle to his flock and his brother st simon zelotes also went by the same path to his rest but their deaths only strengthened the church and their successors carried out the same work  the judgments of god were darkening around jerusalem a procurator named florus was more cruel and insulting than usual and a tumult broke out against him agrippa tried to appease it but the jews pelted him with stones and drove him out of jerusalem they afterwards burnt down his palace and rose in rebellion all over judea imagining that the prophesied time of deliverance was come and that the warlike messiah of their imagination was at hand nero was much enraged at the tidings and sent an army under a plain blunt general named vespasian to punish the revolt this army subdued galilee and samaria and was already surrounding jerusalem when vespasian heard that there had been a great rebellion at home and that nero had been killed he therefore turned back from the siege to wait and see what would happen having thus given the token promised by our lord of the time when the desolation of jerusalem should be at hand when the faithful were to flee accordingly in this pause all the christians marking well the signs of coming wrath took refuge in the hills while the way was still open armies were seen fighting in the clouds a voice was heard in the holy of holies saying let us depart hence the heavilybarred gate of the temple flew open of its own accord and a man wandered up and down the streets day and night crying woe to jerusalem woe woe the jews were hardened against all warning they had no lawful head but there were three parties under different chiefs who equally hated the romans and one another they fought in the streets so that the city was full of blood and fires consumed a great quantity of the food laid up against the siege yet still the blind jews came pressing into it in multitudes to keep the now unmeaning feast of the passover even at the time when vespasians son titus was leading his forces to the siege  it was the year 70 thirtyseven years since that true passover when the jews had slain the true lamb and had cried his blood be on us and our children what a passover was that when one raging multitude pursued another into the temple and stained the courts with the blood of numbers meanwhile titus came up to the valleys around the crowned hill and shut the city in on every side digging a trench and guarding it closely that no food might be carried in and hunger might waste away the strength of those within then began the utmost fulfilment of the curses laid up in the law for the miserable race the chiefs and their parties tore each other to pieces whenever they were not fighting with the enemy blood flowed everywhere and robbers rushed through the streets snatching away every fragment of food from the weak the famine was so deadly that the miserable creatures preyed on the carcases of the dead nay the tender and delicate woman was found who in the straits of hunger killed her own babe roasted and fed upon him so many corpses were thrown over the walls that the narrow valleys were choked and titus in horror cried out that the jews not himself must be accountable for this destruction  for the sake of the christian fugitives in the mountains these dreadful days were shortened and were not in the winter and in august tituss soldiers were enabled to make an entrance into the temple for the sake of its glorious beauty he bade that the building should be spared but it was under the sentence of our lord and his command was in vain a soldier threw a torch through a golden window and the flames spread fast while the fight raged the space round the altar was heaped with corpses and streams of blood flowed like rivers ere the flames reached the sanctuary titus went into it and was so much struck with its beauty that he did his utmost to save it but all in vain and the whole was burnt with 6000 poor creatures whom a false prophet had led to the temple promising that a wonder should there be worked for their deliverance the city still held out for twenty more days of untold misery but at last the romans broke in amid flames quenched in blood and slaughter raged everywhere yet it was a still sadder sight to find the upper rooms of the houses filled with corpses of women and children dead of hunger and indeed no less than a million of persons had perished in the siege while there were 97000 miserable captives 12000 of whom died at once from hunger as titus looked at the walls and towers he cried out that god himself must have been against the jews since he himself could never have driven them from such fortresses he commanded the whole especially the temple to be leveled with the ground no two stones left standing and the foundation to be sown with salt and he carried off the candlestick shewbread table and other sacred ornaments to be displayed in his triumph an arch was set up at rome in honour of his victory with the likeness of these treasures sculptured on it it is still standing and the figures there carved are the chief means we have of knowing what these holy ornaments were really like he gave the jews some to work in the egyptian mines some to fight with wild beasts to amuse the romans and many more to be sold as slaves other people thus dispersed had become fused into other nations but it was not so with the jews slay them not lest my people forget it but scatter them abroad among the heathen had been the prophecy of the psalmist and thus it has remained even to the present day the piteous words of moses have been literally fulfilled and among the nations they have found no ease neither has the sole of their foot found any rest but the trembling heart and failing eye and sorrowful mind have always been theirs they have ever been loathed and persecuted by the nations where their lot has been cast ever craving for their lost home ever hoping for the messiah of their own fancy still they keep their sabbath on the seventh day still they follow the rules of clean and unclean and on each friday such as still live at jerusalem sit with their faces to the wall and lift up their voice in mournful wailing for their desolation their goodly land lies waste the sky above like brass the earth beneath like iron her fruitfulness is over and from end to end she is a country of ruins a sign to all nations some there are who read in the prophecies hopes for the jews that they may yet return and learn who is the saviour others doubt whether this means that they will ever be restored as a nation and still the jews stand as a witness that god keeps his word in wrath as well as in mercya warning that the children of the free new covenant must fear while they are thankful     lesson xxiv  the primitive church      i will also take of the highest branch of the high

jerusalem was destroyed happened the first great eruption of the volcano mount vesuvius in which was killed drusilla the wife of felix her brother agrippa ruled by favour of the romans for many years in the little domain of chalcis titus was emperor after his father he was a very kindhearted man and used to say he had lost a day whenever he had spent one without doing a good action but he was soon poisoned by his wicked brother domitian who succeeded to his throne in 81 domitian was a savage tyrant cruel to all because he was afraid of all he hated the jews and hearing that some persons of royal blood still existed among them he caused search to be made for them and two sons of st jude were brought before him they owned that they came of the line of david but they told him they were poor simple men and showed him their hands hardened with toil and he thought they could do him so little harm that he let them go he also laid hands on the aged st john and caused him to be put into a caldron of boiling oil but the martyr in will though not in deed felt no hurt and was thereupon banished to the little greek isle of patmos here was vouchsafed to him a wonderful vision answering to those of daniel his likeness among the prophets he saw the true heavenly courts such as moses had shadowed in the tabernacle and which ezekiel had described so minutely he saw the same fourfold cherubim and listened to the same threefold chant of praise as isaiah had heard he saw the seven lamps of fire and the rainbow of mercy round about the throne and in the midst in the eternal glory of his priestly robes he beheld him on whose bosom be had lain and who had called him beloved from his lips he wrote messages of counsel and warning to the angels or bishops of the seven churches of asia minor and then came a succession of wonderful visions each opening with the church in heaven and in earth constantly glorifying him that sitteth on the throne and the lamb for ever and ever but going on to show the crimes in the world beneath and the judgments one after another poured out by the angels the true remnant of the church persecuted and the world partly curbed by partly corrupting the visible church then the destruction of the wicked world under the type of babylon the last judgment the eternal punishment of the sinful the final union of christ and his church and the eternal blessedness of the faithful in the heavenly jerusalem with the tree of life restored  when domitian was killed in 86 st john went back to ephesus and there wrote his gospel to fill up what had been left out by the other three evangelists and especially dwelling on the discourses of the lord of life and love that same sweet sound of love rings through his three epistles and yet that heartwhole love of his master made him severe for he started away from a house he had entered and would not go near it while it contained a former believer who had blasphemed christ a young man whom he had once converted fell into evil courses in his absence and even became a tobber st john like the good shepherd himself went out into the wilderness to find him and was taken by the thieves when his convert saw him he would have fled in shame and terror but st john held out his arms called him back and rested not till he had won him to repentance so gentle was he to all living things that he was seen nursing a partridge in his hands and when he became too old to preach to the people he used to hold out his hands in blessing and say little children love one another he died in the year 100 just before the first great storm which was to try the church  the emperor trajan had found out that the iron of the roman temper had become mixed with miry clay and that the men of his time were very different from their fathers and much less brave and public spirited he fancied this was the fault of new ways and that christianity was one of these there were christians everywhere in every town of every province nobles soldiers women slaves rich and poor all feeling themselves members of one body all with the same faith the same prayers and sacraments all day they did their daily tasks only refusing to show any honour to idols such as pouring out wine to the gods before partaking of food or paying adoration to the figures of the cæsars which were carried with the eagle standards of the army and so close was the brotherhood between them that the heathen used to say see how these christians love one another at night they endeavoured to meet in some secret chamber or underground cave at rome the usual place was the catacombs great vaults whence the soft stone for building the city had been dug out and where the quarrymen alone knew the way through the long winding passages here in the very early morning of lords day the christians made every effort to assemble for they were sure of meeting their bishop and of receiving the holy communion to strengthen them for the trials of the week the christian men and women stood on opposite sides a little further off were the learners as yet unbaptized who might only hear the prayers and instructions and beyond them was any person who had been forbidden to receive the holy eucharist on account of some sin and who was waiting to be taken back again the heathen knew nothing of what happened in these meetings and fancied that a great deal that was shocking was done there and trajan ordered that christians should be put to the torture if they would not confess what were their ceremonies very few would betray anything and what they said the heathen could not understand but the emperor imagining that these rites would destroy the old roman spirit forbade them and persecuted the christians because they obeyed god rather than man the bishop of antioch was an old man named ignatius who is believed to have been the little child whom our blessed lord had set in the midst of his disciples as an example of lowliness he had been st johns pupil and always walked in his steps and he is the first father of the church that is the first of the great wise men in those early days whose writings have come down to us as trajan was going through antioch he saw this holy man and sentenced him to be carried to rome there to be thrown to the lions for the amusement of the bloodyminded romans as has been said from early days the favourite sport of this nation had been to sit round on galleries built up within a round building called an amphitheatre to watch the gladiators fight with each other or with savage beasts many of these buildings are still to be found ruined in different parts of the empire and one in especial at rome named the coliseum where it is most likely that the death of st ignatius took place when as he said he was the wheat of christ ground by the teeth of the lions he is reckoned as one of the fathers of the church his great friend was polycarp bishop or angel of smyrna the same as it is believed to whom st john had written in the revelation be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life  the emperor antoninus began a persecution which was carried on by his successor marcus aurelius and in 167 st polycarp who was a very aged man and had ruled the church of smyrna towards seventy years was led before the tribunal the governor had pity on his grey hairs and entreated him to save his life by swearing by the fortunes of caesar and denying christ eighty and six years have i served him and he has never done me a wrong how could i then blaspheme my king who hath saved me said polycarp and all the threats of the governor did but make him glad to be so near glorifying god by his death he was taken out to be burnt alive and as he stood bound to the stake he cried aloud lord god almighty father of the blessed and wellbeloved son jesus christ by whom we have received the grace to know thee god of angels and of powers god of all creatures and of the just who live in thy presence i thank thee that thou hast brought me to this day and hour when i may take part in the number of the martyrs in the cup of thy christ to rise to the eternal life of soul and body in the incorruption of the holy spirit may i be received into thy presence with them as an acceptable offering as thou hast prepared and foretold thou the true god who canst not lie therefore i praise thee i bless thee i glorify thee by the eternal and heavenly high priest jesus christ thy beloved son to whom with thee and the holy ghost be glory now and for ever and ever amen the fire was kindled and to the wonder of the beholders it rose into a bright vault of flame like a glory around the martyr without touching him whereupon the governor became impatient and caused him to be slain with the sword he was the last of the companions of the apostles but there was no lessening of the grace bestowed on the church even when aureliuss army was suffering from a terrible drought in an expedition to germany a legion who were nearly all christians prayed aloud for rain a shower descended in floods of refreshment the emperor said that his god jupiter sent it and caused his triumphal arch to be carved with figures of soldiers some praying others catching rain in their helmets and shields but the band was ever afterwards called the thundering legion this unbelieving emperor persecuted frightfully and great numbers suffered at vienne in gaul many dying of the damp of their prison and many more tortured to death of these was the bishop pothinus of lyons ninety years old who died of the torments and those who lived through them were thrown to wild beasts till the animals were so glutted as to turn from the prey but no pain was so great as not to be counted joy by the christians and the more they were slain the more persons were convinced that the hope must be precious for which they endured so much and the more the word of god prevailed aurelius caesar died in 180 and the church was left at rest for a little while     lesson xxv  the persecutions    blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for   theirs is the kingdom of heavenmatt v 10  it had been revealed to st john that the church should have tribulation for ten days and accordingly in her first three hundred years ten emperors tried to put out her light nero domitian trajan antoninus and aurelius have been mentioned and the next persecutor was severus an emperor who went to britain firmly established the roman power over england and built the great wall to keep the scots from injuring the northern settlers  in his time died the glorious band of martyrs of carthagefive young converts two men named satur and saturninus a noble young married lady called perpetua who had a young infant and two slaves revocatus and felicitas the last of whom gave birth to a daughter in the prison but not even love to their babes could lead these faithful women to dissemble their belief perpetua left her child with her family felicitas gave hers to a christian woman to bring up and the lady and the slave went out singing hand in hand to the amphitheatre where they were to be torn by beasts a wild cow was let loose on them and threw down the two women but perpetua at once sat up again covered herself with her garments and helped up felicitas but as if in a dream for she did not remember that the cow had been loosed on her satur had an especial horror of a bear which was intended to be the means of his death and a good soldier named pudens put meat in front of the den that the beast might not come out a leopard then flew at him and tore him satur asked the soldier for his ring dipped it in his own blood and gave it back as a memorial just before he died under the teeth and claws of the animal the others were all killed by soldiers in the middle of the amphitheatre perpetua guiding the sword to her own throat  the persecution of the emperor decius was one of the worst of all for the heathen grew more ingenious by practice in inventing horrible deaths  under the emperor valerian died st lawrence a young deacon at rome whom the judge commanded to produce the treasures of the church he called together all the aged widows and poor cripples who were maintained by the alms of the faithful these he said are the treasures of the church in the rage of the persecutors he was roasted to death on bars of iron over a fire st cyprian the great bishop of carthage was beheaded and one hundred and fifty martyrs at utica were thrown alive into a pit of quicklime at antioch one man failed sapricius a priest was being led out to die when a christian named nicephorus with whom he had a quarrel came to beg his forgiveness ere his death sapricius would not pardon and nicephorus went on humbly entreating amid the mockery of the guards until the spot of execution was reached and the prisoner was bidden to kneel down to have his bead cut off then it appeared that he who had not the heart to forgive had not the heart to die sapriciuss courage failed him and he promised to sacrifice to the idols and nicephorus was put to death receiving the crown of martyrdom in his stead the persecuting valerian himself came to a miserable end for he was made prisoner in a battle in 258 with the persians and their king for many years forced the unhappy captive to bow down on his hands and knees so as to be a step by which to climb on his elephant and when he died his skin was taken off dyed red and hung up in a temple after his captivity the church enjoyed greater tranquillity many more persons ventured to avow themselves christians and their worship was carried on without so much concealment as formerly  but the troublous times were not yet over and the rage of the prince of this world moved the romans to make a yet more violent effort than any before to put down the kingdom of the prince of peace two emperors began to reign together named diocletian and maximian dividing the whole empire between them into two parts the east and the west after a few years rule they both of them fell savagely upon the christians in switzerland a whole division of the army called the theban legion 6000 in number with the leader st maurice all were cut to pieces together rather than deny their faith in egypt the christians were mangled with potsherds and every torture was invented that could shake their constancy each tribunal was provided with a little altar to some idol and if the christians would but scatter a few grains of incense upon it they were free but this was a denying of their lord and the few who yielded in the fear of them who could kill the body grieved all their lives afterwards for the act and were not restored to their place in the church until after long years of penance or until they had atoned for their fall by witnessing a good confession sometimes they were not allowed to receive the holy communion again till they were on their dying beds but these were the exceptions in general gods strength was made perfect in weakness and not only grown men but timid women tender maidens and little children would bear the utmost torture with glad faith and trust that it was working for them an exceeding weight of glory st margaret of antioch was but fifteen years old st agnes of rome only twelve and at merida in spain eulalia at the same age went out in search of martyrdom insulting the idols until she was seized and put to death full of joy but in general the christians were advised not needlessly to run into the way of danger  this was the first persecution that reached to britain there a kindhearted roman soldier named alban received into his house a priest who was fleeing from his persecutors and while he was there learnt from him the true faith when search was made for his guest alban threw on the dress of the priest and was taken in his stead he was carried to the tribunal and there declaring himself a christian was sentenced to be beheaded the city where he suffered is called after him st albans and a beautiful church was afterwards built in memory of him these cruelties did not long continue in britain for the governor constantius had married a christian british lady named helena and as soon as he ventured to interfere he stopped the persecution  diocletian became tired of reigning and persuaded his comrade maximian to resign their thrones to constantius and to another prince named galerius constantius forbade all persecution in the west but galerius and his soninlaw maximin were very violent in the east and maximin is counted as the last of the ten persecuting emperors under him a great many christians were blinded scarred with hot iron or had their fingers and ears cut off some were sent to the deserts to keep the emperors cattle some were driven in chains to work in the mines these who suffered bravely everything except death were called confessors instead of martyrs galerius died in great misery in 311 of the same horrible disease as the persecutor of the jews antiochus epiphanes and like him he at last owned too late the god whom he had rejected and sent entreaties that prayers might be offered up for him     lesson xxvi  the conversion of constantine      the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and     of his christrev xi 15   the son of constantius constantine became emperor in 307 he was in doubt between the two religions he saw that christianity made people good and yet he could not quite leave off believing in the heathen gods and was afraid of neglecting them as he was passing the alps to put down a very powerful and cruel tyrant who had made himself master of italy he and all his army suddenly beheld in the sky at midday a bright light shaped like a cross and in glorious letters round it the latin words meaning in this sign thou shalt conquer this wonderful sight made constantine believe that the cross was truly the sign of salvation and that he who could show such marvels in heaven must be the true god he set the cross on his standards instead of the roman eagle and such great victories were vouchsafed to him that byandby he became the only emperor and put down all his enemies  he was not as yet baptized but he was a hearty believer and he tried in everything to make the church prosperous and to govern by christian rules from that time all the chief powers of this world have professed to be christian and the church has been owned as the great means appointed by god of leading his people to himself constantines mother helena though in her eightieth year set off to the ruins of jerusalem to try to trace out the places hallowed by our saviours suffering all was waste and desolate and no one lived there save a few very poor jews and christians in wretched huts the latter had never lost the memory of the places where the holy events of the passion had taken place and the empress set men to dig among the ruins on mount calvary till she found the holy sepulchre and not far from it three crosses and the nails belonging to them she built a most beautiful church so large as to cover the whole of golgotha the sepulchre itself formed a round vault within crusted over with marble and lighted with silver lamps the true cross was kept in the church but the nails she brought home as the most precious gift she could carry to her son she also beautified and made into a church the cave of the nativity at bethlehem and she built another church on mount carmel in memory of elijah from her time it became a habit with devout persons to go on pilgrimage to worship at the holy tomb and in the cave of bethlehem and a new city of jerusalem rose upon the ruins of the old one though of course without a temple rome was so fall of the tokens of heathenism that constantine feared that his court would never be heartily christian till he took it to a fresh place so he resolved to build a new capital city for his empire this was the city called after him constantinople the city of constantine on the banks of the bosphorus just where europe and asia nearly meet the chief building there was a most beautiful church dedicated to the holy wisdom of god and named in greek st sophia the bishop there was termed the patriarch of constantinople there were already five patriarchs or great father bishops to rule over divisions of the church at jerusalem antioch alexandria and rome the patriarch of rome was called the pope all was peace and prosperity and the christians were so much at their ease that some finding that they missed the life of hardness which they used to think a great blessing went apart from men and lived in caves quite alone working hard for very scanty food and praying constantly these were called hermits but there soon were troubles enough rising up within the church herself for a man named arius a priest at alexandria began wickedly to teach that our blessed lord was not from all eternity nor equal with god the father so many persons were led away by this blasphemous heresy which means a denial of the faith that it was resolved to call together as many bishops as possible from the entire church to hold a general council and declare the truth  the emperor came to nicea in asia minor in the year 325 and there met three hundred and eighteen bishops from every quarter many of them still scarred by the injuries they had received in the persecutions and many learned priests and deacons among whom the most noted was athanasius of alexandria together they drew up the two first paragraphs of the confession of faith called the nicene creed and three hundred of the bishops set their sign and seal to it declaring it was the truth as they had been charged to hold and teach it fast the catholic or universal faith arius was put out of the communion of the church and all his followers with him but they were many and powerful and in after times constantine became confused by their representations he ought to have seen that he who was not even baptized ought not to interfere in church matters but instead of this he wrote to athanasius who had just been made patriarch of alexandria telling him to preserve peace by receiving arius back to communion athanasius refused to do what would have tainted the whole church so constantine banished him and allowed arius to come to constantinople there the heretic deceived him so completely that he desired that he should be received back on the next sunday while the faithful clergy wept and prayed that the church might be kept clear from the man who denied honour to the lord who bought him arius went through the streets in triumph but in the midst he was smitten by a sudden disease and died in a few moments this judgment convinced constantine and he held to the catholic faith for the rest of his life he was baptized and received his first communion on his deathbed when sixtyfour years old and is remembered as the first believing monarch  after him came worse times for his son constantius was an arian and persecuted the catholics though not to the death st athanasius was driven to hide among the hermits in egypt and a great part of the eastern church fell into the heresy then in 361 reigned his cousin julian the apostate who from being a christian had turned back to be a heathen and wanted to have the old gods worshipped in hopes to show that the prophecies were untrue he tried to build up the temple at jerusalem and the foundations were being dug out when balls of fire came bursting out of the ground and thus gods will and power were made known so that the workmen were forced to leave off julian was very severe towards the catholics and it seemed as though the old times of persecution were coming back but after three years he was killed in battle and the next emperor brought back better days st athanasius finished this life in peace and left behind him writings whence was taken the glorious creed that bears his name     lesson xxvi  theodosius  the sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet and they shall call thee the city of the lord the zion of the holy one of israelisa lx 14   the empire was again divided into two parts which were held by two brothers valentinian who had the eastern half was an arian and valens who ruled at rome was a catholic though all the empire was christian still there were sad disputes for many had fallen away into the heresy and there was so great a love of arguing in a light careless manner in marketplaces baths feasts and places of common resort that it was a great distress to the truly devout to hear the most sacred mysteries discoursed of so freely  the great and learned saint jerome hid himself away from this strife of tongues to pray and study in a hermitage at bethlehem by the desire of the pope he did the same work for the new testament as simon the great had done for the old testament he examined into the history of all the writings that professed to have come down from the apostles time and proved clearly which had been really written under the inspiration of god and had been always held as holy scriptures by the church then he translated the whole bible into latin and wrote an account of each book setting apart those old writings of the jews that are called the apocrypha and are read as wise instruction though they be not certainly known to be the word of god in the same manner as the holy scriptures themselves st jerome is counted as one of the chief fathers or doctors of the church  another great father of the church who lived at the same time was ambrose he was the governor of the italian city of milan and though a devout believer was still unbaptized when the clergy and the people as was then the custom met to choose their bishop a little child in the crowd cried out ambrose bishop and everyone took up the cry with one voice and thought that the choice was inspired by the holy spirit ambrose was very unwilling to accept the office but at last he submitted he was baptized and a week after was first confirmed and then ordained priest and consecrated bishop he was one of the most kind and gentle of men but he had a hard struggle to fight for the truth the emperor valens died and his widow justina who ruled for her little son was an arian she wanted a church for her friends but ambrose would allow none to be profaned by a service where the blessed saviour would be robbed of his honour he knew his duty as a subject too well to lift a hand against the empress but he filled up the church with his faithful flock and there they prayed and sang psalms and hymns without ceasing and when justina sent soldiers to turn them out they were so firm that only one woman ran away instead of offering violence the soldiers joined and prayed with them and thus justina was obliged to give up her attempt in despair  a very good emperor named theodosius had begun to reign in the east and assisted justinas young son to govern the west he was a thorough catholic and loved the church with all his heart some fresh heretics had risen up who taught falsehoods respecting the third person of the most holy trinity and to put them down theodosius called another general council to meet at constantinople and there the following addition was made to the nicene creed i believe in the holy ghost the lord and giver of life who proceedeth from the father who with the father and the son together is worshipped and glorified and so on to the end thus each heresy was made the occasion of giving the faithful a beautiful watchword  though good and religious theodosius was hasty and violent by nature and could be very severe he had laid a tax on the people of antioch which made them so angry that they rose up in a rage knocked down the statues of the emperor and his wife which adorned their public places and dragged them about the streets but as soon as they came to their senses they were dreadfully alarmed knowing that this was an act of high treason they therefore sent off messengers to entreat the emperors pardon and in the meantime they met constantly in the churches fasting and praying that his wrath might be turned away john called chrysostom or golden mouth from his beautiful language was a deacon of antioch and he preached to the people every day during this time of suspense telling them of the sins that had moved god to give them up to their foolish passion so as to put them in fear and lead them to repentance one of these sins was vanity and love of finery and pleasure and another was their irreverent behaviour at church they did repent heartily and before the emperors men had time to do more than begin to try some of the ringleaders there came other messengers at full speed bringing his promise of pardon  love of the sight of chariot races was a great snare to the greeks at thessalonica one of the favourite drivers behaved ill and was imprisoned by the governor upon which the people flew out in a fury and actually stoned the magistrate to death in his passion at their crime theodosius sent off soldiers with orders to put them all to death and when he grew cool and despatched orders to stop the execution of his terrible command they came too latethe city was in flames and the unhappy people innocent and guilty alike all lay slain in the streets theodosius was at milan and st ambrose thought it right to shut him out from the congregation while he was so deeply stained with blood the emperor came to the church door and begged to be admitted but the bishop met him sternly and turned him back theodosius pleaded that david had sinned and had been forgiven if you have been like him in sin be like him in repentance said the bishop and this great prince turned humbly away and went weeping home easter was the regular time for reconciling penitents and at christmas the emperor stayed praying and weeping in his palace till a courtier advised him to try whether the bishop would relent he came to the church but ambrose told him that he could not transgress the laws in his behalf at last however when he saw the emperor so truly contrite and brokenhearted he gave him leave to come in again and there the first thing theodosius did was to fall down on his face weeping bitterly and crying out in davids words my soul cleaveth to the dust quicken thou me according to thy word he lay thus humbly through all the service nor did he once wear his crown and purple robes till after several months of patient penitence he was admitted to the blessed feast of pardon he made a decree that no sentence of death should be executed till thirty days after it was spoken so that no more deeds of hasty passion might be done  one great happiness of st ambroses life was the conversion of augustine this youth was the son of a good and holy mother st monica but he had not been baptized and he grew up wise in his own conceit and loving idle follies and vicious pleasures for many years he was led astray by heretical and heathenish fancies but his faithful mother prayed for him all the time and at last had the joy of seeing him repent with all his heart he was baptized at milan and it is said that the glorious hymn te deum was written by st ambrose and first sung at his baptism the hymn veni creator which is sung in the ordination service is also said to be by st ambrose monica and her son spent a short and peaceful space together and then she died in great thankfulness that he had been given to her prayers he spent many years as bishop of hippo in africa and wrote numerous books which have come down to our day one is called the city of god so as exactly to fulfil the prophecy of isaiah that the church should so be called by the descendants of those who had afflicted her st martin a soldier who once gave half his cloak to a beggar and afterwards became a bishop completed the conversion of gaul at this time and was buried at tours st chrysostom likewise left many sermons and comments on the holy scripture he was made patriarch of constantinople but he suffered many things there for the wife of the emperor arcadius son of the good theodosius hated him for rebuking her love of finery and her passion for racing shows and persuaded her husband to send him into exile in his old age to a climate so cold that he died in consequence the beautiful collect called by his name comes from the liturgy which was used in his time in his church at constantinople but it is not certain whether he actually was the author thereof     lesson xxviii  the teuton nations  the kingdom of heaven is like unto a leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavenedmatt xiii 33  the miry clay which nebuchadnezzar saw mixed with the iron of rome had by the end of the fourth century nearly overcome the strong metal and the time had come when the great horn of the devouring beast was to be broken off and give place to ten others the romans for the last two hundred years had been growing more and more selfish and easy in their habits and instead of fighting their own battles had called in strangers to fight for them till these strangers became too strong for them the nations to whom these hired soldiers belonged were the forefathers of most of the present people of europe they were called teutons altogether and lived in the northern parts of europe they were tall fair large people very brave and spirited with much honour and truth though apt to be savage and violent and they showed more respect to their women than any of the heathens did they had many gods of whom odin who left his name to the fourth day of the week was the chief and father freya the earth was his wife and thor was thunder there was a story of baldur a good and perfect one who died by the craft of lok the destroyer and yet still lived this seemed like a copy of the truth and so did the story of lok himself the power of evil with a serpent on his brow who lay chained and yet could walk forth over the earth and whose pale daughter hela was the gaoler of the unworthy dead they thought the brave who died in battle had the happiest lot their rude fancies could devise they lived in the hall of odin hunting all day feasting all night and drinking mead from the skulls of their conquered enemies  the tribe called goths who lived near the romans and who took their pay and entered their armies learnt the christian faith readily but unfortunately it was through arians that they received it and those farther off continued to worship odin the great theodosius left his empire parted between his two sons arcadius in the east honorius in the west both were young weak and foolish they quarrelled with the great gothic chief alaric who began to overrun their dominions and at last threatened rome so much that honorius was forced to call home all his soldiers to protect himself  the first province thus left bare of troops was britain which remained a prey to the savage scots and then was conquered by the saxons and angles two of the heathen tribes of teutons who seemed for a time quite to have put out the light of christianity in their part of the island the britons in the welsh hills however still continued a free and christian people and patrick a noble young roman who had once been made captive by the wild irish and set to feed their sheep no sooner grew up than he went back to preach the gospel to them and deliver them from a worse bondage than they had made him suffer so many did he convert and such zealous christians were they that ireland used to be called the isle of saints and it has never forgotten the trefoil or shamrock leaf by which st patrick taught his converts to enter into the great mystery how three could yet be one  in the meantime alaric marched against rome once he was beaten back and honorius celebrated the victory by the last roman triumph ever held and after it by the last of the shows of righting slaves a monk sprung into the amphitheatre while it was going on and in the name of christ forbade the death of a gladiator who had been wounded and was to have been killed the people in a rage stoned the good man but they were so much ashamed that these shocking entertainments were given up for ever rome never won another victory alaric came on again and though he honoured the noble city so much that he could not bear to let loose his wild troops on it the false dealing of honorius at last made him so angry that he led his goths into the city but he was very merciful he ordered that no one should be killed and no church injured nor plundered and he led his army out again at the end of six days honorius had fled to ravenna and though a few more weak and foolish men called themselves emperors of the west the very title soon passed away and the chief part of italy was held by the goths and other teuton tribes but they seldom came to rome where the chief power gradually fell into the hands of the pope  gaul was conquered by another teuton race called franks who were very fierce heathen at first but were afterwards converted their great leader clovis married a teuton lady named clotilda a catholic christian she was very anxious to lead him to the truth and at last in a great battle he called out in prayer to clotildas god and when the victory was given to him he took it as a sign from heaven and on coming home was baptized and built the church of notre dame at paris which is said to be just as long as the distance to which king clovis could pitch an axe  spain was conquered by a set of arian goths but a frank princess great grandchild to clotilda brought her husband the young prince to a better way of thinking and though they were persecuted even to the death their influence told upon the rest of the family and the younger brother who came to the throne afterwards brought all spain to be catholic  it was something like this with england where bertha another frank princess worked upon her husband ethelbert king of kent to listen to augustin whom pope gregory the great had sent to preach the word to the saxons recollecting how he had once been struck by the angel faces of the little angle children whom he had found waiting to be sold for slaves in the marketplace from kent the sound of the gospel spread out throughout england and before one hundred years had passed all the saxons and angles were hearty christians and sent out the missionary st boniface who first converted the teutons in germany so though it would have seemed that the great rush of heathen savages must have stifled the christian faith it came working up through them till at last it moulded their whole state and guided their laws but this was long in coming to pass and for many centuries they were very savage and fierce  st gregory the great was one of the very best of the popes very selfdenying and earnestly pious and doing his utmost to train the romans in selfdiscipline and to soften the teutons he put together a book of seven services to be used by devout people in the course of each day and he arranged the chants which are still called by his name though both they and the services are much older a little before his time st benedict had made rules for the persons who wished to serve god and to live apart from the world they lived in buildings named monasteries or convents the men who were called monks under the rule of an abbot the women nuns under an abbess they took a vow of poverty chastity and obedience lived and worked as hard as possible and spent much time in prayer and doing good teaching the young giving medicine to the sick and feeding the poor they would fix their home in a waste land and bring it into good order and they went out preaching and convening the heathen near everyone honoured them and in the worst times they were left unhurt their lands were not robbed and in those savage days little that was gentle or good would have been safe but for the honour paid to the church     lesson xxix  mahomet  god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie2 thess ii 11  the eastern empire was not broken up like the western the emperors reigned at constantinople in great state and splendour in palaces lined with porphyry and hung with purple and filled with gold and silver the greeks of the east had faults the very contrary to those of the teutons of the west instead of being ignorant rude and savage they were learned courtly and keenwitted but their sharpness was a snare to them for what they were afraid to do by force they did by fraud and their word was not to be trusted in matters of faith too they were too fond of talking philosophy and explaining away the hidden mysteries of god so there sprang up sad heresies among them chiefly respecting the two natures of our blessed lord and though there were councils of the church held and the truth was plainly set forth yet great numbers were led away from catholic truth  long ago the lord of the church had warned the churches of asia by his last apostle that if they should fall from their first faith he would remove their candlestickthat is take away the light of his gospel the first warning they had was when the persians broke out in great force came to the holy land robbed the churches at jerusalem and carried away the true cross which had been put in a gold case and buried under ground in hopes of preserving it they afterwards went on to the very banks of the bosphorus and seemed likely to take constantinople itself but the emperor heraclius who had hitherto been very dull and sleepy suddenly woke up to a sense of the danger and proved himself an able warrior hunting the persians back into their own country and rescuing the cross which he carried up the hill of calvary again upon his own shoulders  but a worse foe was growing up among the wild sons of ishmael in arabia nobody can tell what kind of religion these wandering tribes had in the old times except that they honoured their father abraham still circumcised their sons and believed in one god though they paid some sort of worship to a black stone which was kept at mecca some bad learnt a little christianity some had picked up some notions from the jews but they cared for hardly anything except their camels horses and tents and had small thought beyond this life among these men there arose about the year 600 a person named mahomet he had at first been servant to a rich widow whom he afterwards married either he fancied or persuaded others that he believed that the angel gabriel spoke to him in a trance and told him that he was chosen as a great prophet to announce the will of god and restore the faith to what it had been in abrahams days he caused all that he pretended to have been told by the angel to be set down in writings which were called the koran meaning the book the first sentence of which was there is no god but one god and mahomet is his prophet mahomet blasphemously pretended to be as much greater a prophet than our lord as our lord was than moses he ordered prayers and fastings and washings at set times forbade the least drop of wine to be touched and commanded that not only no image should be adored but that no likeness of any created thing should exist promising that all who strictly obeyed all these rules should be led safely over a bridge consisting of a single hair and enter into a delicious garden full of fruits flowers and fountains there to be waited on by beautiful women he gave men leave to have four wives and did nothing to teach them real love purity or devotion and thus his religion suited the bad side of their nature and he persuaded great numbers to join him indeed no unbeliever is so hard to convert as a mahometan  some of the arabs being offended at the new teaching wanted to put him to death and he fled from his home at mecca on his way he was so closely pursued as to be forced to hide in a cave his enemies were just going to search the cave when they saw a spiders web over the mouth and fancied this was a sign that no one could have lately entered it so they passed by and left him safely concealed in his anger at this persecution be declared that the duty of a true mahometan was to spread his religion with the sword and calling his friends round him they fought so bravely that he won back mecca and conquered the whole of arabia they did not persecute christians but they kept them down and despised them and any mahometan who changed his religion was always put to death mahomet called himself khalif and ruled for ten years at mecca where he died and was buried mahometans go on pilgrimage to mecca and always turn their faces thither when they pray at sunrise or sunset throwing water over themselves or sand if they cannot get water  the khalifs who came after mahomet went on conquering the chief tribe of the arabs was called saracens and this was the name given to the whole race whom god had sent to punish the christian world the holy city itself and all the sacred spots were permitted to fall into their hands and though they did not profane the churches the khalif omar built a great mosque or mahometan place of worship where the temple had once been so as quite to overshadow the church of the holy sepulchre  they conquered persia and spread their religion through that country putting down the fire worshippers they seized almost all asia minor where the heretical christians too easily became mahometans and they obtained possession of egypt and the great library at alexandria where they burnt all the collection of books because they said if they taught the same as the koran they were useless if otherwise they were mischievous then from egypt they spread all along the north coast of africa where the roman dominion had once been and were only grieved that the waves of the atlantic ocean kept them from going further to the west  in spain the gothic king rodrigo mortally offended one of his nobles who in revenge called in the saracens to punish him and the whole kingdom fell a prey to these mahometan conquerors except one little mountainous strip in the north where the brave christians drew together and fought gallantly for their church and their freedom through many centuries it almost seemed as if these terrible saracens who bore everything down before them were intended to conquer all europe and crush down the church there as they had done in the east but god was with his people and he raised up a great warrior among the christian franks charles martel or charles of the hammer so called because he always went into battle with a heavy iron hammer led the franks against the saracens when they came up into the south of france and in the year 732 gave them at tours the first real defeat they had yet met with it turned them back completely and they never came north of the pyrenees again but all over the west of asia and north of africa the first places where christianity had spread the heavy dark cloud of mahometanism settled down and has never been removed     lesson xxx  the first schism  while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat st matt xiii 25  is the west there was no heresy as there was in the east the simple teutons believed what they were taught and grew softened by little and little as their clergy gained more influence over them the clergy were usually bred up in the convents and there read the good old books which had come down from learned times st jeromes latin bible and the writings of the holy fathers of the church from st clement the friend of st paul down to st gregory the great each monastery had a few of such books as well as of the liturgy or communion service and breviary or daily service and they were worth much more than their weight in gold the monks used to copy them out and adorn the borders and first letters of the chapters with beautiful colours and gilding but such writing took a long time and when it was done few but the clergy could read except the clergy only such persons as were partly roman by birth had any notion of latin or cared to read at all and so changed were things now that the new race were the conquerors that to be a roman was thought quite contemptible and in france there was a less heavy punishment for killing a roman than for killing a frank the fierce teuton nobles thought nothing but war worth their attention and yet they were very devout and would weep bitterly over their sins they gave richly to churches founded convents and paid great honour to clergymen and to everything belonging to religion  sometimes this honour began to run into idolatry they treated relics that is remains or things that had belonged to holy persons as having some sacredness of their own and fancied that they would save him who carried them from harm and when they glorified god for his saints in heaven and thought of the communion of saints they began to entreat their prayers and the more ignorant would even pray to the saints themselves as if they could by their own power grant the things that were asked the blessed virgin was more sought in this manner than any other saint the pictures and images of saints and the crucifix or figure of our blessed lord on his cross which stood in all the churches often had lights burning before them and people kneeling round in prayer till there was danger that in their ignorance they might be bowing down to the likeness and breaking the second commandment  one of the greek emperors named leo was much displeased at this practice and tried to put a stop to it there was a great uproar at constantinople and many profane things were done and said which shocked the western branch of the church at last the greeks made a rule that there might be pictures of sacred subjects in their churches but no images and to this they have kept ever since the latins would not agree to this and kept both images and pictures and thus began a feeling of distrust between the two branches  the great frank king charles le magne grandson of charles martel was a very religious man and did a great deal to convert the heathens in germany and spread the power of the church he saved rome from some dangerous enemies and made the pope a sort of prince over the city and the pope in return crowned him emperor of rome though without any right to give away that title he died in 814 and after his time all the christian west suffered horribly from the teuton heathens who lived in norway and denmark and who used to come down in their ships and ruin and ravage all the countries round especially england and france they loved nothing so well as burning a convent and such a number of learned monks and their books perished under their hands that the world was growing more ignorant than ever when our good king alfred rose up in 880 taught himself first and then his people and though he died early left such good seed behind him that at last his saxons converted their enemies themselves and norway and denmark became christian too through kings who had learnt the faith in england but all the errors grew the faster from the ignorance of the people and at rome where there was plenty of learning the power the pope enjoyed had done little good for it made ambitious men covet the appointment and they ruled their branch of the church so as to ensure their own gain more than for the sake of what was right the patriarchs of constantinople greatly disapproved of this and made the most of all the differences of opinion and practice when the council of constantinople had added to the nicene creed the sentence which asserts the godhead of the third holy person of the ever blessed trinity the third clause had been who proceedeth from the father of late the western church had added the words and the son now though the greeks believed with all their hearts that the blessed spirit doth come forth from the father and the son yet they said that the latins ought not to put words into the creed that no council had yet authorized and thus a great dispute arose besides the popes had begun to think themselves universal bishops heads over all other patriarchs and to this the patriarch of constantinople would not submit and rightly said that from the old times all patriarchs had been equal and had no right to take authority over one another at last matters ran so high that the pope sent three legates or messengers who laid on the altar of st sophia an act breaking the communion between the two churches and then shook off the dust from their feet this was in the year 1056 a very sad one for here was the first great rent in the church the first breach and one that has never been repaired for the greeks will not to this day hold communion with anyone belonging to the western church nor will the roman church with them and after the first happy thousand years when the church was one outwardly as well as inwardly thus began the time when her unity has become a matter of faith and not of sight but it is our duty to believe that all good christians are joined together because they are joined to our blessed lord as the boughs of a tree belong to one another by their union with the root though they may grow apart on different branches  there were many other differences the greeks and latins reckoned the time of keeping easter in different ways and had not the same way of shaving the heads of their clergy besides the greeks thought that when st paul said an elder might be the husband of one wife he meant that a parish priest must be married so if a clergymans wife died they put him into a convent and took away his parish the roman catholics said on the contrary that the clergy were better unmarried and byandby they forbade even those who were not monks to have wives and in process of time a far more serious evil gradually arose in the western church the clergy said that there was no need for the people to partake of the cup at the holy eucharist so they were cut off from that privilege though our lord had said drink ye all the clergy said it was all the same whether the people drank of it or not since flesh and blood were one but this was thinking for themselves and over explaining and so byandby they lost the real spiritual devout way in which they ought to have reverently spoken of that great and holy mystery and thought of it in a manner that answered better to their mere human understanding     lesson xxxi  the middle ages     surely the isles shall wait for meisaiah ix 9  it is not easy to make out exactly the ten kingdoms to which the roman dominion was said in daniel to give place because sometimes one flourished sometimes another sometimes one was swallowed up sometimes a fresh one sprang forth but there can be no doubt that the ten horns mean the powers of europe which have always been somewhere about that number ever since the conquest by the teuton nations  by the time the first thousand years had past the little leaven had thoroughly leavened the whole lump and the ways of thinking the habits laws and fashions of the western people were all moulded by christian notions the notions were not always really christian nor did the people always act up to them but they meant so to do and though there was some error yet there was also the sincere saving truth which made those who followed it holy and led them to salvation perhaps the greatest mistake was the craving to see instead of only to believe and this led to peoples putting their trust in many things besides the merits of our blessed lordin relics in images of saints in the intercessions of the blessed virgin and above all in the popes promises  the popes were patriarchs of rome and had thus some right over the churches founded from thence they used to send the primate or chief archbishop of each country a pall or scarf woven of the wool of lambs which they had blessed on st agness day many questions were sent to them to be decided at first the right way of choosing a bishop was that the clergy and people of the place should elect him and the king give his consent but when the popes power increased ambitious men used to bribe the people to elect them and affairs grew so bad that at last the emperor otho of germany came to rome put down the wicked popes and took the choice quite into his own hands this was wrong the other way and after two or three reigns the great pope gregory vii after a fierce struggle with the emperor henry iv set matters in order again and obtained that as the roman people were not to be trusted with the choice it should be put into the hands of the clergy of the parish churches at rome who were called cardinals and have ever since had the election of the pope in their hands they wear purple and crimson robes and hats in memory of the old roman purple of the emperors  it had been thought by almost the whole of the western church ever since they had lost their communion with the eastern branch which might have kept them right that the pope stood visibly in our lords place as head of the church and that he was infallible namely so inspired by the holy spirit that he could no more fall into error than a general council could so he stood at the head of all the archbishops and bishops abbots and clergy of the west and whenever a difficulty arose it was sent to him to be settled he ruled likewise over the consciences of all men and women if they sinned the being cut off from the church excommunicated as it was called was the most terrible punishment that could befall them and if a king or country were very wicked indeed the pope could lay them under an interdict namely deprive them of every office of religion shut up the church doors and forbid all service  sometimes these threats were of great benefit it was good for the kings to be forced to think of what was right to be stopped from making cruel wars from misusing their people or living in sinful pleasure but the popes did not always use their power rightly they would become angry and excommunicate people for opposing them and not for doing what was wrong and they did not bethink them of our lords saying that his kingdom is not of this world still the church was working great good holy people were bred up some in convents some in the world st margaret queen of scotland who taught her people to say grace at their meals st richard the good humble bishop of chichester and that glorious french monk st bernard whose holy life and beautiful preaching made him everywhere honoured  great alms were given to the poor and almost all our most beautiful churches and cathedrals were built by devout kings nobles or bishops who gave their wealth for gods glory these were built so as to be almost as symbolical as the temple had been they were usually in the shape of a cross in honour of the token of our salvation the body was called the nave or ship because of the ark of christs church the doors stood for repentance as the entrance the font just within showed that none could enter save by the laver of regeneration the holiest part was to the east as looking for the sun of righteousness this portion is called the chancel and belongs to the clergy as the sanctuary did to the priests of old but the people are not as of old cut off but draw near in faith to taste of the great sacrifice commemorated upon the altar the eagle desk for the holy scripture shows forth one gospel emblem the litany desk is for times of repentance when the priest may mourn between porch and altar the dead rested within and around in the shadow of their church and constant services were celebrated that so the gates might ever be open  even warriors sought to have their alms blessed by the church they bound themselves not to fight on holydays such as fridays and sundays and before they could be made knights they were obliged to vow before god that they would always help the weak never fight in a bad cause and always speak the truth so that all would have been like perfect fulfilment of isaiahs promises of the glory of the church save that man will still follow the devices of his own heart and there were shrines and altars where undue honour was paid to the saints and too many superstitious observances were carried on before their images prayers and alms were offered for departed souls in the notion that they were gone to purgatory a place where it was said their sins would be purged away by suffering before the day of judgment and whence their friends might as they imagined assist them by their offerings  people used to go on pilgrimage and especially such as had fallen into any great sin would go through everything to pray at the holy sepulchre for forgiveness the saracens who had not been unkind to the pilgrims were subdued by a much fiercer set of mahometans the turcomans who did everything to profane the holy places and robbed and misused the christians who came to worship there the news of this profanation stirred up all europe to deliver the sanctuary from the unbeliever monks went about preaching the holy war and multitudes took the cross that is fastened on their shoulder one cut out in cloth and vowed to win back jerusalem the pope took upon himself to say that whoever was killed in such a cause would have all his sins forgiven and be in no danger of purgatory and this be called an indulgence these wars were called crusades in the first in 1098 jerusalem was conquered and a very good and pious man named godfrey set up to be king though he would not be crowned saying he would never wear a crown of gold where his master had worn a crown of thorns but as the greek christians who already lived there would not own the pope but held to their own patriarch a latin patriarch was thrust in and was in subjection to the pope and thus the unhappy schism grew wider after godfreys death the christians in palestine did not behave well nor show themselves worthy to have the keeping of jerusalem and though st bernard preached a second crusade and the emperor of germany and king of france came to help them their affairs only grew worse and worse  in 1186 after they had possessed the holy city only eightyeight years they were deprived of it it was taken again by the saracens and they retained only a few towns on the coast all devout people mourned that the unbeliever should again be defiling the sanctuary but the pope had a great quarrel with the emperor of germany and told the poor credulous people that fighting his battles was as good as a crusade and they began to forsake the holy land and leave it to its fate our own richard the lion heart did his best and so did the excellent french king st louis who died in africa on his way to the crusade but all in vain and finally the christians were driven out of acre their last town and palestine became mahometan again with only a few oppressed christians here and there then came a much more rude dull and violent race of mahometans the turks who burst out of the east conquered the saracens gained all asia minor and at last in the year 1453 they took the city of constantinople killed the last emperor constantine in the assault and won all the country we now call turkey where they sadly oppressed the greeks though they could not make them turn from their true catholic faith it was then that the light of truth faded entirely away from ephesus and the churches of asia a blight fell wherever the turks went and cities once prosperous were deserted and ruined tyre was one of these and she has now become a mere rock where fishermen spread their nets to dry upon the seashore as ezekiel had foretold however it was only forty years afterwards that the last remains of the mahometan conquerors were chased out of spain so that it became again an entirely christian country     lesson xxxii  the reformation  the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hid in a fieldmatt xiii 44  when the services of the church were first drawn up almost everyone in the east spoke greek and most people in the west understood latin and when the teutons learnt christianity they also with it learnt a little latin thus the prayers and the scriptures remained in that tongue but the people themselves spoke each their own language german english french spanish and italian are mixtures in different degrees of latin and teuton and only learned persons who understood the old language could follow the prayers or read the bible so the people missed more and more of the real truth and meaning of sacred things and some of the clergy who had grown corrupt took advantage of their ignorance and deceived them whereas the pope had once declared that those who went on a crusade were sure of dying in a state of salvation he now declared that to give alms for building the great church of st peter at rome would answer the same purpose and indulgences namely promises of so many years less of purgatory used to be absolutely sold and it was very difficult to set these errors right for anyone who was thought to speak against the doctrine of the church was liable to be punished by being burnt to death this was quite contrary to the ways of the early church which however bad a heretic might have been never attempted to harm his person but only separated him from her communion  as the holy spirit within the church is ever cleansing and sanctifying it witnesses against these errors began to be raised up the way to print books instead of writing them out had been discovered in the fifteenth century and as this art made them much more cheap and common many more people began to read and to think in the year 1517 a german monk named martin luther began to declare how far the selling of indulgences was from the doctrine of the apostles and he spoke such plain truth that he convinced a great number of germans and there was a great longing for the cleansing of the church especially after luther had translated the bible into his own tongue and everyone could see how unlike the teaching there was to what had been so long believed  in england king henry viii separated from the roman church because the pope would not please him by breaking a marriage which certainly never ought to have been sanctioned but which having been permitted by the pope and having continued twenty years it was very wrong to dissolve he called himself head of the church in england and though he believed all the later errors he allowed the lessons to be read from a new english translation of the bible he pretended to reform the convents some of which were in a very bad state and had forgotten their rules but instead of setting them to rights he seized their wealth and turned all the monks and nuns adrift  the new notions were favoured by his break with the pope the whole western church was in a ferment the reformers were constantly writing and preaching against the many errors of the roman church and were rejoicing over the real treasure of true faith they had found hidden within her many other sincere and good men were shocked at such disobedience to what they had once respected and unhappily almost all the italian clergy and cardinals were so food of the riches and power in which they were maintained by misleading the people that they dreaded nothing so much as having them set right  the emperor charles v strove hard to bring about a general council of the church as the only hope of making matters right but he was much hindered by his wars with the king of france and by the double dealing of the pope and in the meantime luther and his friends drew up a protest against the false doctrines of rome and were for that reason called protestants in switzerland and france another reformer named john calvin was preaching against the doctrine of the pope and though he neglected what the church of old pure times had decided and thus threw away much that was good as well as much that was untrue great numbers followed him but unfortunately none of the higher clergy on the continent would listen to these views and there seemed no choice but to accept falsehood or to break into a schism after many trials charles v got together some italian spanish and german clergy at trent in the tyrol and called them a council but this was far from being a true general council as there was nobody from the eastern church nor from many branches of the western the protestants knew they should not be fairly treated and that if these italians should decide that they were heretics they might very probably be burnt so instead of coming to it they acted as the early christians never did they took up arms and fought and this attempt at a council broke up in confusion  things were happier in england after the death of henry viii archbishop cranmer and the other guardians of his little son edward vi set to work to clear away the corruptions from the church in england so as to make it as like as they could to what it had been in the apostles time the bible had been translated and they put the whole prayerbook into english leaving out all that savoured of idolatry all the notions about purgatory and everything of error and keeping the real old precious services of the early church restoring to the people the blessed privilege of the cup while the bishops priests and deacons went on in an uninterrupted line as from the beginning on edwards early death his sister queen mary who was married to philip ii the son of the emperor thought all these changes very wicked and endeavoured to put them down four bishops cranmer latimer ridley and hooper were burnt for their share in them with many other persons and england was again reconciled to rome but mary only reigned five years and her sister elizabeth was a sound churchwoman and held fast by the catholic english church in her reformed state  philip ii the son of charles v managed to accomplish another sitting of the council of trent and the church of rome considers it a true council though there were only two hundred and fiftyfive bishops and they condemned the protestants without hearing their defence it did some good to the romish church by putting down the sale of indulgences and some bad practices of the clergy but it bound her to all the errors renounced by the reformers and put her into a state of schism from the catholic church  the lutheran protestants in germany and the calvinists in france holland and scotland as they could have no bishops made up their minds that none were needed though this was quite contrary to scripture and to the ways of the apostles there was a sad time of warfare through all the centre of europe and the spaniards and french horribly persecuted the protestants and calvinists thinking in their blindness that they were thus doing god service but queen elizabeth stood up as the firm friend of all the distressed reformers and at last matters settled down again though not till all christianity had been grievously shattered and rent and there was no more outward unity  there were four branches of the church catholic keeping their bishops the greek the roman the english the swedish but none of these were in outward communion the one with the other though still owning one lord one faith one baptism and waging the same fight with the devil and his works the roman church was spread over all italy spain france and great part of germany and tried to force down all differences of opinion by cruel and bloody means caring more for unity than for truth and boasting of being the only catholic church instead of only one branch of it the lutheran doctrine was taught in norway denmark and many parts of germany and the calvinist teaching gained a great hold in holland scotland and on such french as were not roman catholic the greek church meanwhile stood fast through much tribulation in the turkish dominions and had gradually won the whole great russian empire where as the people ceased to be barbarous they became most devout members of the ancient unchanging greek catholic church     lesson xxxiii  colonization  enlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations spare not lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakesisaiah liv 2   just as the reformation was beginning fresh lands were being found beyond the atlantic ocean where the knowledge of the gospel might reach christopher columbus a gallant genoese mariner and deeply religious man was full of the notion that by sailing westwards he might come round to india and thence make a way for winning back the holy land after much weary waiting and many entreaties he obtained three little ships from queen isabel of spain and with them in the year 1492 came to the islands which he named the west indies lovely places full of gentle natives with skins of a dark ruddy colour wearing for their misfortune golden ornaments to get gold was the great longing of the spaniards and they did not care what cruelties they used so that they could obtain it the pope finding in the prophecies that the isles of the sea should belong to the church considered that this gave him a right to give them away to whomsoever he pleased so he made a grant of all to the west to the spaniards all to the east to the portuguese thereupon great numbers of the spaniards went over to america they conquered the two great empires of mexico and peru and settled in the westindian islands robbing the poor natives of their gold and silver making slaves of them and hunting them with bloodhounds when they tried to run away many good priests who went out as missionaries did all they could to hinder these horrors but in vain and when at last the poor delicate indians began to dwindle away and die off the plan was resorted to of bringing negroes from africa to work in their stead though it was a good man who thought of it in the hope of saving the indians and making the negroes christians it came to most horrible cruelty and was a disgrace to christian europe  however these faithful priests worked hard in teaching and converting the indians all over south america one brotherhood called the jesuits had great establishments where they trained up large villages of indiana in christian habits and taught them to be very faithful and industrious but at home in europe these jesuits did harm by stepping out of their work as ministers interfering with governments more than was right and trying to keep up the authority of the pope more than real catholic truth they taught so many false stories as articles of faith that at last clever people wise in their own conceit began to believe nothing and became like the fool who said in his heart there is no god so there came to be a bad feeling against all the clergy and the jesuits who had made themselves very meddling and troublesome were put down at the entreaty of several kings when they were taken away from their converts in south america it turned out that the poor indians had not steadfastness enough to take care of themselves so all their wellordered establishments were broken up and the people ran wild again all the spanish settlers of whom there were many still held fast to their church and all the coast of the continent of south america is roman catholic  the english and dutch had not been slow to find their way to the west but they went to the colder north instead of to the south and sought good land more than gold some of the english had during queen marys reign made friends with some of the dutch and german calvinists who fancied that whatever roman catholics had done must be wrong instead of only a part and who cared nothing for the ways of the apostolic primitive church so when the true catholic faith was upheld by queen elizabeth by james i who caused our translation of the bible to be made by fortyeight learned hebrew and greek scholars and by charles i who gave bishops and a prayerbook to scotland there were many persons who grew impatient and angry that more changes were not made these broke away from the church calling themselves puritans and independants and living in a state of schism some too thought the king had too much power and in charless time a great many went away and settled in north america that they might have freedom and worship in their own way those who stayed at home went on to that rebellion against church and king which ended in the scottish calvinists betraying king charles and the english independants putting him to death for upholding the bishops after archbishop laud had been beheaded for nearly eleven years the bishops were put down the clergy persecuted and the use of the prayerbook forbidden in england while all sorts of sects rose up and explained the bible as they pleased when at length charles ii came back and the church was reestablished in england many more went to the colonies and though there was a church settlement in virginia the great mass of the north american colonists were calvinists or presbyterians as they are called because presbyters are their highest order of their ministry though they cannot be really commissioned priests never having been ordained by bishops come down from the apostles  the english began to spread fast on every side as their nation grew stronger and more numerous they conquered several of the westindian isles and the church was there established but to their disgrace they carried on the slavetrade to supply the settlers with workmen in the eastindies too they began to acquire large tracts by conquest and by treaty and a few churches were built there but they had not tried to convert the great number of heathens who became subject to them fearing that should they take offence they would shake off their dominion such clergy as did go out were ordained in england there was as yet no bishop to overlook the colonial churches so that they could not take deep root  still the english church was living as a witness of the truth at home with many a great and holy man within her such as bishop taylor whose beautiful writings are loved by all bishop ken whose loyalty to church and king witnessed a good confession and whose hymns are like part of the prayerbook bishop wilson whose devotions for home and at the holy eucharist are our great guide with more good and humble men and women than the world will ever know of and this under gods mercy saved the nation from falling into the unbelieving state of france where people thought it fine to laugh at all religion there in the end of the eighteenth century a terrible outbreak took place against all authority human or divine the king and queen perished by the hands of their subjects quantities of blood was shed and for a time it seemed as if the country was given up to demons the faithful clergy fled or remained hidden and though at last people began to return to their senses the shock to loyalty and religion has never been entirely recovered in that country     lesson xxxiv  the spread of the gospel  the fearful effects of infidelity in france roused good men everywhere and the church began to show that power of reviving and purifying herself which proves that the lord abideth with her for ever  some time before things had come to this pass an english clergyman named john wesley had been striving to awaken people to a more religious life but he did not sufficiently heed the authority of the church and his followers after his death quite separated themselves from her and became absolute schismatics with meetinghouses and ministers of their own calling themselves methodists still his fervour and earnestness stirred up many within the church and from that time there was much more desire to fulfil the mission of christians by bringing others to the knowledge of the truth sundayschools began to be set up to assist the catechizing in church enjoined in the prayerbook and often instead of it and there was a growing eagerness to convert the heathen abroad the great possessions and wide trade of england seemed to mark her as especially intended for this work some persons went about it by giving their money to any missionary society that made fair promises without heeding whether it were schismatic or not others had more patience and trusted their alms to the society for the propagation of the gospel which was managed by the english bishops  the american colonies had by this time grown impatient of the english government and had shaken it off calling themselves the united states the church people among them obtained some bishops from the scottish branch of the church which the calvinists had never been able to put down and every one of the many united states has now a bishop of its own  calcutta was the first english colony to receive a bishop in the year 1814 the second bishop was reginald heber whose beautiful hymns seem the birthright of our church like those of bishop ken one hundred and fifty years before still very little was done with the natives of india they were attached to their foul old religion and government forbade any open measures against it though here and there was a conversion and there have at length come to be three bishops sees and in the south of the peninsula in the see of madras there are a hopeful number of christians the work would everywhere proceed better if there were no schism so that all christians could work together ceylon also has a bishop and many are there gathered in on the borders of china likewise there is an english bishopric and within that empire the french roman catholics have been working steadily for many years to win a few of those obstinate heathen to the faith but with little success and often receiving the crown of martyrdom  the french are very ardent missionaries bearing joyously all kinds of privations and forming their stations wherever they see any hope of gaining converts the sisters of charitygood women under a vow to spend their lives in nursing and teachingdo much to show what the real fruit of christianity is and they are to be found wherever there is trouble or distress there is a great college at rome called the propaganda where every language under the sun is taught in order to fit persons for missionary work  our own st augustines college at canterbury is intended to prepare young men to become english missionaries and north south east and west are the good tidings spreading now that the days are come of which daniel said many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased  the english west indies were first forbidden to import slaves next all the slaves were set free and there are now four bishoprics for their black and white population all negroes seized in the ships of other nations on their way to be made slaves are brought back to sierra leone on the coast of africa there set free and taught to be christians under a bishop of our church and the christian blacks are beginning to carry the message of salvation into the other parts of africa where the climate is so hurtful to englishmen that only the negro race could there do the work  south africa has three bishops to rule their english settlers win the dutch farmers to the church and convert the hottentots and zulus and from them a missionary bishop has been sent out to the heathen tribes in the interior of the continent  north america contains nine great bishops sees and the huge island of australia six new zealand scarcely discovered till within the last fifty years has three bishops of her own ruling over a population of english and of christian natives men whose fathers were cannibals but who are now hearty christians and it is the centre whence a mission bishop is seeking to gain to the church the inhabitants of the beautiful islands that thickly dot the pacific ocean many of these islanders have become christian under the teaching of missionaries from the other societies and though great numbers still remain savage heathens yet the light of the gospel is in the course of shining upon all the islands far away everywhere the creed the lords prayer and the ten commandments in the vulgar tongue are being taught and each convert is gathered in by baptism and fed by the holy eucharist as when the apostles first went forth and no one can mark the great spread of the church within the last fifty years without feeling that the blessing of god is with her the greek church has done less but though still enslaved in turkey in greece she is free and the yoke of the mahometan is there shaken off after her long patience and constancy  there are dark spots in all this brightness for rome still teaches the same errors mixed up with the truth and the spirit of unbelief is to be found far and wide questioning and explaining away all the mysteries it cannot understand  we know that it must be so for it was to fight with sin that christ came into the world and left his church there and st paul prophesied that evil men and seducers should wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived daniel too foresaw that the little horn should spring up and do very wickedly and all the tenor of prophecy in the epistles declares that times of trouble and temptation must try the church  it seems that there has been even from the apostles times an evil spirit opposing himself to our lord and therefore called by st john the antichrist his manifestations have broken out in many waysin arianism in mahometanism perhaps in the great errors of rome and more lately in infidelity and in mormonism and it would seem that there is to be some much more dreadful development of that wicked one exalting himself against christ and severely trying the elect but we have a certain promise that come what may christ will never forsake his chosen flock and those who try to hold fast the faith once delivered to the saints and to keep the law of love clinging to their own true branch of the church may be sure that he who has redeemed them will guard them from all evil and that they will share in his glory when he shall come with all his holy angels to put all enemies under his feet then he shall sit on his great white throne and gather his elect from the four winds to dwell in the eternal jerusalem which needs neither sun nor
