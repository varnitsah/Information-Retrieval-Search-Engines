5882241	the three clerks  by anthony trollope    with an introduction by w teignmouth shore    anthony trollope  born london april 24 1815 died london december 6 1882    introduction  there is the proper mood and the just environment for the reading as well as for the writing of works of fiction and there can be no better place for the enjoying of a novel by anthony trollope than under a tree in kensington gardens of a summer day under a tree in the avenue that reaches down from the round pond to the long water there perhaps more than anywhere else lingers the early victorian atmosphere as we sit beneath our tree we see in the distance the dun redbrick walls of kensington palace where one night princess victoria was awakened to hear that she was queen there in quaint hideously ugly victorian rooms are to be seen victorian dolls and other playthings the whole environment is early victorian here to the minds eye how easy it is to conjure up ghosts of men in baggy trousers and long flowing whiskers of prim women in crinolines in hats with long trailing feathers and with ridiculous little parasols or with grecianbends and chignonschurchparading to and fro beneath the trees or by the waters edgeperchance even the fascinating lady crinoline and the elegant mr macassar jones whose history has been written by clerk charley in the pages we are introducing to the gentle reader as a poetaster of an earlier date has written    where kensington high oer the neighbouring lands   midst green and sweets a royal fabric stands   and sees each spring luxuriant in her bowers   a snow of blossoms and a wild of flowers   the dames of britain oft in crowds repair   to gravel walks and unpolluted air   here while the town in damps and darkness lies   they breathe in sunshine and see azure skies   each walk with robes of various dyes bespread   seems from afar a moving tulip bed   where rich brocades and glossy damasks glow   and chintz the rival of the showery bow  indeed the historian of social manners when dealing with the victorian period will perforce have recourse to the early volumes of punch and to the novels of thackeray dickens and trollope  there are certain authors of whom personally we know little but of whose works we cannot ever know enough such a one for example as shakespeare others of whose lives we know much but for whose works we can have but scant affection such is doctor johnson others who are intimate friends in all their aspects as goldsmith and charles lamb yet others who do not quite come home to our bosoms whose writings we cannot entirely approve but for whom and for whose works we find a soft place somewhere in our hearts and such a one is anthony trollope his novels are not for everyday reading any more than are those of marryat and borrowto take two curious examples there are times and moods and places in which it would be quite impossible to read the three clerks others in which this story is almost wholly delightful with those who are fond of bedreading trollope should ever be a favourite and it is no small compliment to say this for small is the noble army of authors who have given us books which can enchant in the witching hour between waking and slumber it is probable that all lovers of letters have their favourite bedbooks thackeray has charmingly told us of his of the few novels that can really be enjoyed when the reader is settling down for slumber almost all have been set forth by writers whoconsciously or unconsciouslyhave placed character before plot thackeray himself miss austen borrow marryat sterne dickens goldsmith andtrollope  books are very human in their way as what else should they be children of men and women as they are just as with human friends so with book friends first impressions are often misleading good literary coin sometimes seems to ring untrue but the untruth is in the ear of the reader not of the writer for instance trollope has many odd and irritating tricks which are apt to scare off those who lack perseverance and who fail to understand that there must be something admirable in that which was once much admired by the judicious he shares with thackeray the sinful habit of pulling up his readers with a wrench by reminding them that what is set before them is after all mere fiction and that the characters in whose fates they are becoming interested are only marionettes with dickens and others he shares the custom so irritating to us of today of ticketing his personages with clumsy descriptive labels such as in the three clerks mr chaffanbrass sir gregory hardlines sir warwick west end mr neverbend mr whip vigil mr nogo and mr gitemthruet he must plead guilty also to some bad ways peculiarly his own or which he made so by the thoroughness with which he indulged in them he moralizes in his own person in deplorable manner is not this terriblepoor katiedear darling bonnie katiesweet sweetest dearest child why oh why has that mother of thine that tenderhearted loving mother put thee unguarded in the way of such perils as this has she not sworn to herself that over thee at least she would watch as a hen over her young so that no unfortunate love should quench thy young spirit or blanch thy cheeks bloom is this not sufficient to make the gentlest reader swear to himself  fortunately this and some other appalling passages occur after the story is in full swing and after the three clerks and those with whom they come into contact have proved themselves thoroughly interesting companions despite all his oldfashioned tricks trollope does undoubtedly succeed in giving blood and life to most of his characters they are not as a rule people of any great eccentricity or of profound emotions but ordinary everyday folk such as all of us have met and loved or endured trollope fills very adequately a space between thackeray and dickens of whom the former deals for the most part with the upper ten the latter with the lower ten trollope with the suburban and countrytown ten the three together giving us a very complete and detailed picture of the lives led by our grandmothers and grandfathers whose hearts were in the same place as our own but whose manners of speech of behaviour and of dress have now entered into the vague region known as the days of yore  the three clerks is an excellent example of trollopes handiwork the development of the plot is sufficiently skilful to maintain the readers interest and the major part of the characters is lifelike always well observed and sometimes depicted with singular skill and insight trollope himself liked the work well  the plot is not so good as that of the macdermots nor are any characters in the book equal to those of mrs proudie and the warden but the work has a more continued interest and contains the first welldescribed lovescene that i ever wrote the passage in which kate woodward thinking she will die tries to take leave of the lad she loves still brings tears to my eyes when i read it i had not the heart to kill her i never could do that and i do not doubt that they are living happily together to this day  the lawyer chaffanbrass made his first appearance in this novel and i do not think that i have cause to be ashamed of him but this novel now is chiefly noticeable to me from the fact that in it i introduced a character under the name of sir gregory hardlines by which i intended to lean very heavily on that much loathed scheme of competitive examination of which at that time sir charles trevelyan was the great apostle sir gregory hardlines was intended for sir charles trevelyanas any one at the time would know who had taken an interest in the civil service we always call him sir gregory lady trevelyan said to me afterwards when i came to know her husband i never learned to love competitive examination but i became and am very fond of sir charles trevelyan sir stafford northcote who is now chancellor of the exchequer was then leagued with his friend sir charles and he too appears in the three clerks under the feebly facetious name of sir warwick west end but for all that the three clerks was a good novel  which excerpt from trollopes autobiography serves to throw light not only upon the novel in question but also upon the character of its author  trollope served honestly and efficiently for many a long year in the post office achieving his entrance through a farce of an examination  the story of that examination he says is given accurately in the opening chapters of a novel written by me called the three clerks if any reader of this memoir would refer to that chapter and see how charley tudor was supposed to have been admitted into the internal navigation office that reader will learn how anthony trollope was actually admitted into the secretarys office of the general post office in 1834  poes description of the manner in which he wrote the raven is incredible being probably one of his solemn and sombre jokes equally incredible is trollopes confession of his humdrum mechanical methods of work doubtless he believed he was telling the whole truth but only here and there in his autobiography does he permit to peep out touches of light which complete the portrait of himself it is impossible that for the reader any character in fiction should live which has not been alive to its creator so is it with trollope who speaking of his characters says  i have wandered alone among the rooks and woods crying at their grief laughing at their absurdities and thoroughly enjoying their joy i have been impregnated with my own creations till it has been my only excitement to sit with the pen in my hand and drive my team before me at as quick a pace as i could make them travel  there is a plain matteroffactness about trollopes narratives which is convincing making it difficult for the reader to call himself back to fact and to remember that he has been wandering in a world of fiction in the three clerks the young men who give the tale its title are all well drawn to accomplish this in the cases of alaric and charley tudor was easy enough for a skilled writer but to breathe life into harry norman was difficult at first he appears to be a layfigure a priggish dummy of an immaculate hero a failure in portraiture but toward the end of the book it is borne in on us that our dislike had been aroused by the lifelike nature of the painting dislike toward a real man priggish indeed in many ways but with a very human strain of obstinacy and obdurateness which few writers would have permitted to have entered into the makeup of any of their heroes of the other men undy scott may be named as among the very best pieces of portraiture in victorian fiction touch after touch of detail is added to the picture with really admirable skill and undy lives in the readers memory as vividly as he must have existed in the imagination of his creator there are some strong and curious passages in chapter xliv in which the novelist contrasts the lives and fates of varney bill sykes and undy scott they stir the blood proving uncontestibly that undy scott was as real to trollope as he is to us the figure of undy swinging from a gibbet at the broad end of lombard street would have an effect ah my fingers itch to be at the rope  trollope possessed the rare and beautiful gift of painting the hearts and souls of young girls and of this power he has given an admirable example in katie woodward it would be foolish and cruel to attempt to epitomize or rather to draw in miniature this portrait that trollope has drawn at full length were it not for any other end those that are fond of all that is graceful and charming in young womanhood should read the three clerks so becoming the friend nay the lover of katie her sisters are not so attractive simply because nature did not make them so a very fine faithful woman gertrude a dear thing linda all three worthy of their mother she who as we are told in a delicious phrase though adverse to a fool could sympathize with folly   these eight portraits are grouped in the foreground of this conversation piece the background being filled with slighter but always live figures  particularly striking as being somewhat unusual with trollope is the depiction of the publichouse the pig and whistle in norfolk street the landlady mrs davis and the barmaid norah geraghty we can almost smell the gin the effluvia of stale beer the bad tobacco hear the simpers and see the sidlings of norah feel sick with and at charleyhe got up and took her hand and as he did so he saw that her nails were dirty he put his arms round her waist and kissed her and as he caressed her his olfactory nerves perceived that the pomatum in her hair was none of the best  and then he felt very sick but oh why olfactory nerves was it vulgar in early victorian days to call a nose a nose  how far different would have been dickenss treatment of such characters and such a scene out of mrs davis and norah he would have extracted fun and it would never have entered into his mind to have brought such a man as charley into contact with them in a manner that must hurt that young heros susceptibilities thackeray would have followed a third way judging by his treatment of the fotheringay and captain costigan partly humorous partly satirical partly serious  trollope was not endowed with any spark of wit his satire tends towards the obvious and his humour is mild almost unconscious as if he could depict for us what of the humorous came under his observation without himself seeing the fun in it where he sets forth with intent to be humorous he sometimes attains almost to the tragic there are few things so sad as a joke that misses fire or a jester without sense of humour  of the genius of a writer of fiction there is scarce any other test so sure as this of the reality of his characters few are the authors that have created for us figures of fiction that are more alive to us than the historic shadows of the past whose dead bones historians do not seem to be able to clothe with flesh and blood trollope hovers on the border line between genius and great talent or rather it would be more fair to say that with regard to him opinions may justly differ for our own part we hold that his was not talent streaked with genius but rather a jogtrot genius alloyed with mediocrity he lacked the supreme unconsciousness of supreme genius for of genius as of talent there are degrees there are characters in the three clerks that live those who have read the tale must now and again when passing norfolk street strand regret that it would be waste of time to turn down that rebuilt thoroughfare in search of the pig and whistle which was one of these small tranquil shrines of bacchus in which the god is worshipped with as constant a devotion though with less noisy demonstration of zeal than in his larger and more public temples alas lovers of victorian london must lament that such shrines grow fewer day by day the great thoroughfares know them no more they hide nervously in oldworld corners and in them you will meet oldworld characters who not seldom seem to have lost themselves on their way to the pages of charles dickens  despite the advent of electric tramways hampton would still be recognized by the three clerks the little village of hampton with its oldfashioned country inn and its bright quiet grassy river hampton is now as it then was the wellloved resort of cockneydom  so let us alight from the tramcar at hampton and look about on the outskirts of the village for a small oldfashioned brick house abutting on the road but looking from its front windows on to a lawn and garden which stretched down to the river surbiton cottage it is called let us peep in at that merry happy family party and laugh at captain cuttwater waking from his placid sleep rubbing his eyes in wonderment and asking what the devil is all the row about but it is only with our minds eye that we can see surbiton cottagea cottage in the air it is but more substantial to some of us than many a real jerrybuilt villa of red brick and stucco  oldfashioned seem to us the folk who once dwelt there oldfashioned in all save that their hearts were true and their outlook on life sane and clean they live still though their clothes be of a quaint fashion and their talk be of yesterday  who knows but that they will live long after we who love them shall be dead and turned to dust  w

measures every inhabitant of london and every casual visitor there has admired the handsome edifice which generally goes by that name and which stands so conspicuously confronting the treasury chambers it must be owned that we have but a slipslop way of christening our public buildings when a man tells us that he called on a friend at the horse guards or looked in at the navy pay or dropped a ticket at the woods and forests we put up with the accustomed sounds though they are in themselves perhaps indefensible the board of commissioners for regulating weights and measures and the office of the board of commissioners for regulating weights and measures are very long phrases and as in the course of this tale frequent mention will be made of the public establishment in question the readers comfort will be best consulted by maintaining its popular though improper denomination  it is generally admitted that the weights and measures is a wellconducted public office indeed to such a degree of efficiency has it been brought by its present very excellent secretary the two very worthy assistantsecretaries and especially by its late most respectable chief clerk that it may be said to stand quite alone as a high model for all other public offices whatever it is exactly antipodistic of the circumlocution office and as such is always referred to in the house of commons by the gentleman representing the government when any attack on the civil service generally is being made  and when it is remembered how great are the interests entrusted to the care of this board and of these secretaries and of that chief clerk it must be admitted that nothing short of superlative excellence ought to suffice the nation all material intercourse between man and man must be regulated either justly or unjustly by weights and measures and as we of all people depend most on such material intercourse our weights and measures should to us be a source of neverending concern and then that question of the decimal coinage is it not in these days of paramount importance are we not disgraced by the twelve pennies in our shilling by the four farthings in our penny one of the worthy assistantsecretaries the worthier probably of the two has already grown pale beneath the weight of this question but he has sworn within himself with all the heroism of a nelson that he will either do or die he will destroy the shilling or the shilling shall destroy him in his more ardent moods he thinks that he hears the noise of battle booming round him and talks to his wife of westminster abbey or a peerage then what statistical work of the present age has shown half the erudition contained in that essay lately published by the secretary on the market price of coined metals what other living man could have compiled that chronological table which is appended to it showing the comparative value of the metallic currency for the last three hundred years compile it indeed what other secretary or assistantsecretary belonging to any public office of the present day could even read it and live it completely silenced mr muntz for a session and even the times was afraid to review it  such a state of official excellence has not however been obtained without its drawbacks at any rate in the eyes of the unambitious tyros and unfledged novitiates of the establishment it is a very fine thing to be pointed out by envying fathers as a promising clerk in the weights and measures and to receive civil speeches from mammas with marriageable daughters but a clerk in the weights and measures is soon made to understand that it is not for him to    sport with amaryllis in the shade  it behoves him that his life should be grave and his pursuits laborious if he intends to live up to the tone of those around him and as sitting there at his early desk his eyes already dim with figures he sees a jaunty dandy saunter round the opposite corner to the council office at eleven oclock he cannot but yearn after the pleasures of idleness    were it not better done as others use  he says or sighs but then comes phoebus in the guise of the chief clerk and touches his trembling ears    as he pronounces lastly on each deed   of so much fame in downing streetexpect the meed  and so the high tone of the office is maintained  such is the character of the weights and measures at this present period of which we are now treating the exoteric crowd of the civil service that is the great body of clerks attached to other offices regard their brethren of the weights as prigs and pedants and look on them much as a masters favourite is apt to be regarded by other boys at school but this judgement is an unfair one prigs and pedants and hypocrites too there are among them no doubtbut there are also among them many stirred by an honourable ambition to do well for their country and themselves and to two such men the reader is now requested to permit himself to be introduced  henry norman the senior of the two is the second son of a gentleman of small property in the north of england he was educated at a public school and thence sent to oxford but before he had finished his first year at brasenose his father was obliged to withdraw him from it finding himself unable to bear the expense of a university education for his two sons his elder son at cambridge was extravagant and as at the critical moment when decision became necessary a nomination in the weights and measures was placed at his disposal old mr norman committed the not uncommon injustice of preferring the interests of his elder but faulty son to those of the younger with whom no fault had been found and deprived his child of the chance of combining the glories and happiness of a double first a fellow a college tutor and a don  whether harry norman gained or lost most by the change we need not now consider but at the age of nineteen he left oxford and entered on his new duties it must not however be supposed that this was a step which he took without difficulty and without pause it is true that the grand modern scheme for competitive examinations had not as yet been composed had this been done and had it been carried out how awful must have been the cramming necessary to get a lad into the weights and measures but even as things were then it was no easy matter for a young man to convince the chief clerk that he had all the acquirements necessary for the high position to which he aspired  indeed that chief clerk was insatiable and generally succeeded in making every candidate conceive the very lowest opinion of himself and his own capacities before the examination was over some of course were sent away at once with ignominy as evidently incapable many retired in the middle of it with a conviction that they must seek their fortunes at the bar or in medical pursuits or some other comparatively easy walk of life others were rejected on the fifth or sixth day as being deficient in conic sections or ignorant of the exact principles of hydraulic pressure and even those who were retained were so retained as it were by an act of grace the weights and measures was and indeed is like heavenno man can deserve it no candidate can claim as his right to be admitted to the fruition of the appointment which has been given to him henry norman however was found at the close of his examination to be the least undeserving of the young men then under notice and was duly installed in his clerkship  it need hardly be explained that to secure so high a level of information as that required at the weights and measures a scale of salaries equally exalted has been found necessary young men consequently enter at £100 a year we are speaking of course of that more respectable branch of the establishment called the secretarys department at none other of our public offices do men commence with more than £90except of course at those in which political confidence is required political confidence is indeed as expensive as hydraulic pressure though generally found to be less difficult of attainment  henry norman therefore entered on his labours under good auspices having £10 per annum more for the business and pleasures of life in london than most of his young brethren of the civil service whether this would have sufficed of itself to enable him to live up to that tone of society to which he had been accustomed cannot now be surmised as very shortly after his appointment an aunt died from whom he inherited some £150 or £200 a year he was therefore placed above all want and soon became a shining light even in that bright gallery of spiritualized stars which formed the corps of clerks in the secretarys office at the weights and measures  young norman was a goodlooking lad when he entered the public service and in a few years he grew up to be a handsome man he was tall and thin and dark muscular in his proportions and athletic in his habits from the date of his first enjoyment of his aunts legacy he had a wherry on the thames and was soon known as a man whom it was hard for an amateur to beat he had a racket in a racketcourt at st johns wood road and as soon as fortune and merit increased his salary by another £100 a year he usually had a nag for the season this however was not attained till he was able to count five years service in the weights and measures he was as a boy somewhat shy and reserved in his manners and as he became older he did not shake off the fault he showed it however rather among men than with women and indeed in spite of his love of exercise he preferred the society of ladies to any of the bachelor gaieties of his unmarried acquaintance he was nevertheless frank and confident in those he trusted and true in his friendships though considering his age too slow in making a friend such was henry norman at the time at which our tale begins what were the faults in his character it must be the business of the tale to show  the other young clerk in this office to whom we alluded is alaric tudor he is a year older than henry norman though he began his official career a year later and therefore at the age of twentyone how it happened that he contrived to pass the scrutinizing instinct and deep powers of examination possessed by the chief clerk was a great wonder to his friends though apparently none at all to himself he took the whole proceeding very easily while another youth alongside of him who for a year had been reading up for his promised nomination was so awestruck by the severity of the proceedings as to lose his powers of memory and forget the very essence of the differential calculus  of hydraulic pressure and the differential calculus young tudor knew nothing and pretended to know nothing he told the chief clerk that he was utterly ignorant of all such matters that his only acquirements were a tolerably correct knowledge of english french and german with a smattering of latin and greek and such an intimacy with the ordinary rules of arithmetic and with the first books of euclid as he had been able to pick up while acting as a tutor rather than a scholar in a small german university  the chief clerk raised his eyebrows and said he feared it would not do a clerk however was wanting it was very clear that the young gentleman who had only showed that he had forgotten his conic sections could not be supposed to have passed the austerity of the last few years had deterred more young men from coming forward than the extra £10 had induced to do so one unfortunate on the failure of all his hopes had thrown himself into the thames from the neighbouring boatstairs and though he had been hooked out uninjured by the man who always attends there with two wooden legs the effect on his parents minds had been distressing shortly after this occurrence the chief clerk had been invited to attend the board and the chairman of the commissioners who on the occasion was of course prompted by the secretary recommended mr hardlines to be a leetle more lenient in doing so the quantity of butter which he poured over mr hardlines head and shoulders with the view of alleviating the misery which such a communication would be sure to inflict was very great but nevertheless mr hardlines came out from the board a crestfallen and unhappy man the service he said would go to the dogs and might do for anything he cared and he did not mind how soon if the board chose to make the weights and measures a hospital for idiots it might do so he had done what little lay in his power to make the office respectable and now because mammas complained when their cubs of sons were not allowed to come in there and rob the public and destroy the office books he was to be thwarted and reprimanded he had been he said eightandtwenty years in office and was still in his primebut he should he thought take advantage of the advice of his medical friends and retire he would never remain there to see the weights and measures become a hospital for incurables  it was thus that mr hardlines the chief clerk expressed himself he did not however send in a medical certificate nor apply for a pension and the first apparent effect of the little lecture which he had received from the chairman was the admission into the service of alaric tudor mr hardlines was soon forced to admit that the appointment was not a bad one as before his second year was over young tudor had produced a very smart paper on the meritsor demeritsof the strike bushel  alaric tudor when he entered the office was by no means so handsome a youth as harry norman but yet there was that in his face which was more expressive and perhaps more attractive he was a much slighter man though equally tall he could boast no adventitious capillary graces whereas young norman had a pair of black curling whiskers which almost surrounded his face and had been the delight and wonder of the maidservants in his mothers house when he returned home for his first official holiday tudor wore no whiskers and his lightbrown hair was usually cut so short as to give him something of the appearance of a clean puritan but in manners he was no puritan nor yet in his mode of life he was fond of society and at an early period of his age strove hard to shine in it he was ambitious and lived with the steady aim of making the most of such advantages as fate and fortune had put in his way tudor was perhaps not superior to norman in point of intellect but he was infinitely his superior in having early acquired a knowledge how best to use such intellect as he had  his education had been very miscellaneous and disturbed by many causes but yet not ineffective or deficient his father had been an officer in a cavalry regiment with a fair fortune which he had nearly squandered in early life he had taken alaric when little more than an infant and a daughter his only other child to reside in brussels mrs tudor was then dead and the remainder of the household had consisted of a french governess a bonne and a mancook here alaric remained till he had perfectly acquired the french pronunciation and very nearly as perfectly forgotten the english he was then sent to a private school in england where he remained till he was sixteen returning home to brussels but once during those years when he was invited to be present at his sisters marriage with a belgian banker at the age of sixteen he lost his father who on dying did not leave behind him enough of the worlds wealth to pay for his own burial his halfpay of course died with him and young tudor was literally destitute  his brotherinlaw the banker paid for his halfyears schooling in england and then removed him to a german academy at which it was bargained that he should teach english without remuneration and learn german without expense whether he taught much english may be doubtful but he did learn german thoroughly and in that as in most other transactions of his early life certainly got the best of the bargain which had been made for him  at the age of twenty he was taken to the brussels bank as a clerk but here he soon gave visible signs of disliking the drudgery which was exacted from him not that he disliked banking he would gladly have been a partner with ever so small a share and would have trusted to himself to increase his stake but there is a limit to the good nature of brothersinlaw even in belgium and alaric was quite aware that no such good luck as this could befall him at any rate until he had gone through many years of servile labour his sister also though sisterly enough in her disposition to him did not quite like having a brother employed as a clerk in her husbands office they therefore put their heads together and as the tudors had good family connexions in england a nomination in the weights and measures was procured  the nomination was procured but when it was ascertained how very short a way this went towards the attainment of the desired object and how much more difficult it was to obtain mr hardlines approval than the boards favour young tudors friends despaired and recommended him to abandon the idea as should he throw himself into the thames he might perhaps fall beyond the reach of the watermans hook alaric himself however had no such fears he could not bring himself to conceive that he could fail in being fit for a clerkship in a public office and the result of his examination proved at any rate that he had been right to try  the close of his first years life in london found him living in lodgings with henry norman at that time normans income was nearly three times as good as his own to say that tudor selected his companion because of his income would be to ascribe unjustly to him vile motives and a mean instinct he had not done so the two young men had been thrown together by circumstances they worked at the same desk liked each others society and each being alone in the world thereby not unnaturally came together but it may probably be said that had norman been as poor as tudor tudor might probably have shrunk from rowing in the same boat with him  as it was they lived together and were fast allies not the less so that they did not agree as to many of their avocations tudor at his friends solicitation had occasionally attempted to pull an oar from searles slip to battersea bridge but his failure in this line was so complete and he had to encounter so much of normans raillery which was endurable and of his instruction which was unendurable that he very soon gave up the pursuit he was not more successful with a racket and keeping a horse was of course out of the question  they had a bond of union in certain common friends whom they much loved and with whom they much associated at least these friends soon became common to them the acquaintance originally belonged to norman and he had first cemented his friendship with tudor by introducing him at the house of mrs woodward since he had done so the one young man was there nearly as much as the other  who and what the woodwards were shall be told in a subsequent chapter as they have to play as important a part in the tale about to be told as our two friends of the weights and measures it would not be becoming to introduce them at the end of this  as regards alaric tudor it need only be further said by way of preface of him as of harry norman that the faults of his character must be made to declare themselves in the course of our narrative    chapter ii  the internal navigation   the london world visitors as well as residents are well acquainted also with somerset house and it is moreover tolerably well known that somerset house is a nest of public offices which are held to be of less fashionable repute than those situated in the neighbourhood of downing street but are not so decidedly plebeian as the custom house excise and post office  but there is one branch of the civil service located in somerset house which has little else to redeem it from the lowest depths of official vulgarity than the ambiguous respectability of its material position this is the office of the commissioners of internal navigation the duties to be performed have reference to the preservation of canal banks the tolls to be levied at locks and disputes with the admiralty as to points connected with tidal rivers the rooms are dull and dark and saturated with the fog which rises from the river and their only ornament is here and there some dusty model of an improved barge bargees not unfrequently scuffle with hobnailed shoes through the passages and go in and out leaving behind them a smell of tobacco to which the denizens of the place are not unaccustomed  indeed the whole office is apparently infected with a leaven of bargedom not a few of the men are employed from time to time in the somewhat lethargic work of inspecting the banks and towingpaths of the canals which intersect the country this they generally do seated on a load of hay or perhaps of bricks in one of those long ugly shapeless boats which are to be seen congregating in the neighbourhood of brentford so seated they are carried along at the rate of a mile and a half an hour and usually while away the time in gentle converse with the man at the rudder or in silent abstraction over a pipe  but the dullness of such a life as this is fully atoned for by the excitement of that which follows it in london the men of the internal navigation are known to be fast nay almost furious in their pace of living not that they are extravagant in any great degree a fault which their scale of salaries very generally forbids but they are one and all addicted to coal holes and cider cellars they dive at midnight hours into shades and know all the back parlours of all the publichouses in the neighbourhood of the strand here they leave messages for one another and call the girl at the bar by her christian name they are a set of men endowed with sallow complexions and they wear loud clothing and spend more money in ginandwater than in gloves  the establishment is not unusually denominated the infernal navigation and the gentlemen employed are not altogether displeased at having it so called the infernal navvies indeed rather glory in the name the navvies of somerset house are known all over london and there are those who believe that their business has some connexion with the rivers or railroads of that bourne from whence no traveller returns looking however from their office windows into the thames one might be tempted to imagine that the infernal navigation with which they are connected is not situated so far distant from the place of their labours  the spirit who guards the entrance into this elysium is by no means so difficult to deal with as mr hardlines and it was well that it was so some few years since for young charley tudor a cousin of our friend alaric for charley tudor could never have passed muster at the weights and measures charles tudor the third of the three clerks alluded to in our titlepage is the son of a clergyman who has a moderate living on the welsh border in shropshire had he known to what sort of work he was sending his son he might probably have hesitated before he accepted for him a situation in the internal navigation office he was however too happy in getting it to make many inquiries as to its nature we none of us like to look a gifthorse in the mouth old mr tudor knew that a clerkship in the civil service meant or should mean a respectable maintenance for life and having many young tudors to maintain himself he was only too glad to find one of them provided for  charley tudor was some few years younger than his cousin alaric when he came up to town and alaric had at that time some three or four years experience of london life the examination at the internal navigation was certainly not to be so much dreaded as that at the weights and measures but still there was an examination and charley who had not been the most diligent of schoolboys approached it with great dread after a preparatory evening passed with the assistance of his cousin and mr norman  exactly at ten in the morning he walked into the lobby of his future workshop and found no one yet there but two aged seedy messengers he was shown into a waitingroom and there he remained for a couple of hours during which every clerk in the establishment came to have a look at him at last he was ushered into the secretarys room  ah said the secretary your name is tudor isnt it  charley confessed to the fact  yea said the secretary i have heard about you from sir gilbert de salop now sir gilbert de salop was the great family friend of this branch of the tudors but charley finding that no remark suggested itself to him at this moment concerning sir gilbert merely said yes sir  and you wish to serve the queen said the secretary  charley not quite knowing whether this was a joke or not said that he did  quite rightit is a very fair ambition continued the great official functionaryquite rightbut mind you mr tudor if you come to us you must come to work i hope you like hard work you should do so if you intend to remain with us  charley said that he thought he did rather like hard work hereupon a senior clerk standing by though a man not given to much laughter smiled slightly probably in pity at the unceasing labour to which the youth was about to devote himself  the internal navigation requires great steadiness good natural abilities considerable education andandand no end of application come mr tudor let us see what you can do and so saying mr oldeschole the secretary motioned him to sit down at an office table opposite to himself  charley did as he was bid and took from the hands of his future master an old muchworn quill pen with which the great man had been signing minutes  now said the great man just copy the few first sentences of that leading articleeither one will do and he pushed over to him a huge newspaper  to tell the truth charley did not know what a leading article was and so he sat abashed staring at the paper  why dont you write asked the secretary  where shall i begin sir stammered poor charley looking piteously into the examiners face  god bless my soul there either of those leading articles and leaning over the table the secretary pointed to a particular spot  hereupon charley began his task in a large ugly round hand neither that of a man nor of a boy and set himself to copy the contents of the paper the name of pacifico stinks in the nostril of the british public it is well known to all the world how sincerely we admire the versitility of lord palmerstons genius how cordially we simpathize with his patriotic energies but the admiration which even a palmerston inspires must have a bound and our simpathy may be called on too far when we find ourselves asked to pay by this time charley had half covered the halfsheet of foolscap which had been put before him and here at the word pay he unfortunately suffered a large blot of ink to fall on the paper  that wont do mr tudor that wont docome let us look and stretching over again the secretary took up the copy  oh dear oh dear this is very bad versatility with an isympathy with an i sympathize with an i why mr tudor you must be very fond of is down in shropshire  charley looked sheepish but of course said nothing  and i never saw a viler hand in my life oh dear oh dear i must send you back to sir gilbert look here snape this will never donever do for the internal navigation will it  snape the attendant senior clerk said as indeed he could not help saying that the writing was very bad  i never saw worse in my life said the secretary and now mr tudor what do you know of arithmetic  charley said that he thought he knew arithmetic pretty wellat least some of it he modestly added  some of it said the secretary slightly laughing well ill tell you whatthis wont do at all and he took the unfortunate manuscript between his thumb and forefinger you had better go home and endeavour to write something a little better than this mind if it is not very much better it wont do and look here take care that you do it yourself if you bring me the writing of any one else i shall be sure to detect you i have not any more time now as to arithmetic well examine you in some of it tomorrow  so charley with a faint heart went back to his cousins lodgings and waited till the two friends had arrived from the weights and measures the men there made a point of staying up to five oclock as is the case with all model officials and it was therefore late before he could get himself properly set to work but when they did arrive preparations for calligraphy were made on a great scale a volume of gibbon was taken down new quill pens large and small and steel pens by various makers were procured creamlaid paper was provided and ruled lines were put beneath it and when this was done charley was especially cautioned to copy the spelling as well as the wording  he worked thus for an hour before dinner and then for three hours in the evening and produced a very legible copy of half a chapter of the decline and fall  i didnt think they examined at all at the navigation said norman  well i believe its quite a new thing said alaric tudor the schoolmaster must be abroad with a vengeance if he has got as far as that  and then they carefully examined charleys work crossed his ts dotted his is saw that his spelling was right and went to bed  again punctually at ten oclock charley presented himself at the internal navigation and again saw the two seedy old messengers warming themselves at the lobby fire on this occasion he was kept three hours in the waitingroom and some of the younger clerks ventured to come and speak to him at length mr snape appeared and desired the acolyte to follow him charley supposing that he was again going to the awful secretary did so with a palpitating heart but he was led in another direction into a large room carrying his manuscript neatly rolled in his hand here mr snape introduced him to five other occupants of the chamber he mr snape himself having a separate desk there being in official parlance the head of the room charley was told to take a seat at a desk and did so still thinking that the dread hour of his examination was soon to come his examination however was begun and over no one ever asked for his calligraphic manuscript and as to his arithmetic it may be presumed that his assurance that he knew some of it was deemed to be adequate evidence of sufficient capacity and in this manner charley tudor became one of the infernal navvies  he was a gayhearted thoughtless rollicking young lad when he came up to town and it may therefore be imagined that he easily fell into the peculiar ways and habits of the office a short bargees pilotcoat and a pipe of tobacco were soon familiar to him and he had not been six months in london before he had his houseofcall in a cross lane running between essex street and norfolk street mary my dear a screw of birdseye came quite habitually to his lips and before his fist year was out he had volunteered a song at the buckingham shades  the assurance made to him on his first visit to the office by mr secretary oldeschole that the internal navigation was a place of herculean labours had long before this time become matter to him of delightful ridicule he had found himself to be one of six young men who habitually spent about five hours a day together in the same room and whose chief employment was to render the life of the wretched mr snape as unendurable as possible there were copies to be written and entries to be made and books to be indexed but these things were generally done by some extra hand as to the necessity of whose attendance for such purpose mr snape was forced to certify but poor snape knew that he had no alternative he rule six unruly young navvies there was not one of them who did not well know how to make him tremble in his shoes  poor mr snape had selected for his own peculiar walk in life a character for evangelical piety whether he was a hypocriteas all the navvies averredor a man sincere as far as one so weak could accomplish sincerity it is hardly necessary for us to inquire he was not by nature an illnatured man but he had become by education harsh to those below him and timid and cringing with those above in the former category must by no means be included the six young men who were nominally under his guidance they were all but acknowledged by him as his superiors ignorant as they were they could hardly be more so than he useless as they were they did as much for the public service as he did he sometimes complained of them but it was only when their misconduct had been so loud as to make it no longer possible that he should not do so  mr snape being thus by character and predilection a religious man and having on various occasions in olden days professed much horror at having his ears wounded by conversation which was either immoral or profane it had of course become the habitual practice of the navvies to give continual utterance to every description of ribaldry and blasphemy for his especial edification doubtless it may be concluded from the habits of the men that even without such provocation their talk would have exceeded the yea yea and nay nay to which young men should confine themselves but they especially concerted schemes of blasphemy and dialogues of iniquity for mr snapes particular advantage and continued daily this disinterested amusement till at last an idea got abroad among them that mr snape liked it then they changed their tactics and canted through their noses in the manner which they imagined to be peculiar to methodist preachers so on the whole mr snape had an uneasy life of it at the internal navigation  into all these malpractices charley tudor plunged headlong and how should it have been otherwise how can any youth of nineteen or twenty do other than consort himself with the daily companions of his usual avocations once and again in one case among ten thousand a lad may be found formed of such stuff that he receives neither the good nor the bad impulses of those around him but such a one is a lapsus naturae he has been born without the proper attributes of youth or at any rate brought up so as to have got rid of them  such a one at any rate charley tudor was not he was a little shocked at first by the language he heard but that feeling soon wore off his kind heart also in the first month of his novitiate sympathized with the daily miseries of mr snape but he also soon learnt to believe that mr snape was a counterfeit and after the first half year could torture him with as much gusto as any of his brethren alas no evil tendency communicates itself among young men more quickly than cruelty those infernal navvies were very cruel to mr snape  and yet young tudor was a lad of a kindly heart of a free honest open disposition deficient in no proportion of mind necessary to make an estimable man but he was easily malleable and he took at once the full impression of the stamp to which he was subjected had he gone into the weights and measures a hypothesis which of course presumes a total prostration of the intellects and energy of mr hardlines he would have worked without a groan from ten till five and have become as good a model as the best of them as it was he can be hardly said to have worked at all soon became facile princeps in the list of habitual idlers and was usually threatened once a quarter with dismissal even from that abode of idleness in which the very nature of true work was unknown  some tidings of charleys doings in london and nondoings at the internal navigation of course found their way to the shropshire parsonage his dissipation was not of a very costly kind but £90 per annum will hardly suffice to afford an ample allowance of ginandwater and birdseye tobacco over and above the other wants of a mans life bills arrived there requiring payment and worse than this letters also came through sir gilbert de salop from mr oldeschole the secretary saying that young tudor was disgracing the office and lowering the high character of the internal navigation and that he must be removed unless he could be induced to alter his line of life c  urgent austere letters came from the father and fond heartrending appeals from the mother charleys heart was rent it was at any rate a sign in him that he was not past hope of grace that he never laughed at these monitions that he never showed such letters to his companions never quizzed his governors lectures or made merry over the grief of his mother but if it be hard for a young man to keep in the right path when he has not as yet strayed out of it how much harder is it to return to it when he has long since lost the track it was well for the father to write austere letters well for the mother to make tender appeals but charley could not rid himself of his companions nor of his debts nor yet even of his habits he could not get up in the morning and say that he would at once be as his cousin alaric or as his cousins friend mr norman it is not by our virtues or our vices that we are judged even by those who know us best but by such credit for virtues or for vices as we may have acquired now young tudors credit for virtue was very slight and he did not know how to extend it  at last papa and mamma tudor came up to town to make one last effort to save their son and also to save on his behalf the valuable official appointment which he held he had now been three years in his office and his salary had risen to £110 per annum £110 per annum was worth saving if it could be saved the plan adopted by mrs tudor was that of beseeching their cousin alaric to take charley under his especial wing  when charley first arrived in town the fact of alaric and norman living together had given the former a good excuse for not offering to share his lodgings with his cousin alaric with the advantage in age of three or four yearsat that period of life the advantage lies in that directionwith his acquired experience of london life and also with all the wondrous éclat of the weights and measures shining round him had perhaps been a little too unwilling to take by the hand a rustic cousin who was about to enter life under the questionable auspices of the internal navigation he had helped charley to transcribe the chapter of gibbon and had it must be owned lent him from time to time a few odd pounds in his direst necessities but their course in life had hitherto been apart of norman charley had seen less even than of his cousin  and now it became a difficult question with alaric how he was to answer the direct appeal made to him by mrs tudorpray pray let him live with you if it be only for a year alaric the mother had said with the tears running down her cheeks you are so good so discreet so cleveryou can save him alaric promised or was ready to promise anything else but hesitated as to the joint lodgings how could he manage it said he living as he was with another man he feared that mr norman would not accede to such an arrangement as for himself he would do anything but leave his friend norman to tell the truth alaric thought much perhaps too much of the respectability of those with whom he consorted he had already begun to indulge ambitious schemes already had ideas stretching even beyond the limits of the weights and measures and fully intended to make the very most of himself  mrs tudor in her deep grief then betook herself to mr norman though with that gentleman she had not even the slightest acquaintance with a sulking heart with a consciousness of her unreasonableness but with the eloquence of maternal sorrow she made her request mr norman heard her out with all the calm propriety of the weights and measures begged to have a day to consider and then acceded to the request  i think we ought to do it said he to alaric the mothers tears had touched his heart and his sense of duty had prevailed alaric of course could now make no further objection and thus charley the navvy became domesticated with his cousin alaric and harry norman  the first great question to be settled and it is a very great question with a young man was that of latchkey or no latchkey mrs richards the landlady when she made ready the third bedroom for the young gentleman would as was her wont in such matters have put a latchkey on the toilettable as a matter of course had she not had some little conversation with mamma tudor regarding her son mamma tudor had implored and coaxed and probably bribed mrs richards to do something more than take her son in and do for him and mrs richards as her first compliance with these requests had kept the latchkey in her own pocket so matters went on for a week but when mrs richards found that her maidservant was never woken by mr charleys raps after midnight and that she herself was obliged to descend in her dressinggown she changed her mind declared to herself that it was useless to attempt to keep a grown gentleman in leadingstrings and put the key on the table on the second monday morning  as none of the three men ever dined at home alaric and norman having clubs which they frequented and charley eating his dinner at some neighbouring dininghouse it may be imagined that this change of residence did our poor navvy but little good it had however a salutary effect on him at any rate at first he became shamed into a quieter and perhaps cleaner mode of dressing himself he constrained himself to sit down to breakfast with his monitors at halfpast eight and was at any rate so far regardful of mrs richards as not to smoke in his bedroom and to come home sober enough to walk upstairs without assistance every night for the first month  but perhaps the most salutary effect made by this change on young tudor was this that he was taken by his cousin one sunday to the woodwards poor charley had had but small opportunity of learning what are the pleasures of decent society he had gone headlong among the infernal navvies too quickly to allow of that slow and gradual formation of decent alliances which is all in all to a young man entering life a boy is turned loose into london and desired to choose the good and eschew the bad boy as he is he might probably do so if the opportunity came in his way but no such chance is afforded him to eschew the bad is certainly possible for him but as to the good he must wait till he be chosen this it is that is too much for him he cannot live without society and so he falls  society an ample allowance of society this is the first requisite which a mother should seek in sending her son to live alone in london balls routs picnics parties women pretty welldressed witty easymannered good pictures elegant drawing rooms well gotup books majolica and dresden chinathese are the truest guards to protect a youth from dissipation and immorality    these are the books the arts the academes   that show contain and nourish all the world  if only a youth could have them at his disposal some of these things though by no means all charley tudor encountered at the woodwards    chapter iii  the woodwards   it is very difficult nowadays to say where the suburbs of london come to an end and where the country begins the railways instead of enabling londoners to live in the country have turned the country into a city london will soon assume the shape of a great starfish the old town extending from poplar to hammersmith will be the nucleus and the various railway lines will be the projecting rays  there are still however some few nooks within reach of the metropolis which have not been bevillaged and beterraced out of all look of rural charm and the little village of hampton with its oldfashioned country inn and its bright quiet grassy river is one of them in spite of the triple metropolitan waterworks on the one side and the close vicinity on the other of hampton court that wellloved resort of cockneydom  it was here that the woodwards lived just on the outskirts of the village on the side of it farthest from town they inhabited not a villa but a small oldfashioned brick house abutting on to the road but looking from its front windows on to a lawn and garden which stretched down to the river  the grounds were not extensive being included house and all in an area of an acre and a half but the most had been made of it it sloped prettily to the river and was absolutely secluded from the road thus surbiton cottage as it was called though it had no pretension to the grandeur of a countryhouse was a desirable residence for a moderate family with a limited income  mrs woodwards family for there was no mr woodward in the case consisted of herself and three daughters there was afterwards added to this an old gentleman an uncle of mrs woodwards but he had not arrived at the time at which we would wish first to introduce our readers to hampton  mrs woodward was the widow of a clergyman who had held a living in london and had resided there he had however died when two of his children were very young and while the third was still a baby from that time mrs woodward had lived at the cottage at hampton and had there maintained a good repute paying her way from month to month as widows with limited incomes should do and devoting herself to the amusements and education of her daughters  it was not probably from any want of opportunity to cast them aside that mrs woodward had remained true to her weeds for at the time of her husbands death she was a young and a very pretty woman and an income of £400 a year though moderate enough for all the wants of a gentlemans family would no doubt have added sufficiently to her charms to have procured her a second alliance had she been so minded  twelve years however had now elapsed since mr woodward had been gathered to his fathers and the neighbouring world of hampton who had all of them declared over and over again that the young widow would certainly marry again were now becoming as unanimous in their expressed opinion that the old widow knew the value of her money too well to risk it in the keeping of the best he that ever wore boots  at the date at which our story commences she was a comely little woman past forty somewhat below the middle height rather embonpoint as widows of forty should be with pretty fat feet and pretty fat hands wearing just a soupçon of a widows cap on her head with her hair now slightly grey parted in front and brushed very smoothly but not too carefully in bandeaux over her forehead  she was a quick little body full of goodhumour slightly given to repartee and perhaps rather too impatient of a fool but though averse to a fool she could sympathize with folly a great poet has said that women are all rakes at heart and there was something of the rake at heart about mrs woodward she never could be got to express adequate horror at fast young men and was apt to have her own sly little joke at women who prided themselves on being punctilious she could perhaps the more safely indulge in this as scandal had never even whispered a word against herself  with her daughters she lived on terms almost of equality the two elder were now grown up that is they were respectively eighteen and seventeen years old they were devotedly attached to their mother looked on her as the only perfect woman in existence and would willingly do nothing that could vex her but they perhaps were not quite so systematically obedient to her as children should be to their only surviving parent mrs woodward however found nothing amiss and no one else therefore could well have a right to complain  they were both prettybut gertrude the elder was by far the more strikingly so they were nevertheless much alike they both had rich brown hair which they like their mother wore simply parted over the forehead they were both somewhat taller than her and were nearly of a height but in appearance as in disposition gertrude carried by far the greater air of command she was the handsomer of the two and the cleverer she could write french and nearly speak it while her sister could only read it she could play difficult pieces from sight which it took her sister a mornings pains to practise she could fill in and finish a drawing while her sister was still struggling and struggling in vain with the first principles of the art  but there was a softness about linda for such was the name of the second miss woodward which in the eyes of many men made up both for the superior beauty and superior talent of gertrude gertrude was perhaps hardly so soft as so young a girl should be in her had been magnified that spirit of gentle raillery which made so attractive a part of her mothers character she enjoyed and emulated her mothers quick sharp sayings but she hardly did so with her mothers grace and sometimes attempted it with much more than her mothers severity she also detested fools but in promulgating her opinion on this subject she was too apt to declare who the fools were whom she detested  it may be thought that under such circumstances there could be but little confidence between the sisters but nevertheless in their early days they lived together as sisters should do gertrude when she spoke of fools never intended to include linda in the number and linda appreciated too truly and admired too thoroughly her sisters beauty and talent to be jealous of either  of the youngest girl katie it is not necessary at present to say much at this time she was but thirteen years of age and was a happy pretty romping child she gave fair promise to be at any rate equal to her sisters in beauty and in mind was quick and intelligent her great taste was for boating and the romance of her life consisted in laying out ideal pleasuregrounds and building ideal castles in a little reedy island or ait which lay out in the thames a few perches from the drawingroom windows  such was the family of the woodwards harry normans father and mr woodward had been first cousins and hence it had been quite natural that when norman came up to reside in london he should be made welcome to surbiton cottage he had so been made welcome and had thus got into a habit of spending his saturday evenings and sundays at the home of his relatives in summer he could row up in his own wherry and land himself and carpetbag direct on the woodwards lawn and in the winter he came down by the hampton court five pm trainand in each case he returned on the monday morning thus as regards that portion of his time which was most his own he may be said almost to have lived at surbiton cottage and if on any sunday he omitted to make his appearance the omission was ascribed by the ladies of hampton in some halfserious sort of joke to metropolitan allurements and temptations which he ought to have withstood  when tudor and norman came to live together it was natural enough that tudor also should be taken down to surbiton cottage norman could not leave him on every saturday without telling him much of his friends whom he went to visit and he could hardly say much of them without offering to introduce his companion to them tudor accordingly went there and it soon came to pass that he also very frequently spent his sundays at hampton  it must be remembered that at this time the time that is of norman and tudors first entrance on their london life the girls at surbiton cottage were mere girlsthat is little more than children they had not as it were got their wings so as to be able to fly away when the provocation to do so might come they were in short gertrude and linda woodward and not the miss woodwards their drawers came down below their frocks instead of their frocks below their drawers and in lieu of studying the french language as is done by grownup ladies they did french lessons as is the case with ladies who are not grownup under these circumstances there was no embarrassment as to what the young people should call each other and they soon became very intimate as harry and alaric gertrude and linda  it is not however to be conceived that alaric tudor at once took the same footing in the house as norman this was far from being the case in the first place he never slept there seeing that there was no bed for him and the most confidential intercourse in the household took place as they sat cosy over the last embers of the drawingroom fire chatting about everything and nothing as girls always can do after tudor had gone away to his bed at the inn on the opposite side of the way and then tudor did not come on every saturday and at first did not do so without express invitation and although the girls soon habituated themselves to the familiarity of their new friends christian name it was some time before mrs woodward did so  twothree years soon flew by and linda and gertrude became the miss woodwards their frocks were prolonged their drawers curtailed and the lessons abandoned but still alaric tudor and harry norman came to hampton not less frequently than of yore and the world resident on that portion of the left bank of the thames found out that harry norman and gertrude woodward were to be man and wife and that alaric tudor and linda woodward were to go through the same ceremony they found this out or said that they had done so but as usual the world was wrong at least in part for at the time of which we are speaking no word of lovemaking had passed at any rate between the lastnamed couple  and what was mrs woodward about all this time was she matchmaking or matchmarring or was she negligently omitting the duties of a mother on so important an occasion she was certainly neither matchmaking nor matchmarring but it was from no negligence that she was thus quiescent she knew or thought she knew that the two young men were fit to be husbands to her daughters and she felt that if the wish for such an alliance should spring up between either pair there was no reason why she should interfere to prevent it but she felt also that she should not interfere to bring any such matter to pass these young people had by chance been thrown together should there be lovepassages among them as it was natural to suppose there might be it would be well should there be none such it would be well also she thoroughly trusted her own children and did not distrust her friends and so as regards mrs woodward the matter was allowed to rest  we cannot say that on this matter we quite approve of her conduct though we cannot but admire the feeling which engendered it her daughters were very young though they had made such positive advances as have been above described towards the discretion of womanhood they were of the age when they would have been regarded as mere boys had they belonged to the other sex the assertion made by clara van artevelde that women grow upon the sunny side of the wall is doubtless true but young ladies gifted as they are with such advantages may perhaps be thought to require some counsel some advice in those first tender years in which they so often have to make or mar their fortunes  not that mrs woodward gave them no advice not but that she advised them well and oftenbut she did so perhaps too much as an equal too little as a parent  but be that as it mayand i trust my readers will not be inclined so early in our story to lean heavily on mrs woodward whom i at once declare to be my own chief favourite in the talebut be that as it may it so occurred that gertrude before she was nineteen had listened to vows of love from harry norman which she neither accepted nor repudiated and that linda had before she was eighteen perhaps unfortunately taught herself to think it probable that she might have to listen to vows of love from alaric tudor  there had been no concealment between the young men as to their feelings norman had told his friend scores of times that it was the first wish of his heart to marry gertrude woodward and had told him moreover what were his grounds for hope and what his reasons for despair  she is as proud as a queen he had once said as he was rowing from hampton to searles wharf and lay on his oars as the falling tide carried his boat softly past the green banks of richmondshe is as proud as a queen and yet as timid as a fawn she lets me tell her that i love her but she will not say a word to me in reply as for touching her in the way of a caress i should as soon think of putting my arm round a goddess  and why not put your arms round a goddess said alaric who was perhaps a little bolder than his friend and a little less romantic to this harry answered nothing but laying his back to his work swept on past the gardens of kew and shot among the wooden dangers of putney bridge  i wish you could bring yourself to make up to linda said he resting again from his labours that would make the matter so much easier  bring myself said alaric what you mean is that you wish i could bring linda to consent to be made up to  i dont think you would have much difficulty said harry finding it much easier to answer for linda than for her sister but perhaps you dont admire her  i think her by far the prettier of the two said alaric  thats nonsense said harry getting rather red in the face and feeling rather angry  indeed i do and so i am convinced would most men you need not murder me man you want me to make up to linda and surely it will be better that i should admire my own wife than yours  oh you may admire whom you like but to say that she is prettier than gertrudewhy you know it is nonsense  very well my dear fellow then to oblige you ill fall in love with gertrude  i know you wont do that said harry for you are not so very fond of each other but joking apart i do wish so you would make up to linda  well i will when my aunt leaves me £200 a year  there was no answering this so the two men changed the conversation as they walked up together from the boat wharf to the office of the weights and measures  it was just at this time that fortune and old mr tudor of the shropshire parsonage brought charley tudor to reside with our two heroes for the first month or six weeks charley was ruthlessly left by his companions to get through his sundays as best he could it is to be hoped that he spent them in divine worship but it may we fear be surmised with more probability that he paid his devotions at the shrine of some very inferior publichouse deity in the neighbourhood of somerset house as a matter of course both norman and tudor spoke much of their new companion to the ladies at surbiton cottage and as by degrees they reported somewhat favourably of his improved morals mrs woodward with a womans true kindness begged that he might be brought down to hampton  i am afraid you will find him very rough said his cousin alaric  at any rate you will not find him a fool said norman who was always the more charitable of the two  thank god for that said mrs woodward and if he will come next saturday let him by all means do so pray give my compliments to him and tell him how glad i shall be to see him  and thus was this wild wolf to be led into the sheepcote this infernal navvy to be introduced among the angels of surbiton cottage mrs woodward thought that she had a taste for reclaiming reprobates and was determined to try her hand on charley tudor  charley went and his debut was perfectly successful we have hitherto only looked on the worst side of his character but bad as his character was it had a better side he was goodnatured in the extreme kindhearted and affectionate and though too apt to be noisy and even boisterous when much encouraged was not without a certain innate genuine modesty which the knowledge of his own iniquities had rather increased than blunted and as norman had said of him he was no fool his education had not been good and he had done nothing by subsequent reading to make up for this deficiency but he was well endowed with motherwit and owed none of his deficiencies to natures churlishness  he came and was well received the girls thought he would surely get drunk before he left the table and mrs wood ward feared the austere precision of her parlourmaid might be offended by some unworthy familiarity but no accident of either kind seemed to occur he came to the teatable perfectly sober and as far as mrs woodward could tell was unaware of the presence of the parlourmaiden  on the sunday morning charley went to church just like a christian now mrs woodward certainly had expected that he would have spent those two hours in smoking and attacking the parlourmaid he went to church however and seemed in no whit astray there stood up when others stood up and sat down when others sat down after all the infernal navvies bad as they doubtless were knew something of the recognized manners of civilized life  thus charley tudor ingratiated himself at surbiton cottage and when he left received a kind intimation from its mistress that she would be glad to see him again no day was fixed and so charley could not accompany his cousin and harry norman on the next saturday but it was not long before he got another direct invitation and so he also became intimate at hampton there could be no danger of any one falling in love with him for katie was still a child  things stood thus at surbiton cottage when mrs woodward received a proposition from a relative of her own which surprised them all not a little this was from a certain captain cuttwater who was a maternal uncle to mrs woodward and consisted of nothing less than an offer to come and live with them for the remaining term of his natural life now mrs woodwards girls had seen very little of their granduncle and what little they had seen had only taught them to laugh at him when his name was mentioned in the family conclave he was always made the subject of some little feminine joke and mrs woodward though she always took her uncles part did so in a manner that made them feel that he was fair game for their quizzing  when the proposal was first enunciated to the girls they one and all for katie was one of the council suggested that it should be declined with many thanks  hell take us all for midshipmen said linda and stop our rations and masthead us whenever we displease him  i am sure he is a cross old hunks though mamma says hes not said katie with all the impudence of spoilt fourteen  hell interfere with every one of our pursuits said gertrude more thoughtfully and be sure to quarrel with the young men  but mrs woodward though she had consulted her daughters had arguments of her own in favour of captain cuttwaters proposition which she had not yet made known to them goodhumoured and happy as she always was she had her cares in the world her income was only £400 a year and that now that the income tax had settled down on it was barely sufficient for her modest wants a moiety of this died with her and the remainder would be but a poor support for her three daughters if at the time of her death it should so chance that she should leave them in want of support she had always regarded captain cuttwater as a probable source of future aid he was childless and unmarried and had not as far as she was aware another relative in the world it would therefore under any circumstances be bad policy to offend him but the letter in which he had made his offer had been of a very peculiar kind he had begun by saying that he was to be turned out of his present berth by a d whig government on account of his age he being as young a man as ever he had been that it behoved him to look out for a place of residence in which he might live and if it should so please god die also he then said that he expected to pay £200 a year for his board and lodging which he thought might as well go to his niece as to some shark who would probably starve him he also said that poor as he was and always had been he had contrived to scrape together a few hundred pounds that he was well aware that if he lived among strangers he should be done out of every shilling of it but that if his niece would receive him he hoped to be able to keep it together for the benefit of his grandnieces c  now mrs woodward knew her uncle to be an honestminded man she knew also that in spite of his protestation as to being a very poor man he had saved money enough to make him of some consequence wherever he went and she therefore conceived that she could not with prudence send him to seek a home among chance strangers she explained as much of this to the girls as she thought proper and ended the matter by making them understand that captain cuttwater was to be received  on the saturday after this the three scions of the civil service were all at surbiton cottage and it will show how far charley had then made good his ground to state that the coming of the captain was debated in his presence  and when is the great man to be here said norman  at once i believe said mrs woodward that is perhaps before the end of this week and certainly before the end of next  and what is he like said alaric  why he has a tail hanging down behind like a cat or a dog said katie  hold your tongue miss said gertrude as he is to come he must be treated with respect but it is a great bore to me it will destroy all the pleasures of life  nonsense gertrude said mrs woodward it is almost wicked of you to say so destroy all the pleasure of life to have an old gentleman live in the same house with youyou ought to be more moderate my dear in what you say  thats all very well mamma said gertrude but you know you dont like him yourself  but is it true that captain cuttwater wears a pigtail asked norman  i dont care what he wears said gertrude he may wear three if he likes  oh i wish he would said katie laughing that would be so delicious oh linda fancy captain cuttwater with three pigtails   i am sorry to disappoint you katie said mrs woodward but your uncle does not wear even one he once did but he cut it off long since  i am so sorry said katie  i suppose hell want to dine early and go to bed early said linda  his going to bed early would be a great blessing said gertrude mindful of their midnight conclaves on saturdays and sundays  but his getting up early wont be a blessing at all said linda who had a weakness on that subject  talking of bed harry youll have the worst of it said katie for the captain is to have your room  yes indeed said mrs woodward sighing gently we shall no longer have a bed for you harry that is the worst of it  harry of course assured her that if that was the worst of it there was nothing very bad in it he could have a bed at the inn as well as alaric and charley the amount of that evil would only be halfacrown a night  and thus the advent of captain cuttwater was discussed    chapter iv  captain cuttwater   captain cuttwater had not seen much service afloat that is he had not been personally concerned in many of those seaengagements which in and about the time of nelson gave so great a halo of glory to the british lion nor had it even been permitted to him to take a prominent part in such minor affairs as have since occurred he had not the opportunity of distinguishing himself either at the battle of navarino or the bombarding of acre and unfortunately for his ambition the period of his retirement came before that great baltic campaign in which had he been there he would doubtless have distinguished himself as did so many others his earliest years were spent in cruising among the west indies he then came home and spent some considerable portion of his life in idlenessif that time can be said to have been idly spent which he devoted to torturing the admiralty with applications remonstrances and appeals then he was rated as third lieutenant on the books of some wormeaten old manofwar at portsmouth and gave up his time to looking after the stowage of anchors and counting fathoms of rope at last he was again sent afloat as senior lieutenant in a tengun brig and cruised for some time off the coast of africa hunting for slavers and returning after a while from this enterprising employment he received a sort of amphibious appointment at devonport what his duties were here the author being in all points a landsman is unable to describe those who were inclined to ridicule captain cuttwater declared that the most important of them consisted in seeing that the midshipmen in and about the dockyard washed their faces and put on clean linen not less often than three times a week according to his own account he had many things of a higher nature to attend to and indeed hardly a ship sank or swam in hamoaze except by his special permission for a space of twenty years if his own view of his own career may be accepted as correct  he had once declared to certain naval acquaintances over his third glass of grog that he regarded it as his birthright to be an admiral but at the age of seventytwo he had not yet acquired his birthright and the probability of his ever attaining it was becoming very small indeed he was still bothering lords and secretaries of the admiralty for further promotion when he was astounded by being informed by the portadmiral that he was to be made happy by halfpay and a pension the admiral in communicating the intelligence had pretended to think that he was giving the captain information which could not be otherwise than grateful to him but he was not the less aware that the old man would be furious at being so treated what pension him put him on halfpayshelf him for life while he was still anxiously expecting that promotion that call to higher duties which had so long been his due and which now that his powers were matured could hardly be longer denied to him and after all that he had done for his countryhis ungrateful thankless ignorant countrywas he thus to be treated was he to be turned adrift without any mark of honour any special guerdon any sign of his sovereigns favour to testify as to his faithful servitude of sixty years devotion he who had regarded it as his merest right to be an admiral and had long indulged the hope of being greeted in the streets of devonport as sir bartholomew cuttwater kcb was he to be thus thrown aside in his prime with no other acknowledgement than the bare income to which he was entitled  it is hardly too much to say that no old officers who have lacked the means to distinguish themselves retire from either of our military services free from the bitter disappointment and sour feelings of neglected worth which captain cuttwater felt so keenly a clergyman or a doctor or a lawyer feels himself no whit disgraced if he reaches the end of his worldly labours without special note or honour but to a soldier or a sailor such indifference to his merit is wormwood it is the bane of the professions nine men out of ten who go into it must live discontented and die disappointed  captain cuttwater had no idea that he was an old man he had lived for so many years among men of his own stamp who had grown grey and bald and rickety and weak alongside of him that he had no opportunity of seeing that he was more grey or more rickety than his neighbours no children had become men and women at his feet no new race had gone out into the world and fought their battles under his notice one set of midshipmen had succeeded to another but his old comrades in the newsrooms and loungingplaces at devonport had remained the same and captain cuttwater had never learnt to think that he was not doing and was not able to do good service for his country  the very name of captain cuttwater was odious to every clerk at the admiralty he like all naval officers hated the admiralty and thought that of all englishmen those five who had been selected to sit there in high places as joint lords were the most incapable he pestered them with continued and almost continuous applications on subjects of all sorts he was always asking for increased allowances advanced rank more assistance less work higher privileges immunities which could not be granted and advantages to which he had no claim he never took answers but made every request the subject of a prolonged correspondence till at last some energetic assistantsecretary declared that it should no longer be borne and captain cuttwater was dismissed with pension and halfpay during his service he had contrived to save some four or five thousand pounds and now he was about to retire with an assured income adequate to all his wants the public who had the paying of captain cuttwater may perhaps think that he was amply remunerated for what he had done but the captain himself entertained a very different opinion  such is the view which we are obliged to take of the professional side of captain cuttwaters character but the professional side was by far the worst counting fathoms of rope and looking after unruly midshipmen on shore are not duties capable of bringing out in high relief the better traits of a mains character uncle bat as during the few last years of his life he was always called at surbiton cottage was a gentleman and a man of honour in spite of anything that might be said to the contrary at the admiralty he was a man with a soft heart though the end of his nose was so large so red and so pimply and rough as was his usage to little midshipmen when his duty caused him to encounter them in a body he had befriended many a one singly with kind words and an open hand the young rogues would unmercifully quiz old nosey for so captain cuttwater was generally called in devonport whenever they could safely do so but nevertheless in their young distresses they knew him for their friend and were not slow to come to him  in person captain cuttwater was a tall heavy man on whose iron constitution hogsheads of hollands and water seemed to have had no very powerful effect he was much given to profane oaths but knowing that manners required that he should refrain before ladies and being unable to bring his tongue sufficiently under command to do so he was in the habit of craving the ladies pardon after every slip  all that was really remarkable in uncle bats appearance was included in his nose it had always been a generous weighty selfconfident nose inviting to itself more observation than any of its brother features demanded but in latter years it had spread itself out in soft porous red excrescences to such an extent as to make it really deserving of considerable attention no stranger ever passed captain cuttwater in the streets of devonport without asking who he was or at any rate specially noticing him  it must of course be admitted that a too strongly pronounced partiality for alcoholic drink had produced these defects in captain cuttwaters nasal organ and yet he was a most staunch friend of temperance no man alive or dead had ever seen captain cuttwater the worse for liquor at least so boasted the captain himself and there were none at any rate in devonport to give him the lie woe betide the midshipman whom he should see elated with too much wine and even to the common sailor who should be tipsy at the wrong time he would show no mercy most eloquent were the discourses which he preached against drunkenness and they always ended with a reference to his own sobriety the truth was that drink would hardly make captain cuttwater drunk it left his brain untouched but punished his nose  mrs woodward had seen her uncle but once since she had become a widow he had then come up to london to attack the admiralty at close quarters and had sojourned for three or four days at surbiton cottage this was now some ten years since and the girls had forgotten even what he was like great preparations were made for him though the summer had nearly commenced a large fire was kept burning in his bedroomhis bed was newly hung with new curtains two feather beds were piled on each other and everything was done which five women could think desirable to relieve the ailings of suffering age the fact however was that captain cuttwater was accustomed to a small tent bedstead in a room without a carpet that he usually slept on a single mattress and that he never had a fire in his bedroom even in the depth of winter  travelling from devonport to london is now an easy matter and captain cuttwater old as he was found himself able to get through to hampton in one day mrs woodward went to meet him at hampton court in a fly and conveyed him to his new home together with a carpetbag a cocked hat a sword and a very small portmanteau when she inquired after the remainder of his luggage he asked her what more lumber she supposed he wanted no more lumber at any rate made its appearance then or afterwards and the fly proceeded with an easy load to surbiton cottage  there was great anxiety on the part of the girls when the wheels were heard to stop at the front door gertrude kept her place steadily standing on the rug in the drawingroom linda ran to the door and then back again but katie bolted out and ensconced herself behind the parlourmaid who stood at the open door looking eagerly forth to get the first view of uncle bat  so here you are bessie as snug as ever said the captain as he let himself ponderously down from the fly katie had never before heard her mother called bessie and had never seen anything approaching in size or colour to such a nose consequently she ran away frightened  thats gertrudeis it said the captain  gertrude uncle why gertrude is a grownup woman now thats katie whom you remember an infant  god bless my soul said the captain as though he thought that girls must grow twice quicker at hampton than they did at devonport or elsewhere god bless my soul  he was then ushered into the drawingroom and introduced in form to his grandnieces this is gertrude uncle and this linda there is just enough difference for you to know them apart and this katie come here katie and kiss your uncle  katie came up hesitated looked horrified but did manage to get her face somewhat close to the old mans without touching the tremendous nose and then having gone through this peril she retreated again behind the sofa  well bless my stars bessie you dont tell me those are your children  indeed uncle i believe they are its a sad tale for me to tell is it not said the blooming mother with a laugh  why theyll be looking out for husbands next said uncle bat  oh theyre doing that already every day said katie  ha ha ha laughed uncle bat i suppose so i suppose soha ha ha  gertrude turned away to the window disgusted and angry and made up her mind to hate uncle bat for ever afterwards linda made a little attempt to smile and felt somewhat glad in her heart that her uncle was a man who could indulge in a joke  he was then taken upstairs to his bedroom and here he greatly frightened katie and much scandalized the parlourmaid by declaring immediately on his entering the room that it was d hot dation hot craving your pardon ladies  we thought uncle youd like a fire began mrs woodward as  a fire in june when i can hardly carry my coat on my back  its the last day of may now said katie timidly from behind the bedcurtains  this however did not satisfy the captain and orders were forthwith given that the fire should be taken away the curtains stripped off the feather beds removed and everything reduced to pretty much the same state in which it had usually been left for harry normans accommodation so much for all the feminine care which had been thrown away upon the consideration of uncle bats infirmities  god bless my soul said he wiping his brow with a huge coloured handkerchief as big as a mainsail one night in such a furnace as that would have brought on the gout  he had dined in town and by the time that his chamber had been stripped of its appendages he was nearly ready for bed before he did so he was asked to take a glass of sherry  ah sherry said he taking up the bottle and putting it down again sherry ah yes very good wine i am sure you havent a drop of rum in the house have you  mrs woodward declared with sorrow that she had not  or hollands said uncle bat but the ladies of surbiton cottage were unsupplied also with hollands  gin suggested the captain almost in despair  mrs woodward had no gin but she could send out and get it and the first evening of captain cuttwaters visit saw mrs woodwards own parlourmaid standing at the bar of the green dragon while two gills of spirits were being measured out for her  only for the respect she owed to missus as she afterwards declared she never would have so demeaned herself for all the captains in the queens battalions  the captain however got his grog and having enlarged somewhat vehemently while he drank it on the iniquities of those scoundrels at the admiralty took himself off to bed and left his character and peculiarities to the tender mercies of his nieces  the following day was friday and on the saturday norman and tudor were to come down as a matter of course during the long days they usually made their appearance after dinner but they had now been specially requested to appear in good orderly time in honour of the captain their advent had been of course spoken of and mrs woodward had explained to uncle bat that her cousin harry usually spent his sundays at hampton and that he usually also brought with him a friend of his a mr tudor to all this as a matter of course uncle bat had as yet no objection to make  the young men came and were introduced with due ceremony surbiton cottage however during dinnertime was very unlike what it had been before in the opinion of all the party there assembled the girls felt themselves called upon they hardly knew why to be somewhat less intimate in their manner with the young men than they customarily were and harry and alaric with quick instinct reciprocated the feeling mrs woodward even assumed involuntarily somewhat of a company air and uncle bat who sat at the bottom of the table in the place usually assigned to norman was awkward in doing the honours of the house to guests who were in fact much more at home there than himself  after dinner the young people strolled out into the garden and katie as was her wont insisted on harry norman rowing her over to her damp paradise in the middle of the river he attempted vainly to induce gertrude to accompany them gertrude was either coy with her lover or indifferent for very few were the occasions on which she could be induced to gratify him with the rapture of a têteàtête encounter so that in fact harry normans sunday visits were generally moments of expected bliss of which the full fruition was but seldom attained so while katie went off to the island alaric and the two girls sat under a spreading elm tree and watched the little boat as it shot across the water and what do you think of uncle bat said gertrude  well i am sure hes a good sort of fellow and a very gallant officer but  but what said linda  its a thousand pities he should have ever been removed from devonport where i am sure he was both useful and ornamental  both the girls laughed cheerily and as the sound came across the water to normans ears he repented himself of his good nature to katie and determined that her sojourn in the favourite island should on this occasion be very short  but he is to pay mamma a great deal of money said linda and his coming will be a great benefit to her in that way  there ought to be something to compensate for the bore said gertrude  we must only make the best of him said alaric for my part i am rather fond of old gentlemen with long noses but it seemed to me that he was not quite so fond of us i thought he looked rather shy at harry and me  both the girls protested against this and declared that there could be nothing in it  well now ill tell you what gertrude said alaric i am quite sure that he looks on me especially as an interloper and yet ill bet you a pair of gloves i am his favourite before a month is over  oh no linda is to be his favourite said gertrude  indeed i am not said linda i liked him very well till he drank three huge glasses of ginandwater last night but i never can fancy him after that you cant conceive alaric what the drawingroom smelt like i suppose hell do the same every evening  well what can you expect said gertrude if mamma will have an old sailor to live with her of course hell drink grog  while this was going on in the garden mrs woodward sat dutifully with her uncle while he sipped his obnoxious toddy and answered his questions about their two friends  they were both in the weights and measures by far the most respectable public office in london as she told him and both doing extremely well there they were indeed young men sure to distinguish themselves and get on in the world had this not been so she might perhaps have hesitated to receive them so frequently and on such intimate terms at surbiton cottage this she said in a halfapologetic manner and yet with a feeling of anger at herself that she should condescend to apologize to any one as to her own conduct in her own house  they are verynice young men i am sure said uncle bat  indeed they are said mrs woodward  and very civil to the young ladies said uncle bat  they have known them since they were children uncle and of course that makes them more intimate than young men generally are with young ladies and again mrs woodward was angry with herself for making any excuses on the subject  are they well off asked the prudent captain  harry norman is very well off he has a private fortune both of them have excellent situations  to my way of thinking that other chap is the better fellow at any rate he seems to have more gumption about him  why uncle you dont mean to tell me that you think harry norman a fool said mrs woodward harry norman was mrs woodwards special friend and she fondly indulged the hope of seeing him in time become the husband of her elder and favourite daughter if indeed she can be fairly said to have had a favourite child  captain cuttwater poured out another glass of rum and dropped the subject  soon afterwards the whole party came in from the lawn katie was all draggled and wet for she had persisted in making her way right across the island to look out for a site for another palace norman was a little inclined to be sulky for katie had got the better of him when she had got out of the boat he could not get her into it again and as he could not very well leave her in the island he had been obliged to remain paddling about while he heard the happy voices of alaric and the two girls from the lawn alaric was in high goodhumour and entered the room intent on his threatened purpose of seducing captain cuttwaters affections the two girls were both blooming with happy glee and gertrude was especially bright in spite of the somewhat sombre demeanour of her lover  tea was brought in whereupon captain cuttwater having taken a bit of toast and crammed it into his saucer fell fast asleep in an armchair  youll have very little opportunity tonight said linda almost in a whisper  opportunity for what asked mrs woodward  hush said gertrude well tell you by and by mamma youll wake uncle bat if you talk now  i am so thirsty said katie bouncing into the room with dry shoes and stockings on i am so thirsty oh linda do give me some tea  hush said alaric pointing to the captain who was thoroughly enjoying himself and uttering sonorous snores at regular fixed intervals  sit down katie and dont make a noise said mrs woodward gently  katie slunk into a chair opened wide her large bright eyes applied herself diligently to her teacup and then after taking breath said in a very audible whisper to her sister are not we to talk at all linda that will be very dull i think  yes my dear you are to talk as much as you please and as often as you please and as loud as you please that is to say if your mamma will let you said captain cuttwater without any apparent waking effort and in a moment the snoring was going on again as regularly as before  katie looked round and again opened her eyes and laughed mrs woodward said you are very goodnatured uncle the girls exchanged looks with alaric and norman who had not yet recovered his goodhumour went on sipping his tea  as soon as the teathings were gone uncle bat yawned and shook himself and asked if it was not nearly time to go to bed  whenever you like uncle bat said mrs woodward who began to find that she agreed with gertrude that early habits on the part of her uncle would be a family blessing but perhaps youll take something before you go  well i dont mind if i do take a thimbleful of rumandwater so the odious spiritbottle was again brought into the drawingroom  did you call at the admiralty sir as you came through town said alaric  call at the admiralty sir said the captain turning sharply round at the questioner what the deuce should i call at the admiralty for craving the ladies pardon  well indeed i dont know said alaric not a bit abashed but sailors always do call there for the pleasure i suppose of kicking their heels in the lords waitingroom  i have done with that game said captain cuttwater now wide awake and in his energy he poured half a glass more rum into his beaker ive done with that game and ill tell you what mr tudor if i had a dozen sons to provide for tomorrow  oh i do so wish you had said katie it would be such fun fancy uncle bat having twelve sons gertrude what would you call them all uncle  why i tell you what miss katie i wouldnt call one of them a sailor id sooner make tailors of them  tinker tailor soldier sailor gentleman apothecary ploughboy thief said katie that would only be eight what should the other four be uncle  youre quite right captain cuttwater said alaric at least as far as the present moment goes but the time is coming when things at the admiralty will be managed very differently  then im d if that time can come too sooncraving the ladies pardon said uncle bat  i dont know what you mean alaric said harry norman who was just at present somewhat disposed to contradict his friend and not illinclined to contradict the captain also as far as i can judge the admiralty is the very last office the government will think of touching  the government shouted captain cuttwater oh if we are to wait for the government the navy may go to the deuce sir  its the pressure from without that must do the work said alaric  pressure from without said norman scornfully i hate to hear such trash  well see young gentleman well see said the captain it may be trash and it may be right that five fellows who never did the queen a days service in their life should get fifteen hundred or two thousand a year and have the power of robbing an old sailor like me of the reward due to me for sixty years hard work reward no but the very wages that i have actually earned look at me now d me look at me here i am captain cuttwaterwith sixty years serviceand ive done more perhaps for the queens navy thanthan  its too true captain cuttwater said alaric speaking with a sort of mock earnestness which completely took in the captain but stealing a glance at the same time at the two girls who sat over their work at the drawingroom table its too true and theres no doubt the whole thing must be altered and that soon in the first place we must have a sailor at the head of the navy  yes said the captain and one that knows something about it too  youll never have a sailor sitting as first lord said norman authoritatively unless it be when some party man high in rank may happen to have been in the navy as a boy  and why not said captain cuttwater quite angrily  because the first lord must sit in the cabinet and to do that he must be a thorough politician  d politicians craving the ladies pardon said uncle bat  amen said alaric  uncle bat thinking that he had thoroughly carried his point finished his grog took up his candlestick and toddled off to bed  well i think i have done something towards carrying my point said alaric  i didnt think you were half so cunning said linda laughing  i cannot think how you can condescend to advocate opinions diametrically opposed to your own convictions said norman somewhat haughtily  fee fo fum said alaric  what is it all about said mrs woodward  alaric wants to do all he can to ingratiate himself with uncle bat said gertrude and i am sure hes going the right way to work  its very goodnatured on his part said mrs woodward  i dont know what you are talking about said katie yawning and i think you are all very stupid so ill go to bed  the rest soon followed her they did not sit up so late chatting over the fire this evening as was their wont on saturdays though none of them knew what cause prevented it    chapter v  bushey park   the next day being sunday the whole party very properly went to church but during the sermon captain cuttwater very improperly went to sleep and snored ponderously the whole time katie was so thoroughly shocked that she did not know which way to look norman who had recovered his goodhumour and alaric could not refrain from smiling as they caught the eyes of the two girls and mrs woodward made sundry little abortive efforts to wake her uncle with her foot altogether abortive they were not for the captain would open his eyes and gaze at her for a moment in the most goodnatured lacklustre manner conceivable but then in a moment he would be again asleep and snoring with all the regularity of a kitchenclock this was at first very dreadful to the woodwards but after a month or two they got used to it and so apparently did the pastor and the people of hampton  after church there was a lunch of course and then according to their wont they went out to walk these sunday walks in general were matters of some difficulty the beautiful neighbourhood of hampton court with its palacegardens and lovely park is so popular with londoners that it is generally alive on that day with a thronged multitude of men women and children and thus becomes not an eligible resort for lovers of privacy captain cuttwater however on this occasion insisted on seeing the chestnuts and the crowd and consequently they all went into bushey park  uncle bat who professed himself to be a philanthropist and who was also a bit of a democrat declared himself delighted with what he saw it was a great thing for the london citizens to come down there with their wives and children and eat their dinners in the open air under the spreading trees and both harry and alaric agreed with him mrs woodward however averred that it would be much better if they would go to church first and gertrude and linda were of opinion that the park was spoilt by the dirty bits of greasy paper which were left about on all sides katie thought it very hard that as all the londoners were allowed to eat their dinners in the park she might not have hers there also to which captain cuttwater rejoined that he should give them a picnic at richmond before the summer was over  all the world knows how such a party as that of our friends by degrees separates itself into twos and threes when sauntering about in shady walks it was seldom indeed that norman could induce his dulcinea to be so complaisant in his favour but either accident or kindness on her part favoured him on this occasion and as katie went on eliciting from uncle bat fresh promises as to the picnic harry and gertrude found themselves together under one avenue of trees while alaric and linda were equally fortunate or unfortunate under another  i did so wish to speak a few words to you gertrude said norman but it seems as though now that this captain has come among us all our old habits and ways are to be upset  i dont see that you need say that said she we may perhaps be put out a littlethat is mamma and linda and i but i do not see that you need suffer  sufferno not sufferand yet it is suffering  what is suffering said she  why to be as we were last nightnot able to speak to each other  come harry you should be a little reasonable said she laughing if you did not talk last night whose fault was it  i suppose you will say it was my own perhaps it was but i could not feel comfortable while he was drinking ginandwater  it was rum said gertrude rather gravely  well rumandwater in your mothers drawingroom and cursing and swearing before you and linda as though he were in the cockpit of a manofwar  alaric you saw was able to make himself happy and i am sure he is not more indifferent to us than you are  alaric seemed to me to be bent on making a fool of the old man and to tell the truth i cannot approve of his doing so  it seems to me harry that you do not approve of what any of us are doing said she i fear we are all in your black bookscaptain cuttwater and mamma and alaric and i and all of us  well now gertrude do you mean to say you think it right that katie should sit by and hear a man talk as captain cuttwater talked last night do you mean to say that the scene which passed with the rum and the curses and the absurd ridicule which was thrown on your mothers uncle was such as should take place in your mothers drawingroom  i mean to say harry that my mother is the best and only judge of what should and what should not take place there  norman felt himself somewhat silenced by this and walked on for a time without speaking he was a little too apt to take upon himself the character of mentor and strange to say he was aware of his own fault in this particular thus though the temptation to preach was very powerful he refrained himself for a while his present desire was to say soft things rather than sharp words and though lecturing was at this moment much easier to him than lovemaking he bethought himself of his object and controlled the spirit of morality which was strong within him  but we were so happy before your uncle came he said speaking with his sweetest voice and looking at the beautiful girl beside him with all the love he was able to throw into his handsome face  and we are happy now that he has comeor at any rate ought to be said gertrude doing a little in the mentor line herself now that the occasion came in her way  ah gertrude you know very well there is only one thing can make me happy said harry  why you unreasonable man just now you said you were perfectly happy before captain cuttwater came i suppose the one thing now necessary is to send him away again  no gertrude the thing necessary is to take you away  what out of the contamination of poor old uncle bats bottle of rum but harry you see it would be cowardly in me to leave mamma and linda to suffer the calamity alone  i wonder gertrude whether in your heart of hearts you really care a straw about me said harry who was now very sentimental and somewhat lachrymose  you know we all care very much about you and it is very wrong in you to express such a doubt said gertrude with a duplicity that was almost wicked as if she did not fully understand that the kind of caring of which norman spoke was of a very different nature from the general caring which she on his behalf shared with the rest of her family  all of youyes but i am not speaking of all of you i am speaking of you gertrudeyou in particular can you ever love me well enough to be my wife  well there is no knowing what i may be able to do in three or four years time but even that must depend very much on how you behave yourself in the mean time if you get cross because captain cuttwater has come here and snub alaric and linda as you did last night and scold at mamma because she chooses to let her own uncle live in her own house why to tell you the truth i dont think i ever shall  all persons who have a propensity to lecture others have a strong constitutional dislike to being lectured themselves such was decidedly the case with harry norman in spite of his strong love and his anxious desire to make himself agreeable his brow became somewhat darkened and his lips somewhat compressed he would not probably have been annoyed had he not been found fault with for snubbing his friend tudor why should gertrude his gertrude put herself forward to defend his friend let her say what she chose for her mother or even for her profane dramdrinking vulgar old uncle but it was too much that she should take up the cudgels for alaric tudor  well said he i was annoyed last night and i must own it it grieved me to hear alaric turning your uncle into ridicule and that before your mothers face and it grieved me to see you and linda encourage him in what alaric said about the admiralty he did not speak truthfully  do you mean to say that alaric said what was false  inasmuch as he was pretending to express his own opinion he did say what was false  then i must and will say that i never yet knew alaric say a word that was not true and which is more i am quite sure that he would not accuse you of falsehood behind your back in a fit of jealousy  jealousy said norman looking now as black as grim death itself  yes it is jealousy it so turned out that alaric got on better last night with captain cuttwater than you did and that makes you jealous  pish said norman somewhat relieved but still sufficiently disgusted that his ladylove should suppose that he could be otherwise than supremely indifferent to the opinion of captain cuttwater  the lovescene however was fatally interrupted and the pair were not long before they joined the captain mrs woodward and katie  and how fared it with the other pair under the other avenue of chestnuts  alaric tudor had certainly come out with no defined intention of making love as harry norman had done but with such a companion it was very difficult for him to avoid it linda was much more open to attacks of this nature than her sister not that she was as a general rule willingly and wilfully inclined to give more encouragement to lovers than gertrude but she had less power of fence less skill in protecting herself and much less of that naughty selfesteem which makes some women fancy that all lovemaking to them is a liberty and the want of which makes others feel that all lovemaking is to them a compliment  alaric tudor had no defined intention of making love but he had a sort of suspicion that he might if he pleased do so successfully and he had no defined intention of letting it alone he was a farseeing prudent man for his age perhaps too prudent but he was nevertheless fully susceptible of the pleasure of holding an affectionate close intercourse with so sweet a girl as linda woodward and though he knew that marriage with a girl without a dowry would for him be a deathblow to all his high hopes he could hardly resist the temptation of conjugating the verb to love had he been able to choose from the two sisters he would probably have selected gertrude in spite of what he had said to norman in the boat but gertrude was bespoken and it therefore seemed all but unnatural that there should not be some love passages between him and linda  ah mrs woodward my friend my friend was it well that thou shouldst leave that sweet unguarded rosebud of thine to such perils as these  they also commenced their wooing by talking over captain cuttwater but they did not quarrel over him linda was quite content to be told by her friend what she ought to do and how she ought to think about her uncle and alaric had a better way of laying down the law than norman he could do so without offending his hearers pride and consequently was generally better listened to than his friend though his law was probably not in effect so sound  but they had soon done with captain cuttwater and alaric had to choose another subject gertrude and norman were at some distance from them but were in sight and somewhat in advance  look at harry said alaric i know from the motion of his shoulder that he is at this moment saying something very tender  it is ten times more likely that they are quarrelling said linda  oh the quarrels of loverswe know all about that dont we  you must not call them lovers alaric mamma would not like it nor indeed would gertrude i am sure  i would not for the world do anything that mrs woodward would not like but between ourselves linda are they not lovers  no that is not that i know of i dont believe that they are a bit said linda blushing at her own fib  and why should they not be how indeed is it possible that they should not be that isfor i heartily beg gertrudes pardonhow is it possible that harry should not be in love with her  indeed gertrude is very very beautiful said linda with the faintest possible sigh occasioned by the remembrance of her own inferior charms  indeed she is very very beautiful repeated alaric speaking with an absent air as though his mind were fully engaged in thinking of the beauty of which he spoke  it was not in lindas nature to be angry because her sister was admired and because she was not but yet there was something in alarics warm tone of admiration which gave her a feeling of unhappiness which she would have been quite unable to define even had she attempted it she saw her sister and harry norman before her and she knew in her heart that they were lovers in spite of her little weak declaration to the contrary she saw how earnestly her sister was loved and she in her kindly loving nature could not but envy her fancied happiness envynoit certainly was not envy she would not for worlds have robbed her sister of her admirer but it was so natural for her to feel that it must be delicious to be admired  she did not begrudge gertrude normans superior beauty nor his greater wealth she knew that gertrude was entitled to more much more than herself but seeing that norman was gertrudes lover was it not natural that alaric should be hers and then though harry was the handsomer and the richer she liked alaric so much the better of the two but now that alaric was alone with her the only subject he could think to talk of was gertrudes beauty  it must not be supposed that these thoughts in their plainlydeveloped form passed through lindas mind it was not that she thought all this but that she felt it such feelings are quite involuntary whereas ones thoughts are more or less under command linda would not have allowed herself to think in this way for worlds but she could not control her feelings  they walked on side by side perfectly silent for a minute or two and an illnatured tear was gathering itself in the corner of lindas eye she was afraid even to raise her hand to brush it away for fear alaric should see her and thus it went on gathering till it was like to fall  how singular it is said alarichow very singular the way in which i find myself living with you all such a perfect stranger as i am  a perfect stranger said linda who having remembered alaric since the days of her short frocks and lessons looked on him as a very old friend indeed  yes a perfect stranger if you think of it what do any of you know about me your mother never saw my mother your father knew nothing of my father there is no kindred blood common to us harry norman there is your near cousin but what am i that i should be thus allowed to live with you and walk with you and have a common interest in all your doings  why you are a dear friend of mammas are you not  a dear friend of mammas said he well indeed i hope i am for your mother is at any rate a dear friend to me but linda one cannot be so much without longing to be more look at harry how happy he is  but alaric surely you would not interfere with harry said linda whose humble innocent heart thought still of nothing but the merits of her sister and then remembering that it was necessary that she should admit nothing on gertrudes behalf she entered her little protest against the assumption that her sister acknowledged norman for her lover that is you would not do so if there were anything in it  i interfere with harry said alaric switching the heads off the bits of fern with the cane he carried no indeed i have no wish at all to do that it is not that of which i was thinking harry is welcome to all his happiness that is if gertrude can be brought to make him happy  linda made no answer now but the tear came running down her face and her eyes became dim and her heart beat very quick and she didnt quite remember where she was up to this moment no man had spoken a word of love to linda woodward and to some girls the first word is very trying  interfere with harry alaric repeated again and renewed his attack on the ferns well linda what an opinion you must have of me  linda was past answering she could not protestnor would it have been expedient to do sothat her opinion of her companion was not unfavourable  gertrude is beautiful very beautiful he continued still beating about the bush as modest lovers do and should do but she is not the only beautiful girl in surbiton cottage nor to my eyes is she the most so  linda was now quite beside herself she knew that decorum required that she should say something stiff and stately to repress such language but if all her future character for propriety had depended on it she could not bring herself to say a word she knew that gertrude when so addressed would have maintained her dignity and have concealed her secret even if she allowed herself to have a secret to conceal she knew that it behoved her to be repellent and antagonistic to the first vows of a first lover but alas she had no power of antagonism no energy for repulse left in her her knees seemed to be weak beneath her and all she could do was to pluck to pieces the few flowers that she carried at her waist  alaric saw his advantage but was too generous to push it closely nor indeed did he choose to commit himself to all the assured intentions of a positive declaration he wished to raise an interest in lindas heart and having done so to leave the matter to chance something however it was necessary that he should say he walked a while by her in silence decapitating the ferns and then coming close to her he said  linda dear linda you are not angry with me linda however answered nothing linda dearest linda speak one word to me  dont said linda through her tears pray dont alaric pray dont  well linda i will not say another word to you now let us walk gently we shall catch them up quite in time before they leave the park  and so they sauntered on exchanging no further words linda by degrees recovered her calmness and as she did so she found herself to be oh so happy she had never never envied gertrude her lover but it was so sweet so very sweet to be able to share her sisters happiness and alaric was he also happy at the moment he doubtless enjoyed the triumph of his success but still he had a feeling of sad care at his heart how was he to marry a girl without a shilling were all his high hopes was all his soaring ambition to be thrown over for a dream of love  ah mrs woodward my friend my friend thou who wouldst have fed thy young ones like the pelican with blood from thine own breast had such feeding been of avail thou who art the kindest of mothers has it been well for thee to subject to such perils this poor weak young dove of thine  uncle bat had become tired with his walk and crawled home so slowly that alaric and linda caught the party just as they reached the small wicket which leads out of the park on the side nearest to hampton nothing was said or thought of their absence and they all entered the house together four of them however were conscious that that sundays walk beneath the chestnuts of bushey park would long be remembered  nothing else occurred to make the day memorable in the evening after dinner mrs woodward and her daughters went to church leaving her younger guests to entertain the elder one the elder one soon took the matter in his own hand by going to sleep and harry and alaric being thus at liberty sauntered out down the river side they both made a forced attempt at goodhumour each speaking cheerily to the other but there was no confidence between them as there had been on that morning when harry rowed his friend up to london ah me what had occurred between them to break the bonds of their mutual trustto quench the ardour of their firm friendship but so it was between them now it was fated that they never again should place full confidence in each other  there was no such breach between the sisters at least not as yet but even between them there was no free and full interchange of their hopes and fears gertrude and linda shared the same room and were accustomedas what girls are notto talk half through the night of all their wishes thoughts and feelings and gertrude was generally prone enough to talk of harry norman sometimes she would say she loved him a little just a little at others she would declare that she loved him not at allthat is not as heroines love in novels not as she thought she could love and would do should it ever be her lot to be wooed by such a lover as her young fancy pictured to her then she would describe her beau idéal and the description certainly gave no counterpart of harry norman to tell the truth however gertrude was as yet heart whole and when she talked of love and harry norman she did not know what love was  on this special sunday evening she was disinclined to speak of him at all not that she loved him more than usual but that she was beginning to think that she could not ever really love him at all she had taught herself to think that he might probably be her husband and had hitherto felt no such repugnance to her destiny as caused her to shun the subject but now she was beginning to think of the matter seriously and as she did so she felt that life might have for her a lot more blessed than that of sharing the world with her cousin harry  when therefore linda began to question her about her lover and to make little hints of her desire to tell what alaric had said of her and norman gertrude gave her no encouragement she would speak of captain cuttwater of katies lessons of the new dress they were to make for their mother of mr everscreechs long sermon of anything in fact but of harry norman  now this was very hard on poor linda her heart was bursting within her to tell her sister that she also was beloved but she could not do so without some little encouragement  in all their conferences she took the cue of the conversation from her sister and though she could have talked about alaric by the hour if gertrude would have consented to talk about harry she did not know how to start the subject of her own lover while gertrude was so cold and uncommunicative as to hers she struggled very hard to obtain the privilege for which she so anxiously longed but in doing so she only met with a sad and sore rebuff  gertrude at last said linda when gertrude thought that the subject had been put to rest at any rate for that night dont you think mamma would be pleased if she knew that you had engaged yourself to harry norman  no said gertrude evincing her strong mind by the tone in which she spoke i do not if mamma wished it she would have told me for she never has any secrets i should be as wrong to engage myself with harry as you would be with alaric for though harry has property of his own while poor alaric has none he has a very insufficient income for a married man and i have no fortune with which to help him if nothing else prevented it i should consider it wicked in me to make myself a burden to a man while he is yet so young and comparatively so poor  prudent sensible highminded welldisciplined gertrude but had her heart really felt a spark of love for the man of whom she spoke how much would prudent sensible highminded considerations have weighed with her alas not a feather  having made her prudent highminded speech she turned round and slept and poor linda also turned round and bedewed her pillow she no longer panted to tell her sister of alarics love  on the next morning the two young men returned to town and the customary dullness of the week began    chapter vi  sir gregory hardlines   great changes had been going on at the weights and measures or rather it might be more proper to say that great changes were now in progress from that moment in which it had been hinted to mr hardlines that he must relax the rigour of his examinations he had pondered deeply over the matter hitherto he had confined his efforts to his own office and so far from feeling personally anxious for the amelioration of the civil service generally had derived no inconsiderable share of his happiness from the knowledge that there were such sinks of iniquity as the internal navigation to be widely different from others was mr hardlines glory he was perhaps something of a civil service pharisee and wore on his forehead a broad phylactery stamped with the mark of crown property he thanked god that he was not as those publicans at somerset house and took glory to himself in paying tithes of official cumin  but now he was driven to a wider range those higher pharisees who were above him in his own pharisaical establishment had interfered with the austerity of his worship he could not turn against them there on their own ground he of all men could not be disobedient to official orders but if he could promote a movement beyond the walls of the weights and measures if he could make pharisees of those benighted publicans in the strand if he could introduce conic sections into the custom house and political economy into the post office if by any effort of his the foreign office clerks could be forced to attend punctually at ten and that wretched saunterer whom five days a week he saw lounging into the council officeif he could be made to mend his pace what a wide field for his ambition would mr hardlines then have found  great ideas opened themselves to his mind as he walked to and from his office daily what if he could become the parent of a totally different order of things what if the civil service through his instrumentality should become the nucleus of the best intellectual diligence in the country instead of being a byword for sloth and ignorance mr hardlines meditated deeply on this and as he did so it became observed on all sides that he was an altered man as regarded his solicitude for the weights and measures one or two lads crept in by no means conspicuous for their attainments in abstract science young men too were observed to leave not much after four oclock without calling down on themselves mr hardlines usual sarcasm some said he was growing old others that he was brokenhearted but mr hardlines was not old nor broken in heart or body he was thinking of higher things than the weights and measures and at last he published a pamphlet  mr hardlines had many enemies all in the civil service one of the warmest of whom was mr oldeschole of the navigation and at first they rejoiced greatly that jobs wish had been accomplished on their behalf and that their enemy had written a book they were down on mr hardlines with reviews counter pamphlets official statements and indignant contradiction but mr hardlines lived through this storm of missiles and got his book to be fêted and made much of by some government pundits who were very bigwigs indeed and at last he was invited over to the building on the other side to discuss the matter with a president a secretary of state a lord commissioner two joint secretaries and three chairmen  and then for a period of six months the light of mr hardlines face ceased to shine on the children of the weights and measures and they felt one and all that the glory had in a certain measure departed from their house now and again mr hardlines would look in but he did so rather as an enemy than as a friend there was always a gleam of antagonistic triumph in his eye which showed that he had not forgotten the day when he was called in question for his zeal he was felt to be in opposition to his own board rather than in cooperation with it the secretary and the assistantsecretaries would say little caustic things about him to the senior clerks and seemed somewhat to begrudge him his new honours but for all this mr hardlines cared little the president and the secretary of state the joint secretaries and the chairmen all allowed themselves to be led by him in this matter his ambition was about to be gratified it was his destiny that he should remodel the civil service what was it to him whether or no one insignificant office would listen to his charming let the secretary at the weights and measures sneer as he would he would make that hero of the metallic currency know that he mr hardlines was his master  at the end of six months his budding glory broke out into splendid fullblown manycoloured flowers he resigned his situation at the weights and measures and was appointed chief commissioner of the board of civil service examination with a salary of £2000 a year he was made a kcb and shone forth to the world as sir gregory hardlines and he received a present of £1000 that happy ne plus ultra of governmental liberality sir gregory hardlines was forced to acknowledge to himself that he was born to a great destiny  when sir gregory as we must now call him was first invited to give his attendance at another office he found it expedient to take with him one of the young men from the weights and measures and he selected alaric tudor now this was surprising to many for tudor had been brought into the office not quite in accordance with sir gregorys views but during his four years of service alaric had contrived to smooth down any acerbity which had existed on this score either the paper on the strikebushel or his own general intelligence or perhaps a certain amount of flattery which he threw into his daily intercourse with the chief clerk had been efficacious and when sir gregory was called upon to select a man to take with him to his new temporary office he selected alaric tudor  the main effect which such selection had upon our story rises from the circumstance that it led to an introduction between tudor and the honourable undecimus scott and that this introduction brought about a close alliance  we will postpone for a short while such description of the character and position of this gentleman as it may be indispensable to give and will in this place merely say that the honourable undecimus scott had been chosen to act as secretary to the temporary commission that was now making inquiry as to the proposed civil service examinations and that in this capacity he was necessarily thrown into communication with tudor he was a man who had known much of officialities had filled many situations was acquainted with nearly all the secretaries assistantsecretaries and private secretaries in london had been in parliament and was still handandglove with all young members who supported government tudor therefore thought it a privilege to know him and allowed himself to become in a certain degree subject to his influence  when it was declared to the world of downing street that sir gregory hardlines was to be a great man to have an office of his own and to reign over assistantcommissioners and subject secretaries there was great commotion at the weights and measures and when his letter of resignation was absolutely there visible to the eyes of clerks properly docketed and duly minuted routine business was for a day nearly suspended gentlemen walked in and out from each others rooms asking this momentous questionwho was to fill the chair which had so long been honoured by the great hardlines who was to be thought worthy to wear that divine mantle  but even this was not the question of the greatest moment which at that period disturbed the peace of the office it was well known that the chief clerk must be chosen from one of the three senior clerks and that he would be so chosen by the voice of the commissioners there were only three men who were deeply interested in this question but who would then be the new senior clerk and how would he be chosen a strange rumour began to be afloat that the new scheme of competitive examination was about to be tried in filling up this vacancy occasioned by the withdrawal of sir gregory hardlines from hour to hour the rumour gained ground and mens minds began to be much disturbed  it was no wonder that mens minds should be disturbed competitive examinations at eighteen twenty and twentytwo may be very well and give an interesting stimulus to young men at college but it is a fearful thing for a married man with a family who has long looked forward to rise to a certain income by the worth of his general conduct and by the value of his seniorityit is a fearful thing for such a one to learn that he has again to go through his school tricks and fill up examination papers with all his juniors round him using their stoutest efforts to take his promised bread from out of his mouth detur digno is a maxim which will make men do their best to merit rewards every man can find courage within his heart to be worthy but detur digniori is a fearful law for such a profession as the civil service what worth can make a man safe against the possible greater worth which will come treading on his heels the spirit of the age raises from year to year to a higher level the standard of education the prodigy of 1857 who is now destroying all the hopes of the man who was well enough in 1855 will be a dunce to the tyro of 1860  there were three or four in the weights and measures who felt all this with the keenest anxiety the fact of their being there and of their having passed the scrutiny of mr hardlines was proof enough that they were men of high attainments but then the question arose to them and others whether they were men exactly of those attainments which were now most required who is to say what shall constitute the merits of the dignior it may one day be conic sections another greek iambics and a third german philosophy rumour began to say that foreign languages were now very desirable the three excellent married gentlemen who stood first in succession for the coveted promotion were great only in their vernacular  within a week from the secession of sir gregory his immediate successor had been chosen and it had been officially declared that the vacant situation in the senior class was to be thrown open as a prize for the best man in the office here was a brilliant chance for young merit the place was worth £600 ayear and might be gained by any one who now received no more than £100 each person desirous of competing was to send in his name to the secretary on or before that day fortnight and on that day month the candidates were to present themselves before sir gregory hardlines and his board of commissioners  and yet the joy of the office was by no means great the senior of those who might become competitors was of course a miserable disgusted man he went about fruitlessly endeavouring to instigate rebellion against sir gregory that very sir gregory whom he had for many years all but worshipped poor jones was to tell the truth in a piteous case he told the secretary flatly that he would not compete with a lot of boys fresh from school and his friends began to think of removing his razors nor were brown and robinson in much better plight they both it is true hated jones ruthlessly and desired nothing better than an opportunity of supplanting him they were moreover fast friends themselves but not the less on that account had brown a mortal fear of robinson as also had robinson a mortal fear of brown  then came the bachelors first there was uppinall who when he entered the office was supposed to know everything which a young man had ever known those who looked most to dead knowledge were inclined to back him as first favourite it had however been remarked that his utility as a clerk had not been equal to the profundity of his acquirements of all the candidates he was the most selfconfident  the next to him was mr a minusex a wondrous arithmetician he was one who could do as many sums without pen and paper as a learned pig who was so given to figures that he knew the number of stairs in every flight he had gone up and down in the metropolis one who whatever the subject before him might be never thought but always counted many who knew the peculiar propensities of sir gregorys earlier days thought that mr minusex was not an unlikely candidate  the sixth in order was our friend norman the secretary and the two assistantsecretaries when they first put their heads together on the matter declared that he was the most useful man in the office  there was a seventh named alphabet precis mr precis peculiar forte was a singular happiness in official phraseology much that he wrote would doubtless have been considered in the purlieus of paternoster row as ungrammatical if not unintelligible but according to the syntax of downing street it was equal to macaulay and superior to gibbon he had frequently said to his intimate friends that in official writing style was everything and of his writing it certainly did form a very prominent part he knew well none perhaps so well when to beg leave to lay before the boardand when simply to submit to the commissioners he understood exactly to whom it behoved the secretary to have the honour of being a very humble servant and to whom the more simple i am sir was a sufficiently civil declaration these are qualifications great in official life but were not quite so much esteemed at the time of which we are speaking as they had been some few years previously  there was but one other named as likely to stand with any probability of success and he was alaric tudor among the very juniors of the office he was regarded as the great star of the office there was a dash about him and a quick readiness for any work that came to hand in which perhaps he was not equalled by any of his compeers then too he was the special friend of sir gregory  but no one had yet heard tudor say that he intended to compete with his seven seniorsnone yet knew whether he would put himself forward as an adversary to his own especial friend norman that norman would be a candidate had been prominently stated for some few days not a word was spoken even between the friends themselves as to tudors intention  on the sunday they were as usual at hampton and then the subject was mooted by no less a person than captain cuttwater  so you young gentlemen up in london are all going to be examined are you said he what is it to be about whos to be first lieutenant of the ship is that it  oh no said alaric nothing half so high as that boatswains mate would be nearer the mark  and who is to be the successful man  oh harry norman here he was far the first favourite in yesterdays betting  and how do you stand yourself said uncle bat  oh im only an outsider said alaric they put my name down just to swell the number but i shall be scratched before the running begins  indeed he wont said harry hell run and distance us all there is no one who has a chance with him why he is sir gregorys own pet  there was nothing more said on the subject at surbiton cottage the ladies seemed instinctively to perceive that it was a matter which they had better leave alone not only were the two young men to be pitted against each other but gertrude and linda were as divided in their wishes on the subject as the two candidates could be themselves  on the following morning however norman introduced the subject i suppose you were only jesting yesterday said he when you told the captain that you were not going to be a candidate  indeed i can hardly say that i was in jest or in earnest said alaric i simply meant to decline to discuss the subject with uncle bat  but of course you do mean to stand said harry alaric made no answer  perhaps you would rather decline to discuss the matter with me also said harry  not at all i would much prefer discussing it openly and honestly my own impression is that i had better leave it alone  and why so said harry  why so repeated alaric well there are so many reasons in the first place there would be seven to one against me and i must confess that if i did stand i should not like to be beaten  the same argument might keep us all back said norman  thats true but one man will be more sensitive more cowardly if you will than another and then i think no one should stand who does not believe himself to have a fair chance his doing so might probably mar his future prospects how can i put myself in competition with such men as uppinall and minuses  harry laughed slightly for he knew it had been asked by many how such men as uppinall and minusex could think of putting themselves in competition with alaric tudor  that is something like mockmodesty is it not alaric  no by heaven it is not i know well what those men are made of and i know or think i know my own abilities i will own that i rank myself as a human creature much higher than i rank them but they have that which i have not and that which they have is that which these examiners will chiefly require  if you have no other reason said norman i would strongly advise you to send in your name  well harry i have another reason and though last it is by no means the least you will be a candidate and probably the successful one to tell you the truth i have no inclination to stand against you  norman turned very red and then answered somewhat gravely i would advise you to lay aside that objection i fairly tell you that i consider your chance better than my own  and suppose it be so which i am sure it is notbut suppose it be so what then  why you will do right to take advantage of it  yes and so gain a step and lose a friend said alaric no there can be no heartburn to me in your being selected for though i am older than you you are my senior in the office but were i to be put over your head it would in the course of nature make a division between us and if it were possible that you should forgive it it would be quite impossible that gertrude should do so i value your friendship and that of the woodwards too highly to risk it  norman instantly fired up with true generous energy i should be wretched said he if i thought that such a consideration weighed with you i would rather withdraw myself than allow such a feeling to interfere with your prospects indeed after what you have said i shall not send in my own name unless you also send in yours  i shall only be creating fuel for a feud said alaric to put you out of the question no promotion could compensate to me for what i should lose at hampton  nonsense man you would lose nothing faith i dont know whether it is not i that should lose if i were successful at your expense  how would gertrude receive me said alaric pushing the matter further than he perhaps should have done  we wont mind gertrude said norman with a little shade of black upon his brow you are an older man than i and therefore promotion is to you of more importance than to me you are also a poorer man i have some means besides that drawn from my office which if i marry i can settle on my wife you have none such i should consider myself to be worse than wicked if i allowed any consideration of such a nature to stand in the way of your best interests believe me alaric that though i shall as others be anxious for success myself i should in failing be much consoled by knowing that you had succeeded and as he finished speaking he grasped his friends hand warmly in token of the truth of his assertion  alaric brushed a tear from his eye and ended by promising to be guided by his friends advice harry norman as he walked into the office felt a glow of triumph as he reflected that he had done his duty by his friend with true disinterested honesty and alaric he also felt a glow of triumph as he reflected that come what might there would be now no necessity for him to break with norman or with the woodwards norman must now always remember that it was at his own instigation that he alaric had consented to be a candidate  as regarded the real fact of the candidature the prize was too great to allow of his throwing away such a chance alarics present income was £200 that which he hoped to gain was £600    chapter vii  mr fidus neverbend  immediately on entering the office tudor gave it to be understood that he intended to give in his name as a candidate but he had hardly done so when his attention was called off from the coming examinations by another circumstance which was ultimately of great importance to him one of the assistantsecretaries sent for him and told him that his services having been required by sir gregory hardlines for a week or so he was at once to go over to that gentlemans office and alaric could perceive that as sir gregorys name was mentioned the assistantsecretary smiled on him with no aspect of benign solicitude  he went over accordingly and found that sir gregory having been desired to select a man for a special service in the country had named him he was to go down to tavistock with another gentleman from the woods and forests for the purpose of settling some disputed point as to the boundaries and privileges of certain mines situated there on crown property  you know nothing about mining i presume said sir gregory  nothing whatever said alaric  i thought not that was one reason why i selected you what is wanted is a man of sharp intelligence and plain common sense and one also who can write english for it will fall to your lot to draw up the report on the matter mr neverbend who is to be your colleague cannot put two words together  mr neverbend said alaric  yes fidus neverbend of the woods and forests a very excellent public servant and one in whom the fullest confidence can be placed but between you and me he will never set the thames on fire  does he understand mining asked alaric  he understands government properties and will take care that the crown be not wronged but tudor the government will look to you to get the true commonsense view of the case i trusti mean that i really do trust that you will not disgrace my choice  alaric of course promised that he would do his best expressed the deepest gratitude to his patron and went off to put himself into communication with mr neverbend at the woods and forests having received an assurance that the examination in his own office should not take place till after his return from tavistock he was not slow to perceive that if he could manage to come back with all the éclat of a successful mission the prestige of such a journey would go far to assist him on his coming trial  mr fidus neverbend was an absolute dragon of honesty his integrity was of such an allpervading nature that he bristled with it as a porcupine does with its quills he had theories and axioms as to a mans conduct and the conduct especially of a man in the queens civil service up to which no man but himself could live consequently no one but himself appeared to himself to be true and just in all his dealings  a quarter of an hour spent over a newspaper was in his eyes a downright robbery if he saw a man so employed he would divide out the total of salary into hourly portions and tell him to a fraction of how much he was defrauding the public if he ate a biscuit in the middle of the day he did so with his eyes firmly fixed on some document and he had never been known to be absent from his office after ten or before four  when sir gregory hardlines declared that mr fidus neverbend would never set the thames on fire he meant to express his opinion that that gentleman was a fool and that those persons who were responsible for sending mr neverbend on the mission now about to be undertaken were little better than fools themselves for so sending him but mr neverbend was no fool he was not a disciple of sir gregorys school he had never sat in that philosophers porch or listened to the high doctrines prevalent at the weights and measures he could not write with all mr precis conventional correctness or dispose of any subject at a moments notice as would mr uppinall but nevertheless he was no fool sir gregory like many other wise men thought that there were no swans but of his own hatching and would ask with all the pompous conceit of pharisees in another age whether good could come out of the woods and forests  sir gregory however perfectly succeeded in his object of imbuing tudor with a very indifferent opinion of his new colleagues abilities it was his object that tudor should altogether take the upper hand in the piece of work which was to be done between them and that it should be clearly proved how very incapable the woods and forests were of doing their own business  mr fidus neverbend however whatever others in the outer world might think of him had a high character in his own office and did not underestimate himself he when he was told that a young clerk named tudor was to accompany him conceived that he might look on his companion rather in the light of a temporary private secretary than an equal partner and imagined that new glory was added to him by his being so treated the two men therefore met each other with very different views  but though mr neverbend was no fool he was not an equal either in tact or ability to alaric tudor alaric had his interview with him and was not slow to perceive the sort of man with whom he had to act of course on this occasion little more than grimaces and civility passed between them but mr neverbend even in his grimaces and civility managed to show that he regarded himself as decidedly no 1 upon the occasion  well mr tudor said he i think of starting on tuesday tuesday will not i suppose be inconvenient to you  sir gregory has already told me that we are expected to be at tavistock on tuesday evening  ah i dont know about that said neverbend that may be all very well for sir gregory but i rather think i shall stay the night at plymouth  it will be the same to me said tudor i havent looked at the papers yet so i can hardly say what may be necessary  no no of course not as to the papers i dont know that there is much with which you need trouble yourself i believe i am pretty well up in the case but mr tudor there will be a good deal of writing to do when we are there  we are both used to that i fancy said tudor so it wont kill us  no of course not i understand that there will be a good many people for me to see a great many conflicting interests for me to reconcile and probably i may find myself obliged to go down two or three of these mines  well that will be good fun said alaric  neverbend drew himself up the idea of having fun at the cost of government was painful to him however he spared the stranger his reproaches and merely remarked that the work he surmised would be heavy enough both for the man who went below ground and for the one who remained above  the only point settled between them was that of their starting by an early train on the tuesday named and then alaric returned to sir gregorys office there to read through and digest an immense bulk of papers all bearing on the question at issue there had it appeared been lately opened between the tamar and the tavy a new mine which had become exceedingly prosperousoutrageously prosperous as shareholders and directors of neighbouring mines taught themselves to believe some question had arisen as to the limits to which the happy possessors of this new tin el dorado were entitled to go squabbles of course had been the result and miners and masters had fought and bled each side in defence of its own rights as a portion of these mines were on crown property it became necessary that the matter should be looked to and as the local inspector was accused of having been bribed and bought and of being in fact an absolute official judas it became necessary to send some one to inspect the inspector hence had come alarics mission the name of the mine in question was wheal mary jane and alaric had read the denomination half a score of times before he learnt that there was no real female in the case  the sunday before he went was of course passed at hampton and there he received the full glory of his special appointment he received glory and norman in an equal degree fell into the background mrs woodward stuck kindly to harry and endeavoured in her gentle way to quiz the projected trip to devonshire but the other party was too strong and her raillery failed to have the intended effect gertrude especially expressed her opinion that it was a great thing for so young a man to have been selected for such employment by such a person and linda though she said less could not prevent her telltale face from saying more katie predicted that alaric would certainly marry mary jane wheal and bring her to surbiton cottage and captain cuttwater offered to the hero introductions to all the old naval officers at devonport  by jingo i should like to go with you said the captain  i fear the pleasure would not repay the trouble said alaric laughing  upon my word i think ill do it said the captain it would be of the greatest possible service to you as an officer of the crown it would give you so much weight there i could make you known you know  i could not hear of such a thing said alaric trembling at the idea which uncle bat had conjured up  there is admiral starbod and captain focassel and old hardaport and sir jib boomwhy dn me they would all do anything for mecraving the ladies pardon  alaric in his own defence was obliged to declare that the rules of the service especially required that he should hold no friendly communication with any one during the time that he was employed on this special service poor captain cuttwater grieved to have his good nature checked was obliged to put up with this excuse and consoled himself with abusing the government which could condescend to give so absurd an order  this was on the saturday on the sunday going to church the captain suggested that alaric might at any rate just call upon sir jib on the sly it would be a great thing for you said uncle bat ill write a note tonight and you can take it with you sir jib is a rising man and youll regret it for ever if you miss the opportunity now sir jib boom was between seventy and eighty and he and captain cuttwater had met each other nearly every day for the last twenty years and had never met without a squabble  after church they had their usual walk and lindas heart palpitated as she thought that she might have to undergo another têteàtête with her lover but it palpitated in vain it so turned out that alaric either avoided or at any rate did not use the privilege and linda returned home with an undefined feeling of gentle disappointment she had fully made up her mind to be very staid very discreet and very collected to take a leaf out of her sisters book and give him no encouragement whatever she would not absolutely swear to him that she did not now and never could return his passion but she would point out how very imprudent any engagement between two young persons situated as they were must behow foolish it would be for them to bind themselves for any number of years to a marriage which must be postponed she would tell alaric all this and make him understand that he was not to regard himself as affianced to her but she with a womans faith would nevertheless remain true to him this was lindas great resolve and the strong hope that in a very few weeks alaric would be promoted to a marrying income of £600 per annum made the prospect of the task not so painful as it might otherwise have been fate however robbed her of the pleasure if it would have been a pleasure of sacrificing her love to her duty and dear linda dearest linda was not again whispered into her ear  and what on earth is it that you are to do down in the mines asked mrs woodward as they sat together in the evening  nothing on the earth mrs woodwardit is to be all below the surface forty fathom deep said alaric  take care that you ever come up again said she  they say the mine is exceedingly richperhaps i may be tempted to stay down there  then youll be like the gloomy gnome that lives in dark cold mines said katie  isnt it very dangerous going down into those places asked linda  men go down and come up again every day of their lives and what other men can do i can i suppose  that doesnt follow at all said captain cuttwater what sort of a figure would you make on a yardarm reefing a sail in a gale of wind  pray do take care of yourself said gertrude  normans brow grew black i thought that it was settled that mr neverbend was to go down and that you were to stay above ground said he  so mr neverbend settled it but that arrangement may perhaps be unsettled again said alaric with a certain feeling of confidence in his own strong will  i dont at all doubt said mrs woodward that if we were to get a sly peep at you we should find you both sitting comfortably at your inn all the time and that neither of you will go a foot below the ground  very likely all i mean to say is that if neverbend goes down ill go too  but mind you gloomy gnome mind you bring up a bit of gold for me said katie  on the monday morning he started with the oftenexpressed good wishes of all the party and with a note for sir jib boom which the captain made him promise that he would deliver and which alaric fully determined to lose long before he got to plymouth  that evening he and norman passed together as soon as their office hours were over they went into the london exhibition which was then open and there walking up and down the long centre aisle they talked with something like mutual confidence of their future prospects this was a favourite resort with norman who had schooled himself to feel an interest in works of art alarics mind was of a different cast he panted rather for the great than the beautiful and was inclined to ridicule the growing taste of the day for torsos palissy ware and assyrian monsters  there was then some mutual confidence between the two young men norman who was apt to examine himself and his own motives more strictly than alaric ever did had felt that something like suspicion as to his friend had crept over him and he had felt also that there was no ground for such suspicion he had determined to throw it off and to be again cordial with his companion he had resolved so to do before his last visit at hampton but it was at hampton that the suspicion had been engendered and there he found himself unable to be genial kindly and contented surbiton cottage was becoming to him anything but the abode of happiness that it had once been a year ago he had been the hero of the hampton sundays he could not but now feel that alaric had as it were supplanted him with his own friends the arrival even of so insignificant a person as captain cuttwaterand captain cuttwater was very insignificant in normans mindhad done much to produce this state of things he had been turned out of his bedroom at the cottage and had therefore lost those last loving lingering words sometimes protracted to so late an hour which had been customary after alarics departure to his innthose last lingering words which had been so sweet because their sweetness had not been shared with his friend  he could not be genial and happy at surbiton cottage but he was by no means satisfied with himself that he should not have been so when he found that he had been surly with alaric he was much more angry with himself than alaric was with him alaric indeed was indifferent about it he had no wish to triumph over harry but he had an object to pursue and he was not the man to allow himself to be diverted from it by any ones caprice  this trip is a great thing for you said harry  well i really dont know of course i could not decline it but on the whole i should be just as well pleased to have been spared if i get through it well why it will be well but even that cannot help me at this examination  i dont know that  whya week passed in the slush of a cornish mine wont teach a man algebra  it will give you prestige  then you mean to say the examiners wont examine fairly well perhaps so but what will be the effect on me if i fail i know nothing of mines i have a colleague with me of whom i can only learn that he is not weak enough to be led or wise enough to lead who is so selfopinionated that he thinks he is to do the whole work himself and yet so jealous that he fears i shall take the very bread out of his mouth what am i to do with such a man  you must manage him said harry  that is much easier said than done replied alaric i wish you had the task instead of me  so do not i sir gregory when he chose you knew what he was about  upon my word harry you are full of compliments today i really ought to take my hat off  no i am not i am in no mood for compliments i know very well what stuff you are made of i know your superiority to myself i know you will be selected to go up over all our heads i feel all this and alaric you must not be surprised that to a certain degree it is painful to me to feel it but by gods help i will get over it and if you succeed it shall go hard with me but i will teach myself to rejoice at it look at that fawn there said he turning away his face to hide the tear in his eye did you ever see more perfect motion  alaric was touched but there was more triumph than sympathy in his heart it was sweet much too sweet to him to hear his superiority thus acknowledged he was superior to the men who worked round him in his office he was made of a more plastic clay than they and despite the inferiority of his education he knew himself to be fit for higher work than they could do as the acknowledgement was made to him by the man whom of those around him he certainly ranked second to himself he could not but feel that his hearts blood ran warm within him he could not but tread with an elastic step  but it behoved him to answer harry and to answer him in other spirit than this  oh harry said he you have some plot to ruin me by my own conceit to make me blow myself out and destroy myself poor frog that i am in trying to loom as largely as that great cow fidus neverbend you know i am fully conscious how much inferior my education has been to yours  education is nothing said harry  education is nothing alaric triumphantly reechoed the words in his hearteducation is nothingmind mind is everything mind and the will so he expressed himself to his own inner self but out loud he spoke much more courteously  it is the innate modesty of your own heart harry that makes you think so highly of me and so meanly of yourself but the proof of what we each can do is yet to be seen years alone can decide that that your career will be honourable and happy of that i feel fully sure i wish i were as confident of mine  but alaric said norman going on rather with the thread of his own thoughts than answering or intending to answer what the other said in following up your high ambitionand i know you have a high ambitiondo not allow yourself to believe that the end justifies the means because you see that men around you act as though they believed so  do i do sodo i seem to do so said alaric turning sharply round  dont be angry with me alaric dont think that i want to preach but sometimes i fancy not that you do so but that your mind is turning that way that in your eager desire for honourable success you wont scrutinize the steps you will have to take  that i would get to the top of the hill in short even though the hillside be miry well i own i wish to get to the top of the hill  but not to defile yourself in doing so  when a man comes home from a successful chase with his bag well stuffed with game the women do not quarrel with him because there is mud on his gaiters  alaric that which is evil is evil lies are evil  and am i a liar  heaven forbid that i should say so heaven forbid that i should have to think so but it is by such doctrines as that that men become liars  what by having muddy gaiters  by disregarding the means in looking to the end  and i will tell you how men become mere vegetables by filling their minds with uselessneedless scruplesby straining at gnats  well finish your quotation said harry  i have finished it in speaking to you i would not for the world go on and seem to insinuate that you would swallow a camel no insinuation could be more base or unjust but nevertheless i think you may be too overscrupulous what great man ever rose to greatness continued alaric after they had walked nearly the length of the building in silence who thought it necessary to pick his steps in the manner you have described  then i would not be great said harry  but surely god intends that there shall be great men on the earth  he certainly wishes that there should be good men said harry  and cannot a man be good and great  that is the problem for a man to solve do you try that good you certainly can be if you look to him for assistance let that come first and then the greatness if that be possible  it is all a quibble about a word said alaric what is good david was a man after gods own heart and a great man too and yet he did things which were i to do i should be too base to live look at jacobhow did he achieve the tremendous rights of patriarchal primogeniture but come the policemen are trying to get rid of us it is time for us to go and so they left the building and passed the remainder of the evening in concord togetherin concord so soon to be dissolved and ah perhaps never to be renewed  on the next morning alaric and his new companion met each other at an early hour at the paddington station neverbend was rather fussy with his dispatchbox and a large official packet which an office messenger dashing up in a cab brought to him at the moment of his departure neverbends enemies were wont to declare that a messenger a cab and a big packet always rushed up at the moment of his starting on any of his official trips then he had his ticket to get and his times to buy and he really had not leisure to do more than nod at alaric till he had folded his rug around him tried that the cushion was soft enough and completed his arrangements for the journey  well mr tudor at last he said as soon as the train was in motion and how are you this morningready for work i hope  well not exactly at this moment said alaric one has to get up so early for these morning trains  early mr tudor my idea is that no hour should be considered either early or late when the crown requires our services  just at present the crown requires nothing else of us i suppose but that we should go along at the rate of forty miles an hour  there is nothing like saving time said neverbend i know you have as yet had no experience in these sort of cases so i have brought you the papers which refer to a somewhat similar matter that occurred in the forest of dean i was sent down there and that is the report which i then wrote i propose to take it for the model of that which we shall have to draw up when we return from tavistock and as he spoke he produced a voluminous document or treatise in which he had contrived to render more obscure some matter that he had been sent to clear up on the crown property in the forest of dean  now alaric had been told of this very report and was aware that he was going to tavistock in order that the joint result of his and mr neverbends labours might be communicated to the crown officers in intelligible language  the monster report before him contained twentysix pages of close folio writing and he felt that he really could not oblige mr neverbend by reading it  forest of dean ah thats coal is it not said alaric mary jane seems to be exclusively in the tin line i fear there will be no analogy  the cases are in many respects similar said neverbend and the method of treating them  then i really cannot concur with you as to the propriety of my reading it i should feel myself absolutely wrong to read a word of such a report for fear i might be prejudiced by your view of the case it would in my mind be positively dishonest in me to encourage any bias in my own feelings either on one side or the other  but really mr tudor  i need not say how much personal advantage it would be to me to have the benefit of your experience but my conscience tells me that i should not do itso i think ill go to sleep  mr neverbend did not know what to make of his companion whether to admire the high tone of his official honesty or to reprobate his idleness in refusing to make himself master of the report while he was settling the question in his own mind tudor went to sleep and did not wake till he was invited to partake of ten minutes refreshment at swindon  i rather think said mr neverbend that i shall go on to tavistock tonight  oh of course said alaric i never for a moment thought of stopping short of it and taking out a book he showed himself disinclined for further conversation  of course its open to me to do as i please in such a matter said neverbend continuing his subject as soon as they reached the bristol station but on the whole i rather think we had better go on to tavistock tonight  no i will not stop at plymouth he said as he passed by taunton and on reaching exeter he declared that he had fully made up his mind on the subject  well get a chaise at plymouth said alaric  i think there will be a public conveyance said neverbend  but a chaise will be the quickest said the one  and much the dearest said the other  that wont signify much to us said alaric we shant pay the bill  it will signify a great deal to me said neverbend with a look of ferocious honesty and so they reached plymouth  on getting out of the railway carriage alaric at once hired a carriage with a pair of horses the luggage was strapped on and mr neverbend before his time for expostulation had fairly come found himself posting down the road to tavistock followed at a respectful distance by two coaches and an omnibus  they were soon drinking tea together at the bedford hotel and i beg to assure any travelling readers that they might have drunk tea in a much worse place mr neverbend though he made a great struggle to protect his dignity and maintain the superiority of his higher rank felt the ground sinking from beneath his feet from hour to hour he could not at all understand how it was but even the servants at the hotel seemed to pay more deference to tudor than to him and before the evening was over he absolutely found himself drinking port wine negus because his colleague had ordered it for him  and now said neverbend who was tired with his long journey i think ill go to bed  do said alaric who was not at all tired and ill go through this infernal mass of papers i have hardly looked at them yet now that i am in the neighbourhood i shall better understand the strange names  so alaric went to work and studied the dry subject that was before him it will luckily not be necessary for us to do so also it will be sufficient for us to know that wheal mary jane was at that moment the richest of all the rich mines that had then been opened in that district that the or its or her shares which is the proper way of speaking of them i am shamefully ignorant were at an enormous premium that these two commissioners would have to see and talk to some scores of loud and angry men deeply interested in their success or failure and that that success or failure might probably in part depend on the view which these two commissioners might take    chapter viii  the hon undecimus scott   the hon undecimus scott was the eleventh son of the lord gaberlunzie lord gaberlunzie was the representative of a very old and very noble race more conspicuous however at the present time for its age and nobility than for its wealth the hon undecimus therefore learnt on arriving at manhood that he was heir only to the common lot of mortality and that he had to earn his own bread this however could not have surprised him much as nine of his brethren had previously found themselves in the same condition  lord gaberlunzie certainly was not one of those wealthy peers who are able to make two or three elder sons and after that to establish any others that may come with comfortable younger childrens portions the family was somewhat accustomed to the res angusta domi but they were fully alive to the fact that a noble brood such as their own ought always to be able to achieve comfort and splendour in the worlds broad field by due use of those privileges which spring from a noble name cauldkail castle in aberdeenshire was the family residence but few of the eleven young scotts were ever to be found there after arriving at that age at which they had been able to fly from the paternal hall  it is a terrible task that of having to provide for eleven sons with two or three a man may hope with some reasonable chance of seeing his hope fulfilled that things will go well with him and that he may descend to his grave without that worst of wretchedness that gnawing grief which comes from bad children but who can hope that eleven sons will all walk in the narrow path  had lord gaberlunzie however been himself a patriarch and ruled the pastoral plains of palestine instead of the bleak mountains which surround cauldkail castle he could not have been more indifferent as to the number of his sons they flew away each as his time came with the early confidence of young birds and as seldom returned to disturb the family nest  they were a cannie comely sensible brood their father and mother if they gave them nothing else gave them strong bodies and sharp brains they were very like each other though always with a difference red hair bright as burnished gold high but not very high cheek bones and small sharp twinkling eyes were the gaberlunzie personal characteristics there were three in the army two in the navy and one at a foreign embassy one was at the diggings another was chairman of a railway company and our own more particular friend undecimus was picking up crumbs about the world in a manner that satisfied the paternal mind that he was quite able to fly alone  there is a privilege common to the sons of all noble lords the full value of which the young scotts learnt very early in lifethat of making any woman with a tocher an honourable lady ye maun be a puir chiel gin yell be worth less than ten thoosand pound in the market o marriage and ten thoosand pound is a gawcey grand heritage such had been the fatherly precept which lord gaberlunzie had striven to instil into each of his noble sons and it had not been thrown away upon them one after the other they had gone forth into the marketplace alluded to and had sold themselves with great ease and admirable discretion there had been but one moses in the lot the hon gordon hamilton scott had certainly brought home a bundle of shagreen spectacle cases in the guise of a widow with an exceedingly doubtful jointure doubtful indeed at first but very soon found to admit of no doubt whatever he was the one who with true scotch enterprise was prosecuting his fortunes at the bendigo diggings while his wife consoled herself at home with her title  undecimus with filial piety had taken his father exactly at his word and swapped himself for £10000 he had however found himself imbued with much too high an ambition to rest content with the income arising from his matrimonial speculation he had first contrived to turn his real £10000 into a fabulous £50000 and had got himself returned to parliament for the tillietudlem district burghs on the credit of his great wealth he then set himself studiously to work to make a second market by placing his vote at the disposal of the government  nor had he failed of success in his attempt though he had hitherto been able to acquire no high or permanent post he had soon been appointed private secretary to the first lord of the stannaries and he found that his duty in this capacity required him to assist the government whip in making and keeping houses this occupation was congenial to his spirit and he worked hard and well at it but the greatest of men are open to the tainting breath of suspicion and the honourable undecimus scott or undy scott as he was generally now called did not escape illnatured persons whispered that he was not on all occasions true to his party and once when his master the whipinchief overborne with too much work had been tempted to put himself to bed comfortably in his own house instead of on his usual uneasy couch behind the speakers chair undy had greatly failed the leader of a party whose struggles for the religion of his country had hitherto met but small success saw at a glance the opportunity which fortune had placed in his way he spied with eagle eye the nakedness of that land of promise which is compressed in the district round the treasury benches the barren field before him was all his own and he put and carried his motion for closing the parks on sundays  he became a hero but undy was all but undone the highest hope of the sabbatarian had been to address an almost empty house for an hour and a half on this his favourite subject but the chance was too good to be lost he sacrificed his oratorical longings on the altar of party purpose and limited his speech to a mere statement of his motion off flew on the wings of hansom a youthful member more trusty than the trusted undy to the abode of the now couchant treasury argus morpheus had claimed him all for his own he was lying in true enjoyment with his tired limbs stretched between the unaccustomed sheets and snoring with free and sonorous nose restrained by the contiguity of no speakers elbow but even in his deepest slumber the quick wheels of the bounding cab struck upon the tympanum of his anxious ear he roused himself as does a noble watchdog when the suspicious tread of theft approaches the hurry of the jaded horse the sudden stop the maddened furious knock all told a tale which his welltrained ear only knew too well he sat up for a moment listening in his bed stretched himself with one involuntary yawn and then stood upright on the floor it should not at any rate be boasted by any one that he had been found in bed  with elastic step three stairs at a time up rushed that young and eager member it was well for the nerves of mrs whip vigil that the calls of society still held her bound in some distant brilliant throng for no consideration would have stopped the patriotic energy of that sucking statesman mr vigil had already performed the most important act of a speedy toilet when his door was opened and as his young friend appeared was already buttoning his first brace  pumpkin is up said the eager juvenile and we have only five men in the house  and where the devil is undy scott said the right hon mr vigil  the devil only knows said the other  i deserve it for trusting him said the consciencestricken but worthy public servant by this time he had on his neckcloth and boots in his eager haste to serve his country he had forgotten his stockings i deserve it for trusting himand how many men have they  fortyone when i left  then theyll divide of course  of course they will said the promising young dove of the treasury  and now mr whip vigil had buttoned on that wellmade frock with which the parliamentary world is so conversant and as he descended the stairs arranged with pocketcomb his now grizzling locks his wellbrushed hat stood ready to his touch below and when he entered the cab he was apparently as well dressed a gentleman as when about three hours after noon he may be seen with slow and easy step entering the halls of the treasury chambers  but ah alas he was all too late he came but to see the ruin which undys defection had brought about he might have taken his rest and had a quiet mind till the next mornings times revealed to him the fact of mr pumpkins grand success when he arrived the numbers were being taken and he even he mr whip vigil he the great archnumberer was excluded from the number of the counted when the doors were again open the commons of england had decided by a majority of fortyone to seven that the parks of london should one and all be closed on sundays and mr pumpkin had achieved among his own set a weeks immortality  we mustnt have this again vigil said a very great man the next morning with a goodhumoured smile on his face however as he uttered the reprimand it will take us a whole night and god knows how much talking to undo what those fools did yesterday  mr vigil resolved to leave nothing again to the unassisted industry or honesty of undy scott and consequently that gentlemans claims on his party did not stand so highly as they might have done but for this accident parliament was soon afterwards dissolved and either through the lukewarm support of his government friends or else in consequence of his great fortune having been found to be ambiguous the independent electors of the tillietudlem burghs took it into their heads to unseat mr scott unseated for tillietudlem he had no means of putting himself forward elsewhere and he had to repent in the sackcloth and ashes of private life the fault which had cost him the friendship of mr vigil  his life however was not strictly private he had used the honourable before his name and the mp which for a time had followed after it to acquire for himself a seat as director at a bank board he was a vicepresident of the caledonian english irish and general european and american fire and life assurance society such at least had been the name of the jointstock company in question when he joined it but he had obtained much credit by adding the word oriental and inserting it after the allusion to europe he had tried hard to include the fourth quarter of the globe but as he explained to some of his friends it would have made the name too cumbrous for the advertisements he was a director also of one or two minor railways dabbled in mining shares and altogether did a good deal of business in the private stockjobbing line  in spite of his former delinquencies his political friends did not altogether throw him over in the first place the time might come when he would be again useful and then he had managed to acquire that air and tact which make one official man agreeable to another he was always goodhumoured when in earnest there was a dash of drollery about him in his most comic moods he ever had some serious purpose in view he thoroughly understood the esoteric and exoteric bearings of modern politics and knew well that though he should be a model of purity before the public it did not behove him to be very straitlaced with his own party he took everything in good part was not overtalkative overpushing or presumptuous he felt no strong bias of his own had at his fingers ends the cant phraseology of ministerial subordinates and knew how to make himself useful he knew alsoa knowledge much more difficult to acquirehow to live among men so as never to make himself disagreeable  but then he could not be trusted true but how many men in his walk of life can be trusted and those who canat how terribly high a price do they rate their own fidelity how often must a minister be forced to confess to himself that he cannot afford to employ good faith undy scott therefore from time to time received some ministerial bone some civil service scrap of victuals thrown to him from the government table which if it did not suffice to maintain him in all the comforts of a treasury career still preserved for him a connexion with the elysium of public life gave him as it were a link by which he could hang on round the outer corners of the states temple and there watch with advantage till the doors of paradise should be reopened to him he was no lucifer who having wilfully rebelled against the high majesty of heaven was doomed to suffer for ever in unavailing but still proud misery the penalties of his asserted independence but a poor peri who had made a lapse and thus forfeited for a while celestial joys and was now seeking for some welcome offering striving to perform some useful service by which he might regain his lost glory  the last of the good things thus tendered to him was not yet all consumed when mr hardlines now sir gregory was summoned to assist at or rather preside over the deliberations of the committee which was to organize a system of examination for the civil service the hon u scott had been appointed secretary to that committee this to be sure afforded but a fleeting moment of halcyon bliss but a man like mr scott knew how to prolong such a moment to its uttermost stretch the committee had ceased to sit and the fruits of their labour were already apparent in the establishment of a new public office presided over by sir gregory but still the clever undy continued to draw his salary  undy was one of those men who though married and the fathers of families are always seen and known en garçon no one had a larger circle of acquaintance than undy scott no one apparently a smaller circle than mrs undy scott so small indeed was it that its locale was utterly unknown in the fashionable world at the time of which we are now speaking undy was the happy possessor of a bedroom in waterloo place and rejoiced in all the comforts of a firstrate club but the sacred spot in which at few and happy intervals he received the caresses of the wife of his bosom and the children of his loins is unknown to the author  in age mr scott at the time of the tavistock mining inquiry was about thirtyfive having sat in parliament for five years he had now been out for four and was anxiously looking for the day when the universal scramble of a general election might give him another chance in person he was as we have said stalwart and comely hirsute with copious red locks not only over his head but under his chin and round his mouth he was well made six feet high neither fat nor thin and he looked like a gentleman he was careful in his dress but not so as to betray the care that he took he was imperturbable in temper though restless in spirit and the one strong passion of his life was the desire of a good income at the cost of the public  he had an easy way of getting intimate with young men when it suited him and as easy a way of dropping them afterwards when that suited him he had no idea of wasting his time or opportunities in friendships not that he was indifferent as to his companions or did not appreciate the pleasure of living with pleasant men but that life was too short and with him the race too much up hill to allow of his indulging in such luxuries he looked on friendship as one of those costly delights with which none but the rich should presume to gratify themselves he could not afford to associate with his fellowmen on any other terms than those of making capital of them it was not for him to walk and talk and eat and drink with a man because he liked him how could the eleventh son of a needy scotch peer who had to maintain his rank and position by the force of his own wit how could such a one live if he did not turn to some profit even the convivialities of existence  acting in accordance with his fixed and conscientious rule in this respect undy scott had struck up an acquaintance with alaric tudor he saw that alaric was no ordinary clerk that sir gregory was likely to have the civil service under his thumb and that alaric was a great favourite with the great man it would but little have availed undy to have striven to be intimate with sir gregory himself the knight commander of the bath would have been deaf to his blandishments but it seemed probable that the ears of alaric might be tickled  and thus alaric and undy scott had become fast friends that is as fast as such friends generally are alaric was no more blind to his own interest than was his new ally but there was this difference between them undy lived altogether in the utilitarian world which he had formed around himself whereas alaric lived in two worlds when with undy his pursuits and motives were much such as those of undy himself but at surbiton cottage and with harry norman he was still susceptible of a higher feeling he had been very cool to poor linda on his last visit to hampton but it was not that his heart was too hard for love he had begun to discern that gertrude would never attach herself to norman and if gertrude were free why should she not be his  poor linda  scott had early heardand of what official event did he not obtain early intelligencethat neverbend was to go down to tavistock about the mary jane tin mine and that a smart colleague was required for him he would fain for reasons of his own have been that smart colleague himself but that he knew was impossible he and neverbend were the alpha and omega of official virtues and vices but he took an opportunity of mentioning before sir gregory in a passing unpremeditated way how excellently adapted tudor was for the work it so turned out that his effort was successful and that tudor was sent  the whole of their first day at tavistock was passed by neverbend and alaric in hearing interminable statements from the various mining combatants and when at seven oclock alaric shut up for the evening he was heartily sick of the job the next morning before breakfast he sauntered out to air himself in front of the hotel and who should come whistling up the street with a cigar in his mouth but his new friend undy scott    chapter ix  mr manylodes   alaric tudor was very much surprised had he seen sir gregory himself or captain cuttwater walking up the street of tavistock he could not have been more startled it first occurred to him that scott must have been sent down as a third commissioner to assist at the investigation and he would have been right glad to have known that this was the case for he found that the management of mr neverbend was no pastime but he soon learnt that such relief was not at hand for him  well tudor my boy said he and how do you like the clotted cream and the thick ankles of the stout devonshire lasses  i have neither tasted the one nor seen the other said alaric as yet i have encountered nothing but the not very civil tongues and not very clear brains of cornish roughs  a boeotian crew but nevertheless they know on which side their bread is butteredand in general it goes hard with them but they butter it on both sides and how does the faithful neverbend conduct himself talk of boeotians if any man ever was born in a foggy air it must have been my friend fidus  alaric merely shrugged his shoulders and laughed slightly but what on earth brings you down to tavistock said he  oh i am a denizen of the place naturalized and all but settled have vast interests here and a future constituency let the russells look well to themselves the time is quickly coming when you will address me in the house with bitter sarcasm as the honourable but inconsistent member for tavistock egad who knows but you may have to say right honourable  oh i did not know the wind blew in that quarter said alaric not illpleased at the suggestion that he also on some future day might have a seat among the faithful commons  the wind blows from all quarters with me said undy but in the meantime i am looking out for shares  will you come in and breakfast asked the other  what with friend fidus no thankee i am not by many degrees honest enough to suit his book he would be down on some little public peccadillo of mine before i had swallowed my first egg besides i would not for worlds break the pleasure of your têteàtête  will you come down after dinner  no neither after dinner nor before breakfast not all the coffee nor all the claret of the bedford shall tempt me remember my friend you are paid for it i am not  well then good morning said alaric i must go in and face my fate like a briton  undy went on for a few steps and then returned as though a sudden thought had struck him but tudor i have bowels of compassion within me though no pluck i am willing to rescue you from your misery though i will not partake it come up to me this evening and i will give you a glass of brandypunch your true miners never drink less generous tipple  how on earth am i to shake off this incubus of the woods and works  shake him off why make him drunk and put him to bed or tell him at once that the natural iniquity of your disposition makes it necessary that you should spend a few hours of the day in the company of a sinner like myself tell him that his virtue is too heavy for the digestive organs of your unpractised stomach tell him what you will but come i myself am getting sick of those mining vandals though i am so used to dealing with them  alaric promised that he would come and then went in to breakfast undy also returned to his breakfast well pleased with this first success in the little scheme which at present occupied his mind the innocent young commissioner little dreamt that the honourable mr scott had come all the way to tavistock on purpose to ask him to drink brandypunch at the blue dragon  another day went wearily and slowly on with alaric and mr neverbend tedious neverending statements had to be taken down in writing the same things were repeated over and over again and were as often contradicted men who might have said in five words all that they had to say would not be constrained to say it in less than five thousand and each one seemed to think or pretended to seem to think that all the outer world and the government were leagued together to defraud the interest to which he himself was specially attached but this was not the worst of it there were points which were as clear as daylight but tudor could not declare them to be so as by doing so he was sure to elicit a different opinion from mr neverbend  i am not quite so clear on that point mr tudor he would say  alaric till experience made him wise would attempt to argue it  that is all very well but i am not quite so sure of it we will reserve the point if you please and so affairs went on darkly no ray of light being permitted to shine in on the matter in dispute  it was settled however before dinner that they should both go down the wheal mary jane on the following day neverbend had done what he could to keep this crowning honour of the inquiry altogether in his own hands but he had found that in this respect tudor was much too much for him  immediately after dinner alaric announced that he was going to spend the evening with a friend  a friend said neverbend somewhat startled i did not know that you had any friends in tavistock  not a great many but it so happened that i did meet a man i know this morning and promised to go to him in the evening i hope youll excuse my leaving you  oh i dont mind for myself said neverbend though when men are together its as well for them to keep together but mr tudor  well said alaric who felt growing within him a determination to put down at once anything like interference with his private hours  perhaps i ought not to mention it said neverbend but i do hope youll not get among mining people only think what our position here is  what on earth do you mean said alaric do you think i shall be bribed over by either side because i choose to drink a glass of wine with a friend at another hotel  bribed no i dont think youll be bribed but i think we should both keep ourselves absolutely free from all chance of being talked to on the subject except before each other and before witnesses i would not drink brandyandwater at the blue dragon before this report be written even if my brother were there  well mr neverbend i am not so much afraid of myself but wherever there are two men there will be two opinions so good night if it so chance that you are in bed before my return  so tudor went out and neverbend prepared himself to sit up for him he would sooner have remained up all night than have gone to bed before his colleague came back  three days alaric tudor had now passed with mr neverbend and not only three days but three evenings also a man may endure to be bored in the course of business through the day but it becomes dreadful when the infliction is extended to postprandial hours it does not often occur that one is doomed to bear the same bore both by day and night any change gives some ease but poor alaric for three days had had no change he felt like a liberated convict as he stepped freely forth into the sweet evening air and made his way through the town to the opposition inn  here he found undy on the doorsteps with a cigar in his mouth here i am waiting for you said he you are fagged to death i know and well get a mouthful of fresh air before we go upstairsand so saying he put his arm through alarics and they strolled off through the suburbs of the town  you dont smoke said undy with his cigarcase in his hand welli believe you are rightcigars cost a great deal of money and cant well do a man any real good god almighty could never have intended us to make chimneys of our mouths and noses does fidus ever indulge in a weed  he never indulges in anything said alaric  except honesty said the other and in that he is a beastly glutton he gorges himself with it till all his faculties are overpowered and his mind becomes torpid its twice worse than drinking i wonder whether hell do a bit of speculation before he goes back to town  who neverbendhe never speculates  why not ah my fine fellow you dont know the world yet those sort of men dull drones like neverbend are just the fellows who go the deepest ill be bound he will not return without a few mary janes in his pocketbook hell be a fool if he does i know  why thats the very mine we are down here about  and thats the very reason why hell purchase mary janes he has an opportunity of knowing their value oh let neverbend alone he is not so young as you are my dear fellow  young or old i think you mistake his character  why tudor what would you think now if he not only bought for himself but was commissioned to buy by the very men who sent him down here  it would be hard to make me believe it  ah faith is a beautiful thing what a pity that it never survives the thirtieth yearexcept with women and fools  and have you no faith scott  yesmuch in myselfsome little in lord palmerston that is in his luck and a good deal in a banknote but i have none at all in fidus neverbend what have faith in a man merely because he tells me to have it his method of obtaining it is far too easy  i trust neither his wit nor his judgement but i dont believe him to be a thief  thief i said nothing of thieves he may for aught i know be just as good as the rest of the world all i say is that i believe him to be no better but come we must go back to the inn there is an ally of mine coming to me a perfect specimen of a sharp cornish mining stockjobberas vulgar a fellow as you ever met and as shrewd he wont stay very long so you need not be afraid of him  alaric began to feel uneasy and to think that there might by possibility be something in what neverbend had said to him he did not like the idea of meeting a cornish stockjobber in a familiar way over his brandypunch while engaged as he now was on the part of government he felt that there might be impropriety in it and he would have been glad to get off if he could but he felt ashamed to break his engagement and thus followed undy into the hotel  has mr manylodes been here said scott as he walked upstairs  hes in the bar now sir said the waiter  beg him to come up then in the bar why that man must have a bar within himselfthe alcohol he consumes every day would be a tidy sale for a small publichouse  up they went and mr manylodes was not long in following them he was a small man more like an american in appearance than an englishman he had on a common black hat a black coat black waistcoat and black trousers thick boots a coloured shirt and very dirty hands though every article he wore was good and most of them such as gentlemen wear no man alive could have mistaken him for a gentleman no man conversant with the species to which he belonged could have taken him for anything but what he was as he entered the room a faint sickly secondhand smell of alcohol pervaded the atmosphere  well manylodes said scott im glad to see you again this is my friend mr tudor  your servant sir said manylodes just touching his hat without moving it from his head and how are you mr scott i am glad to see you again in these parts sir  and hows trade come tudor what will you drink manylodes i know takes brandy their sherry is vile and their claret worse maybe they may have a fairish glass of port and how is trade manylodes  were all as brisk as bees at present i never knew things sharper if youve brought a little money with you nows your time but i tell you this youll find it sharp work for the eyesight  quicks the word i suppose  lord love you quick why a fellow must shave himself before he goes to bed if he wants to be up in time these days  i suppose so  lord love you why there was old sam weazle never caught napping yetwhy at truro last monday he bought up to 450 new friendships and before he was abed they werent worth not this bottle of brandy well old sam was just bit by those cambourne lads  and how did that happen  why the new friendships certainly was very good while they lasted just for three months they was the thing certainly why it came up sir as if there werent no end of it and just as clean as that halfcrownbut i knowd there was an end coming  water i suppose said undy sipping his toddy  them clean takes mr scott they never lasts there was water but that werent the worst old weazle knew of that he calculated hed back the metal agin the water and so he bought all up he could lay his finger on but the stuff was run out them cambourne boyswhat did they do why they let the water in on purpose by monday night old weazle knew it all and then you may say it was as good as a play  and how did you do in the matter  oh i sold i did very wellbought at £7 2s 3d and sold at £6 19s 10 12d and got my seven per cent for the four months but lord love you them clean takes never lasts i wornt going to hang on heres your health mr scott yours mr i didnt just catch the genlemans name and without waiting for further information on the point he finished his brandyandwater  so its all up with the new friendships is it said undy  up and down mr scott every dog has his day these mary janes will be going the same way some of them days were all mortal and with this moral comparison between the uncertainty of human life and the vicissitudes of the shares in which he trafficked mr manylodes proceeded to put some more sugar and brandy into his tumbler  true truewe are all mortalmanylodes and mary janes old friendships and new friendships while they last we must make the most we can of them buy them cheap and sell them dear and above all things get a good percentage  thats the game mr scott and i will say no man understands it better than yourselfkeep the ball arunningthats your maxim are you going it deep in mary jane mr scott  who i o noshes a cut above me now i fear the shares are worth any money now i suppose  worth any money i think they are mr scott but i believe and then bringing his chair close up to that of his aristocratic friend resting his hands one on mr scotts knee and the other on his elbow and breathing brandy into his ear he whispered to him words of great significance  ill leave you scott said alaric who did not enjoy the society of mr manylodes and to whom the nature of the conversation was in his present position extremely irksome i must be back at the bedford early  earlywhy early surely our honest friend can get himself to bed without your interference come you dont like the brandy toddy nor i either well see what sort of a hand they are at making a bowl of bishop  not for me scott  yes for you man surely you are not tied to that fellows apronstrings he said removing himself from the close contiguity of mr manylodes and speaking under his voice take my advice if you once let that man think you fear him youll never get the better of him  alaric allowed himself to be persuaded and stayed  i have just ten words of business to say to this fellow continued scott and then we will be alone  it was a lovely autumn evening early in september and alaric sat himself at an open window looking out from the back of the hotel on to the brentor with its singular parish church built on its highest apex while undy held deep council with his friend of the mines but from time to time some word of moment found its way to alarics ears and made him also unconsciously fix his mind on the irritamenta malorum which are dug from the bowels of the earth in those western regions  minting money sir its just minting money theres been no chance like it in my days £4 12s 6d paid up and theyll be at £25 in truro before sun sets on saturday lord love you mr scott nows your time if as i hear they and then there was a very low whisper and alaric who could not keep his eye altogether from mr manylodes countenance saw plainly that that worthy gentleman was talking of himself and in spite of his better instincts a desire came over him to know more of what they were discussing and he could not keep from thinking that shares bought at £4 12s 6d and realizing £25 must be very nice property  well ill manage it said scott still in a sort of whisper but audibly enough for alaric to hear forty you say ill take them at £5 1s 1dvery well and he took out his pocketbook and made a memorandum come tudor heres the bishop we have done our business so now well enjoy ourselves what manylodes are you off  lord love you mr scott ive a deal to do before i get to my downy and i dont like those doctored tipples good night mr scott i wishes you good night sir and making another slight reference to his hat which had not been removed from his head during the whole interview mr manylodes took himself off  there now is a specimen of a species of the genus homo class englishman which is i believe known nowhere but in cornwall  cornwall and devonshire i suppose said alaric  no he is out of his true element here if you want to see him in all the glory of his native county you should go west of truro from truro to hayle is the land of the manylodes and a singular species it is but tudor youll be surprised i suppose if i tell you that i have made a purchase for you  a purchase for me  yes i could not very well consult you before that fellow and yet as the chance came in my way i did not like to lose it come the bishop aint so bad is it though it is doctored tipple and he refilled alarics glass  but what have you purchased for me scott  forty shares in the mary jane  then you may undo the bargain again for i dont want them and shall not take them  you need not be a bit uneasy my dear fellow ive bought them at a little over £5 and theyll be saleable tomorrow at double the moneyor at any rate tomorrow week but whats your objection to them  in the first place ive got no money to buy shares  thats just the reason why you should buy them having no money you cant but want some and heres your way to make it you can have no difficulty in raising £200  and in the next place i should not think of buying mining shares and more especially these while i am engaged as i now am  fal de ral de ral de ral thats all very fine mr commissioner only you mistake your man you think you are talking to mr neverbend  well scott i shant have them  just as you please my dear fellow theres no compulsion only mark this the ball is at your foot now but it wont remain there there is a tide in the affairs of menyou know the rest and you know also that tide and time wait for no man if you are contented with your two or three hundred a year in the weights and measures god forbid that i should tempt you to higher thoughtsonly in that case i have mistaken my man  i must be contented with it if i can get nothing better said tudor weakly  exactly you must be contentedor rather you must put up with itif you can get nothing better thats the meaning of contentment all the world over you argue in a circle you must be a mere clerk if you cannot do better than other mere clerks but the fact of your having such an offer as that i now make you is proof that you can do better than others proves in fact that you need not be a mere clerk unless you choose to remain so  buying these shares might lose me all that i have got and could not do more than put a hundred pounds or so in my pocket  gammon  could i go back and tell sir gregory openly that i had bought them  why tudor you are the youngest fish i ever met sent out to swim alone in this wicked world of ours who the deuce talks openly of his speculations will sir gregory tell you what shares he buys is not every member of the house every man in the government every barrister parson and doctor that can collect a hundred pounds are not all of them at the work and do they talk openly of the matter does the bishop put it into his charge or the parson into his sermon  but they would not be ashamed to tell their friends  would not they oh the rev mr pickabit of st judas without would not be ashamed to tell his bishop but the long and the short of the thing is this most men circumstanced as you are have no chance of doing anything good till they are forty or fifty and then their energies are worn out you have had tact enough to push yourself up early and yet it seems you have not pluck enough to take the goods the gods provide you  the godsyou mean the devils rather said alaric who sat listening and drinking almost unconsciously his doctored tipple  call them what you will for me fortune has generally been esteemed a goddess but misfortune a very devil but tudor you dont know the world here is a chance in your way of course that keg of brandy who went out just now understands very well who you are he wants to be civil to me and he thinks it wise to be civil to you also he has a hat full of these shares and he tells me that knowing my weakness and presuming that you have the same he bought a few extra this morning thinking we might like them now i have no hesitation in saying there is not a single man whom the government could send down here from sir gregory downwards who could refuse the chance  i am quite sure that neverbend  oh for heavens sake dont choke me with neverbend the fools are fools and will be so they are used for their folly i speak of men with brains how do you think that such men as hardlines vigil and mr estimate have got up in the world would they be where they are now had they been contented with their salaries  they had private fortunes  very private they must have beeni never heard of them no what fortunes they have they made two of them are in parliament and the other has a government situation of £2000 a year with little or nothing to do but they began life early and never lost a chance  it is quite clear that that blackguard who was here just now thinks that he can influence my opinion by inducing me to have an interest in the matter  he had no such ideanor have i do you think i would persuade you to such villany do you think i do not know you too well of course the possession of these shares can have no possible effect on your report and is not expected to have any but when men like you and me become of any note in the world others such as manylodes like to know that we are embarked in the same speculation with themselves why are members of parliament asked to be directors and vicegovernors and presidents and guardians of all the jointstock societies that are now set agoing not because of their capital for they generally have none not for their votes because one vote can be but of little use in any emergency it is because the names of men of note are worth money men of note understand this and enjoy the fat of the land accordingly i want to see you among the number  twas thus the devil pleaded for the soul of alaric tudor and alas he did not plead in vain let him but have a fair hearing and he seldom does tis in this way that the truth of that awful mystery the fall of man comes home to us that we cannot hear the devil plead and resist the charm of his eloquence to listen is to be lost lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil let that petition come forth from a mans heart a true and earnest prayer and he will be so led that he shall not hear the charmer let him charm ever so wisely  twas but a thin veil that the hon undecimus scott threw over the bait with which he fished for the honesty of alaric tudor and yet it sufficed one would say that a young man fortified with such aspirations as those which glowed in alarics breast should have stood a longer siege should have been able to look with clearer eyesight on the landmarks which divide honour from dishonour integrity from fraud and truth from falsehood but he had never prayed to be delivered from evil his desire had rather been that he might be led into temptation  he had never so prayedyet had he daily said his prayers at fitting intervals on every returning sunday had he gone through with all the fitting forms the ordinary worship of a christian nor had he done this as a hypocrite with due attention and a full belief he had weekly knelt at gods temple and given if not his mind at least his heart to the service of his church but the inner truth of the prayer which he repeated so often had not come home to him alas how many of us from week to week call ourselves worms and dust and miserable sinners describe ourselves as chaff for the winds grass for the burning stubble for the plough as dirt and filth fit only to be trodden under foot and yet in all our doings before the world cannot bring home to ourselves the conviction that we require other guidance than our own  alaric tudor had sighed for permission to go forth among worldlings and there fight the worlds battle power station rank wealth all the good things which men earn by tact diligence and fortune combined and which were so far from him at his outset in life became daily more dear to his heart and now his honourable friend twitted him with being a mere clerk no he was not never had been never would be such had he not already in five or six short years distanced his competitors and made himself the favourite and friend of men infinitely above him in station was he not now here in tavistock on a mission which proved that he was no mere clerk was not the fact of his drinking bishop in the familiar society of a lords son and an exmp a proof of it  it would be calumny on him to say that he had allowed scott to make him tipsy on this occasion he was far from being tipsy but yet the mixture which he had been drinking had told upon his brain  but undy said hehe had never before called his honourable friend by his christian namebut undy if i take these shares where am i to get the money to pay for them  the chances are you may part with them before you leave tavistock if so you will not have to pay for them you will only have to pocket the difference  or pay the loss  or pay the loss but theres no chance of that ill guarantee you against that  but i shant like to sell them i shant choose to be trafficking in shares buying a few as an investment may perhaps be a different thing  oh alaric alaric to what a pass had your conscience come when it could be so silenced  well i suppose you can raise a couple of hundred£205 will cover the whole thing commission and all but mind i dont advise you to keep them longi shall take two months dividends and then sell  two hundred and five pounds said tudor to whom the sum seemed anything but trifling and when must it be paid  well i can give manylodes a cheque for the whole dated this day week youll be back in town before that we must allow him £5 for the accommodation i suppose you can pay the money in at my bankers by that day  alaric had some portion of the amount himself and he knew that norman had money by him he felt also a halfdrunken conviction that if norman failed him captain cuttwater would not let him want such a sum and so he said that he could and the bargain was completed  as he went downstairs whistling with an affected ease and a gaiety which he by no means felt undy scott leant back in his chair and began to speculate whether his new purchase was worth the purchasemoney hes a sharp fellow certainly in some things and may do well yet but hes uncommonly green that however will wear off i should not be surprised if he told neverbend the whole transaction before this time tomorrow and then mr scott finished his cigar and went to bed  when alaric entered the sittingroom at the bedford he found neverbend still seated at a table covered with official books and huge bundles of official papers an enormous report was open before him from which he was culling the latent sweets and extracting them with a pencil he glowered at alaric with a severe suspicious eye which seemed to accuse him at once of the deed which he had done  you are very late said neverbend but i have not been sorry to be alone i believe i have been able to embody in a rough draft the various points which we have hitherto discussed i have just been five hours and a half at it and fidus looked at his watch five hours and forty minutes tomorrow perhaps that is if you are not going to your friend again youll not object to make a fair copy  copy shouted alaric in whose brain the open air had not diminished the effect of the bishop and who remembered with all the energy of pot valour that he was not a mere clerk copybother im going to bed old fellow and i advise you to do the same  and then taking up a candlestick and stumbling somewhat awkwardly against a chair tudor went off to his room waiting no further reply from his colleague  mr neverbend slowly put up his papers and followed him he is decidedly the worse for drinkdecidedly so said he to himself as he pulled off his clothes what a disgrace to the woods and workswhat a disgrace  and he resolved in his mind that he would be very early at the pits mouth he would not be kept from his duty while a dissipated colleague collected his senses by the aid of sodawater    chapter x  wheal mary jane   mr manylodes was at any rate right in this that that beverage which men call bishop is a doctored tipple and alaric tudor when he woke in the morning owned the truth it had been arranged that certain denizens of the mine should meet the two commissioners at the pitmouth at eight oclock and it had been settled at dinnertime that breakfast should be on the table at seven sharp half an hours quick driving would take them to the spot  at seven mr fidus neverbend who had never yet been known to be untrue to an appointment by the fraction of a second was standing over the breakfasttable alone he was alone but not on that account unhappy he could hardly disguise the pleasure with which he asked the waiter whether mr tudor was yet dressed or the triumph which he felt when he heard that his colleague was not quite ready  bring the tea and the eggs at once said neverbend very briskly  wont you wait for mr tudor asked the waiter with an air of surprise now the landlord waiter boots and chambermaid the chambermaid especially had all in mr neverbends estimation paid tudor by far too much consideration and he was determined to show that he himself was first fiddle  wait no quite out of the questionbring the hot water immediatelyand tell the ostler to have the fly at the door at halfpast seven exact  yes sir said the man and disappeared  neverbend waited five minutes and then rang the bell impetuously if you dont bring me my tea immediately i shall send for mr boteldale now mr boteldale was the landlord  mr tudor will be down in ten minutes was the waiters false reply for up to that moment poor alaric had not yet succeeded in lifting his throbbing head from his pillow the boots was now with him administering sodawater and brandy and he was pondering in his sickened mind whether by a manful effort he could rise and dress himself or whether he would not throw himself backwards on his coveted bed and allow neverbend the triumph of descending alone to the nether world  neverbend nearly threw the loaf at the waiters head wait ten minutes longer what right had that vile devonshire napkintwirler to make to him so base a proposition bring me my breakfast sir shouted neverbend in a voice that made the unfortunate sinner jump out of the room as though he had been moved by a galvanic battery  in five minutes tea made with lukewarm water and eggs that were not half boiled were brought to the impatient commissioner as a rule mr neverbend when travelling on the public service made a practice of enjoying his meals it was the only solace which he allowed himself the only distraction from the cares of office which he permitted either to his body or his mind but on this great occasion his country required that he should forget his comforts and he drank his tasteless tea and ate his uncooked eggs threatening the waiter as he did so with sundry pains and penalties in the form of sixpences withheld  is the fly there said he as he bolted a last morsel of cold roast beef  coming sir said the waiter as he disappeared round a corner  in the meantime alaric sat lackadaisical on his bedside all undressed leaning his head upon his hand and feeling that his struggle to dress himself was all but useless the sympathetic boots stood by with a cup of teawelldrawn comfortable teain his hand and a small bit of dry toast lay near on an adjacent plate  try a bit o toast sir said boots  ugh ejaculated poor alaric  have a leetle drop o rum in the tea sir and itll set you all to rights in two minutes  the proposal made alaric very sick and nearly completed the catastrophe ugh he said  theres the trap sir for mr neverbend said the boots whose ears caught the wellknown sound  the devil it is said alaric who was now stirred up to instant action take my compliments to mr neverbend and tell him ill thank him to wait ten minutes  boots descending with the message found mr neverbend ready coated and gloved standing at the hotel door the fly was there and the lame ostler holding the horse but the provoking driver had gone back for his coat  please sir mr tudor says as how youre not to go just at present but to wait ten minutes till he be ready  neverbend looked at the man but he would not trust himself to speak wait ten minutes and it now wanted fiveandtwenty minutes to eightnonot for all the tudors that ever sat upon the throne of england  there he stood with his watch in his hand as the returning jehu hurried round from the stable yard you are now seven minutes late said he and if you are not at the place by eight oclock i shall not give you one farthing  all right said jehu well be at mary jane in less than no time and off they went not at the quickest pace but neverbends heart beat high with triumph as he reflected that he had carried the point on which he had been so intent  alaric when he heard the wheels roll off shook from him his lethargy it was not only that neverbend would boast that he alone had gone through the perils of their subterranean duty but that doubtless he would explain in london how his colleague had been deterred from following him it was a grievous task that of dressing himself as youthful sinners know but too well every now and then a qualm would come over him and make the work seem all but impossible boots however stuck to him like a man poured cold water over his head renewed his teacup comforted him with assurances of the bracing air and put a paper full of sandwiches in his pocket  for heavens sake put them away said alaric to whom the very idea of food was repulsive  youll want em sir afore you are half way to mary jane and it ant no joke going down and up again i know whats what sir  the boots stuck to him like a man he did not only get him sandwiches but he procured for him also mr boteldales own fasttrotting pony and just as neverbend was rolling up to the pits mouth fifteen minutes after his time greatly resolving in his own mind to button his breeches pocket firmly against the recreant driver alaric started on the chase after him  mr neverbend had a presentiment that sick as his friend might be nauseous as doubtless were the qualms arising from yesterdays intemperance he would make an attempt to recover his lost ground he of the woods and works had begun to recognize the energy of him of the weights and measures and felt that there was in it a force that would not easily be overcome even by the fumes of bishop but yet it would be a great thing for the woods and works if he neverbend could descend in this perilous journey to the deep bowels of the earth leaving the weights and measures stranded in the upper air this descent among the hidden riches of a lower world this visit to the provocations of evils not yet dug out from their durable confinement was the keystone as it were of the whole mission let neverbend descend alone alone inspect the wonders of that dirty deep and tudor might then talk and write as he pleased in such case all the world of the two public offices in question and of some others cognate to them would adjudge that he neverbend had made himself master of the situation  actuated by these correct calculations mr neverbend was rather fussy to begin an immediate descent when he found himself on the spot two native gentlemen who were to accompany the commissioners or the commissioner as appeared likely to be the case were already there as were also the men who were to attend upon them  it was an ugly uninviting place to look at with but few visible signs of wealth the earth which had been burrowed out by these human rabbits in their search after tin lay around in huge ungainly heaps the overground buildings of the establishment consisted of a few illarranged sheds already apparently in a state of decadence dirt and slush and pods of water confined by muddy dams abounded on every side muddy men with muddy carts and muddy horses slowly crawled hither and thither apparently with no object and evidently indifferent as to whom they might overset in their course the inferior men seemed to show no respect to those above them and the superiors to exercise no authority over those below them there was a sullen equality among them all on the ground around was no vegetation nothing green met the eye some few stunted bushes appeared here and there nearly smothered by heapedup mud but they had about them none of the attractiveness of foliage the whole scene though consisting of earth alone was unearthly and looked as though the devil had walked over the place with hot hoofs and then raked it with a huge rake  i am afraid i am very late said neverbend getting out of his fly in all the haste he could muster and looking at his watch the moment his foot touched the ground very late indeed gentlemen i really must apologize but it was the driver i was punctual to the minute i was indeed but come gentlemen we wont lose another moment and mr neverbend stepped out as though he were ready at an instants notice to plunge head foremost down the deepest shaft in all that region of mines  oh sir there ant no cause of hurry whatsomever said one of the mining authorities the day is long enough  oh but there is cause of hurry mr undershot said neverbend angrily great cause of hurry we must do this work very thoroughly and i positively have not time to get through all that i have before me  butant the other genleman acoming asked mr undershot  surely mr tooder isnt a going to cry off said the other why he was so hot about it yesterday  mr tudor is not very well this morning said mr neverbend as his going down is not necessary for the inquiry and is merely a matter of taste on his part he has not joined me this morning come gentlemen are we ready  it was then for the first time explained to mr neverbend that he had to go through a rather complicated adjustment of his toilet before he would be considered fit to meet the infernal gods he must he was informed envelop himself from head to foot in miners habiliments if he wished to save every stitch he had on him from dirt and destruction he must also cover up his head with a linen cap so constituted as to carry a lump of mud with a candle stuck in it if he wished to save either his head from filth or his feet from falling now mr neverbend like most clerks in public offices was somewhat particular about his wardrobe it behoved him as a gentleman frequenting the west end to dress well and it also behoved him to dress cheaply he was moreover careful both as to his head and feet he could not therefore reject the recommended precautions but yet the timethe time thus lost might destroy all  he hurried into the shed where his toilet was to be made and suffered himself to be prepared in the usual way he took off his own great coat and put on a muddy course linen jacket that covered the upper portion of his body completely he then dragged on a pair of equally muddy overalls and lastly submitted to a most uninviting cap which came down over his ears and nearly over his eyes and on the brow of which a lump of mud was then affixed bearing a short tallow candle  but though dressed thus in miners garb mr neverbend could not be said to look the part he filled he was a stout reddishfaced gentleman with round shoulders and huge whiskers he was nearly bald and wore spectacles and in the costume in which he now appeared he did not seem to be at his ease indeed all his air of command all his personal dignity and dictatorial tone left him as soon as he found himself metamorphosed into a fat pseudominer he was like a cock whose feathers had been trailed through the mud and who could no longer crow aloud or claim the dunghill as his own his appearance was somewhat that of a dirty dissipated cook who having been turned out of one of the clubs for drunkenness had been wandering about the streets all night he began to wish that he was once more in the wellknown neighbourhood of charing cross  the adventure however must now be carried through there was still enough of manhood in his heart to make him feel that he could not return to his colleague at tavistock without visiting the wonders which he had come so far to see when he reached the head of the shaft however the affair did appear to him to be more terrible than he had before conceived he was invited to get into a rough square bucket in which there was just room for himself and another to stand he was specially cautioned to keep his head straight and his hands and elbows from protruding and then the windlass began to turn and the upper world the sunlight and all humanity receded from his view  the world receded from his view but hardly soon enough for as the windlass turned and the bucket descended his last terrestrial glance looking out among the heaps of mud descried alaric tudor galloping on mr boteldales pony up to the very mouth of the mine  facilis descensus averni the bucket went down easy enough and all too quick the manner in which it grounded itself on the first landing grated discordantly on mr neverbends finer perceptibilities but when he learnt after the interchange of various hoarse and to him unintelligible bellowings that he was to wait in that narrow damp lobby for the coming of his fellowcommissioner the grating on his feelings was even more discordant he had not pluck enough left to grumble but he grunted his displeasure he grunted however in vain for in about a quarter of an hour alaric was close to him shoulder to shoulder he also wore a white jacket c with a nightcap of mud and candle on his head but somehow he looked as though he had worn them all his life the fast gallop and the excitement of the masquerade which for him had charms the sterner neverbend could not feel had dissipated his sickness and he was once more all himself  so ive caught you at the first stage said he goodhumouredly for though he knew how badly he had been treated he was much too wise to show his knowledge it shall go hard but ill distance you before we have done he said to himself poor neverbend only grunted  and then they all went down a second stage in another bucket and then a third in a third bucket and then the business commenced as far as this point passive courage alone had been required to stand upright in a wooden tub and go down and down and down was in itself easy enough so long as the heart did not utterly faint mr neverbends heart had grown faintish but still he had persevered and now stood on a third lobby listening with dull unintelligent ears to eager questions asked by his colleague and to the rapid answers of their mining guides tudor was absolutely at work with paper and pencil taking down notes in that wretched pandemonium  there now sir said the guide no more of them ugly buckets mr neverbend we can trust to our own arms and legs for the rest of it and so saying he pointed out to mr neverbends horrorstricken eyes a perpendicular iron ladder fixed firmly against the upright side of a shaft and leadingfor aught mr neverbend could seedirect to hell itself  down here is it said alaric peeping over  ill go first said the guide and down he went down down down till neverbend looking over could barely see the glimmer of his disappearing head light was it absolutely intended that he should disappear in the same way had he bound himself to go down that fiendish upright ladder and were he to go down it what then would it be possible that a man of his weight should ever come up again  shall it be you or i next said alaric very civilly neverbend could only pant and grunt and alaric with a courteous nod placed himself on the ladder and went down down down till of him also nothing was left but the faintest glimmer mr neverbend remained above with one of the mining authorities one attendant miner also remained with them  now sir said the authority if you are ready the ladder is quite free  free what would not neverbend have given to be free also himself he looked down the free ladder and the very look made him sink it seemed to him as though nothing but a spider could creep down that perpendicular abyss and then a sound slow sharp and continuous as of drops falling through infinite space on to deep water came upon his ear and he saw that the sides of the abyss were covered with slime and the damp air made him cough and the cap had got over his spectacles and nearly blinded him and he was perspiring with a cold clammy sweat  well sir shall we be going on said the authority mr tooderll be at the foot of the next set before this  mr neverbend wished that mr tudors journey might still be down and down and down till he reached the globes centre in which conflicting attractions might keep him for ever fixed in his despair he essayed to put one foot upon the ladder and then looked piteously up to the guides face even in that dark dingy atmosphere the light of the farthing candle on his head revealed the agony of his heart his companions though they were miners were still men they saw his misery and relented  maybe thee be afeared said the working miner and if so be thee beest theed better bide  i am sure i should never come up again said neverbend with a voice pleading for mercy but with all the submission of one prepared to suffer without resistance if mercy should not be forthcoming  thee beest for sartan too thick and weazy like for them stairs said the miner  i am i am said neverbend turning on the man a look of the warmest affection and shoving the horrid heavy encumbered cap from off his spectacles yes i am too fat how would he have answered with what aspect would he have annihilated the sinner had such a man dared to call him weazy up above on terra firma under the canopy of heaven  his troubles however or at any rate his dangers were brought to an end as soon as it became plainly manifest that his zeal in the public service would carry him no lower and would hardly suffice to keep life throbbing in his bosom much longer even in his present level preparations were made for his ascent a bell was rung hoarse voices were again heard speaking and answering in sounds quite unintelligible to a cockneys ears chains rattled the windlass whirled and the huge bucket came tumbling down nearly on their heads poor neverbend was all but lifted into it where now was all the pride of the morn that had seen him go forth the great dictator of the mines where was that towering spirit with which he had ordered his tea and toast and rebuked the slowness of his charioteer where the ambition that had soared so high over the pet of the weights and measures alas alas how few of us there are who have within us the courage to be great in adversity aequam mementoc cif thou couldst but have thought of it o neverbend who needst must some day die  but neverbend did not think of it how few of us do remember such lessons at those moments in which they ought to be of use to us he was all but lifted into the tub and then out of it and then again into another till he reached the upper world a sight piteous to behold his spectacles had gone from him his cap covered his eyes his lamp had reversed itself and soft globules of grease had fallen on his nose he was bathed in perspiration and was nevertheless chilled through to his very bones his whiskers were fringed with mud and his black cravat had been pulled from his neck and lost in some infernal struggle nevertheless the moment in which he seated himself on a hard stool in that rough shed was perhaps the happiest in his life some christian brought him beer had it been nectar from the brewery of the gods he could not have drunk it with greater avidity  by slow degrees he made such toilet as circumstances allowed and then had himself driven back to tavistock being no more willing to wait for tudor now than he had been in the early morning but jehu found him much more reasonable on his return and as that respectable functionary pocketed his halfcrown he fully understood the spirit in which it was given poor neverbend had not now enough pluck left in him to combat the hostility of a postboy  alaric who of course contrived to see all that was to be seen and learn all that was to be learnt in the dark passages of the tin mine was careful on his return to use his triumph with the greatest moderation his conscience was alas burdened with the guilty knowledge of undys shares when he came to think of the transaction as he rode leisurely back to tavistock he knew how wrong he had been and yet he felt a kind of triumph at the spoil which he held for he had heard among the miners that the shares of mary jane were already going up to some incredible standard of value in this manner so said he to himself had all the great minds of the present day made their money and kept themselves afloat twas thus he tried to comfort himself but not as yet successfully  there were no more squabbles between mr neverbend and mr tudor each knew that of himself which made him bear and forbear and so the two commissioners returned to town on good terms with each other and alaric wrote a report which delighted the heart of sir gregory hardlines ruined the opponents of the great tin mine and sent the mary jane shares up and up and up till speculating men thought that they could not give too high a price to secure them  alaric returned to town on friday it had been arranged that he and charley and norman should all go down to hampton on the saturday and then on the following week the competitive examination was to take place but alarics first anxiety after his return was to procure the £206 which he had to pay for the shares which he held in his pocketbook he all but regretted as he journeyed up to town with the now tame fidus seated opposite to him that he had not disposed of them at tavistock even at half their present value so that he might have saved himself the necessity of being a borrower and have wiped his hands of the whole affair  he and norman dined together at their club in waterloo place the pythagorean a much humbler establishment than that patronized by scott and one that was dignified by no politics after dinner as they sat over their pint of sherry alaric made his request  harry said he suddenly you are always full of moneyi want you to lend me £150  norman was much less quick in his mode of speaking than his friend and at the present moment was inclined to be somewhat slower than usual this affair of the examination pressed upon his spirits and made him dull and unhappy during the whole of dinner he had said little or nothing and had since been sitting listlessly gazing at vacancy and balancing himself on the hindlegs of his chair  o yescertainly said he but he said it without the eagerness with which alaric thought that he should have answered his request  if its inconvenient or if you dont like it said alaric the blood mounting to his forehead it does not signify i can do without it  i can lend it you without any inconvenience said harry when do you want itnot tonight i suppose  nonot tonighti should like to have it early tomorrow morning but i see you dont like it so ill manage it some other way  i dont know what you mean by not liking it i have not the slightest objection to lending you any money i can spare i dont think youll find any other of your friends who will like it better you can have it by eleven oclock tomorrow  intimate as the two men were there had hitherto been very little borrowing or lending between them and now alaric felt as though he owed it to his intimacy with his friend to explain to him why he wanted so large a sum in so short a time he felt moreover that he would not himself be so much ashamed of what he had done if he could confess it to some one else he could then solace himself with the reflection that he had done nothing secret norman he supposed would be displeased but then normans displeasure could not injure him and with norman there would be no danger that the affair would go any further  you must think it very strange said he that i should want such a sum but the truth is i have bought some shares  railway shares said norman in a tone that certainly did not signify approval he disliked speculation altogether and had an oldfashioned idea that men who do speculate should have money wherewith to do it  nonot railway shares exactly  canal suggested norman  nonot canal  gas  mines said alaric bringing out the dread truth at last  harry normans brow grew very black not that mine that youve been down about i hope said he  yesthat very identical mary jane that i went down and down about said alaric trying to joke on the subject dont look so very black my dear fellow i know all that you have to say upon the matter i did what was very foolish i dare say but the idea never occurred to me till it was too late that i might be suspected of making a false report on the subject because i had embarked a hundred pounds in it  alaric if it were known  then it mustnt be known said tudor i am sorry for it but as i told you the idea didnt occur to me till it was too late the shares are bought now and must be paid for tomorrow i shall sell them the moment i can and you shall have the money in three or four days  i dont care one straw about the money said norman now quick enough but still in great displeasure i would give double the amount that you had not done this  dont be so suspicious harry said the otherdont try to think the worst of your friend by others by sir gregory hardlines neverbend and such men i might expect to be judged harshly in such a matter but i have a right to expect that you will believe me i tell you that i did this inadvertently and am sorry for it surely that ought to be sufficient  norman said nothing more but he felt that tudor had done that which if known would disgrace him for ever it might however very probably never be known and it might also be that tudor would never act so dishonestly again on the following morning the money was paid and in the course of the next week the shares were resold and the money repaid and alaric tudor for the first time in his life found himself to be the possessor of over three hundred pounds  such was the price which scott manylodes  co had found it worth their while to pay him for his good report on mary jane    chapter xi  the three kings   and now came the allimportant week on the saturday the three young men went down to hampton charley had lately been leading a very mixed sort of life one week he would consort mainly with the houri of the norfolk street beershop and the next he would be on his good behaviour and live as respectably as circumstances permitted him to do his scope in this respect was not large the greatest respectability which his unassisted efforts could possibly achieve was to dine at a cheap eatinghouse and spend his evenings at a cigar divan he belonged to no club and his circle of friends except in the houri and navvy line was very limited who could expect that a young man from the internal navigation would sit for hours and hours alone in a dull london lodging over his book and teacup who should expect that any young man will do so and yet mothers and aunts and anxious friends do expect itvery much in vain  during alarics absence at tavistock norman had taken charley by the hand and been with him a good deal he had therefore spent an uncommonly respectable week and the norfolk street houri would have been au désespoir but that she had other charleys to her bow when he found himself getting into a firstclass carriage at the waterloobridge station with his two comrades he began to appreciate the comfort of decency and almost wished that he also had been brought up among the stern morals and hard work of the weights and measures  nothing special occurred at surbiton cottage it might have been evident to a watchful bystander that alaric was growing in favour with all the party excepting mrs woodward and that as he did so harry was more and more cherished by her  this was specially shown in one little scene alaric had brought down with him to hampton the documents necessary to enable him to draw out his report on mary jane indeed it was all but necessary that he should do so as his coming examination would leave him but little time for other business during the week on saturday night he sat up at his inn over the papers and on sunday morning when mrs woodward and the girls came down ready bonneted for church he signified his intention of remaining at his work  i certainly think he might have gone to church said mrs woodward when the halldoor closed behind the party as they started to their place of worship  oh mamma think how much he has to do said gertrude  nonsense said mrs woodward its all affectation and he ought to go to church government clerks are not worked so hard as all that are they harry  alaric is certainly very busy but i think he should go to church all the same said harry who himself never omitted divine worship  but surely this is a work of necessity said linda  fiddledede said mrs woodward i hate affectation my dear its very grand i dare say for a young mans services to be in such request that he cannot find time to say his prayers hell find plenty of time for gossiping by and by i dont doubt  linda could say nothing further for an unbidden tear moistened her eyelid as she heard her mother speak so harshly of her lover gertrude however took up the cudgels for him and so did captain cuttwater  i think you are a little hard upon him mamma said gertrude particularly when you know that as a rule he always goes to church i have heard you say yourself what an excellent churchman he is  young men change sometimes said mrs woodward  upon my word bessie i think you are very uncharitable this fine sunday morning said the captain i wonder how youll feel if we have that chapter about the beam and the mote  mrs woodward did not quite like being scolded by her uncle before her daughters but she said nothing further katie however looked daggers at the old man from out her big bright eyes what right had any man were he ever so old ever so much an uncle to scold her mamma katie was inclined to join her mother and take harry normans side for it was harry norman who owned the boat  they were now at the church door and they entered without saying anything further let us hope that charity which surpasseth all other virtues guided their prayers while they were there and filled their hearts in the meantime alaric unconscious how he had been attacked and how defended worked hard at his tavistock notes  mrs woodward was quite right in this that the commissioner of the mines though he was unable to find time to go to church did find time to saunter about with the girls before dinner was it to be expected that he should not do so for what other purpose was he there at hampton  they were all very serious this sunday afternoon and katie could make nothing of them she and charley indeed went off by themselves to a desert island or a place that would have been a desert island had the water run round it and there built stupendous palaces and laid out glorious gardens charley was the most goodnatured of men and could he have only brought a boat with him as harry so often did he would soon have been first favourite with katie  it shant be at all like hampton court said katie speaking of the new abode which charley was to build for her  not at all said charley  nor yet buckingham palace  no said charley i think well have it gothic  gothic said katie looking up at him with all her eyes will gothic be most grand whats gothic  charley began to consider westminster abbey said he at last  ohbut charley i dont want a church is the alhambra gothic  charley was not quite sure but thought it probably was they decided therefore that the new palace should be built after the model of the alhambra  the afternoon was but dull and lugubrious to the remainder of the party the girls seemed to feel that there was something solemn about the coming competition between two such dear friends which prevented and should prevent them all from being merry harry perfectly sympathized in the feeling and even alaric though depressed himself by no melancholy forebodings was at any rate conscious that he should refrain from any apparent anticipation of a triumph they all went to church in the evening but even this amendment in alarics conduct hardly reconciled him to mrs woodward  i suppose we shall all be very clever before long said she after tea but really i dont know that we shall be any the better for it now in this office of yours by the end of next week there will be three or four men with broken hearts and there will be one triumphant jackanapes so conceited and proud that hell never bring himself to do another good ordinary days work as long as he lives nothing will persuade me but that it is not only very bad but very unjust also  the jackanapes must learn to put up with ordinary work said alaric or hell soon find himself reduced to his former insignificance  and the men with the broken hearts they i suppose must put up with their wretchedness too said mrs woodward and their wives also and children who have been looking forward for years to this vacancy as the period of their lives at which they are to begin to be comfortable i hate such heartlessness i hate the very name of sir gregory hardlines  but mamma wont the general effect be to produce a much higher class of education among the men said gertrude  in the army and navy the best men get on the best said linda  do they by jingo said uncle bat its very little you know about the navy miss linda  well then at any rate they ought said linda  i would have a competitive examination in every service said gertrude it would make young men ambitious they would not be so idle and empty as they now are if they had to contend in this way for every step upwards in the world  the world said mrs woodward will soon be like a fishpond very full of fish but with very little food for them every one is scrambling for the others prey and they will end at last by eating one another if harry gets this situation will not that unfortunate jones who for years has been waiting for it always regard him as a robber  my maxim is this said uncle bat if a youngster goes into any service say the navy and does his duty by his country like a man why he shouldnt be passed over now look at me i was on the books of the catamaran one of the old seventyfours in 96 i did my duty then and always was never in the black book or laid up sick was always rough and ready for any work that came to hand and when i went into the mudlark as lieutenant in year 9 little bobby howard had just joined the old cat as a young middy and where am i now and where is bobby howard why de im on the shelf craving the ladies pardon and hes a lord of the admiralty if you please and a member of parliament now i say cuttwaters as good a name as howard for going to sea with any day and if thered been a competitive examination for admiralty lords five years ago bobby howard would never have been where he is now and somebody else who knows more about his profession than all the howards put together might perhaps have been in his place and so my lads heres to you and i hope the best man will win  whether uncle bat agreed with his niece or with his grandnieces was not very apparent from the line of his argument but they all laughed at his eagerness and nothing more was said that evening about the matter  alaric harry and charley of course returned to town on the following day breakfast on monday morning at surbiton cottage was an early affair when the young men were there so early that captain cuttwater did not make his appearance since his arrival at the cottage mrs woodward had found an excuse for a later breakfast in the necessity of taking it with her uncle so that the young people were generally left alone linda was the family teamaker and was therefore earliest down and alaric being the first on this morning to leave the hotel found her alone in the diningroom  he had never renewed the disclosure of his passion but linda had thought that whenever he shook hands with her since that memorable walk she had always felt a more than ordinary pressure this she had been careful not to return but she had not the heart to rebuke it now when he bade her good morning he certainly held her hand in his longer than he need have done he looked at her too as though his looks meant something more than ordinary looking at least so linda thought but yet he said nothing and so linda slightly trembling went on with the adjustment of her teatray  it will be all over linda when we meet again said alaric his mind she found was intent on his examination not on his love but this was natural was as it should be ifand she was certain in her heart that it would be soif he should be successful then he might speak of love without having to speak in the same breath of poverty as well it will be all over when we meet again he said  i suppose it will said linda  i dont at all like it it seems so unnatural having to contend against ones friend and yet one cannot help it one cannot allow ones self to go to the wall  im sure harry doesnt mind it said linda  im sure i do said he if i fail i shall be unhappy and if i succeed i shall be equally so i shall set all the world against me i know what your mother meant when she talked of a jackanapes yesterday if i get the promotion i may wish goodbye to surbiton cottage  oh alaric  harry would forgive me but harrys friends would never do so  how can you say so i am sure mamma has no such feeling nor yet even gertrude i mean that none of us have  it is very natural all of you should for he is your cousin  you are just the same as our cousin i am sure we think quite as much of you as of harry even gertrude said she hoped that you would get it  dear gertrude  because you know harry does not want it so much as you do i am sure i wish you success with all my heart perhaps its wicked to wish for either of you over the other but you cant both get it at once you know  at this moment katie came in and soon afterwards gertrude and the two other young men and so nothing further was said on the subject  charley parted with the competitors at the corner of waterloo bridge he turned into somerset house being there regarded on these monday mornings as a prodigy of punctuality and alaric and harry walked back along the strand arminarm toward their own office  well lads i hope youll both win said charley and whichever wins most why of course hell stand an uncommon good dinner  oh thats of course said alaric well have it at the trafalgar  and so the two walked on together arminarm to the weights and measures  the ceremony which was now about to take place at the weights and measures was ordained to be the first of those examinations which under the auspices of sir gregory hardlines were destined to revivify clarify and render perfect the civil service of the country it was a great triumph to sir gregory to see the darling object of his heart thus commencing its existence in the very cradle in which he as an infant hercules had made his first exertions in the cause it was to be his future fortune to superintend these intellectual contests in a stately office of his own duly set apart and appointed for the purpose but the throne on which he was to sit had not yet been prepared for him and he was at present constrained to content himself with exercising his power now here and now there according as his services might be required carrying the appurtenances of his royalty about with him  but sir gregory was not a solitary monarch in days long gone by there were as we all know three kings at cologne and again three kings at brentford so also were there three kings at the civil service examination board but of these three sir gregory was by far the greatest king he sat in the middle had two thousand jewels to his crown whereas the others had only twelve hundred each and his name ran first in all the royal warrants nevertheless sir gregory could he have had it so would like most other kings have preferred an undivided sceptre  of his comates on the throne the elder in rank was a west country baronet who not content with fatting beeves and brewing beer like his sires aspired to do something for his country sir warwick westend was an excellent man full of the best intentions and not more than decently anxious to get the good things of government into his hand he was perhaps rather too much inclined to think that he could see further through a millstone than another and had a way of looking as though he were always making the attempt he was a man born to grace if not his country at any rate his county and his conduct was uniformly such as to afford the liveliest satisfaction to his uncles aunts and relations in general if as a king he had a fault it was this that he allowed that other king sir gregory to carry him in his pocket  but sir gregory could not at all get the third king into his pocket this gentleman was a worthy clergyman from cambridge one mr jobbles by name mr jobbles had for many years been examining undergraduates for little goes and great goes and had passed his life in putting posing questions in detecting ignorance by viva voce scrutiny and eliciting learning by printed papers he by a stupendous effort of his mathematical mind had divided the adult british male world into classes and subclasses and could tell at a moments notice how long it would take him to examine them all his soul panted for the work every man should he thought be made to pass through some go the greengrocers boy should not carry out cabbages unless his fitness for cabbagecarrying had been ascertained and till it had also been ascertained that no other boy ambitious of the preferment would carry them better difficulty there was no difficulty could not he jobbles get through 5000 viva voces in every five hoursthat is with due assistance and would not 55000 printed papers containing 555000 questions be getting themselves answered at the same time with more or less precision  so now mr jobbles was about to try his huge plan by a small commencement  on the present occasion the examination was actually to be carried on by two of the kings in person sir gregory had declared that as so large a portion of his heart and affections was bound up with the gentlemen of the weights and measures he could not bring himself actually to ask questions of them and then to listen to or read their answers should any of his loved ones make some fatal faux pas his tears like those of the recording angel would blot out the error his eyes would refuse to see faults if there should be faults in those whom he himself had nurtured therefore though he came with his colleagues to the weights and measures he did not himself take part in the examination  at eleven oclock the boardroom was opened and the candidates walked in and seated themselves fear of sir gregory and other causes had thinned the number poor jones who by right of seniority should have had the prize declined to put himself in competition with his juniors and in lieu thereof sent up to the lords of the treasury an awful memorial spread over fifteen folio pagesvery uselessly the lords of the treasury referred it to the three kings whose secretary put a minute upon it sir gregory signed the minute and some gentleman at the treasury wrote a short letter to mr jones apprising that unhappy gentleman that my lords had taken the matter into their fullest consideration and that nothing could be done to help him had jones been consulted by any other disappointed civil service werter as to the expediency of complaining to the treasury lords jones would have told him exactly what would be the result the disappointed one however always thinks that all the treasury lords will give all their ears to him though they are deafer than icarus to the world beside  robinson stood his ground like a man but brown found out a day or two before the struggle came that he could not bring himself to stand against his friend jones he said he knew was incompetent but robinson ought to get it so he for one would not stand in robinsons way  uppinall was there as confident as a bantam cock and so was alphabet precis who had declared to all his friends that if the pure well of official english undefiled was to count for anything he ought to be pretty safe but poor minusex was ill and sent a certificate he had so crammed himself with unknown quantities that his mindlike a gourmands stomachhad broken down under the effort and he was now sobbing out algebraic positions under his counterpane  norman and alaric made up the five who still had health strength and pluck to face the stern justice of the new kings and they accordingly took their seats on five chairs equally distant placing themselves in due order of seniority  and then first of all sir gregory made a little speech standing up at the head of the boardroom table with an attendant king on either hand and the secretary and two assistantsecretaries standing near him was not this a proud moment for sir gregory  it had now become his duty he said to take his position in that room that wellknown wellloved room under circumstances of which he had little dreamt when he first entered it with awestruck steps in the days of his early youth but nevertheless even then ambition had warmed him that ambition had been to devote every energy of his mind every muscle of his body every hour of his life to the civil service of his country it was not much perhaps that he had been able to do he could not boast of those acute powers of mind of that gigantic grasp of intellect of which they saw in those days so wonderful an example in a high place sir gregory here gratefully alluded to that statesman who had given him his present appointment but still he had devoted all his mind such as it was and every hour of his life to the service and now he had his reward if he might be allowed to give advice to the gentlemen before him gentlemen of whose admirable qualifications for the civil service of the country he himself was so well aware his advice should be thisthat they should look on none of their energies as applicable to private purposes regard none of their hours as their own they were devoted in a peculiar way to the civil service and they should feel that such was their lot in life they should know that their intellects were a sacred pledge intrusted to them for the good of that service and should use them accordingly this should be their highest ambition and what higher ambition asked sir gregory could they have they all alas knew that the service had been disgraced in other quarters by idleness incompetency and he feared he must say dishonesty till incompetency and dishonesty had become not the exception but the rule it was too notorious that the civil service was filled by the family fools of the aristocracy and middle classes and that any family who had no fool to send sent in lieu thereof some invalid past hope thus the service had become a hospital for incurables and idiots it was said sir gregory for him and them to cure all that he would not he said at that moment say anything with reference to salaries it was as they were all aware a very difficult subject and did not seem to be necessarily connected with the few remarks which the present opportunity had seemed to him to call for he then told them they were all his beloved children that they were a credit to the establishment that he handed them over without a blush to his excellent colleagues sir warwick westend and mr jobbles and that he wished in his heart that each of them could be successful and having so spoken sir gregory went his way  it was beautiful then to see how mr jobbles swam down the long room and handed out his examination papers to the different candidates as he passed them twas a pity there should have been but five the man did it so well so quickly with such a gusto he should have been allowed to try his hand upon five hundred instead of five his step was so rapid and his hand and arm moved so dexterously that no conceivable number would have been too many for him but even with five he showed at once that the right man was in the right place mr jobbles was created for the conducting of examinations  and then the five candidates who had hitherto been all ears of a sudden became all eyes and devoted themselves in a manner which would have been delightful to sir gregory to the papers before them sir warwick in the meantime was seated in his chair hard at work looking through his millstone  it is a dreadful task that of answering examination papersonly to be exceeded in dreadfulness by the horrors of mr jobbles viva voce torments a man has before him a string of questions and he looks painfully down them from question to question searching for some allusion to that special knowledge which he has within him he too often finds that no such allusion is made it appears that the jobbles of the occasion has exactly known the blank spots of his mind and fitted them all he has perhaps crammed himself with the winds and tides and there is no more reference to those stormy subjects than if luna were extinct but he has unfortunately been loose about his botany and question after question would appear to him to have been dictated by sir joseph paxton or the headgardener at kew and then to his own blank face and puzzled look is opposed the fast scribbling of some botanic candidate fast as though reams of folio could hardly contain all the knowledge which he is able to pour forth  and so with a mixture of fastscribbling pens and blank faces our five friends went to work the examination lasted for four days and it was arranged that on each of the four days each of the five candidates should be called up to undergo a certain quantum of mr jobbles viva voce this part of his duty mr jobbles performed with a mildness of manner that was beyond all praise a mother training her firstborn to say papa could not do so with a softer voice or more affectionate demeanour  the planet jupiter said he to mr precis i have no doubt you know accurately the computed distance of that planet from the sun and also that of our own planet could you tell me now how would you calculate the distance in inches say from london bridge to the nearest portion of jupiters disc at twelve oclock on the first of april mr jobbles as he put his little question smiled the sweetest of smiles and spoke in a tone conciliating and gentle as though he were asking mr precis to dine with him and take part of a bottle of claret at halfpast six  but nevertheless mr precis looked very blank  i am not asking the distance you know said mr jobbles smiling sweeter than ever i am only asking how you would compute it  but still mr precis looked exceedingly blank  never mind said mr jobbles with all the encouragement which his voice could give never mind now suppose that a be a milestone b a turnpikegate and so on  but mr jobbles in spite of his smiles so awed the hearts of some of his candidates that two of them retired at the end of the second day poor robinson thinking and not without sufficient ground that he had not a ghost of a chance determined to save himself from further annoyance and then norman put utterly out of conceit with himself by what he deemed the insufficiency of his answers did the same he had become low in spirits unhappy in temperament and selfdiffident to a painful degree alaric to give him his due did everything in his power to persuade him to see the task out to the last but the assurance and composure of alarics manner did more than anything else to provoke and increase normans discomfiture he had been schooling himself to bear a beating with a good grace and he began to find that he could only bear it as a disgrace on the morning of the third day instead of taking his place in the boardroom he sent in a note to mr jobbles declaring that he withdrew from the trial mr jobbles read the note and smiled with satisfaction as he put it into his pocket it was an acknowledgement of his own unrivalled powers as an examiner  mr precis still trusting to his pure well went on to the end and at the end declared that so ignorant was mr jobbles of his duty that he had given them no opportunity of showing what they could do in english composition why had he not put before them the papers in some memorable official case and desired them to make an abstract those for instance on the muchvexed question of penny versus pound as touching the new standard for the decimal coinage mr jobbles an examiner indeed and so mr precis bethought himself that he also if unsuccessful would go to the lords of the treasury  and mr uppinall and alaric tudor also went on those who knew anything of the matter when they saw how the running horses were reduced in number and what horses were left on the coursewhen they observed also how each steed came to the post on each succeeding morning had no doubt whatever of the result so that when alaric was declared on the saturday morning to have gained the prize there was very little astonishment either felt or expressed at the weights and measures  alarics juniors wished him joy with some show of reality in their manner but the congratulations of his seniors including the secretary and assistantsecretaries the new chief clerk and the men in the class to which he was now promoted were very cold indeed but to this he was indifferent it was the nature of tudors disposition that he never for a moment rested satisfied with the round of the ladder on which he had contrived to place himself he had no sooner gained a step than he looked upwards to see how the next step was to be achieved his motto might well have been excelsior if only he could have taught himself to look to heights that were really high when he found that the august secretary received him on his promotion without much empressement he comforted himself by calculating how long it would be before he should fill that secretarys chairif indeed it should ever be worth his while to fill it  the secretary at the weights and measures had after all but a dull time of it and was precluded by the routine of his office from parliamentary ambition and the joys of government alaric was already beginning to think that this weights and measures should only be a steppingstone to him and that when sir gregory with his stern dogma of devotion to the service had been of sufficient use to him he also might with advantage be thrown over in the meantime an income of £600 a year brought with it to the young bachelor some very comfortable influence but the warmest and the pleasantest of all the congratulations which he received was from his dear friend undy scott  ah my boy said undy pressing his hand youll soon be one of us by the by i want to put you up for the downing you should leave that pythagorean theres nothing to be got by it  now the downing was a political club in which however politics had latterly become a good deal mixed but the government of the day generally found there a liberal support and recognized and acknowledged its claim to consideration    chapter xii  consolation   on the following sunday neither tudor nor norman was at hampton they had both felt that they could not comfortably meet each other there and each had declined to go they had promised to write and now that the matter was decided how were they or either of them to keep the promise  it may be thought that the bitterness of the moment was over with norman as soon as he gave up but such was not the case let him struggle as he would with himself he could not rally nor bring himself to feel happy on what had occurred he would have been better satisfied if alaric would have triumphed but alaric seemed to take it all as a matter of course and never spoke of his own promotion unless he did so in answer to some remark of his companion then he could speak easily enough otherwise he was willing to let the matter go by as one settled and at rest he had consulted norman about the purchase of a horse but he hitherto had shown no other sign that he was a richer man than formerly  it was a very bitter time for norman he could not divest his mind of the subject what was he to do where was he to go how was he to get away even for a time from alaric tudor and then was he right in wishing to get away from him had he not told himself over and over again that it behoved him as a man and a friend and a christian to conquer the bitter feeling of envy which preyed on his spirits had he not himself counselled alaric to stand this examination and had he not promised that his doing so should make no difference in their friendship had he not pledged himself to rejoice in the success of his friend and now was he to break his word both to that friend and to himself  schooling himself or trying to school himself in this way he made no attempt at escaping from his unhappiness they passed the wednesday thursday and friday evenings together it was now nearly the end of september and london was empty that is empty as regards those friends and acquaintances with whom norman might have found some resource on the saturday they left their office early for all office routine had during this week been broken through by the immense importance of the ceremony which was going on and then it became necessary to write to mrs woodward  will you write to hampton or shall i said alaric as they walked arminarm under the windows of whitehall  oh you of course said norman you have much to tell them i have nothing  just as you please said the other that is of course i will if you like it but i think it would come better from you you are nearer to them than i am and it will have less a look of triumph on my part and less also of disappointment on yours if you write if you tell them that you literally threw away your chance you will only tell them the truth  norman assented but he said nothing further what business had alaric to utter such words as triumph and disappointment he could not keep his arm on which alaric was leaning from spasmodically shrinking from the touch he had been beaten by a man nay worse had yielded to a man who had not the common honesty to refuse a bribe and yet he was bound to love this man he could not help asking himself the question which he would do would he love him or hate him  but while he was so questioning himself he got home and had to sit down and write his letterthis he did at once but not without difficulty it ran as follows  my dear mrs woodward  i write a line to tell you of my discomfiture and alarics success i gave up at the end of the second day of course i will tell you all about it when we meet no one seemed to doubt that alaric would get it as a matter of course i shall be with you on next saturday alaric says he will not go down till the saturday after when i shall be at normansgrove my best love to the girls tell katie i shant drown either myself or the boat  yours ever affectionately  h n  saturday september 185  pray write me a kind letter to comfort me  mrs woodward did write him a very kind letter and it did comfort him and she wrote also as she was bound to do a letter of congratulation to alaric this letter though it expressed in the usual terms the satisfaction which one friend has in anothers welfare was not written in the same warm affectionate tone as that to norman alaric perceived instantly that it was not cordial he loved mrs woodward dearly and greatly desired her love and sympathy but what then he could not have everything he determined therefore not to trouble his mind if mrs woodward did not sympathize with him others of the family would do so and success would ultimately bring her round what woman ever yet refused to sympathize with successful ambition  alaric also received a letter from captain cuttwater in which that gallant veteran expressed his great joy at the result of the examinationlet the best man win all the world over said he whatever his name is and theyll have to make the same rule at the admiralty too the days of the howards are gone by that is unless they can prove themselves able seamen which very few of them ever did yet let the best man win thats what i say and let every man get his fair share of promotion alaric did not despise the sympathy of captain cuttwater it might turn out that even captain cuttwater could be made of use  mrs woodwards letter to harry was full of the tenderest affection it was a flattering soothing loving letter such as no man ever could have written it was like oil poured into his wounds and made him feel that the world was not all harsh to him he had determined not to go to hampton that saturday but mrs woodwards letter almost made him rush there at once that he might throw himself into her armsinto her arms and at her daughters feet the time had now come to him when he wanted to be comforted by the knowledge that his love was returned he resolved that during his next visit he would formally propose to gertrude  the determination to do this and a strong hope that he might do it successfully kept him up during the interval on the following week he was to go to his fathers place to shoot having obtained leave of absence for a month and he felt that he could still enjoy himself if he could take with him the conviction that all was right at surbiton cottage mrs woodward in her letter though she had spoken much of the girls had said nothing special about gertrude nevertheless norman gathered from it that she intended that he should go thither to look for comfort and that he would find there the comfort that he required  and mrs woodward had intended that such should be the effect of her letter it was at present the dearest wish of her heart to see norman and gertrude married that norman had often declared his love to her eldest daughter she knew very well and she knew also that gertrude had never rejected him having perfect confidence in her child she had purposely abstained from saying anything that could bias her opinion she had determined to leave the matter in the hands of the young people themselves judging that it might be best arranged as a true lovematch between them without interference from her she had therefore said nothing to gertrude on the subject  mrs woodward however discovered that she was in error when it was too late for her to retrieve her mistake and indeed had she discovered it before that letter was written what could she have done she could not have forbidden harry to come to her houseshe could not have warned him not to throw himself at her daughters feet the cup was prepared for his lips and it was necessary that he should drink of it there was nothing for which she could blame him nothing for which she could blame herself nothing for which she did blame her daughter it was sorrowful pitiful to be lamented wept for aye and groaned for many inward groans it cost her but it was at any rate well that she could attribute her sorrow to the spite of circumstances rather than to the illconduct of those she loved  nor would it have been fair to blame gertrude in the matter while she was yet a child this friend of her mothers had been thrown with her and when she was little more than a child she found that this friend had become a lover she liked him in one sense loved him and was accustomed to regard him as one whom it would be almost wrong in her not to like and love what wonder then that when he first spoke to her warm words of adoration she had not been able at once to know her own heart and tell him that his hopes would be in vain  she perceived by instinct rather than by spoken words that her mother was favourable to this young lover that if she accepted him she would please her mother that the course of true love might in their case run smooth what wonder then that she should have hesitated before she found it necessary to say that she could not would not be harry normans wife  on the saturday morning the morning of that night which was as he hoped to see him go to bed a happy lover so happy in his love as to be able to forget his other sorrows she was sitting alone with her mother it was natural that their conversation should turn to alaric and harry alaric with his happy prospects was soon dismissed but mrs woodward continued to sing the praises of him who had she been potent with the magi of the civil service would now be the lion of the weights and measures  i must say i think it was weak of him to retire said gertrude alaric says in his letter to uncle bat that had he persevered he would in all probability have been successful  i should rather say that it was generous said her mother  well i dont know mamma that of course depends on his motives but wouldnt generosity of that sort between two young men in such a position be absurd  you mean that such regard for his friend would be quixotic  yes mamma  perhaps it would all true generosity all noble feeling is now called quixotic but surely gertrude you and i should not quarrel with harry on that account  i think he got frightened mamma and had not nerve to go through with it  mrs woodward looked vexed but she made no immediate reply and for some time the mother and daughter went on working without further conversation at last gertrude said  i think every man is bound to do the best he can for himselfthat is honestly there is something spoony in one man allowing another to get before him as long as he can manage to be first himself  mrs woodward did not like the tone in which her daughter spoke she felt that it boded ill for harrys welfare and she tried but tried in vain to elicit from her daughter the expression of a kinder feeling  well my dear i must say i think you are hard on him but probably just at present you have the spirit of contradiction in you if i were to begin to abuse him perhaps i should get you to praise him  oh mamma i did not abuse him  something like it my dear when you said he was spoony  oh mamma i would not abuse him for worldsi know how good he is i know how you love him but but and gertrude though very little given to sobbing moods burst into tears  come here gertrude come here my child said mrs woodward now moved more for her daughter than for her favourite what is it what makes you cry i did not really mean that you abused poor harry  gertrude got up from her chair knelt at her mothers feet and hid her face in her mothers lap oh mamma she said with a halfsmothered voice i know what you mean i know what you wish butbutbut oh mamma you must notmust not must not think of it any more  then may god help him said mrs woodward gently caressing her daughter who was still sobbing with her face buried in her mothers lap may god almighty lighten the blow to him but oh gertrude i had hoped i had so hoped  oh mamma dont pray dont and gertrude sobbed as though she were going into hysterics  no my child i will not say another word dear as he is to me you are and must be ten times dearer there gertrude it is over now over at least between us we know each others hearts now it is my fault that we did not do so sooner they did understand each other at last and the mother made no further attempt to engage her daughters love for the man she would have chosen as her daughters husband  but still the worst was to come as mrs woodward well knewand as gertrude knew also to come too on this very day mrs woodward with a womans keen perception felt assured that harry norman when he found himself at the cottage freed from the presence of the successful candidate surrounded by the affectionate faces of all her circle would melt at once and look to his love for consolation she understood the feelings of his heart as well as though she had read them in a book and yet she could do nothing to save him from his fresh sorrows the cup was prepared for him and it was necessary that he should drink it she could not tell him could not tell even him that her daughter had rejected him when as yet he had made no offer  and so harry norman hurried down to his fate when he reached the cottage mrs woodward and linda and katie were in the drawingroom  harry my dear harry said mrs woodward rushing to him throwing her arms round him and kissing him we know it all we understand it allmy fine dear good harry  harry was melted in a moment and in the softness of his mood kissed katie too and linda also katie he had often kissed but never linda cousins though they were linda merely laughed but norman blushed for he remembered that had it so chanced that gertrude had been there he would not have dared to kiss her  oh harry said katie we are so sorrythat is not sorry about alaric but sorry about you why were there not two prizes  its all right as it is katie said he we need none of us be sorry at all alaric is a clever fellow everybody gave him credit for it before and now he has proved that everybody is right  he is older than you you know and therefore he ought to be cleverer said katie trying to make things pleasant  and then they went out into the garden but where was gertrude all this time she had been in the drawingroom a moment before his arrival they walked out into the lawn but nothing was said about her absence norman could not bring himself to ask for her and mrs woodward could not trust herself to talk of her  where is the captain said harry  hes at hampton court said linda he has found another navy captain there and he goes over every day to play backgammon as they were speaking however the captain walked through the house on to the lawn  well norman how are you how are you sorry you couldnt all win but youre a man of fortune you know so it doesnt signify  not a great deal of fortune said harry looking sheepish  well i only hope the best man got it now at the admiralty the worst man gets it always  the worst man didnt get it here said harry  no no said uncle bat im sure he did not nor he wont long at the admiralty either i can tell them that but wheres gertrude  shes in her bedroom dressing for dinner said katie  hoity toity said uncle bat shes going to make herself very grand today thats all for you master norman well i suppose we may all go in and get ready but mind i have got no sweetheart and so i shant make myself grand at all and so they all went in to dress for dinner  when norman came down gertrude was in the drawingroom alone but he knew that they would be alone but for a minute and that a minute would not serve for his purpose she said one soft gentle word of condolence to him some little sentence that she had been studying to pronounce all her study was thrown away for norman in his confusion did not understand a word that she spoke her tone however was kind and affectionate and she shook hands with him apparently with cordiality he however ventured no kiss with her he did not even press her hand when for a moment he held it within his own  dinner was soon over and the autumn evening still admitted of their going out norman was not sorry to urge the fact that the ladies had done so as an excuse to captain cuttwater for not sitting with him over his wine he heard their voices in the garden and went out to join them prepared to ascertain his fate if fortune would give him an opportunity of doing so he found the party to consist of mrs woodward linda and katie gertrude was not there  i think the evenings get warmer as the winter gets nearer said harry  yes said mrs woodward but they are so dangerous the night comes on all at once and then the air is so damp and cold  and so they went on talking about the weather  your boat is up in london i know harry said katie with a voice of reproach but at the same time with a look of entreaty  yes its at searles said norman  but the punt is here said katie  not this evening katie said he  katie how can you be such a tease said mrs woodward youll make harry hate the island and you too i wonder you can be so selfish  poor katies eyes became suffused with tears  my dear katie its very bad of me isnt it said norman and the fine weather so nearly over too i ought to take you oughtnt i come we will go  no we wont said katie taking his big hand in both her little ones indeed we wont it was very wrong of me to bother you and you withwithwith so much to think of dear harry i dont want to go at all indeed i dont and she turned away from the little path which led to the place where the punt was moored  they sauntered on for a while together and then norman left them he said nothing but merely stole away from the lawn towards the drawingroom window mrs woodward well knew with what object he went and would have spared him from his immediate sorrow by following him but she judged that it would be better both for him and for her daughter that he should learn the truth  he went in through the open drawingroom window and found gertrude alone she was on the sofa with a book in her hand and had he been able to watch her closely he would have seen that the book trembled as he entered the room but he was unable to watch anything closely his own heart beat so fast his own confusion was so great that he could hardly see the girl whom he now hoped to gain as his wife had alaric been coming to his wooing he would have had every faculty at his call but then alaric could not have loved as norman loved  and so we will leave them in about half an hour when the short twilight was becoming dusk mrs woodward returned and found norman standing alone on the hearthrug before the fireplace gertrude was away and he was leaning against the mantelpiece with his hands behind his back staring at vacancy but oh with such an aspect of dull speechless agony in his face  mrs woodward looked up at him and would have burst into tears had she not remembered that they would not be long alone she therefore restrained herself but gave one involuntary sigh and then taking off her bonnet placed herself where she might sit without staring at him in his sorrow  katie came in next oh harry its so lucky we didnt start in the punt said she for its going to pour and we never should have been back from the island in that slow thing  norman looked at her and tried to smile but the attempt was a ghastly failure katie gazing up into his face saw that he was unhappy and slunk away without further speech to her distant chair there from time to time she would look up at him and her little heart melted with ruth to see the depth of his misery why oh why thought she should that greedy alaric have taken away the only prize  and then linda came running in with her bonnet ribbons all moist with the big raindrops you are a nice squire of dames said she to leave us all out to get wet through by ourselves and then she also looking up saw that jesting was at present illtimed and so sat herself down quietly at the teatable  but norman never moved he saw them come in one after another he saw the pity expressed in mrs woodwards face he heard the lighthearted voices of the two girls and observed how when they saw him their lightheartedness was abashed but still he neither spoke nor moved he had been stricken with a fearful stroke and for a while was powerless  captain cuttwater having shaken off his diningroom nap came for his tea and then at last gertrude also descending from her own chamber glided quietly into the room when she did so norman with a struggle roused himself and took a chair next to mrs woodward and opposite to her eldest daughter  who could describe the intense discomfiture of that teaparty or paint in fitting colours the different misery of each one there assembled even captain cuttwater at once knew that something was wrong and munched his breadandbutter and drank his tea in silence linda surmised what had taken place though she was surprised she was left without any doubt poor katie was still in the dark but she also knew that there was cause for sorrow and crept more and more into her little self mrs woodward sat with averted face and ever and anon she put her handkerchief to her eyes gertrude was very pale and all but motionless but she had schooled herself and managed to drink her tea with more apparent indifference than any of the others norman sat as he had before been standing with that dreadful look of agony upon his brow  immediately after tea mrs woodward got up and went to her dressingroom her dressingroom though perhaps not improperly so called was not an exclusive closet devoted to combs petticoats and soap and water it was a comfortable snug room nicely furnished with sofa and easy chairs and often open to others besides her handmaidens thither she betook herself that she might weep unseen but in about twenty minutes her tears were disturbed by a gentle knock at the door  very soon after she went gertrude also left the room and then katie crept off  i have got a headache tonight said norman after the remaining three had sat silent for a minute or two i think ill go across and go to bed  a headache said linda oh i am so sorry that you have got to go to that horrid inn  oh i shall do very well there said norman trying to smile  will you have my room said the captain goodnaturedly any sofa does for me  norman assured them as well as he could that his present headache was of such a nature that a bed at the inn would be the best thing for him and then shaking hands with them he moved to the door  stop a moment harry said linda and let me tell mamma shell give you something for your head he made a sign to her however to let him pass and then creeping gently upstairs he knocked at mrs woodwards door  come in said mrs woodward and harry norman with all his sorrows still written on his face stood before her  oh harry said she come in i am so glad that you have come to me oh harry dear harry what shall i say to comfort you what can i saywhat can i do  norman forgetting his manhood burst into tears and throwing himself on a sofa buried his face on the arm and sobbed like a young girl but the tears of a man bring with them no comfort as do those of the softer sex he was a strong tall man and it was dreadful to see him thus convulsed  mrs woodward stood by him and put her hand caressingly on his shoulder she saw he had striven to speak and had found himself unable to do so i know how it is said she you need not tell me i know it all would that she could have seen you with my eyes would that she could have judged you with my mind  oh mrs woodward  to me harry you should have been the dearest the most welcome son but you are so still no son could be dearer oh that she could have seen you as i see you  there is no hope said he he did not put it as a question but mrs woodward saw that it was intended that she should take it as such if she pleased what could she say to him she knew that there was no hope had it been linda linda might have been moulded to her will but with gertrude there could now be no hope what could she say she knelt down and kissed his brow and mingled her tears with his  oh harryoh harry my dearest dearest son  oh mrs woodward i have loved her so truly  what could mrs woodward do but cry also what but that and throw such blame as she could upon her own shoulders she was bound to defend her daughter  it has been my fault harry she said it is i whom you must blame not poor gertrude  i blame no one said he  i know you do not but it is i whom you should blame i should have learnt how her heart stood and have prevented thisbut i thought i thought it would have been otherwise  norman looked up at her and took her hand and pressed it i will go now he said and dont expect me here tomorrow i could not come in say that i thought it best to go to town because i am unwell goodbye mrs woodward pray write to me i cant come to the cottage now for a while but pray write to me do not you forget me mrs woodward  mrs woodward fell upon his breast and wept and bade god bless him and called him her son and her dearest friend and sobbed till her heart was nigh to break what she thought what could her daughter wish for when she repulsed from her feet such a suitor as harry norman  he then went quietly down the stairs quietly out of the house and having packed up his bag at the inn started off through the pouring rain and walked away through the dark stormy night through the dirt and mud and wet to his london lodgings nor was he again seen at surbiton cottage for some months after this adventure    chapter xiii  a communication of importance   normans dark wet walk did him physically no harm and morally some good he started on it in that frame of mind which induces a man to look with indifference on all coming evils under the impression that the evils already come are too heavy to admit of any increase but by the time that he was thoroughly wet through well splashed with mud and considerably fatigued by his first five or six miles walk he began to reflect that life was not over with him and that he must think of future things as well as those that were past  he got home about two oclock and having knocked up his landlady mrs richards betook himself to bed alaric had been in his room for the last two hours but of charley and his latchkey mrs richards knew nothing she stated her belief however that two am seldom saw that erratic gentleman in his bed  on the following morning alaric when he got his hot water heard that norman returned during the night from hampton and he immediately guessed what had brought him back he knew that nothing short of some great trouble would have induced harry to leave the cottage so abruptly and that that trouble must have been of such a nature as to make his remaining with the woodwards an aggravation of it no such trouble could have come on him but the one  as charley seldom made his appearance at the breakfast table on sunday mornings alaric foresaw that he must undergo a têteàtête which would not be agreeable to himself and which must be much more disagreeable to his companion but for this there was no help harry had however prepared himself for what he had to go through and immediately that the two were alone he told his tale in a very few words  alaric said he i proposed to gertrude last night and she refused me  alaric tudor was deeply grieved for his friend there was something in the rejected suitors countenancesomething in the tone of voice which would have touched any heart softer than stone and alarics heart had not as yet been so hardened by the world as to render him callous to the sight of such grief as this  take my word for it harry shell think better of it in a month or two he said  nevernever i am sure of it not only from her own manner but from her mothers said harry and yet during half his walk home he had been trying to console himself with the reflection that most young ladies reject their husbands once or twice before they accept them  there is no offering a man comfort in such a sorrow as this unless indeed he be one to whom the worship of bacchus may be made a fitting substitute for that of the paphian goddess  there is a sort of disgrace often felt if never acknowledged which attaches itself to a man for having put himself into normans present position and this generally prevents him from confessing his defeat in such matters the misfortune in question is one which doubtless occurs not unfrequently to mankind but as mankind generally bear their special disappointments in silence and as the vanity of women is generally exceeded by their goodnature the secret we believe in most cases remains a secret    shall i wasting in despair   die because a womans fair   if she be not fair for me   what care i how fair she be  this was the upshot of the consideration which withers the poet gave to the matter and withers was doubtless right tis thus that rejected lovers should think thus that they should demean themselves but they seldom come to this philosophy till a few days have passed by and talking of their grievance does not assist them in doing so  when therefore harry had declared what had happened to him and had declared also that he had no further hope he did not at first find himself much the better for what he had confessed he was lackadaisical and piteous and alaric though he had endeavoured to be friendly soon found that he had no power of imparting any comfort early in the day they parted and did not see each other again till the following morning  i was going down to normansgrove on thursday said harry  yes i know said alaric  i think i shall ask leave to go today it cant make much difference and the sooner i get away the better  and so it was settled norman left town the same afternoon and alaric with his blushing honours thick upon him was left alone  london was now very empty and he was constrained to enjoy his glory very much by himself he had never associated much with the minusexes and uppinalls nor yet with the joneses and robinsons of his own office and it could not be expected that there should be any specially confidential intercourse between them just at the present moment undy was of course out of town with the rest of the fashionable world and alaric during the next week was left very much on his own hands  and so said he to himself as he walked solitary along the lone paths of rotten row and across the huge desert to the marble arch and so poor harrys hopes have been all in vain he has lost his promotion and now he has lost his bridepoor harryand then it occurred to him that as he had acquired the promotion it might be his destiny to win the bride also he had never told himself that he loved gertrude he had looked on her as normans own and he at any rate was not the man to sigh in despair after anything that was out of his reach but now now that harrys chance was over and that no bond of friendship could interfere with such a passion why should he not tell himself that he loved gertrude if as harry had himself said there was no longer any hope for him why said alaric to himself why should not i try my chance of linda of dear dearest linda at this moment he thought very little or perhaps not at all of what mrs woodward might say of that he did think a good deal  the week was melancholy and dull and it passed very slowly at hampton on the sunday morning it became known to them all that norman was gone but the subject by tacit consent was allowed to pass all but unnoticed even katie even uncle bat were aware that something had occurred which ought to prevent them from inquiring too particularly why harry had started back to town in so sudden a manner and so they said nothing to linda gertrude had told what had happened and linda as she heard it asked herself whether she was prepared to be equally obdurate with her lover he had now the means of supporting a wife and why should she be obdurate  nothing was said on the subject between gertrude and her mother what more could mrs woodward say it would have been totally opposed to the whole principle of her life to endeavour by any means to persuade her daughter to the match or to have used her maternal influence in normans favour and she was well aware that it would have been impossible to do so successfully gertrude was not a girl to be talked into a marriage by any parent and certainly not by such a parent as her mother there was therefore nothing further to be said about it  on saturday alaric went down but his arrival hardly made things more pleasant mrs woodward could not bring herself to be cordial with him and the girls were restrained by a certain feeling that it would not be right to show too much outward joy at alarics success linda said one little word of affectionate encouragement but it produced no apparent return from alaric his immediate object was to recover mrs woodwards good graces and he thought before he went that he had reason to hope that he might do so  of all the household captain cuttwater was the most emphatic in his congratulations he had no doubt he said that the best man had won he had always hoped that the best man might win he had not had the same luck when he was young but he was very glad to see such an excellent rule brought into the service it would soon work great changes he was quite sure at the board of admiralty  on the sunday afternoon captain cuttwater asked him into his own bedroom and told him with a solemn serious manner that he had a communication of importance to make to him alaric followed the captain into the wellknown room in which norman used to sleep wondering what could be the nature of uncle bats important communication it might probably be some tidings of sir jib boom  mr alaric said the old man as soon as they were both seated on opposite sides of a little pembroke table that stood in the middle of the room i was heartily glad to hear of your success at the weights and measures not that i ever doubted it if they made a fair sailing match of it  i am sure i am much obliged to you captain cuttwater  that is as may be by and by but the fact is i have taken a fancy to you i like fellows that know how to push themselves  alaric had nothing for it but to repeat again that he felt himself grateful for captain cuttwaters good opinion  not that i have anything to say against mr normana very nice young man indeed he is very nice though perhaps not quite so cheerful in his manners as he might be  alaric began to take his friends part and declared what a very worthy fellow harry was  i am sure of iti am sure of it said uncle bat but everybody cant be a1 and a man cant make everybody his heir  alaric pricked up his ears so after all captain cuttwater was right in calling his communication important but what business had captain cuttwater to talk of making new heirshad he not declared that the woodwards were his heirs  i have got a little money mr alaric he went on saying in a low modest tone very different from that he ordinarily used i have got a little moneynot muchand it will of course go to my niece here  of course said alaric  that is to sayit will go to her children which is all the same thing  quite the same thing said alaric  but my idea is this if a man has saved a few pounds himself i think he has a right to give it to those he loves best now i have no children of my own  alaric declared himself aware of the fact  and i suppose i shant have any now  not if you dont marry said alaric who felt rather at a loss for a proper answer he could not however have made a better one  no thats what i mean but i dont think i shall marry i am very well contented here and i like surbiton cottage amazingly  its a charming place said alaric  no i dont suppose i shall ever have any children of my ownand then uncle bat sighed gentlyand so i have been considering whom i should like to adopt  quite right captain cuttwater  whom i should like to adopt i should like to have one whom i could call in a special manner my own now mr alaric i have made up my mind and who do you think it is  oh captain cuttwater i couldnt guess on such a matter i shouldnt like to guess wrong  perhaps notno thats rightwell then ill tell you its gertrude  alaric was well aware that it was gertrude before her name had been pronounced  yes its gertrude of course i couldnt go out of bessies familyof course it must be either gertrude or linda or katie now linda and katie are very well but they havent half the gumption that gertrude has  no they have not said alaric  i like gumption said captain cuttwater youve a great deal of gumptionthats why i like you  alaric laughed and muttered something  now i have been thinking of something and uncle bat looked strangely mysteriousi wonder what you think of gertrude  whoi said alaric  i can see through a millstone as well as another said the captain and i used to think that norman and gertrude meant to hit it off together  alaric said nothing he did not feel inclined to tell normans secret and yet he could not belie gertrude by contradicting the justice of captain cuttwaters opinion  i used to think sobut now i find theres nothing in it i am sure gertrude wouldnt have him and i think shes right he hasnt gumption enough  harry norman is no fool  i dare say not said the captain but take my word shell never have himlord bless you norman knows that as well as i do  alaric knew it very well himself also but he did not say so  now the long and the short of it is thiswhy dont you make up to her if youll make up to her and carry the day all i can say is i will do all i can to keep the pot aboiling and if you think it will help you you may tell gertrude that i say so  this was certainly an important communication and one to which alaric found it very difficult to give any immediate answer he said a great deal about his affection for mrs woodward of his admiration for miss woodward of his strong sense of captain cuttwaters kindness and of his own unworthiness but he left the captain with an impression that he was not prepared at the present moment to put himself forward as a candidate for gertrudes hand  i dont know what the deuce he would have said the captain to himself shes as fine a girl as hes likely to find and two or three thousand pounds isnt so easily got every day by a fellow that hasnt a shilling of his own  when alaric took his departure the next morning he thought he perceived from mrs woodwards manner that there was less than her usual cordiality in the tone in which she said that of course he would return at the end of the week  i will if possible he said and i need not say that i hope to do so but i fear i may be kept in townat any rate ill write when the end of the week came he wrote to say that unfortunately he was kept in town he thoroughly understood that people are most valued when they make themselves scarce he got in reply a note from gertrude saying that her mother begged that on the following saturday he would come and bring charley with him  on his return to town alaric by appointment called on sir gregory he had not seen his patron yet since his great report on wheal mary jane had been sent in that report had been written exclusively by himself and poor neverbend had been obliged to content himself with putting all his voluminous notes into tudors hands he afterwards obediently signed the report and received his reward for doing so alaric never divulged to official ears how neverbend had halted in the course of his descent to the infernal gods  i thoroughly congratulate you said sir gregory you have justified my choice and done your duty with credit to yourself and benefit to the public i hope you may go on and prosper as long as you remember that your own interests should always be kept in subservience to those of the public service you will not fail to receive the praise which such conduct deserves  alaric thanked sir gregory for his good opinion and as he did so he thought of his new bankers account and of the £300 which was lying there after all which of them was right sir gregory hardlines or undy scott or was it that sir gregorys opinions were such as should control the outward conduct and undys those which should rule the inner man    chapter xiv  very sad   norman prolonged his visit to his father considerably beyond the month at first he applied for and received permission to stay away another fortnight and at the end of that fortnight he sent up a medical certificate in which the doctor alleged that he would be unable to attend to business for some considerable additional period it was not till after christmas day that he reappeared at the weights and measures  alaric kept his appointment at hampton and took charley with him and on the two following saturdays he also went there and on both occasions charley accompanied him during these visits he devoted himself as closely as he could to mrs woodward he talked to her of norman and of normans prospects in the office he told her how he had intended to abstain from offering himself as a competitor till he had as it were been forced by norman to do so he declared over and over again that norman would have been victorious had he stood his ground to the end and assured her that such was the general opinion through the whole establishment and this he did without talking much about himself or praising himself in any way when he did so his speech was wholly of his friend and of the sorrow that he felt that his friend should have been disappointed in his hopes  all this had its effects of normans rejected love they neither of them spoke each knew that the other must be aware of it but the subject was far too tender to be touched at any rate as yet and so matters went on and alaric regained the footing of favour which he had for a while lost with the mistress of the house  but there was one inmate of surbiton cottage who saw that though alaric spent so much of his tune with mrs woodward he found opportunity also for other private conversation and this was linda why was it that in the moments before they dressed for dinner alaric was whispering with gertrude and not with her why was it that alaric had felt it necessary to stay from church that sunday evening when gertrude also had been prevented from going by a headache he had remained he said in order that captain cuttwater might have company but linda was not slow to learn that uncle bat had been left to doze away the time by himself why on the following monday had gertrude been down so early and why had alaric been over from the inn full half an hour before his usual time linda saw and knew all this and was disgusted but even then she did not could not think that alaric could be untrue to her that her own sister would rob her of her lover it could not be that there should be such baseness in human nature  poor linda  and yet though she did not believe that such falseness could exist in this world of hers at surbiton cottage she could not restrain herself from complaining rather petulantly to her sister as they were going to bed on that sunday evening  i hope your headache is better she said in a tone of voice as near to irony as her soft nature could produce  yes it is quite well now said gertrude disdaining to notice the irony  i dare say alaric had a headache too i suppose one was about as bad as the other  linda said gertrude answering rather with dignity than with anger you ought to know by this time that it is not likely that i should plead false excuses alaric never said he had a headache  he said he stayed from church to be with uncle bat but when we came back we found him with you  uncle bat went to sleep and then he came into the drawingroom  the two girls said nothing more about it linda should have remembered that she had never breathed a word to her sister of alarics passion for herself gertrudes solemn propriety had deterred her just as she was about to do so how very little of that passion had alaric breathed himself and yet alas enough to fill the fond girls heart with dreams of love which occupied all her waking all her sleeping thoughts oh ye ruthless swains from whose unhallowed lips fall words full of poisoned honey do ye never think of the bitter agony of many months of the dull misery of many years of the cold monotony of an uncheered life which follow so often as the consequence of your short hour of pastime  on the monday morning as soon as alaric and charley had started for townit was the morning on which linda had been provoked to find that both gertrude and alaric had been up half an hour before they should have beengertrude followed her mother to her dressingroom and with palpitating heart closed the door behind her  linda remained downstairs putting away her tea and sugar not in the best of humours but katie according to her wont ran up after her mother  katie said gertrude as katie bounced into the room dearest katie i want to speak a word to mammaalone will you mind going down just for a few minutes and she put her arm round her sister and kissed her with almost unwonted tenderness  go katie dear said mrs woodward and katie speechless retired  gertrude has got something particular to tell mamma something that i may not hear i wonder what it is about said katie to her second sister  lindas heart sank within her could it be no it could not could not be that the sweet voice which had whispered in her ears those wellremembered words could have again whispered the same into other earsthat the very gertrude who had warned her not to listen to such words from such lips should have listened to them herself and have adopted them and made them her own it could not could not be and yet lindas heart sank low within her                                         if you really love him said the mother again caressing her eldest daughter as she acknowledged her love but hardly with such tenderness as when that daughter had repudiated that other loveif you really love him dearest of course i do not of course i cannot object  i do mamma i do  well then gertrude so be it i have not a word to say against your choice had i not believed him to be an excellent young man i should not have allowed him to be here with you so much as he has been we cannot all see with the same eyes dearest can we  no mamma but pray dont think i dislike poor harry and oh mamma pray dont set him against alaric because of this  set him against alaric no gertrude i certainly shall not do that but whether i can reconcile harry to it that is another thing  at any rate he has no right to be angry at it said gertrude assuming her air of dignity  certainly not with you gertrude  no nor with alaric said she almost with indignation  that depends on what has passed between them it is very hard to say how men so situated regard each other  i know everything that has passed between them said gertrude i never gave harry any encouragement as soon as i understood my own feelings i endeavoured to make him understand them also  but my dearest no one is blaming you  but you are blaming alaric  indeed i am not gertrude  no man could have behaved more honourably to his friend said gertrude no man more nobly and if harry does not feel it so he has not the good heart for which i always gave him credit  poor fellow his friendship for alaric will be greatly tried  and mamma has not alarics friendship been tried and has it not borne the trial nobly harry told him ofofof his intentions harry told him long long long ago  ah mepoor harry sighed mrs woodward  but you think nothing of alaric  alaric is successful my dear and can think sufficiently of himself mrs woodward was going to say but she stopped herself  harry told him all continued gertrude and alaricalaric said nothing of his own feelings alaric never said a word to me that he might not have said before his friendtilltillyou must own mamma that no one can have behaved more nobly than alaric has done  mrs woodward nevertheless had her own sentiments on the matter which were not quite in unison with those of her daughter but then she was not in love with alaric and her daughter was she thought that alarics love was a passion that had but lately come to the birth and that had he been true to his friendnobly true as gertrude had described himit would never have been born at all or at any rate not till harry had had a more prolonged chance of being successful with his suit mrs woodward understood human nature better than her daughter or at least flattered herself that she did so and she felt well assured that alaric had not been dying for love during the period of harrys unsuccessful courtship he might she thought have waited a little longer before he chose for his wife the girl whom his friend had loved seeing that he had been made the confidant of that love  such were the feelings which mrs woodward felt herself unable to repress but she could not refuse her consent to the marriage after all she had some slight twinge of conscience some inward conviction that she was prejudiced in harrys favour as her daughter was in alarics then she had lost all right to object to alaric by allowing him to be so constantly at the cottage and then again there was nothing to which in reason she could object in point of immediate income alaric was now the better match of the two she kissed her daughter therefore and promised that she would do her best to take alaric to her heart as her soninlaw  you will tell uncle bat mamma said gertrude  o yescertainly my dear of course hell be told but i suppose it does not make much matter immediately  i think he should be told mamma i should not like him to think that he was treated with anything like disrespect  very well my dear ill tell him said mrs woodward who was somewhat surprised at her daughters punctilious feelings about uncle bat however it was all very proper and she was glad to think that her children were inclined to treat their granduncle with respect in spite of his long nose  and then gertrude was preparing to leave the room but her mother stopped her gertrude dear said she  yes mamma  come here dearest shut the door gertrude have you told linda yet  no mamma not yet  as mrs woodward asked the question there was an indescribable look of painful emotion on her brow it did not escape gertrudes eye and was not to her perfectly unintelligible she had conceived an ideawhy she did not knowthat these recent tidings of hers would not be altogether agreeable to her sister  no mamma i have not told her of course i told you first but now i shall do so immediately  let me tell her said mrs woodward will you gertrude  oh certainly mamma if you wish it  things were going wrong with mrs woodward she had perceived with a mothers anxious eye that her second daughter was not indifferent to alaric tudor while she yet thought that norman and gertrude would have suited each other this had caused her no disquietude she herself had entertained none of those grand ideas to which gertrude had given utterance with so much sententiousness when she silenced lindas tale of love before the telling of it had been commenced mrs woodward had always felt sufficiently confident that alaric would push himself in the world and she would have made no objection to him as a soninlaw had he been contented to take the second instead of the first of her flock  she had never spoken to linda on the matter and linda had offered to her no confidence but she felt all but sure that her second child would not have entertained the affection which she had been unable altogether to conceal had no lovers plea been poured into her ears mrs woodward questioned her daughters but little but she understood well the nature of each and could nearly read their thoughts lindas thoughts it was not difficult to read  linda pet she said as soon as she could get linda into her room without absolutely sending for her you have not yet heard gertrudes news  no said linda turning very pale and feeling that her heart was like to burst  i would let no one tell you but myself linda come here dearest dont stand there away from me can you guess what it is  linda for a moment could not speak no mamma she said at last i dont know what it is  mrs woodward twined her arm round her daughters waist as they sat on the sofa close to each other linda tried to compose herself but she felt that she was trembling in her mothers arms she would have given anything to be calm anything to hide her secret she little guessed then how well her mother knew it her eyes were turned down and she found that she could not raise them to her mothers face  no mamma she said i dont knowwhat is it  gertrude is to be married linda she is engaged  i thought she refused harry said linda through whose mind a faint idea was passing of the cruelty of natures arrangements which gave all the lovers to her sister  yes dearest she did and now another has made an offershe has accepted him mrs woodward could hardly bring herself to speak out that which she had to say and yet she felt that she was only prolonging the torture for which she was so anxious to find a remedy  has she said linda on whom the full certainty of her misery had now all but come  she has accepted our dear alaric  our dear alaric what words for lindas ears they did reach her ears but they did not dwell thereher soft gentle nature sank beneath the sound her mother when she looked to her for a reply found that she was sinking through her arms linda had fainted  mrs woodward neither screamed nor rang for assistance nor emptied the waterjug over her daughter nor did anything else which would have the effect of revealing to the whole household the fact that linda had fainted she had seen girls faint before and was not frightened but how when linda recovered was she to be comforted  mrs woodward laid her gently on the sofa undid her dress loosened her stays and then sat by her chafing her hands and moistening her lips and temples till gradually the poor girls eyes reopened the recovery from a fainting fit a real fainting fit i beg young ladies to understand brings with it a most unpleasant sensation and for some minutes lindas sorrow was quelled by her sufferings but as she recovered her strength she remembered where she was and what had happened and sobbing violently she burst into an hysterical storm of tears  her most poignant feeling now was one of fear lest her mother should have guessed her secret and this mrs woodward well understood she could do nothing towards comforting her child till there was perfect confidence between them it was easy to arrive at this with linda nor would it afterwards be difficult to persuade her as to the course she ought to take the two girls were so essentially different the one so eager to stand alone and guide herself the other so prone to lean on the nearest support that came to her hand  it was not long before linda had told her mother everything either by words or tears or little signs of mute confession she made her mother understand with all but exactness what had passed between alaric and herself and quite exactly what had been the state of her own heart she sobbed and wept and looked up to her mother for forgiveness as though she had been guilty of a great sin and when her mother caressed her with all a mothers tenderness and told her that she was absolved from all fault free of all blame she was to a certain degree comforted whatever might now happen her mother would be on her side but mrs woodward when she looked into the matter found that it was she that should have demanded pardon of her daughter not her daughter of her why had this tender lamb been allowed to wander out of the fold while a wolf in sheeps clothing was invited into the pastureground  gertrude with her talent her beauty and dignity of demeanour had hitherto been perhaps the closest to the mothers hearthad been if not the most cherished yet the most valued gertrude had been the apple of her eye this should be altered now if a mothers love could atone for a mothers negligence mrs woodward would atone to her child for this hour of misery and katieher sweet bonny katieshe at least should be protected from the wolves those were the thoughts that passed through mrs woodwards heart as she sat there caressing linda but how were things to be managed now at the present moment it was quite clear that the wolf in sheeps clothing must be admitted into the pastoral family either that or the fairest lamb of the flock must be turned out altogether to take upon herself lupine nature and roam the woods a beast of prey as matters stood it behoved them to make such a sheep of alaric as might be found practicable  and so mrs woodward set to work to teach her daughter how best she might conduct herself in her present state of wretchedness she had to bear with her sisters success to listen to her sisters joy to enter into all her future plans to assist at her toilet to prepare her wedding garments to hear the congratulations of friends and take a sisters share in a sisters triumph and to do this without once giving vent to a reproach and she had worse than this to do she had to encounter alaric and to wish him joy of his bride she had to protect her female pride from the disgrace which a hopeless but acknowledged love would throw on it she had to live in the house with alaric as though he were her brother and as though she had never thought to live with him in any nearer tie she would have to stand at the altar as her sisters bridesmaid and see them married and she would have to smile and be cheerful as she did so  this was the lesson which mrs woodward had now to teach her daughter and she so taught it that linda did all that circumstances and her mother required of her late on that afternoon she went to gertrude and kissing her wished her joy at that moment gertrude was the more embarrassed of the two  linda dear linda she said embracing her sister convulsively  i hope you will be happy gertrude with all my heart said linda and so she relinquished her lover  we talk about the weakness of womenand linda woodward was in many a way weak enoughbut what man what giant has strength equal to this it was not that her love was feeble her heart was capable of truest love and she had loved alaric truly but she had that within her which enabled her to overcome herself and put her own heart and hopes and happinessall but her maiden prideinto the background when the hopes and happiness of another required it  she still shared the same room with her sister and those who know how completely absorbed a girl is by her first acknowledged love may imagine how many questions she had to answer to how many propositions she was called to assent for how many schemes she had to vouchsafe a sisters interest while her heart was telling her that she should have been the questioner she should have been the proposer that the schemes should all have been her own  but she bore it bravely when alaric first came down which he did in the middle of the week she was as she told her mother too weak to stand in his presence her mother strongly advised her not to absent herself so she sat gently by while he kissed mrs woodward and katie she sat and trembled for her turn she knew must come it did come alaric with an assurance which told more for his courage than for his heart came up to her and with a smiling face offered her his hand she rose up and muttered some words which she had prepared for the occasion and he still holding her by the hand stooped down and kissed her cheek mrs woodward looked on with an angry flush on her brow and hated him for his coldhearted propriety of demeanour  linda went up to her mothers room and sitting on her mothers bed sobbed herself into tranquillity  it was very grievous to mrs woodward to have to welcome alaric to her house for alarics own sake she would no longer have troubled herself to do so but gertrude was still her daughter her dear child gertrude had done nothing to disentitle her to a childs part and a childs protection and even had she done so mrs woodward was not a woman to be unforgiving to her child for gertrudes sake she had to make alaric welcome she forced herself to smile on him and call him her son to make him more at home in her house even than harry had ever been to give him privileges which he wolf as he was had so little deserved  but captain cuttwater made up by the warmth of his congratulations for any involuntary coolness which alaric might have detected in those of mrs woodward it had become a strong wish of the old mans heart that he might make alaric at any rate in part his heir without doing an injustice to his niece or her family he had soon seen and appreciated what he had called the gumption both of gertrude and alaric had harry married gertrude and alaric linda he would have regarded either of those matches with disfavour but now he was quite satisfiednow he could look on alaric as his son and gertrude as his daughter and use his money according to his fancy without incurring the reproaches of his conscience  quite right my boy he said to alaric slapping him on the back at the same time with pretty nearly all his powerquite right didnt i know you were the winning horsedidnt i tell you how it would be do you think i dont know what gumption means if i had not had my own weathereye open aye and d wide open the most of my time i shouldnt have two or three thousand pounds to give away now to any young fellow that i take a fancy to  alaric was of course all smiles and good humour and gertrude not less so the day after he heard of the engagement uncle bat went to town and on his return he gave gertrude £100 to buy her weddingclothes and half that sum to her mother in order that the thing might go off as he expressed himself slipslap and no mistake to linda he gave nothing but promised her that he would not forget her when her time came  all this time norman was at normansgrove but there were three of the party who felt that it behoved them to let him know what was going on mrs woodward wrote first and on the following day both gertrude and alaric wrote to him the former from hampton and the latter from his office in london  all these letters were much laboured but with all this labour not one of them contained within it a grain of comfort that from mrs woodward came first and told the tale strange to say though harry had studiously rejected from his mind all idea of hope as regarded gertrude nevertheless the first tidings of her betrothal with alaric struck him as though he had still fancied himself a favoured lover he felt as though in his absence he had been robbed of a prize which was all his own as though a chattel had been taken from him to which he had a full right as though all the hampton party mrs woodward included were in a conspiracy to defraud him the moment his back was turned  the blow was so severe that it laid him prostrate at once he could not sob away his sorrow on his mothers bosom no one could teach him how to bear his grief with meek resignation he had never spoken of his love to his friends at normansgrove they had all been witnesses to his deep disappointment but that had been attributed to his failure at his office he was not a man to seek for sympathy in the sorrows of his heart he had told alaric of his rejection because he had already told him of his love but he had whispered no word of it to anyone besides on the day on which he received mrs woodwards letter he appeared at dinner ghastly pale and evidently so ill as to be all but unable to sit at table but he would say nothing to anybody he sat brooding over his grief till he was unable to sit any longer  and yet mrs woodward had written with all her skill with all her heart striving to pluck the sting away from the tidings which she had to communicate she had felt however that she owed as much at least to her daughter as she did to him and she failed to call alaric perjured false dishonoured unjust disgraced and treacherous nothing short of her doing so would have been deemed by norman fitting mention of tudors sin nothing else would have satisfied the fury of his wrath  on the next morning he received gertrudes letter and alarics the latter he never readhe opened it saw that it began as usual my dear harry and then crammed it into his pocket by return of post it went back under a blank cover addressed to alaric at the weights and measures the days of duelling were gone byunfortunately as norman now thought but nothing he determined should ever induce him again to hold friendly intercourse with the traitor he abstained from making any such oath as to the woodwards but determined that his conduct in that respect should be governed by the manner in which alaric was received by them  but gertrudes letter he read over and over again and each time he did so he indulged in a fresh burst of hatred against the man who had deceived him a dishonest villain he said to himself over and over again what right had i to suppose he would be true to me when i found that he had been so false to others  dearest harry the letter began dearest harrywhy should she begin with a lie he was not dearest you must not must not must not be angry with alaric she went on to say as soon as she had told her tale oh must he not not be angry with alaric not angry with the man who had forgotten every law of honour every principle of honesty every tie of friendship not angry with the man whom he had trusted with the key of his treasure and who had then robbed him who had stolen from him all his contentment all his joy his very hearts blood not angry with him  our happiness will never be perfect unless you will consent to share it thus simply in the affection of her heart had gertrude concluded the letter by which she intended to pour balm into the wounds of her rejected lover and pave the way for the smoothing of such difficulties as might still lie in the way of her love  their happiness would not be perfect unless he would consent to share it every word in the sentence was gall to him it must have been written with the object of lacerating his wounds and torturing his spirit so at least said norman to himself he read the letter over and over again at one time he resolved to keep it till he could thrust it back into her hand and prove to her of what cruelty she had been guilty then he thought of sending it to mrs woodward and asking her how after that could she think that he should ever again enter her doors at hampton finally he tore it into a thousand bits and threw them behind the fire  share their happiness and as he repeated the words he gave the last tear to the fragments of paper which he still held in his hand could he at that moment as easily have torn to shreds all hope of earthly joys for those two lovers he would then have done it and cast the ruins to the flames  oh what a lesson he might have learnt from linda and yet what were his injuries to hers he in fact had not been injured at least not by him against whom the strength of his wrath most fiercely raged the two men had both admired gertrude but norman had started on the race first before alaric had had time to know his own mind he had learnt that norman claimed the beauty as his own he had acknowledged to himself that norman had a right to do so and had scrupulously abstained from interfering with him why should norman like a dog in the manger begrudge to his friend the fodder which he himself could not enjoy to him at any rate alaric had in this been no traitor twas thus at least that gertrude argued in her heart and twas thus that mrs woodward tried to argue also  but who could excuse alarics falseness to linda and yet linda had forgiven him    chapter xv  norman returns to town   harry norman made no answer to either of his three letters beyond that of sending alarics back unread but this without other reply was sufficient to let them all guess nearly with accuracy what was the state of his mind alaric told gertrude how his missive had been treated and gertrude of course told her mother  there was very little of that joy at surbiton cottage which should have been the forerunner of a wedding none of the woodward circle were content thus to lose their friend and then their unhappiness on this score was augmented by hearing that harry had sent up a medical certificate instead of returning to his duties when his prolonged leave of absence was expired  to alaric this at the moment was a relief he had dreaded the return of norman to london there were so many things to cause infinite pain to them both all normans things his books and clothes his desks and papers and pictures his whips and sticks and all those sundry belongings which even a bachelor collects around himwere strewing the rooms in which alaric still lived he had of course felt that it was impossible that they should ever again reside together not only must they quarrel but all the men at their office must know that they had quarrelled and yet some intercourse must be maintained between them they must daily meet in the rooms at the weights and measures and it would now in their altered position become necessary that in some things norman should receive instructions from alaric as his superior officer but if alaric thought of this often so did norman and before the last fortnight had expired the thinking of it had made him so ill that his immediate return to london was out of the question  mrs woodwards heart melted within her when she heard that harry was really ill she had gone on waiting day after day for an answer to her letter but no answer came no answer came but in lieu thereof she heard that harry was laid up at normansgrove she heard it and gertrude heard it and in spite of the coming wedding there was very little joy at surbiton cottage  and then mrs woodward wrote again and a man must have had a heart of stone not to be moved by such a letter she had heard she said that he was ill and the tidings had made her wretchedthe more so inasmuch as he had sent no answer to her last letter was he very ill was he dangerously ill she hoped she would fain hope that his illness had not arisen from any mental grief if he did not reply to this or get some of his family to do so there would be nothing for her but to go herself to normansgrove she could not remain quiet while she was left in such painful doubt about her dearest wellloved harry norman how to speak of gertrude or how not to speak of her mrs woodward knew notat last she added the three girls send their kindest love they are all as wretchedly anxious as i am i know you are too good to wish that poor gertrude should suffer but if you did you might have your wish the tidings of your illness together with your silence have robbed her of all her happiness and it ended thusdearest harry do not be cruel to us our hearts are all with you  this was too much for normans sternness and he relented at least as far as mrs woodward was concerned he wrote to say that though he was still weak he was not dangerously ill and that he intended if nothing occurred amiss to be in town about the end of the year he hoped he might then see her to thank her for all her kindness she would understand that he could not go down to surbiton cottage but as she would doubtless have some occasion for coming up to town they might thus contrive to meet he then sent his love to linda and katie and ended by saying that he had written to charley tudor to take lodgings for him not the slightest allusion was made either to gertrude or alaric except that which might seem to be conveyed in the intimation that he could make no more visits to hampton  this letter was very cold it just permitted mrs woodward to know that norman did not regard them all as strangers and that was all linda said it was very sad and gertrude said not to her mother but to alaric that it was heartless captain cuttwater predicted that he would soon come round and be as sound as a roach again in six months time alaric said nothing but he went on with his wooing and this he did so successfully as to make gertrude painfully alive to what would have been in her eyes the inferiority of her lot had she unfortunately allowed herself to become the victim of normans love  alaric went on with his wooing and he also went on with his sharebuying undy scott had returned to town for a week or two to wind up the affairs of his expiring secretaryship and he made alaric understand that a nice thing might yet be done in mary janes alaric had been very foolish to sell so quickly so at least said undy to this alaric replied that he had bought the shares thoughtlessly and had felt a desire to get rid of them as quickly as he could those were scruples at which undy laughed pleasantly and alaric soon laughed with him  at any rate said undy your report is written and off your hands now so you may do what you please in the matter like a free man with a safe conscience  alaric supposed that he might  i am as fond of the civil service as any man said undy just as fond of it as sir gregory himself i have been in it and may be in it again if i do i shall do my duty but i have no idea of having my hands tied my purse is my own to do what i like with it whether i buy beef or mutton or shares in cornwall is nothing to anyone i give the crown what it pays for my five or six hours a day and nothing more when i was appointed private secretary to the first lord of the stannaries i told my friend whip vigil that those were the terms on which i accepted office and vigil agreed with me alaric pupil as he was to the great sir gregory declared that he also agreed with him that is not sir gregorys doctrine but its mine said undy and though its my own i think it by far the honester doctrine of the two  alaric did not sift the matter very deeply nor did he ask undy or himself either whether in using the contents of his purse in the purchase of shares he would be justified in turning to his own purpose any information which he might obtain in his official career nor did he again offer to put that broad test to himself which he had before proposed and ask himself whether he would dare to talk of what he was doing in the face of day in his own office before sir gregory or before the neverbends of the service he had already learnt the absurdity of such tests did other men talk of such doings was it not notorious that the world speculated and that the world was generally silent in the matter why should he attempt to be wiser than those around him was it not sufficient for him to be wise in his generation what man had ever become great who allowed himself to be impeded by small scruples if the sportsman returned from the field laden with game who would scrutinize the mud on his gaiters excelsior said alaric to himself with a proud ambition and so he attempted to rise by the purchase and sale of mining shares  when he was fairly engaged in the sport his style of play so fascinated undy that they embarked in a sort of partnership pro hoc vice good to the last during the ups and downs of wheal mary jane mary jane no doubt would soon run dry or else be drowned as had happened to new friendship but in the meantime something might be done  of course youll be consulted about those other papers said undy it might be as well they should be kept back for a week or two  well ill see said alaric and as he said it he felt that his face was tinged with a blush of shame but what then who would look at the dirt on his gaiters if he filled his bag with game  mrs woodward was no whit angered by the coldness of normans letter she wished that he could have brought himself to write in a different style but she remembered his grief and knew that as time should work its cure upon it he would come round and again be gentle and affectionate at any rate with her  she misdoubted charleys judgement in the choice of lodgings and therefore she talked over the matter with alaric it was at last decided that he alaric should move instead of driving norman away his final movement would soon take place that movement which would rob him of the freedom of lodginghood and invest him with all the ponderous responsibility and close restraint of a householder he and gertrude were to be married in february and after spending a cold honeymoon in paris and brussels were to begin their married life amidst the sharp winds of a london march but love gratified love will we believe keep out even an english east wind if so it is certainly the only thing that will  charley therefore wrote to norman telling him that he could remain in his old home and humbly asking permission to remain there with him to this request he received a kind rejoinder in the affirmative though charley was related to alaric there had always apparently been a closer friendship between him and norman than between the two cousins and now in his fierce unbridled quarrel with alaric and in his present coolness with the woodwards he seemed to turn to charley with more than ordinary affection  norman made his appearance at the office on the first monday of the new year he had hitherto sat at the same desk with alaric each of them occupying one side of it on his return he found himself opposite to a stranger alaric had of course been promoted to a room of his own  the weights and measures had never been a noisy office but now it became more silent than ever men there talked but little at any time and now they seemed to cease from talking altogether it was known to all that the damon and pythias of the establishment were damon and pythias no longer that war waged between them and that if all accounts were true they were ready to fly each at the others throat some attributed this to the competitive examination others said it was love others declared that it was money the root of evil and one rash young gentleman stated his positive knowledge that it was all three at any rate something dreadful was expected and men sat anxious at their desks fearing the coming evil  on the monday the two men did not meet nor on the tuesday on the next morning alaric having acknowledged to himself the necessity of breaking the ice walked into the room where norman sat with three or four others it was absolutely necessary that he should make some arrangement with him as to a certain branch of officework and though it was competent for him as the superior to have sent for norman as the inferior he thought it best to abstain from doing so even though he were thereby obliged to face his enemy for the first time in the presence of others  well mr embryo said he speaking to the new junior and standing with his back to the fire in an easy way as though there was nothing wrong under the sun or at least nothing at the weights and measures well mr embryo how do you get on with those calculations  pretty well i believe sir i think i begin to understand them now said the tyro producing for alarics gratification five or six folio sheets covered with intricate masses of figures  ah yes that will do very well said alaric taking up one of the sheets and looking at it with an assumed air of great interest though he acted his part pretty well his mind was very far removed from mr embryos efforts  norman sat at his desk as black as a thundercloud with his eyes turned intently at the paper before him but so agitated that he could not even pretend to write  by the by norman said alaric when will it suit you to look through those scotch papers with me  my name sir is mr norman said harry getting up and standing by his chair with all the firmness of a paladin of old  with all my heart said alaric in speaking to you i can have but one wish and that is to do so in any way that may best please you  any instructions you may have to give i will attend to as far as my duty goes said norman  and then alaric pushing mr embryo from his chair without much ceremony sat down opposite to his former friend and said and did what he had to say and do with an easy unaffected air in which there was at any rate none of the usual superciliousness of a neophytes authority norman was too agitated to speak reasonably or to listen calmly but alaric knew that though he might not do so today he would tomorrow or if not tomorrow then the next day and so from day to day he came into normans room and transacted his business mr embryo got accustomed to looking through the window at the council office for the ten minutes that he remained there and norman also became reconciled to the custom and thus though they never met in any other way they daily had a kind of intercourse with each other which at last contrived to get itself arranged into a certain amount of civility on both sides  immediately that normans arrival was heard of at surbiton cottage mrs woodward hastened up to town to see him she wrote to him to say that she would be at his lodgings at a certain hour and begged him to come thither to her of course he did not refuse and so they met mrs woodward had much doubted whether or no she would take linda or katie with her but at last she resolved to go alone harry she thought would be more willing to speak freely to her to open his heart to her if there were nobody by but herself  their meeting was very touching and characteristic of the two persons mrs woodward was sad enough but her sadness was accompanied by a strength of affection that carried before it every obstacle norman was also sad but he was at first stern and cold and would have remained so to the last had not his manly anger been overpowered by her feminine tenderness  it was singular but not the less true that at this period norman appeared to have forgotten altogether that he had ever proposed to gertrude and been rejected by her all that he said and all that he thought was exactly what he might have said and thought had alaric taken from him his affianced bride no suitor had ever felt his suit to be more hopeless than he had done and yet he now regarded himself as one whose high hopes of happy love had all been destroyed by the treachery of a friend and the fickleness of a woman  this made the task of appeasing him very difficult to mrs woodward she could not in plain language remind him that he had been plainly rejected nor could she on the other hand permit her daughter to be branded with a fault of which she had never been guilty  mrs woodward had wished though she had hardly hoped so to mollify norman as to induce him to promise to be at the wedding but she soon found that this was out of the question there was no mitigating his anger against alaric  mrs woodward said he standing very upright and looking very stiff i will never again willingly put myself in any position where i must meet him  oh harry dont say sothink of your close friendship think of your long friendship  why did he not think of it  but harryif not for his sake if not for your own at any rate do so for ours for my sake for katies and lindas for gertrudes sake  i had rather not speak of gertrude mrs woodward  ah harry gertrude has done you no injury why should you thus turn your heart against her you should not blame her if you have anyone to blame it is me  no you have been true to me  and has she been false oh harry think how we have loved you you should be more just to us  tush he said i do not believe in justice there is no justice left i would have given everything i had for him i would have made any sacrifice his happiness was as much my thought as my own and nowand yet you talk to me of justice  and if he had injured you harry would you not forgive him do you repeat your prayers without thinking of them do you not wish to forgive them that trespass against you norman groaned inwardly in the spirit do you not think of this when you kneel every night before your god  there are injuries which a man cannot forgive is not expected to forgive  are there harry oh that is a dangerous doctrine in that way every man might nurse his own wrath till anger would make devils of us all our saviour has made no exceptions  in one sense i do forgive him mrs woodward i wish him no evil but it is impossible that i should call a man who has so injured me my friend i look upon him as disgraced for ever  she then endeavoured to persuade him to see gertrude or at any rate to send his love to her but in this also he was obdurate it could he said do no good he could not answer for himself that his feelings would not betray him a message would be of no use if true it would not be gracious if false it had better be avoided he was quite sure gertrude would be indifferent as to any message from him the best thing for them both would be that they should forget each other  he promised however that he would go down to hampton immediately after the marriage and he sent his kindest love to linda and katie and dear mrs woodward said he i know you think me very harsh i know you think me vindictivebut pray pray believe that i understand all your love and acknowledge all your goodness the time will perhaps come when we shall be as happy together as we once were  mrs woodward trying to smile through her tears could only say that she would pray that that time might soon come and so bidding god bless him as a mother might bless her child she left him and returned to hampton not with a light heart    chapter xvi  the first wedding   in spite however of norman and his anger on a cold snowy morning in the month of february gertrude stood at the altar in hampton church a happy trusting bride and linda stood smiling behind her the lovely leader of the nuptial train nor were lindas smiles false or forced much less treacherous she had taught herself to look on alaric as her sisters husband and though in doing so she had suffered and did still suffer she now thought of her own lost lover in no other guise  a housemaid not long since who was known in the family in which she lived to be affianced to a neighbouring gardener came weeping to her mistress  oh maam  why susan what ails you  oh maam  well susanwhat is itwhy are you crying  oh maamjohn  wellwhat of john i hope he is not misbehaving  indeed maam he is then the worst of misbehaviour for hes gone and got hisself married and poor susan gave vent to a flood of tears  her mistress tried to comfort her and not in vain she told her that probably she might be better as she was that john seeing what he had done must be a false creature who would undoubtedly have used her ill and she ended her good counsel by trying to make susan understand that there were still as good fish in the sea as had ever yet been caught out of it  and thats true too maam said susan with her apron to her eyes  then you should not be downhearted you know  nor i hant downarted maam for thank god i could love any man but its the looks on it maam its that i mind  how many of us are there women and men too who think most of the looks of it under such circumstances and who were we as honest as poor susan ought to thank god as she did that we can love anyone anyone that is of the other sex we are not all of us susceptible of being torn to tatters by an unhappy passion not even all those of us who may be susceptible of a true and honest love and it is well that it is so it is one of gods mercies and if we were as wise as susan we should thank god for it  linda was perhaps one of those she was good affectionate tender and true but she was made of that stuff which can bend to the north wind the world was not all over with her because a man had been untrue to her she had had her grief and had been told to meet it like a christian she had been obedient to the telling and now felt the good result so when gertrude was married she stood smiling behind her and when her new brotherinlaw kissed her in the vestryroom she smiled again and honestly wished them happiness  and katie was there very pretty and bonny still childish with her short dress and long trousers but looking as though she too would soon feel the strength of her own wings and be able to fly away from her mothers nest dear katie her story has yet to be told to her belongs neither the soft easiness of her sister linda nor the sterner dignity of gertrude but she has a character of her own which contains perhaps higher qualities than those given to either of her sisters  and there were other bridesmaids there how many it boots not now to say we must have the spaces round our altars greatly widened if this passion for bevies of attendant nymphs be allowed to go on increasingand if crinolines increase also if every bride is to have twelve maidens and each maiden to stand on no less than a twelveyard circle what modest temple will ever suffice for a sacrifice to hymen  and mrs woodward was there of course as pretty to my thinking as either of her daughters or any of the bridesmaids she was very pretty and smiling and quiet but when gertrude said i will she was thinking of harry norman and grieving that he was not there  and captain cuttwater was there radiant in a new blue coat made specially for the occasion and elastic with true joy he had been very generous he had given £1000 to alaric and settled £150 a year on gertrude payable of course after his death this indeed was the bulk of what he had to give and mrs woodward had seen with regret his exuberant munificence to one of her children but gertrude was her child and of course she could not complain  and charley was there acting as best man it was just the place and just the work for charley he forgot all his difficulties all his duns and also all his town delights without a sigh he left his lady in norfolk street to mix ginsling for other admirers and felt no regret though four brother navvies were going to make a stunning night of it at the salon de seville dansant at the bottom of holborn hill however he had his hopes that he might be back in time for some of that fun  and undy scott was there he and alaric had fraternized so greatly of late that the latter had as a matter of course asked him to his wedding and mrs woodward had of course expressed her delight at receiving alarics friend undy also was a pleasant fellow for a wedding party he was full of talk fond of ladies being no whit abashed in his attendance on them by the remembrance of his bosoms mistress whom he had left let us hope happy in her far domestic retirement undy scott was a good man at a wedding and made himself specially agreeable on this occasion  but the great glory of the day was the presence of sir gregory hardlines it was a high honour considering all that rested on sir gregorys shoulders for so great a man to come all the way down to hampton to see a clerk in the weights and measures married    cum tot sustineas et tanta negotia solus  for we may call it solus sir warwick and mr jobbles being sources of more plague than profit in carrying out your noble schemeswhile so many things are on your shoulders sir gregory while you are defending the civil service by your pen adorning it by your conduct perfecting it by new rules how could any man have had the face to ask you to a wedding  nevertheless sir gregory was there and did not lose the excellent opportunity which a speech at the breakfasttable afforded him for expressing his opinion on the civil service of his country  and so gertrude woodward became gertrude tudor and she and alaric were whirled away by a postchaise and postboy done out with white bows to the hampton court station from thence they whisked up to london and then down to dover and there we will leave them  they were whisked away having first duly gone through the amount of badgering which the bride and bridegroom have to suffer at the wedding breakfasttable they drank their own health in champagne alaric made a speech in which he said he was quite unworthy of his present happiness and gertrude picked up all the bijoux gold pencilcases and silver creamjugs which were thrown at her from all sides all the men made speeches and all the women laughed but the speech of the day was that celebrated one made by sir gregory in which he gave a sketch of alaric tudor as the beau idéal of a clerk in the civil service his heart said he energetically is at the weights and measures but gertrude looked at him as though she did not believe a word of it  and so alaric and gertrude were whisked away and the wedding guests were left to look sheepish at each other and take themselves off as best they might sir gregory of course had important public business which precluded him from having the gratification of prolonging his stay at hampton charley got away in perfect time to enjoy whatever there might be to be enjoyed at the dancing saloon of seville and undy scott returned to his club  then all was again quiet at surbiton cottage captain cuttwater who had perhaps drunk the brides health once too often went to sleep katie having taken off her fine clothes roamed about the house disconsolate and mrs woodward and linda betook themselves to their needles  the tudors went to brussels and were made welcome by the belgian banker whose counters he had deserted so much to his own benefit and from thence to paris and having been there long enough to buy a french bonnet and wonder at the enormity of french prices they returned to a small but comfortable house they had prepared for themselves in the neighbourhood of westbourne terrace  previous to this norman had been once and but once at hampton and when there he had failed in being comfortable himself or in making the woodwards so he could not revert to his old habits or sit or move or walk as though nothing special had happened since he had been last there he could not talk about gertrude and he could not help talking of her by some closer packing among the ladies a room had now been prepared for him in the house even this upset him and brought to his mind all those unpleasant thoughts which he should have endeavoured to avoid  he did not repeat his visit before the tudors returned and then for some time he was prevented from doing so by the movements of the woodwards themselves mrs woodward paid a visit to her married daughter and when she returned linda did the same and so for a while norman was as it were divided from his old friends whereas tudor as a matter of course was one of themselves  it was only natural that mrs woodward should forgive alaric and receive him to her bosom now that he was her soninlaw after all such ties as these avail more than any predilections more than any effort of judgement in the choice of the objects of our affections we associate with those with whom the tenor of life has thrown us and from habit we learn to love those with whom we are brought to associate    chapter xvii  the honourable mrs val and miss golightly   the first eighteen months of gertrudes married life were not unhappy though like all persons entering on the realities of the world she found much to disappoint her at first her husbands society was sufficient for her and to give him his due he was not at first an inattentive husband then came the baby bringing with him as first babies always should do a sort of second honeymoon of love and a renewal of those services which women so delight to receive from their bosoms lord  she had of course made acquaintances since she had settled herself in london and had in her modest way done her little part in adding to the gaiety of the great metropolis in this respect indeed alarics commencement of life had somewhat frightened mrs woodward and the more prudent of his friends grand as his official promotion had been his official income at the time of his marriage did not exceed £600 a year and though this was to be augmented occasionally till it reached £800 yet even with this advantage it could hardly suffice for a man and his wife and a coming family to live in an expensive part of london and enable him to see his friends occasionally as the act of feeding ones acquaintance is now generally called  gertrude like most english girls of her age was at first so ignorant about money that she hardly knew whether £600 was or was not a sufficient income to justify their present mode of living but she soon found reason to suspect that her husband at any rate endeavoured to increase it by other means we say to suspect because he never spoke to her on the subject he never told her of mary janes and new friendships or hinted that he had extensive money dealings in connexion with undy scott  but it can be taken for granted that no husband can carry on such dealings long without some sort of cognizance on his wifes part as to what he is doing a woman who is not trusted by her lord may choose to remain in apparent darkness may abstain from questions and may consider it either her duty or her interest to assume an ignorance as to her husbands affairs but the partner of ones bed and board the minister who soothes ones headaches and makes ones tea and looks after ones linen cant but have the means of guessing the thoughts which occupy her companions mind and occasionally darken his brow  much of gertrudes society had consisted of that into which alaric was thrown by his friendship with undy scott there was a brother of undys living in town one valentine scotta captain in a cavalry regiment and whose wife was by no means of that delightfully retiring disposition evinced by undys better half the hon mrs valentine or mrs val scott as she was commonly called was a very pushing woman and pushed herself into a prominent place among gertrudes friends she had been the widow of jonathan golightly esq umquhile sheriff of the city of london and stockbroker and when she gave herself and her jointure up to captain val she also brought with her to enliven the house a daughter clementina the only remaining pledge of her love for the stockbroker  when val scott entered the world his fathers precepts as to the purposes of matrimony were deeply graven on his heart he was the best looking of the family and except undy the youngest he had not undys sharpness his talent for public matters or his aptitude for the higher branches of the civil service but he had wit to wear his sash and epaulets with an easy grace and to captivate the heart person and some portion of the purse of the widow golightly the lady was ten years older than the gentleman but then she had a thousand a year and to make matters more pleasant the beauteous clementina had a fortune of her own  under these circumstances the marriage had been contracted without any deceit or attempt at deceit by either party val wanted an income and the sheriffs widow wanted the utmost amount of social consideration which her not very extensive means would purchase for her on the whole the two parties to the transaction were contented with their bargain mrs val it is true kept her income very much in her own hands but still she consented to pay vals tailors bills and it is something for a man to have bed and board found him for nothing it is true again the lady did not find that the noble blood of her husband gave her an immediate right of entry into the best houses in london but it did bring her into some sort of contact with some few people of rank and fame and being a sensible woman she had not been unreasonable in her expectations  when she had got what she could from her husband in this particular she did not trouble him much further he delighted in the rag and there spent the most of his time happily she delighted in what she called the charms of society and as society expanded itself before her she was also we must suppose happy she soon perceived that more in her immediate line was to be obtained from undy than from her own member of the gaberlunzie family and hence had sprung up her intimacy with mrs tudor  it cannot be said that gertrude was very fond of the honourable mrs val nor even of her daughter clementina golightly who was more of her own age these people had become her friends from the force of circumstances and not from predilection to tell the truth mrs val who had in her day encountered with much patience a good deal of snubbing and who had had to be thankful when she was patronized now felt that her day for being a great lady had come and that it behoved her to patronize others she tried her hand upon gertrude and found the practice so congenial to her spirits so pleasantly stimulating so well adapted to afford a gratifying compensation for her former humility that she continued to give up a good deal of her time to no 5 albany row westbourne terrace at which house the tudors resided  the young bride was not exactly the woman to submit quietly to patronage from any mrs val however honourable she might be but for a while gertrude hardly knew what it meant and at her first outset the natural modesty of youth and her inexperience in her new position made her unwilling to take offence and unequal to rebellion by degrees however this feeling of humility wore off she began to be aware of the assumed superiority of mrs vals friendship and by the time that their mutual affection was of a years standing gertrude had determined in a quiet way without saying anything to anybody to put herself on a footing of more perfect equality with the honourable mrs val  clementina golightly was in the common parlance of a large portion of mankind a doosed fine gal she stood five feet six and stood very well on very good legs but with rather large feet she was as straight as a grenadier and had it been her fate to carry a milkpail she would have carried it to perfection instead of this however she was permitted to expend an equal amount of energy in every variation of waltz and polka that the ingenuity of the dancing professors of the age has been able to produce waltzes and polkas suited her admirably for she was gifted with excellent lungs and perfect powers of breathing and she had not much delight in prolonged conversation her fault if she had one was a predilection for flirting but she did her flirtations in a silent sort of way much as we may suppose the fishes do theirs whose amours we may presume to consist in swimming through their cool element in close contiguity with each other a feast of reason and a flow of soul were not the charms by which clementina golightly essayed to keep her admirers spellbound at her feet to whirl rapidly round a room at the rate of ten miles an hour with her right hand outstretched in the grasp of her partners and to know that she was tightly buoyed up like a horse by a bearingrein by his other hand behind her back was for her sufficient to do this as she did do it without ever crying for mercy with no slackness of breath and apparently without distress must have taken as much training as a horse gets for a race but the training had in nowise injured her and now having gone through her gallops and run all her heats for three successive seasons she was still sound of wind and limb and fit to run at any moment when called upon  we have said nothing about the face of the beauteous clementina and indeed nothing can be said about it there was no feature in it with which a man could have any right to find fault that she was a doosed fine girl was a fact generally admitted but nevertheless you might look at her for four hours consecutively on a monday evening and yet on tuesday you would not know her she had hair which was brownish and sufficiently silkyand which she wore as all other such girls do propped out on each side of her face by thick round velvet pads which when the waltzing pace became exhilarating occasionally showed themselves looking greasy she had a pair of eyes set straight in her head faultless in form and perfectly inexpressive she had a nose equally straight but perhaps a little too coarse in dimensions she had a mouth not over large with two thin lips and small whitish teeth and she had a chin equal in contour to the rest of her face but on which venus had not deigned to set a dimple nature might have defied a french passport officer to give a description of her by which even her own mother or a detective policeman might have recognized her  when to the above list of attractions it is added that clementina golightly had £20000 of her own and a reversionary interest in her mothers jointure it may be imagined that she did not want for goodwinded cavaliers to bear her up behind and whirl around with her with outstretched hands  i am not going to stay a moment my dear said mrs val seating herself on gertrudes sofa having rushed up almost unannounced into the drawingroom followed by clementina indeed lady howlaway is waiting for me this moment but i must settle with you about the june flowershow  oh thank you mrs scott dont trouble yourself about me said gertrude i dont think i shall go  oh nonsense my dear of course youll go its the show of the year and the grand duke is to be therebaby is all right now you know i must not hear of your not going  all the samei fear i must decline said gertrude i think i shall be at hampton  oh nonsense my dear of course you must show yourself people will say all manner of things else clementina has promised to meet victoire jaquêtanápes there and a party of french people people of the very highest ton youll be delighted my dear  m jaquêtanápes is the most delicious polkist you ever met said clementina he has got a new back step that will quite amaze you as gertrude in her present condition was not much given to polkas this temptation did not have great effect  oh you must come of course my dearand pray let me recommend you to go to madame bosconi for your bonnet she has such darling little ducks and as cheap as dirt but i want you to arrange about the carriage you can do that with mr tudor and i can settle with you afterwards captain scott wont go of course but i have no doubt undecimus and mr tudor will come later and bring us home we can manage very well with the one carriage  in spite of her thousand a year the honourable mrs val was not ashamed to look after the pounds shillings and pence and so having made her arrangements mrs val took herself off hurrying to appease the anger of lady howlaway and followed by clementina who since her little outburst as to the new back step of m jaquêtanápes had not taken much part in the conversation  flowershows are a great resource for the mrs scotts of london life they are open to ladies who cannot quite penetrate the inner sancta of fashionable life and yet they are frequented by those to whom those sancta are everyday household walks there at least the mrs scotts of the outer world can show themselves in close contiguity and on equal terms with the mrs scotts of the inner world and then who is to know the difference if also one is an honourable mrs scott and can contrive to appear as such in the next days morning post may not one fairly boast that the ends of society have been attained where is the citadel how is one to know when one has taken it  gertrude could not be quite so defiant with her friends as she would have wished to have been as they were borne with and encouraged by her husband of undys wife alaric saw nothing and heard little but it suited undy to make use of his sisterinlaws house and it suited alaric to be intimate with undys sisterinlaw moreover had not clementina golightly £20000 and was she not a doosed fine girl this was nothing to alaric now and might not be considered to be much to undy but that farseeing acute financier knew that there were other means of handling a ladys money than that of marrying her he could not at present acquire a second fortune in that way but he might perhaps acquire the management of this £20000 if he could provide the lady with a husband of the proper temperament undy scott did not want to appropriate miss golightlys fortune he only wanted to have the management of it  looking round among his acquaintance for a fitting parti for the sweet clementina his mind after much consideration settled upon charley tudor there were many young men much nearer and dearer to undy than charley who might be equally desirous of so great a prize but he could think of none over whom he might probably exercise so direct a control charley was a handsome gay fellow and waltzed au ravir he might therefore without difficulty make his way with the fair clementina he was distressingly poor and would therefore certainly jump at an heiresshe was delightfully thoughtless and easy of leading and therefore the money when in his hands might probably be manageable he was also alarics cousin and therefore acceptable  undy did not exactly open his mind to alaric tudor in this matter alarics education was going on rapidly but his mind had not yet received with sufficient tenacity those principles of philosophy which would enable him to look at this scheme in its proper light he had already learnt the great utility one may almost say the necessity of having a command of money he was beginning also to perceive that money was a thing not to be judged of by the ordinary rules which govern a mans conduct in other matters it behoves a gentleman to be open aboveboard liberal and true goodnatured generous confiding selfdenying doing unto others as he would wish that others should do unto him but in the acquirement and use of moneythat is its use with the object of acquiring more its use in the usurers sensehis practice should be exactly the reverse he should be close secret exacting given to concealment not over troubled by scruples suspicious without sympathies selfdevoted and always doing unto others exactly that which he is on his guard to prevent others from doing unto himviz making money by them so much alaric had learnt and had been no inapt scholar but he had not yet appreciated the full value of the latitude allowed by the genius of the present age to men who deal successfully in money he had as we have seen acknowledged to himself that a sportsman may return from the field with his legs and feet a little muddy but he did not yet know how deep a man may wallow in the mire how thoroughly he may besmear himself from head to foot in the blackest foulest mud and yet be received an honoured guest by ladies gay and noble lords if only his bag be sufficiently full    rem quocunque modo rem  the remainder of the passage was doubtless applicable to former times but now is hardly worth repeating  as alarics stomach was not yet quite suited for strong food undy fitted this matter to his friends still juvenile capacities there was an heiress a doosed fine girl as undy insisted laying peculiar strength on the word of emphasis with £20000 and there was charley tudor a devilish decent fellow without a rap why not bring them together this would only be a mark of true friendship on the part of undy and on alarics part it would be no more than one cousin would be bound to do for another looking at it in this light alaric saw nothing in the matter which could interfere with his quiet conscience  ill do what i can said undy mrs val is inclined to have a way of her own in most things but if anybody can lead her i can charley must take care that val himself doesnt take his part thats all if he interferes it would be all up with us  and thus alaric intent mainly on the interest of his cousin and actuated perhaps a little by the feeling that a rich cousin would be more serviceable than a poor one set himself to work in connexion with undy scott to make prey of clementina golightlys £20000  but if undy had no difficulty in securing the cooperation of alaric in this matter alaric by no means found it equally easy to secure the cooperation of charley charley tudor had not yet learnt to look upon himself as a marketable animal worth a certain sum of money in consequence of such property in good appearance address c as god had been good enough to endow him withal  he daily felt the depth and disagreeable results of his own poverty and not unfrequently when specially short of the queens medium sighed for some of those thousands and tens of thousands with which mens mouths are so glibly full he had often tried to calculate what would be his feelings if some eccentric goodnatured old stranger should leave him say five thousand a year he had often walked about the street with his hands in his empty pockets building delicious castles in the air and doing the most munificent actions imaginable with his newlyacquired wealth as all men in such circumstances do relieving distress rewarding virtue and making handsome presents to all his friends and especially to mrs woodward so far charley was not guiltless of coveting wealth but he had never for a moment thought of realizing his dreams by means of his personal attractions it had never occurred to him that any girl having money could think it worth her while to marry him he navvy as he was with his infernal friends and pothouse love with his debts and idleness and low associations with his saloons of seville his elysium in fleet street and his paradise near the surrey gardens had hitherto thought little enough of his own attractions no kind father had taught him that he was worth £10000 in any market in the world when he had dreamt of money he had never dreamt of it as accruing to him in return for any value or worth which he had inherent in himself even in his lighter moments he had no such conceit and at those periods few and far between in which he did think seriously of the world at large this special method of escaping from his difficultiesnever once presented itself to his mind  when therefore alaric first spoke to him of marrying £20000 and clementina golightly his surprise was unbounded  £20000 said alaric and a doosed fine girl you know and he also laid great stress on the latter part of the offer knowing how inflammable was charleys heart and at the same time how little mercenary was his mind  but charley was not only surprised at the proposed arrangement but apparently also unwilling to enter into it he argued that in the first place no girl in her senses would accept him to this alaric replied that as clementina had not much sense to speak of that objection might fall to the ground then charley expressed an idea that miss golightlys friends might probably object when they learnt what were the exact pecuniary resources of the expectant husband to which alaric argued that the circumstances of the case were very lucky inasmuch as some of clementinas natural friends were already prepossessed in favour of such an arrangement  driven thus from two of his strongholds charley in the most modest of voices in a voice one may say quite shamefaced and conscious of its masters weaknesssuggested that he was not quite sure that at the present moment he was very much in love with the lady in question  alaric had married for love and was not two years married yet had his education so far progressed in that short period as to enable him to laugh at such an objection  then my dear fellow what the deuce do you mean to do with yourself youll certainly go to the dogs  charley had an idea that he certainly should and also had an idea that miss clementina and her £20000 might not improbably go in the same direction if he had anything to do with them  and as for loving her continued alaric thats all my eye love is a luxury which none but the rich or the poor can afford we middleclass paupers who are born with good coats on our backs but empty purses can have nothing to do with it  but you married for love alaric  my marriage was not a very prudent one and should not be taken as an example and then i did get some fortune with my wife and what is more i was not so fearfully in want of it as you are  charley acknowledged the truth of this said that he would think of the matrimonial project and promised at any rate to call on clementina on an early occasion he had already made her acquaintance had already danced with her and certainly could not take upon himself to deny that she was a doosed fine girl  but charley had reasons of his own reasons which he could not make known to alaric for not thinking much of or trusting much to miss golightlys fortune in the first place he regarded marriage on such a grand scale as that now suggested as a ceremony which must take a long time to adjust the wooing of a lady with so many charms could not be carried on as might be the wooing of a chambermaid or a farmers daughter it must take months at least to conciliate the friends of so rich an heiress and months at the end of them to prepare the wedding gala but charley could not wait for months before one month was over he would probably be laid up in some vile limbo an unfortunate poor prisoner at the suit of an ironhearted tailor  at this very moment of alarics proposition at this instant when he found himself talking with so much coolness of the expedience or inexpedience of appropriating to his own purpose a slight trifle of £20000 he was in dire strait as to money difficulties  he had lately that is within the last twelve months made acquaintance with an interesting gentleman named jabesh mruen mr jabesh mruen was in the habit of relieving the distresses of such impoverished young gentlemen as charley tudor and though he did this with every assurance of philanthropic regard though in doing so he only made one stipulation pray be punctual mr tudor now pray do be punctual sir and you may always count on me nevertheless in spite of all his goodness mr mruens young friends seldom continued to hold their heads well up over the worlds waters  on the morning after this conversation with alaric charley intended to call on his esteemed old friend many were the morning calls he did make many were the weary useless aimless walks which he took to that little street at the back of mecklenburg square with the fond hope of getting some relief from mr mruen and many also were the calls the return visits as it were which mr mruen made at the internal navigation and numerous were the whispers which he would there whisper into the ears of the young clerk mr snape the while sitting by with a sweet unconscious look as though he firmly believed mr mruen to be charleys maternal uncle  and then too charley had other difficulties which in his mind presented great obstacles to the golightly scheme though alaric would have thought little of them and undy nothing what was he to do with his norfolk street lady his barmaid houri his norah geraghty to whom he had sworn all manner of undying love and for whom in some sort of fashion he really had an affection and norah was not a lightoflove whom it was as easy to lay down as to pick up charley had sworn to love her and she had sworn to love charley and to give her her due she had kept her word to him though her life rendered necessary a sort of daily or rather nightly flirtation with various male comersas indeed for the matter of that did also the life of miss clementina golightlyyet she had in her way been true to her lover she had been true to him and charley did not doubt her and in a sort of low way respected her though it was but a dissipated and debauched respect there had even been talk between them of marriage and who can say what in his softer moments when his brain had been too weak or the toddy too strong charley may not have promised  and there was yet another objection to miss golightly one even more difficult of mention one on which charley felt himself more absolutely constrained to silence than even either of the other two he was sufficiently disinclined to speak to his cousin alaric as to the merits either of mr jabesh mruen or of miss geraghty but he could have been eloquent on either rather than whisper a word as to the third person who stood between him and the £20000  the school in which charley now lived that of the infernal navvies had taught him to laugh at romance but it had not been so successful in quelling the early feelings of his youth in drying up the fountains of poetry within him as had been the case with his cousin in that other school in which he had been a scholar charley was a dissipated dissolute rake and in some sense had degraded himself but he had still this chance of safety on his side that he himself reprobated his own sins he dreamt of other things and a better life he made visions to himself of a sweet home and a sweeter sweetest lovely wife a love whose hair should not be redolent of smoke nor her hands reeking with gin nor her services at the demand of every libertine who wanted a screw of tobacco or a glass of cold without  he had made such a vision to himself and the angel with which he had filled it was not a creature of his imagination she who was to reign in this ethereal paradise this happy home far as the poles away from norfolk street was a living being in the sublunar globe present sometimes to charleys eyes and now so often present to his thoughts and yet she was but a child and as ignorant that she had ever touched a lovers heart by her childish charms as though she had been a baby  after all even on charleys part it was but a vision he never really thought that his young inamorata would or could be to him a real true hearts companion returning his love with the double love of a woman watching his health curing his vices and making the sweet things of the world a living reality around him this love of his was but a vision but not the less on that account did it interfere with his cousin alarics proposition in reference to miss clementina golightly  that other love also that squalid love of his was in truth no visionwas a stern palpable reality very difficult to get rid of and one which he often thought to himself would very probably swallow up that other love and drive his sweet dream far away into utter darkness and dim chaotic space  but at any rate it was clear that there was no room in his heart for the beauteous clementina doosed fine girl as she undoubtedly was and serviceable as the £20000 most certainly would have been    chapter xviii  a day with one of the navviesmorning   on the morning after this conversation with alaric charley left his lodgings with a heavy heart and wended his way towards mecklenburg square at the corner of davies street he got an omnibus which for fourpence took him to one of the little alleys near grays inn and there he got down and threading the wellknown locality through bedford place and across theobalds road soon found himself at the door of his generous patron oh how he hated the house how he hated the bleareyed crossgrained dirty impudent fishfag of an old woman who opened the door for him how he hated mr jabesh mruen to whom he now came a supplicant for assistance and how above all he hated himself for being there  he was shown into mr mruens little front parlour where he had to wait for fifteen minutes while his patron made such a breakfast as generally falls to the lot of such men we can imagine the rancid butter the stale befingered bread the haporth of skyblue milk the tea innocent of chinas wrongs and the soiled cloth mr mruen always did keep charley waiting fifteen minutes and so he was no whit surprised the doing so was a part of the tremendous interest which the wretched old usurer received for his driblets of money  there was not a bit of furniture in the room on which charley had not speculated till speculation could go no further the old escritoire or secrétaire which mr mruen always opened the moment he came into the room the rickety pembroke table covered with dirty papers which stood in the middle of it the horsehairbottomed chairs on which charley declined to sit down unless he had on his thickest winter trousers so perpendicular had become some atoms on the surface which when new had no doubt been horizontal the ornaments  on the chimney broken bits of filthy crockery full of wisps of paper with a china duck without a tail and a dog to correspond without a head the pictures against the wall with their tarnished dingy frames and cracked glasses representing three of the seasons how the fourth had gone before its time to its final bourne by an unhappy chance mr mruen had once explained to charley while endeavouring to make his young customer take the other three as a good value for £7 10s in arranging a little transaction the total amount of which did not exceed £15  in that instance however charley who had already dabbled somewhat deeply in dressingcases utterly refused to trade in the articles produced  charley stood with his back to the dog and duck facing winter with spring on his right and autumn on his left it was well that summer was gone no summer could have shed light on that miserable chamber he knew that he would have to wait and was not therefore impatient and at the end of fifteen minutes mr mruen shuffled into the room in his slippers  he was a little man with thin grey hair which stood upright from his narrow headwhat his age might have been it was impossible to guess he was wizened and dry and grey but still active enough on his legs when he had exchanged his slippers for his shoes and as keen in all his senses as though years could never tell upon him  he always wore round his neck a stiffstarched deep white handkerchief not fastened with a bow in front the ends being tucked in so as to be invisible this cravat not only covered his throat but his chin also so that his head seemed to grow forth from it without the aid of any neck and he had a trick of turning his face round within it an inch or two to the right or to the left in a manner which seemed to indicate that his cranium was loose and might be removed at pleasure  he shuffled into the room where charley was standing with little short quick steps and putting out his hand just touched that of his customer by way of going through the usual process of greeting  some short statement must be made of charleys money dealings with mr mruen up to this period about two years back a tailor had an overdue bill of his for £20 of which he was unable to obtain payment and being unwilling to go to law or perhaps being himself in mr mruens power he passed this bill to that worthy gentlemanwhat amount of consideration he got for it it matters not now to inquire mr mruen very shortly afterwards presented himself at the internal navigation and introduced himself to our hero he did this with none of the overbearing harshness of the ordinary dun or the short caustic decision of a creditor determined to resort to the utmost severity of the law he turned his head about and smiled and just showed the end of the bill peeping out from among a parcel of others begged mr tudor to be punctual he would only ask him to be punctual and would in such case do anything for him and ended his visit by making an appointment to meet charley in the little street behind mecklenburg square charley kept his appointment and came away from mr mruens with a wellcontented mind he had it is true left £5 behind him and had also left the bill still entire but he had obtained a promise of unlimited assistance from the goodnatured gentleman and had also received instructions how he was to get a brother clerk to draw a bill how he was to accept it himself and how his patron was to discount it for him paying him real gold out of the bank of england in exchange for his worthless signature  charley stepped lighter on the ground as he left mr mruens house on that eventful morning than he had done for many a day there was something delightful in the feeling that he could make money of his name in this way as great bankers do of theirs by putting it at the bottom of a scrap of paper he experienced a sort of pride too in having achieved so respectable a position in the race of ruin which he was running as to have dealings with a billdiscounter he felt that he was putting himself on a par with great men and rising above the low level of the infernal navvies mr mruen had pulled the bill out of a heap of bills which he always carried in his huge pocketbook and showed to charley the name of an impoverished irish peer on the back of it and the sight of that name had made charley quite in love with rum he already felt that he was almost handandglove with lord mountcoffeehouse for it was a descendant of the nobleman so celebrated in song only be punctual mr tudor only be punctual and i will do anything for you mr mruen had said as charley left the house charley however never had been punctual and yet his dealings with mr mruen had gone on from that day to this what absolute money he had ever received into his hand he could not now have said but it was very little probably not amounting in all to £50 yet he had already paid during the two years more than double that sum to this sharpclawed vulture and still owed him the amounts of more bills than he could number indeed he had kept no account of these doublefanged little documents he had signed them whenever told to do so and had even been so preposterously foolish as to sign them in blank all he knew was that at the beginning of every quarter mr mruen got nearly the half of his little modicum of salary and that towards the middle of it he usually contrived to obtain an advance of some small some very small sum and that when doing so he always put his hand to a fresh bit of paper  he was beginning to be heartily sick of the billdiscounter his intimacy with the lord had not yet commenced nor had he experienced any of the delights which he had expected to accrue to him from the higher tone of extravagance in which he entered when he made mr mruens acquaintance and then the horrid fatal waste of time which he incurred in pursuit of the few pounds which he occasionally obtained filled even his heart with a sort of despair morning after morning he would wait in that hated room and then day after day at two oclock he would attend the usurers city hauntand generally all in vain the patience of mr snape was giving way and the discipline even of the internal navigation felt itself outraged  and now charley stood once more in that dingy little front parlour in which he had never yet seen a fire and once more mr jabesh mruen shuffled into the room in his big cravat and dirty loose slippers  how dye do mr tudor how dye do i hope you have brought a little of this with you and jabesh opened out his left hand and tapped the palm of it with the middle finger of his right by way of showing that he expected some money not that he did expect any cormorant that he was this was not the period of the quarter in which he ever got money from his customer  indeed i have not mr mruen but i positively must get some  ohohohohmr tudormr tudor how can we go on if you are so unpunctual now i would do anything for you if you would only be punctual  oh bother about thatyou know your own game well enough  be punctual mr tudor only be punctual and we shall be all rightand so you have not got any of this and jabesh went through the tapping again  not a doit said charley but i shall be up the spout altogether if you dont do something to help me  but you are so unpunctual mr tudor  oh d it youll make me sick if you say that again what else do you live by but that but i positively must have some money from you today if not i am done for  i dont

salary and i have not had a shilling back since  but you are so unpunctual mr tudor and jabesh twisted his head backwards and forwards within his cravat rubbing his chin with the interior starch  well then ill tell you what it is said charley ill be shot if you get a shilling from me on the 1st of october and you may sell me up as quick as you please if i dont give a history of your business that will surprise some people my name isnt tudor  ha ha ha laughed mr mruen with a soft quiet laugh  well really mr tudor i would do more for you than any other young man that i know if you were only a little more punctual how much is it you want now  £15or £10£10 will do  ten pounds said jabesh as though charley had asked for ten thousandten poundsif two or three would do  but two or three wont do  and whose name will you bring  whose name why scatteralls to be sure now scatterall was one of the navvies and from him mr mruen had not yet succeeded in extracting one farthing though he had his name on a volume of charleys bills  scatteralli dont like mr scatterall said jabesh he is very dissipated and the most unpunctual young man i ever metyou really must get some one else mr tudor you really must  oh thats nonsensescatterall is as good as anybodyi couldnt ask any of the other fellowsthey are such a low set  but mr scatterall is so unpunctual theres your cousin mr alaric tudor  my cousin

his name and ill let you have £10 or £8ill let you have £8 at once  i dare say you will mr mruen or £80 and be only too happy to give it me but you know that is out of the question now i wont wait any longer just give me an answer to this if i come to you in the city will you let me have some money today if you wont why i must go elsewherethats all  the interview ended by an appointment being made for another meeting to come off at two pm that day at the banks of jordan a publichouse in sweetings alley as well known to charley as the little front parlour of mr mruens house bring the billstamp with you mr tudor said jabesh by way of a last parting word of counsel and let mr scatterall sign itthat is if it must be mr scatterall but i wish you would bring your cousins name  nonsense  well then bring it signedbut ill fill it you young fellows understand nothing of filling in a bill properly  and then taking his leave the infernal navvy hurried off and reached his office in somerset house at a quarter past eleven oclock as he walked along he bought the bit of stamped paper on which his friend scatterall was to write his name  when he reached the office he found that a great commotion was going on mr snape was standing up at his desk and the first word which greeted charleys ears was an intimation from that gentleman that mr oldeschole had desired that mr tudor when he arrived should be instructed to attend in the boardroom  very well said charley in a tone of great indifference with all my heart i rather like seeing oldeschole now and then but he mustnt keep me long for i have to meet my grandmother at islington at two oclock and charley having hung up his hat prepared to walk off to the secretarys room  youll be good enough to wait a few minutes mr tudor said snape another gentleman is with mr oldeschole at present you will be good enough to sit down and go on with the kennett and avon lock entries till mr oldeschole is ready to see you  charley sat down at his desk opposite to his friend scatterall i hope mr snape you had a pleasant meeting at evening prayers yesterday said he with a tone of extreme interest  you had better mind the lock entries at present mr tudor they are greatly in arrear  and the evening meetings are docketed up as close as wax i suppose what the deuce is in the wind dick mr scatteralls christian name was richard wheres corkscrew mr corkscrew was also a navvy and was one of those to whom charley had specially alluded when he spoke of the low set  oh heres a regular go said scatterall its all up with corkscrew i believe  why whats the cheese now  oh its all about some pork chops which screwy had for supper last night screwy was a name of love which among his brother navvies was given to mr corkscrew mr snape seems to think they did not agree with him  pork chops in july exclaimed charley  poor screwy forgot the time of year said another navvy he ought to have called it lamb and grass  and then the story was told on the preceding afternoon mr corkscrew had been subjected to the dire temptation of a boating party to the eelpie island for the following day and a dinner thereon there were to be at the feast no less than fourandtwenty jolly souls and it was intimated to mr corkscrew that as no soul was esteemed to be more jolly than his own the party would be considered as very imperfect unless he could join it asking for a days leave mr corkscrew knew to be out of the question he had already taken too many without asking he was therefore driven to take another in the same way and had to look about for some excuse which might support him in his difficulty an excuse it must be not only new but very valid one so strong that it could not be overset one so well avouched that it could not be doubted accordingly after mature consideration he sat down after leaving his office and wrote the following letter before he started on an evening cruising expedition with some others of the party to prepare for the next days festivities  thursday morningjuly 185  my dear sir  i write from my bed where i am suffering a most tremendous indiggestion last night i eat a stunning supper off pork chopps and never remembered that pork chopps always does disagree with me but i was very indiscrete and am now teetotally unable to rise my throbing head from off my pillar i have took four blu pills and some salts and sena plenty of that and shall be the thing tomorrow morning no doubt just at present i feel just as if i had a mill stone inside my stomacpray be so kind as to make it all right with mr oldeschole and believe me to remain  your faithful and obedient servant  verax corkscrew  thomas snape esq c  internal navigation office somerset house  having composed this letter of excuse and not intending to return to his lodgings that evening he had to make provision for its safely reaching the hands of mr snape in due time on the following morning this he did by giving it to the boy who came to clean the lodginghouse boots with sundry injunctions that if he did not deliver it at the office by ten oclock on the following morning the sixpence accruing to him would never be paid mr corkscrew however said nothing as to the letter not being delivered before ten the next morning and as other business took the boy along the strand the same evening he saw no reason why he should not then execute his commission he accordingly did so and duly delivered the letter into the hands of a servant girl who was cleaning the passages of the office  fortune on this occasion was blind to the merits of mr corkscrew and threw him over most unmercifully it so happened that mr snape had been summoned to an evening conference with mr oldeschole and the other pundits of the office to discuss with them or rather to hear discussed some measure which they began to think it necessary to introduce for amending the discipline of the department  we are getting a bad name whether we deserve it or not said mr oldeschole that fellow hardlines has put us into his bluebook and now theres an article in the times  just at this moment a messenger brought in to mr snape the unfortunate letter of which we have given a copy  whats that said mr oldeschole  a note from mr corkscrew sir said snape  hes the worst of the whole lot said mr oldeschole  he is very bad said snape but i rather think that perhaps sir mr tudor is the worst of all  well i dont know said the secretary muttering sotto voce to the undersecretary while mr snape read the letter tudor at any rate is a gentleman  mr snape read the letter and his face grew very long there was a sort of sneaking civility about corkscrew not prevalent indeed at all times but which chiefly showed itself when he and mr snape were alone together which somewhat endeared him to the elder clerk he would have screened the sinner had he had either the necessary presence of mind or the necessary pluck but he had neither he did not know how to account for the letter but by the truth and he feared to conceal so flagrant a breach of discipline at the moment of the present discussion  things at any rate so turned out that mr corkscrews letter was read in full conclave in the boardroom of the office just as he was describing the excellence of his manoeuvre with great glee to four or five other jolly souls at the magpie and stump  at first it was impossible to prevent a fit of laughter in which even mr snape joined but very shortly the laughter gave way to the serious considerations to which such an epistle was sure to give rise at such a moment what if sir gregory hardlines should get hold of it and put it into his bluebook what if the times should print it and send it over the whole world accompanied by a few of its most venomous touches to the eternal disgrace of the internal navigation and probably utter annihilation of mr oldescholes official career an example must be made  yes an example must be made messengers were sent off scouring the town for mr corkscrew and about midnight he was found still true to the magpie and stump but hardly in condition to understand the misfortune which had befallen him so much as this however did make itself manifest to him that he must by no means join his jollysouled brethren at the eelpie island and that he must be at his office punctually at ten oclock the next morning if he had any intention of saving himself from dismissal when charley arrived at his office mr corkscrew was still with the authorities and charleys turn was to come next  charley was rather a favourite with mr oldeschole having been appointed by himself at the instance of mr oldescholes great friend sir gilbert de salop and he was moreover the bestlooking of the whole lot of navvies but he was no favourite with mr snape  poor screwyit will be all up with him said charley he might just as well have gone on with his party and had his fun out  it will i imagine be necessary to make more than one example mr tudor said mr snape with a voice of utmost severity  aaamen said charley if everything else fails i think ill go into the green line you couldnt give me a helping hand could you mr snape there was a rumour afloat in the office that mr snapes wife held some little interest in a small greengrocers establishment  mr tudor to attend in the boardroom immediately said a fat messenger who opened the door wide with a start and then stood with it in his hand while he delivered the message  all right said charley ill tumble up and be with them in ten seconds and then collecting together a large bundle of the arrears of the kennett and avon lock entries being just as much as he could carry he took the disordered papers and placed them on mr snapes desk exactly over the paper on which he was writing and immediately under his nose  mr tudormr tudor said snape  as i am to tear myself away from you mr snape it is better that i should hand over these valuable documents to your safe keeping there they are mr snape pray see that you have got them all and so saying he left the room to attend to the high behests of mr oldeschole  as he went along the passages he met verax corkscrew returning from his interview well screwy said he and how fares it with you pork chops are bad things in summer aint they  its all up said corkscrew almost crying im to go down to the bottom and im to stay at the office till seven oclock every day for a month and old foolscap says hell ship me the next time im absent halfanhour without leave  oh is that all said charley if thats all you get for pork chops and senna im all right i shouldnt wonder if i did not get promoted and so he went in to his interview  what was the nature of the advice given him what amount of caution he was called on to endure need not here be exactly specified we all know with how light a rod a father chastises the son he loves let solomon have given what counsel he may to the contrary charley in spite of his manifold sins was a favourite and he came forth from the boardroom an unscathed man in fact he had been promoted as he had surmised seeing that corkscrew who had been his senior was now his junior he came forth unscathed and walking with an easy air into his room put his hat on his head and told his brother clerks that he should be there tomorrow morning at ten or at any rate soon after  and where are you going now mr tudor said snape  to meet my grandmother at islington if you please sir said charley i have permission from mr oldeschole to attend upon her for the rest of the dayperhaps you would like to ask him and so saying he went off to his appointment with mr mruen at the banks of jordan    chapter xix  a day with one of the navviesafternoon   the banks of jordan was a publichouse in the city which from its appearance did not seem to do a very thriving trade but as it was carried on from year to year in the same dull monotonous deadalive sort of fashion it must be surmised that some one found an interest in keeping it open  charley when he entered the door punctually at two oclock saw that it was as usual nearly deserted one long lanky middleaged man seedy as to his outward vestments and melancholy in countenance sat at one of the tables but he was doing very little good for the establishment he had no refreshment of any kind before him and was intent only on a dingy pocketbook in which he was making entries with a pencil  you enter the banks of jordan by two folding doors in a corner of a very narrow alley behind the exchange as you go in you observe on your left a little glass partition something like a large cage inside which in a bar are four or five untemptinglooking bottles and also inside the cage on a chair is to be seen a quietlooking female who is invariably engaged in the manufacture of some white article of inward clothing anything less like the flashydressed barmaidens of the western gin palaces it would be difficult to imagine to this encaged sempstress no one ever speaks unless it be to give a rare order for a mutton chop or pint of stout and even for this she hardly stays her sewing for a moment but touches a small bell and the ancient waiter who never shows himself but when called for and who is the only other inhabitant of the place ever visible receives the order from her through an open pane in the cage as quietly as she received it from her customer  the floor of the single square room of the establishment is sanded and the tables are ranged round the walls each table being fixed to the floor and placed within wooden partitions by which the occupier is screened from any inquiring eyes on either side  such was mr jabesh mruens houseofcall in the city and of many a mutton chop and many a pint of stout had charley partaken there while waiting for the man of money to him it seemed to be inexcusable to sit down in a public inn and call for nothing he perceived however that the large majority of the frequenters of the banks of jordan so conducted themselves  he was sufficiently accustomed to the place to know how to give his orders without troubling that diligent barmaid and had done so about ten minutes when jabesh more punctual than usual entered the place this charley regarded as a promising sign of forthcoming cash it very frequently happened that he waited there an hour and that after all jabesh would not come and then the morning visit to mecklenburg square had to be made again and so poor charleys time or rather the time of his poor office was cut up wasted and destroyed  a mutton chop said mr mruen looking at charleys banquet a very nice thing indeed in the middle of the day i dont mind if i have one myself and so charley had to order another chop and more stout  they have very nice sherry here excellent sherry said mruen the best i think in the citythats why i come here  upon my honour mr mruen i shant have money to pay for it until i get some from you said charley as he called for a pint of sherry  never mind john never mind the sherry today said mruen mr tudor is very kind but ill take beer and the little man gave a laugh and twisted his head and ate his chop and drank his stout as though he found that both were very good indeed when he had finished charley paid the bill and discovered that he was left with ninepence in his pocket  and then he produced the bill stamp waiter said he pen and ink and the waiter brought pen and ink  not today said jabesh wiping his mouth with the tablecloth not today mr tudori really havent time to go into it todayand i havent brought the other bills with me i quite forgot to bring the other bills with me and i can do nothing without them and mr mruen got up to go  but this was too much for charley he had often before bought bill stamps in vain and in vain had paid for mutton chops and beer for mr mruens dinner but he had never before when doing so been so hard pushed for money as he was now he was determined to make a great attempt to gain his object  nonsense said he getting up and standing so as to prevent mruen from leaving the box thats d nonsense  oh dont swear said mruenpray dont take gods name in vain i dont like it  i shall swear and to some purpose too if thats your game now look here  let me get up and well talk of it as we go to the bankyou are so unpunctual you know  d your punctuality  oh dont swear mr tudor  look hereif you dont let me have this money today by all that is holy i will never pay you a farthing againnot one farthing ill go into the court and you may get your money as you can  but mr tudor let me get up and well talk about it in the street as we go along  theres the stamp said charley fill it up and then ill go with you to the bank  mruen took the bit of paper and twisted it over and over again in his hand considering the while whether he had yet squeezed out of the young man all that could be squeezed with safety or whether by an additional turn by giving him another small advancement he might yet get something more he knew that tudor was in a very bad state that he was tottering on the outside edge of the precipice but he also knew that he had friends would his friends when they came forward to assist their young pickle out of the mire would they pay such bills as these or would they leave poor jabesh to get his remedy at law that was the question which mr mruen had to ask and to answer he was not one of those noble vultures who fly at large game and who are willing to run considerable risk in pursuit of their prey mr mruen avoided courts of law as much as he could and preferred a small safe trade one in which the fall of a single customer could never be ruinous to him in which he need run no risk of being transported for forgery incarcerated for perjury or even if possibly it might be avoided gibbeted by some lawyer or judge for his malpractices  but you are so unpunctual he said having at last made up his mind that he had made a very good thing of charley and that probably he might go a little further without much danger i wish to oblige you mr tudor but pray do be punctual and so saying he slowly spread the little document before him across which scatterall had already scrawled his name and slowly began to write in the date slowly with his head low down over the table and continually twisting it inside his cravat he filled up the paper and then looking at it with the air of a connoisseur in such matters he gave it to charley to sign  but you havent put in the amount said charley  mr mruen twisted his head and laughed he delighted in playing with his game as a fisherman does with a salmon wellnoi havent put in the amount yet do you sign it and ill do that at once  ill do it said charley ill say £15 and youll give me £10 on that  no no no said jabesh covering the paper over with his hands you young men know nothing of filling bills just sign it mr tudor and ill do the rest and so charley signed it and then mruen again taking the pen wrote in fifteen pounds as the recognized amount of the value of the document he also took out his pocketbook and filled a cheque but he was very careful that charley should not see the amount there written and now said he we will go to the bank  as they made their way to the house in lombard street which mr mruen honoured by his account charley insisted on knowing how much he was to have for the bill jabesh suggested £3 10s charley swore he would take nothing less than £8 but by the time they had arrived at the bank it had been settled that £5 was to be paid in cash and that charley was to have the three seasons for the balance whenever he chose to send for them when charley as he did at first positively refused to accede to these terms mr mruen tendered him back the bill and reminded him with a plaintive voice that he was so unpunctual so extremely unpunctual  having reached the bank which the moneylender insisted on charley entering with him mr mruen gave the cheque across the counter and wrote on the back of it the form in which he would take the money whereupon a note and five sovereigns were handed to him the cheque was for £15 and was payable to c tudor esq so that proof might be forthcoming at a future time if necessary that he had given to his customer full value for the bill then in the outer hall of the bank unseen by the clerks he put one after another slowly and unwillingly four sovereigns into charleys hand  the otherwheres the other said charley  jabesh smiled sweetly and twisted his head  come give me the other said charley roughly  four is quite enough quite enough for what you want and remember my time mr tudor you should remember my time  give me the other sovereign said charley taking hold of the front of his coat  well well you shall have ten shillings but i want the rest for a purpose  give me the sovereign said charley or ill drag you in before them all in the bank and expose you give me the other sovereign i say  ha ha ha laughed mr mruen i thought you liked a joke mr tudor well here it is and now do be punctual pray do be punctual and ill do anything i can for you  and then they parted charley going westward towards his own haunts and mruen following his daily pursuits in the city  charley had engaged to pull up to aviss at putney with harry norman to dine there take a country walk and row back in the cool of the evening and he had promised to call at the weights and measures with that object punctually at five  you can get away in time for that i suppose said harry  well ill try and manage it said charley laughing  nothing could be kinder nay more affectionate than norman had been to his fellowlodger during the last year and a half it seemed as though he had transferred to alarics cousin all the friendship which he had once felt for alaric and the deeper were charleys sins of idleness and extravagance the wider grew normans forgiveness and the more sincere his efforts to befriend him as one result of this charley was already deep in his debt not that norman had lent him money or even paid bills for him but the lodgings in which they lived had been taken by norman and when the end of the quarter came he punctually paid his landlady  charley had once a few weeks before the period of which we are now writing told norman that he had no money to pay his long arrear and that he would leave the lodgings and shift for himself as best he could he had said the same thing to mrs richards the landlady and had gone so far as to pack up all his clothes but his back was no sooner turned than mrs richards under normans orders unpacked them all and hid away the portmanteau it was well for him that this was done he had bespoken for himself a bedroom at the publichouse in norfolk street and had he once taken up his residence there he would have been ruined for ever  he was still living with norman and ever increasing his debt in his misery at this state of affairs he had talked over with harry all manner of schemes for increasing his income but he had never told him a word about mr mruen why his salary which was now £150 per annum should not be able to support him norman never asked charley the while was very miserable and the more miserable he was the less he found himself able to rescue himself from his dissipation what moments of ease he had were nearly all spent in norfolk street and such being the case how could he abstain from going there  well charley and how do crinoline and macassar go on said norman as they sauntered away together up the towingpath above putney now there were those who had found out that charley tudor in spite of his wretched idle vagabond mode of life was no fool indeed that there was that talent within him which if turned to good account might perhaps redeem him from ruin and set him on his legs again at least so thought some of his friends among whom mrs woodward was the most prominent she insisted that if he would make use of his genius he might employ his spare time to great profit by writing for magazines or periodicals and inspirited by so flattering a proposition charley had got himself introduced to the editor of a newlyprojected publication at his instance he was to write a tale for approval and crinoline and macassar was the name selected for his first attempt  the affair had been fully talked over at hampton and it had been arranged that the young author should submit his story when completed to the friendly criticism of the party assembled at surbiton cottage before he sent it to the editor he had undertaken to have crinoline and macassar ready for perusal on the next saturday and in spite of mr mruen and norah geraghty he had really been at work  will it be finished by saturday charley said norman  yesat least i hope so but if thats not done i have another all complete  another and what is that called  oh thats a very short one said charley modestly  but short as it is it must have a name i suppose whats the name of the short one  why the name is long enough its the longest part about it the editor gave me the name you know and then i had to write the story its to be called sir anthony allanadale and the baron of ballyporeen  oh two rival knights in love with the same lady of course and harry gave a gentle sigh as he thought of his own still unhealed grief the scene is laid in ireland i presume  no not in ireland at least not exactly i dont think the scene is laid anywhere in particular its up in a mountain near a castle there isnt any lady in itat least not alive  heavens charley i hope you are not dealing with dead women  nothat is i have to bring them to life again ill tell you how it is in the first paragraph sir anthony allanadale is lying dead and the baron of ballyporeen is standing over him with a bloody sword you must always begin with an incident now and then hark back for your explanation and description thats what the editor says is the great secret of the present day and where we beat all the old fellows that wrote twenty years ago  ohyesi see they used to begin at the beginning that was very humdrum  a devilish bore you know for a fellow who takes up a novel because hes dull of course he wants his fun at once if you begin with a long history of whos who and all that why he wont read three pages but if you touch him up with a startling incident or two at the first go off then give him a chapter of horrors then another of fun then a little love or a little slang or something of that sort why you know about the end of the first volume you may describe as much as you like and tell everything about everybodys father and mother for just as many pages as you want to fill at least thats what the editor says  meleager ab ovo may be introduced with safety when you get as far as that suggested norman  yes you may bring him in too if you like said charley who was somewhat oblivious of his classicalities well sir anthony is lying dead and the baron is standing over him when out come sir anthonys retainers  outout of what  out of the castle thats all explained afterwards out come the retainers and pitch into the baron till they make mincemeat of him  they dont kill him too  dont they though i rather think they do and no mistake  and so both your heroes are dead in the first chapter  first chapter why thats only the second paragraph im only to be allowed ten paragraphs for each number and i am expected to have an incident for every other paragraph for the first four days  thats twenty incidents  yesits a great bother finding so manyim obliged to make the retainers come by all manner of accidents and i should never have finished the job if i hadnt thought of setting the castle on fire and now forked tongues of liquid fire and greedy lambent flames burst forth from every window of the devoted edifice the devouring element thats the best passage in the whole affair  this is for the daily delight isnt it  yes for the daily delight it is to begin on the 1st of september with the partridges we expect a most tremendous sale it will be the first halfpenny publication in the market and as the retailers will get them for sixpence a scoretwentyfour to the scoretheyll go off like wildfire  well charley and what do you do with the dead bodies of your two heroes  of course i neednt tell you that it was not the baron who killed sir anthony at all  oh wasnt it o dearthat was a dreadful mistake on the part of the retainers  but as natural as life you see these two grandees were nextdoor neighbours and there had been a feud between the families for seven centuriesa sort of capulet and montague affair one adelgitha the daughter of the thane of allanadalethere were thanes in those days you knowwas betrothed to the eldest son of sir waldemar de ballyporeen this gives me an opportunity of bringing in a succinct little account of the conquest which will be beneficial to the lower classes the editor peremptorily insists upon that kind of thing  omne tulit punctum said norman  yes i dare say said charley who was now too intent on his own new profession to attend much to his friends quotation well where was ioh the eldest son of sir waldemar went off with another lady and so the feud began there is a very pretty scene between adelgitha and her ladysmaid  what seven centuries before the story begins  why not the editor says that the unities are altogether thrown over now and that they are regular boshour game is to stick in a good bit whenever we can get iti got to be so fond of adelgitha that i rather think shes the heroine  but doesnt that take off the interest from your dead grandees  not a bit i take it chapter and chapter about well you see the retainers had no sooner made mincemeat of the barona very elegant young man was the baron just returned from the continent where he had learnt to throw aside all prejudices about family feuds and everything eke and he had just come over in a friendly way to say as much to sir anthony when as he crossed the drawbridge he stumbled over the corpse of his ancient enemywell the retainers had no sooner made mincemeat of him than they perceived that sir anthony was lying with an open bottle in his hand and that he had taken poison  having committed suicide asked norman  no not at all the editor says that we must always have a slap at some of the iniquities of the times he gave me three or four to choose from there was the adulteration of food and the want of education for the poor and street music and the miscellaneous sale of poisons  and so you chose poisons and killed the knight  exactly at least i didnt kill him for he comes all right again after a bit he had gone out to get something to do him good after a hard night a seidlitz powder or something of that sort and an apothecarys apprentice had given him prussic acid in mistake  and how is it possible he should have come to life after taking prussic acid  why there i have a double rap at the trade the prussic acid is so bad of its kind that it only puts him into a kind of torpor for a week then we have the trial of the apothecarys boy that is an excellent episode and gives me a grand hit at the absurdity of our criminal code  why charley it seems to me that you are hitting at everything  oh ah right and left thats the game for us authors the press is the only censor morum going nowand who so fit set a thief to catch a thief you know well i have my hit at the criminal code and then sir anthony comes out of his torpor  but how did it come to pass that the barons sword was all bloody  ah there was the difficulty i saw that at once it was necessary to bring in something to be killed you know i thought of a stray tiger out of wombwells menagerie but the editor says that we must not trespass against the probabilities so i have introduced a big dog the baron had come across a big dog and seeing that the brute had a wooden log tied to his throat thought he must be mad and so he killed him  and whats the end of it charley  why the end is rather melancholy sir anthony reforms leaves off drinking and takes to going to church everyday he becomes a puseyite puts up a memorial window to the baron and reads the tracts at last he goes over to the pope walks about in nasty dirty clothes all full of vermin and gives over his estate to cardinal wiseman then there are the retainers they all come to grief some one way and some another i do that for the sake of the nemesis  i would not have condescended to notice them i think said norman  oh i must there must be a nemesis the editor specially insists on a nemesis  the conclusion of charleys novel brought them back to the boat norman when he started had intended to employ the evening in giving good counsel to his friend and in endeavouring to arrange some scheme by which he might rescue the brand from the burning but he had not the heart to be severe and sententious while charley was full of his fun it was so much pleasanter to talk to him on the easy terms of equal friendship than turn mentor and preach a sermon  well charley said he as they were walking up from the boat wharfnorman to his club and charley towards his lodgingsfrom which route however he meant to deviate as soon as ever he might be left alonewell charley i wish you success with all my heart i wish you could do somethingi wont say to keep you out of mischief  i wish i could harry said charley thoroughly abashed i wish i couldindeed i wish i couldbut it is so hard to go right when one has begun to go wrong  it is hard i know it is  but you never can know how hard harry for you have never tried and then they went on walking for a while in silence side by side  you dont know the sort of place that office of mine is continued charley you dont know the sort of fellows the men are i hate the place i hate the men i live with it is all so dirty so disreputable so false i cannot conceive that any fellow put in there as young as i was should ever do well afterwards  but at any rate you might try your best charley  yes i might do that still and i know i dont and where should i have been now if it hadnt been for you  never mind about that i sometimes think we might have done more for each other if we had been more together but remember the motto you said youd choose charleyexcelsior we can none of us mount the hill without hard labour remember that word charleyexcelsior remember it nownow tonight remember how you dream of higher things and begin to think of them in your waking moments also and so they parted      chapter xx  a day with one of the navviesevening   excelsior said charley to himself as he walked on a few steps towards his lodgings having left norman at the door of his club remember it nownow tonight  yesnow is the time to remember it if it is ever to be remembered to any advantage he went on with stoic resolution to the end of the street determined to press home and put the last touch to crinoline and macassar but as he went he thought of his interview with mr mruen and of the five sovereigns still in his pocket and altered his course  charley had not been so resolute with the usurer so determined to get £5 from him on this special day without a special object in view his credit was at stake in a more than ordinary manner he had about a week since borrowed money from the woman who kept the publichouse in norfolk street and having borrowed it for a week only felt that this was a debt of honour which it was incumbent on him to pay therefore when he had walked the length of one street on his road towards his lodgings he retraced his steps and made his way back to his old haunts  the house which he frequented was hardly more like a modern london ginpalace than was that other house in the city which mr mruen honoured with his custom it was one of those small tranquil shrines of bacchus in which the god is worshipped perhaps with as constant a devotion though with less noisy demonstrations of zeal than in his larger and more public temples none absolutely of the lower orders were encouraged to come thither for oblivion it had about it nothing inviting to the general eye no gas illuminations proclaimed its midnight grandeur no huge folding doors one set here and another there gave ingress and egress to a wretched crowd of povertystricken midnight revellers no reiterated assertions in gaudy letters each a foot long as to the peculiar merits of the old tom or hodges cream of the valley seduced the thirsty traveller the panelling over the window bore the simple announcement in modest letters of the name of the landlady mrs davis and the same name appeared with equal modesty on the one gas lamp opposite the door  mrs davis was a widow and her customers were chiefly people who knew her and frequented her house regularly lawyers clerks who were either unmarried or whose married homes were perhaps not so comfortable as the widows front parlour tradesmen not of the best sort glad to get away from the noise of their children young men who had begun the cares of life in ambiguous positions just on the confines of respectability and who finding themselves too weak in flesh to cling on to the round of the ladder above them were sinking from year to year to lower steps and depths even below the level of mrs daviss publichouse to these might be added some few of a somewhat higher rank in life though perhaps of a lower rank of respectability young men who like charley tudor and his comrades liked their ease and selfindulgence and were too indifferent as to the class of companions against whom they might rub their shoulders while seeking it  the cat and whistle for such was the name of mrs daviss establishment had been a house of call for the young men of the internal navigation long before charleys time what first gave rise to the connexion it is not now easy to say but charley had found it and had fostered it into a close alliance which greatly exceeded any amount of intimacy which existed previously to his day  it must not be presumed that he in an ordinary way took his place among the lawyers clerks and general run of customers in the front parlour occasionally he condescended to preside there over the quiet revels to sing a song for the guests which was sure to be applauded to the echo and to engage in a little skirmish of politics with a retired lampmaker and a silversmiths foreman from the strand who always called him sir and received what he said with the greatest respect but as a rule he quaffed his falernian in a little secluded parlour behind the bar in which sat the widow davis auditing her accounts in the morning and giving out orders in the evening to norah geraghty her barmaid and to an attendant sylph who ministered to the front parlour taking in goes of gin and screws of tobacco and bringing out the price thereof with praiseworthy punctuality  latterly indeed charley had utterly deserted the front parlour for there had come there a pestilent fellow highly connected with the press as the lampmaker declared but employed as an assistant shorthandwriter somewhere about the houses of parliament according to the silversmith who greatly interfered with our navvys authority he would not at all allow that what charley said was law entertained fearfully democratic principles of his own and was not at all the gentleman so charley drew himself up declined to converse any further on politics with a man who seemed to know more about them than himself and confined himself exclusively to the inner room  on arriving at this elysium on the night in question he found mrs davis usefully engaged in darning a stocking while scatterall sat opposite with a cigar in his mouth his hat over his nose and a glass of gin and water before him  i began to think you werent coming said scatterall and i was getting so deuced dull that i was positively thinking of going home  thats very civil of you mr scatterall said the widow  well youve been sitting there for the last halfhour without saying a word to me and it is dull looking at a woman mending stockings is dull aint it charley  that depends said charley partly on whom the woman may be and partly on whom the man may be wheres norah mrs davis  shes not very well tonight she has got a headache there aint many of them here tonight so shes lying down  a little seedy i suppose said scatterall  charley felt rather angry with his friend for applying such an epithet to his ladylove however he did not resent it but sitting down lighted his pipe and sipped his gin and water  and so they sat for the next quarter of an hour saying very little to each other what was the nature of the attraction which induced two such men as charley tudor and dick scatterall to give mrs davis the benefit of their society while she was mending her stockings it might be difficult to explain they could have smoked in their own rooms as well and have drunk gin and water there if they had any real predilection for that mixture mrs davis was neither young nor beautiful nor more than ordinarily witty charley it is true had an allurement to entice him thither but this could not be said of scatterall to whom the lovely norah was never more than decently civil had they been desired in their own paternal halls to sit and see their mothers housekeeper darn the family stockings they would probably both of them have rebelled even though the supply of tobacco and gin and water should be gratuitous and unlimited  it must be presumed that the only charm of the pursuit was in its acknowledged impropriety they both understood that there was something fast in frequenting mrs daviss inner parlour something slow in remaining at home and so they both sat there and mrs davis went on with her darningneedle nothing abashed  well i think i shall go said scatterall shaking off the last ash from the end of his third cigar  do said charley you should be careful you know late hours will hurt your complexion  its so deuced dull said scatterall  why dont you go into the parlour and have a chat with the gentlemen suggested mrs davis theres mr peppermint there now lecturing about the war upon my word he talks very well  hes so deuced low said scatterall  hes a bumptious noisy blackguard too said charley he doesnt know how to speak to a gentleman when he meets one  scatterall gave a great yawn i suppose youre not going charley said he  oh yes i am said charley in about two hours  two hours well good night old fellow for im off three cigars mrs davis and two goes of gin and water the last cold then having made this little commercial communication to the landlady he gave another yawn and took himself away mrs davis opened her little book jotted down the items and then having folded up her stockings and put them into a basket prepared herself for conversation  but though mrs davis prepared herself for conversation she did not immediately commence it having something special to say she probably thought that she might improve her opportunity of saying it by allowing charley to begin she got up and pottered about the room went to a cupboard and wiped a couple of glasses and then out into the bar and arranged the jugs and pots this done she returned to the little room and again sat herself down in her chair  heres your five pounds mrs davis said charley i wish you knew the trouble i have had to get it for you  to give mrs davis her due this was not the subject on which she was anxious to speak she would have been at present well inclined that charley should remain her debtor indeed mr tudor i am very sorry you should have taken any trouble on such a trifle if youre short of money it will do for me just as well in october  charley looked at the sovereigns and bethought himself how very short of cash he was then he thought of the fight he had had to get them in order that he might pay the money which he had felt so ashamed of having borrowed and he determined to resist the temptation  did you ever know me flush of cash you had better take them while you can get them and as he pushed them across the table with his stick he remembered that all he had left was ninepence  i dont want the money at present mr tudor said the widow were such old friends that there ought not to be a word between us about such a triflenow dont leave yourself bare take what you want and settle with me at quarterday  well ill take a sovereign said he for to tell you the truth i have only the ghost of a shilling in my pocket and so it was settled mrs davis reluctantly pocketed four of mr mruens sovereigns and charley kept in his own possession the fifth as to which he had had so hard a combat in the lobby of the bank  he then sat silent for a while and smoked and mrs davis again waited for him to begin the subject on which she wished to speak and whats the matter with norah all this time he said at last  whats the matter with her repeated mrs davis well i think you might know whats the matter with her you dont suppose shes made of stone do you  charley saw that he was in for it it was in vain that normans last word was still ringing in his ears excelsior what had he to do with excelsior what miserable reptile on gods earth was more prone to crawl downwards than he had shown himself to be and then again a vision floated across his minds eye of a young sweet angel face with large bright eyes with soft delicate skin and all the exquisite charms of gentle birth and gentle nurture a single soft touch seemed to press his arm a touch that he had so often felt and had never felt without acknowledging to himself that there was something in it almost divine all this passed rapidly through his mind as he was preparing to answer mrs daviss question touching norah geraghty  you dont think shes made of stone do you said the widow repeating her words  indeed i dont think shes made of anything but whats suitable to a very nice young woman said charley  a nice young woman is that all you can say for her i call her a very fine girl miss golightlys friends could not say anything more even for that young lady i dont know where youll pick up a handsomer or a betterconducted one either for the matter of that  indeed she is said charley  oh for the matter of that no one knows it better than yourself mr tudor and shes as well able to keep a mans house over his head as some others that take a deal of pride in themselves  im quite sure of it said charley  well the long and the short of it is this mr tudor and as she spoke the widow got a little red in the face she had as charley thought an unpleasant look of resolution about hera roundness about her mouth and a sort of fierceness in her eyes the long and the short of it is this mr tudor what do you mean to do about the girl  do about her said charley almost bewildered in his misery  yes do about her do you mean to make her your wife thats plain english because ill tell you what ill not see her put upon any longer it must be one thing or the other and that at once and if youve a grain of honour in you mr tudorand i think you are honourableyou wont back from your word with the girl now  back from my word said charley  yes back from your word said mrs davis the floodgates of whose eloquence were now fairly opened im sure youre too much of the gentleman to deny your own words and them repeated more than once in my presencecherootsyes are there none there childoh they are in the cupboard these last words were not part of her address to charley but were given in reply to a requisition from the attendant nymph outside youre too much of a gentleman to do that i know and so as im her natural friendand indeed shes my cousin not that far offi think its right that we should all understand one another  oh quite right said charley  you cant expect that she should go and sacrifice herself for you you know said mrs davis who now that she had begun hardly knew how to stop herself a girls time is her money shes at her best now and a girl like her must make her hay while the sun shines she cant go on fallalling with you and then nothing to come of it you mustnt suppose shes to lose her market that way  god knows i should be sorry to injure her mrs davis  i believe you would because i take you for an honourable gentleman as will be as good as your word now theres peppermint there  what that fellow in the parlour  and an honourable gentleman he is not that i mean to compare him to you mr tudor nor yet doesnt norah not by no means but there he is well he comes with the most honourablest proposals and will make her mrs peppermint tomorrow if so be that shell have it  you dont mean to say that there has been anything between them said charley who in spite of the intense desire which he had felt a few minutes since to get the lovely norah altogether off his hands now felt an acute pang of jealousy you dont mean to say that there has been anything between them  nothing as you have any right to object to mr tudor you may be sure i wouldnt allow of that nor yet wouldnt norah demean herself to it  then how did she get talking to him  she didnt get talking to him but he has eyes in his head and you dont suppose but what he can see with them if a girl is in the public line of course any man is free to speak to her if you dont like it it is for you to take her out of it not but what for a girl that is in the public line norah geraghty keeps herself to herself as much as any girl you ever set eyes on  what the d has she to do with this fellow then  why hes a widower and has three young children and hes looking out for a mother for them and he thinks norah will suit there now you have the truth and the whole truth  d his impudence said charley  well i dont see that theres any impudence he has a house of his own and the means to keep it now ill tell you what it is norah cant abide him  charley looked a little better satisfied when he heard this declaration  norah cant abide the sight of him nor wont of any man as long as you are hanging after her shes as true as steel and proud you ought to be of her proud thought charley as he again muttered to himself excelsiorbut mr tudor i wont see her put upon thats the long and the short of it if you like to take her there she is i dont say shes just your equal as to breeding though shes come of decent people too but shes good as gold shell make a shilling go as far as any young woman i know and if £100 or £150 are wanting for furniture or the like of that why ive that regard for her that that shant stand in the way now mr tudor ive spoke honest and if youre the gentleman as i takes you to be youll do the same  to do mrs davis justice it must be acknowledged that in her way she had spoken honestly of course she knew that such a marriage would be a dreadful misalliance for young tudor of course she knew that all his friends would be heartbroken when they heard of it but what had she to do with his friends her sympathies her good wishes were for her friend had norah fallen a victim to charleys admiration and then been cast off to eat the bitterest bread to which any human being is ever doomed what then would charleys friends have cared for her there was a fair fight between them if norah geraghty as a reward for her prudence could get a husband in a rank of life above her instead of falling into utter destruction as might so easily have been the case who could do other than praise herpraise her and her clever friend who had so assisted her in her struggle    dolus an virtus  had mrs davis ever studied the classics she would have thus expressed herself  poor charley was altogether thrown on his beamends he had altogether played mrs daviss game in evincing jealousy at mr peppermints attentions he knew this and yet for the life of him he could not help being jealous he wanted to get rid of miss geraghty and yet he could not endure that anyone else should lay claim to her favour he was very weak he knew how much depended on the way in which he might answer this woman at the present moment he knew that he ought now to make it plain to her that however foolish he might have been however false he might have been it was quite out of the question that he should marry her barmaid but he did not do so he was worse than weak it was not only the disinclination to give pain or even the dread of the storm that would ensue which deterred him but an absurd dislike to think that mr peppermint should be graciously received there as the barmaids acknowledged admirer  is she really ill now said he  shes not so ill but what she shall make herself well enough to welcome you if youll say the word that you ought to say the most that ails her is fretting at the long delaybolt the door child and go to bed there will be no one else here now go up and tell miss geraghty to come down she hasnt got her clothes off yet i know  mrs davis was too good a general to press charley for an absolute immediate fixed answer to her question she knew that she had already gained much by talking thus of the proposed marriage by setting it thus plainly before charley without rebuke or denial from him he had not objected to receiving a visit from norah on the implied understanding that she was to come down to him as his affianced bride he had not agreed to this in words but silence gives consent and mrs davis felt that should it ever hereafter become necessary to prove anything what had passed would enable her to prove a good deal  charley puffed at his cigar and sipped his gin and water it was now twelve oclock and he thoroughly wished himself at home and in bed the longer he thought of it the more impossible it appeared that he should get out of the house without the scene which he dreaded the girl had bolted the door put away her cups and mugs and her step upstairs had struck heavily on his ears the house was not large or high and he fancied that he heard mutterings on the landingplace indeed he did not doubt but that miss geraghty had listened to most of the conversation which had taken place  excuse me a minute mr tudor said mrs davis who was now smiling and civil enough i will go upstairs myself the silly girl is shamefaced and does not like to come down and up went mrs davis to see that her barmaids curls and dress were nice and jaunty it would not do now at this moment for norah to offend her lover by any untidiness charley for a moment thought of the front door the enemy had allowed him an opportunity for retreating he might slip out before either of the women came down and then never more be heard of in norfolk street again he had his hand in his waistcoat pocket with the intent of leaving the sovereign on the table but when the moment came he felt ashamed of the pusillanimity of such an escape and therefore stood or rather sat his ground with a courage worthy of a better purpose  down the two women came and charley felt his heart beating against his ribs as the steps came nearer the door he began to wish that mr peppermint had been successful the widow entered the room first and at her heels the expectant beauty we can hardly say that she was blushing but she did look rather shamefaced and hung back a little at the door as though she still had half a mind to think better of it and go off to her bed  come in you little fool said mrs davis you neednt be ashamed of coming down to see him you have done that often enough before now  norah simpered and sidled well im sure now said she heres a start mr tudor to be brought downstairs at this time of night and im sure i dont know what its about and then she shook her curls and twitched her dress and made as though she were going to pass through the room to her accustomed place at the bar  norah geraghty was a fine girl putting her in comparison with miss golightly we are inclined to say that she was the finer girl of the two and that barring position money and fashion she was qualified to make the better wife in point of education that is the effects of education there was not perhaps much to choose between them norah could make an excellent pudding and was willing enough to exercise her industry and art in doing so miss golightly could copy music but she did not like the trouble and could play a waltz badly neither of them had ever read anything beyond a few novels in this respect as to the amount of labour done miss golightly had certainly far surpassed her rival competitor for charleys affections  charley got up and took her hand and as he did so he saw that her nails were dirty he put his arms round her waist and kissed her and as he caressed her his olfactory nerves perceived that the pomatum in her hair was none of the best he thought of those young lustrous eyes that would look up so wondrously into his face he thought of the gentle touch which would send a thrill through all his nerves and then he felt very sick  well upon my word mr tudor said miss geraghty youre making very free tonight she did not however refuse to sit down on his knee though while sitting there she struggled and tossed herself and shook her long ringlets in charleys face till he wished hersafe at home in mr peppermints nursery  and is that what you brought me down for mrs davis said norah well upon my word i hope the doors locked we shall have all the world in here else  if you hadnt come down to him hed have come up to you said mrs davis  would he though said norah i think he knows a trick worth two of that and she looked as though she knew well how to defend herself if any overzeal on the part of her lover should ever induce him to violate the sanctum of her feminine retirement  there was no overzeal now about charley he ought to have been happy enough for he had his charmer in his arms but he showed very little of the ecstatic joy of a favoured lover there he sat with norah in his arms and as we have said norah was a handsome girl but he would much sooner have been copying the kennett and avon canal lock entries in mr snapes room at the internal navigation  lawks mr tudor you neednt hold me so tight said norah  he means to hold you tight enough now said mrs davis hes very angry because i mentioned another gentlemans name  well now you didnt said norah pretending to look very angry  well i just did and if youd only seen him you must be very careful what you say to that gentleman or therell be a row in the house  i said norah what i say to him its very little i have to say to the man but i shall tell him this hed better take himself somewhere else if hes going to make himself troublesome  all this time charley had said nothing but was sitting with his hat on his head and his cigar in his mouth the latter appendage he had laid down for a moment when he saluted miss geraghty but he had resumed it having at the moment no intention of repeating the compliment  and so you were jealous were you said she turning round and looking at him well now some people might have more respect for other people than to mix up their names that way with the names of any men that choose to put themselves forward what would you say if i was to talk to you about miss  charley stopped her mouth it was not to be borne that she should be allowed to pronounce the name that was about to fall from her lips  so you were jealous were you said she when she was again able to speak well my  mrs davis told me flatly that you were going to marry the man said charley so what was i to think  it doesnt matter what you think now said mrs davis for you must be off from this do you know what oclock it is do you want the house to get a bad name come you two understand each other now so you may as well give over billing and cooing for this time its all settled now isnt it mr tudor  oh yes i suppose so said charley  well and what do you say norah  oh im sure im agreeable if he is ha ha ha i only hope he wont think me too forwardhe he he  and then with another kiss and very few more words of any sort charley took himself off  ill have nothing more to do with him said norah bursting into tears as soon as the door was well bolted after charleys exit im only losing myself with him he dont mean anything and i said he didnt all along hed have pitched me to old scratch while i was sitting there on his knee if hed have had his own wayso he would and poor norah cried heartily as she went to her work in her usual way among the bottles and taps  why you fool you what do you expect you dont think hes to jump down your throat do you you can but try it on and then if it dont do why theres the other one to fall back on only if i had the choice id rather have young tudor too  so would i said norah i cant abide that other fellow  well there thats how it is you knowbeggars cant be choosers but come make us a drop of something hot a little drop will do yourself good but its better not to take it before him unless when he presses you  so the two ladies sat down to console themselves as best they might for the reverses which trade and love so often bring with them  charley walked off a miserable man he was thoroughly ashamed of himself thoroughly acknowledged his own weakness and yet as he went out from the cat and whistle he felt sure that he should return there again to renew the degradation from which he had suffered this night indeed what else could he do now he had as it were solemnly plighted his troth to the girl before a third person who had brought them together with the acknowledged purpose of witnessing that ceremony he had before mrs davis and before the girl herself heard her spoken of as his wife and had agreed to the understanding that such an arrangement was a settled thing what else had he to do now but to return and complete his part of the bargain what else but that and be a wretched miserable degraded man for the rest of his days lower viler more contemptible infinitely lower even than his brother clerics at the office whom in his pride he had so much despised  he walked from norfolk street into the strand and there the world was still alive though it was now nearly one oclock the debauched misery the wretched outdoor midnight revelry of the world was there streaming in and out from ginpalaces and bawling itself hoarse with horrid discordant screechowl slang but he went his way unheeding and uncontaminated now now that it was useless he was thinking of the better things of the world nothing now seemed worth his grasp nothing now seemed pleasurable nothing capable of giving joy but what was decent good reputable cleanly and polished how he hated now that lower world with which he had for the last three years condescended to pass so much of his time how he hated himself for his own vileness he thought of what alaric was of what norman was of what he himself might have beenhe that was praised by mrs woodward for his talent he that was encouraged to place himself among the authors of the day he thought of all this and then he thought of what he wasthe affianced husband of norah geraghty  he went along the strand over the crossing under the statue of charles on horseback and up pall mall east till he came to the opening into the park under the duke of yorks column the london night world was all alive as he made his way from the opera colonnade shrill voices shrieked out at him as he passed and drunken men coming down from the night supperhouses in the haymarket saluted him with affectionate cordiality the hoarse waterman from the cabstand whose voice had perished in the night air croaked out at him the offer of a vehicle and one of the night beggarwomen who cling like burrs to those who roam the street a these unhallowed hours still stuck to him as she had done ever since he had entered the strand  get away with you said charley turning at the wretched creature in his fierce anger get away or ill give you in charge  that you may never know what it is to be in misery yourself said the miserable irishwoman  if you follow me a step farther ill have you locked up said charley  oh then its you that have the hard heart said she and its you that will suffer yet  charley looked round threw her the odd halfpence which he had in his pocket and then turned down towards the column the woman picked up her prize and with a speedy blessing took herself off in search of other prey  his way home would have taken him up waterloo place but the space round the column was now deserted and quiet and sauntering there without thinking of what he did he paced up and down between the clubs and the steps leading into the park there walking to and fro slowly he thought of his past career of all the circumstances of his life since his life had been left to his own control and of the absence of all hope for the future  what was he to do he was deeply inextricably in debt that wretch mruen had his name on bills which it was impossible that he should ever pay tradesmen held other bills of his which were either now overdue or would very shortly become so he was threatened with numerous writs any one of which would suffice to put him into gaol from his poor father burdened as he was with other children he knew that he had no right to expect further assistance he was in debt to norman his best he would have said his only friend had it not been that in all his misery he could not help still thinking of mrs woodward as his friend  and yet how could his venture to think longer of her contaminated as he now was with the horrid degradation of his acknowledged love at the cat and whistle no he must think no more of the woodwards he must dream no more of those angel eyes which in his waking moments had so often peered at him out of heaven teaching him to think of higher things giving him higher hopes than those which had come to him from the working of his own unaided spirit ah lessons taught in vain vain hopes lessons that had come all too late hopes that had been cherished only to be deceived it was all over now he had made his bed and he must lie on it he had sown his seed and he must reap his produce there was now no excelsior left for him within the bounds of human probability  he had promised to go to hampton with harry norman on saturday and he would go there for the last time he would go there and tell mrs woodward so much of the truth as he could bring himself to utter he would say farewell to that blest abode he would take lindas soft hand in his for the last time for the last time he would hear the young silverringing happy voice of his darling katie for the last time look into her bright face for the last time play with her as with a child of heavenand then he would return to the cat and whistle  and having made this resolve he went home to his lodgings it was singular that in all his misery the idea hardly once occurred to him of setting himself right in the world by accepting his cousins offer of miss golightlys hand and fortune    chapter xxi  hampton court bridge   before the following saturday afternoon charleys spirits had somewhat recovered their natural tone not that he was in a happy frame of mind the united energies of mr mruen and mrs davis had been too powerful to allow of that not that he had given over his projected plan of saying a long farewell to mrs woodward or at any rate of telling her something of his position he still felt that he could not continue to live on terms of close intimacy both with her daughters and with norah geraghty but the spirits of youth are ever buoyant and the spirits of no one could be endowed with more natural buoyancy than those of the young navvy charley therefore in spite of his misfortunes was ready with his manuscript when saturday afternoon arrived and according to agreement met norman at the railway station  only one evening had intervened since the night in which he had ratified his matrimonial engagement and in spite of the delicate nature of his position he had for that evening allowed mr peppermint to exercise his eloquence on the heart of the fair norah without interruption he the while had been engaged in completing the memoirs of crinoline and macassar  well charley they asked one and all as soon as he reached the cottage have you got the story have you brought the manuscript is it all finished and ready for that dreadful editor  charley produced a roll and linda and katie instantly pounced upon it  oh it begins with poetry said linda  i am so glad said katie is there much poetry in it charley i do so hope there is  not a word of it said charley that which linda sees is a song that the heroine is singing and it isnt supposed to be written by the author at all  im so sorry that theres no poetry said katie cant you write poetry charley  at any rate theres lots of love in it said linda who was turning over the pages  is there said katie well thats next best but they should go together you should have put all your love into verse charley and then your prose would have done for the funny parts  perhaps its all fun said mrs woodward but come girls this is not fair i wont let you look at the story till its read in full committee and so saying mrs woodward took the papers from her daughters and tying them up deposited them safe in custody well have it out when the teathings are gone  but before the teathings had come an accident happened which had been like to dismiss crinoline and macassar altogether from the minds of the whole of the woodward family the young men had as usual dined in town and therefore they were all able to spend the long summer evening out of doors normans boat was down at hampton and it was therefore determined that they should row down as far as hampton court park and back charley and norman were to row and mrs woodward agreed to accompany her daughters uncle bat was left at home to his nap and rum and water  norman was so expert a thames waterman that he was quite able to manage the boat without a steersman and charley was nearly his equal but there is some amusement in steering and katie was allowed to sit between the tillerropes  i can steer very well mamma cant i harry i always steer when we go to the island and we run the boat straight into the little creek only just broad enough to hold it katies visits to the island however were not so frequent as they had heretofore been for she was approaching to sixteen years of age and wet feet and draggled petticoats had lost some of their charms mrs woodward trusting more to the experience of her two knights than to the skill of the lady at the helm took her seat and they went off merrily down the stream  all the world knows that it is but a very little distance from hampton church to hampton court bridge especially when one has the stream with one they were very soon near to the bridge and as they approached it they had to pass a huge barge that was lazily making its way down to brentford  theres lots of tune for the big arch said charley  pull away then said harry  they both pulled hard and shot alongside and past the barge but the stream was strong and the great ugly mass of black timber moved behind them quicker than it seemed to do  it will be safer to take the one to the left said harry  oh theres lots of tune said charley  no said harry do as i tell you and go to the leftpull your left hand a little katie  charley did as he was bid and katie intended to do the same but unfortunately she pulled the wrong hand they were now very near the bridge and the barge was so close to them as to show that there might have been danger in attempting to get through the same arch with her  your left hand katie your left shouted norman your left string katie was confused and gave first a pull with her right and then a pull with her left and then a strong pull with her right the two men backed water as hard as they could but the effect of katies steering was to drive the nose of the boat right into one of the wooden piers of the bridge  the barge went on its way and luckily made its entry under the arch before the little craft had swung round into the stream before it as it was the boat still clinging by its nose came round with its stern against the side of the barge and as the latter went on the timbers of normans wherry cracked and crumpled in the rude encounter  the ladies should all have kept their seats mrs woodward did do so linda jumped up and being next to the barge was pulled up into it by one of the men katie stood bolt upright with the tillerropes still in her hand awestruck at the misfortune she had caused but while she was so standing the stern of the boat was lifted nearly out of the water by the weight of the barge and katie was pitched behind her mothers back head foremost into the water  norman at the moment was endeavouring to steady the boat and shove it off from the barge and had also lent a hand to assist linda in her escape charley was on the other side standing up and holding on by the piers of the bridge keeping his eyes on the ladies so as to be of assistance to them when assistance might be needed  and now assistance was sorely needed and luckily had not to be long waited for charley with a light and quick step passed over the thwarts and disregarding mrs woodwards scream let himself down over the gunwale behind her seat into the water katie can hardly be said to have sunk at all she had at least never been so much under the water as to be out of sight her clothes kept up her light body and when charley got close to her she had been carried up to the piers of the bridge and was panting with her head above water and beating the stream with her little hands  she was soon again in comparative safety charley had her by one arm as he held on with the other to the boat and kept himself afloat with his legs mrs woodward leaned over and caught her daughters clothes while linda who had seen what had happened stood shrieking on the barge as it made its way on heedless of the ruin it left behind  another boat soon came to their assistance from the shore and mrs woodward and katie were got safely into it charley returned to the battered wherry and assisted norman in extricating it from its position and a third boat went to lindas rescue who would otherwise have found herself in rather an uncomfortable position the next morning at brentford  the hugging and kissing to which katie was subjected when she was carried up to the inn near the boatslip on the surrey side of the river may be imagined as may also the faces she made at the wineglassful of stiff brandy and water which she was desired to drink she was carried home in a fly and by the time she arrived there had so completely recovered her life and spirits as to put a vehement negative on her mothers proposition that she should at once go to bed  and not hear dear charleys story said she with tears in her eyes and mamma i cant and wont go to bed without seeing charley i didnt say one word yet to thank him for jumping into the water after me  it was in vain that her mother told her that charleys story would amuse her twice as much when she should read it printed it was in vain that mrs woodward assured her that charley should come up to her room door and hear her thanks as he stood in the passage with the door ajar katie was determined to hear the story read it must be read if read at all that saturday night as it was to be sent to the editor in the course of the week and reading crinoline and macassar out loud on a sunday was not to be thought of at surbiton cottage katie was determined to hear the story read and to sit very near the author too during the reading to sit near him and to give him such praise as even in her young mind she felt that an author would like to hear charley had pulled her out of the river and no one as far as her efforts could prevent it should be allowed to throw cold water on him  norman and charley wet as the latter was contrived to bring the shattered boat back to hampton when they reached the lawn at surbiton cottage they were both in high spirits an accident if it does no material harm is always an inspiriting thing unless one feels that it has been attributable to ones own fault neither of them could in this instance attach any blame to himself and each felt that he had done what in him lay to prevent the possible ill effect of the mischance as for the boat harry was too happy to think that none of his friends were hurt to care much about that  as they walked across the lawn mrs woodward ran out to them my dear dear charley she said what am i to say to thank you it was the first time mrs woodward had ever called him by his christian name it had hitherto made him in a certain degree unhappy that she never did so and now the sound was very pleasant to him  oh mrs woodward said he laughing you mustnt touch me for im all mud  my dear dear charley what can i say to you and dear harry i fear weve spoilt your beautiful new boat  i fear weve spoilt katies beautiful new hat said norman  mrs woodward had taken and pressed a hand of each of them in spite of charleys protestations about the mud  oh youre in a dreadful state said she you had better take something at once youll catch your death of cold  id better take myself off to the inn said charley and get some clean clothes thats all i want but how is katieand how is linda  and so after a multitude of such inquiries on both sides and of all manner of affectionate greetings charley went off to make himself dry preparatory to the reading of the manuscript  during his absence linda and katie came down to the drawingroom linda was full of fun as to her journey with the bargeman but katie was a little paler than usual and somewhat more serious and quiet than she was wont to be  norman was the first in the drawingroom and received the thanks of the ladies for his prowess in assisting them and charley was not slow to follow him for he was never very long at his toilet he came in with a jaunty laughing air as though nothing particular had happened and as if he had not a care in the world and yet while he had been dressing he had been thinking almost more than ever of norah geraghty o that she and mrs davis with her and jabesh mruen with both of them could be buried ten fathom deep out of his sight and out of his mind  when he entered the room katie felt her heart beat so strongly that she hardly knew how to thank him for saving her life a year ago she would have got up and kissed him innocently but a year makes a great difference she could not do that now so she gave him her little hand and held his till he came and sat down at his place at the table  oh charley i dont know what to say to you said she and he could see and feel that her whole body was shaking with emotion  then ill tell you what to say charley here is your tea and some bread and some butter and some jam and some muffin for ill tell you what my evening bath has made me as hungry as a hunter i hope it has done the same to you  katie still holding his hand looked up into his face and he saw that her eyes were suffused with tears she then left his side and running round the room filled a plate with all the things he had asked for and bringing them to him again took her place beside him i wish i knew how to do more than that said she  i suppose charley youll have to make an entry about that barge on monday morning wont you said linda mind you put in it how beautiful i looked sailing through the arch   yes and how very gallant the bargeman was said norman  yes and how much you enjoyed the idea of going down the river with him while we came back to the cottage said charley well put it all down at the navigation and old snape shall make a special minute about it  katie drank her tea in silence and tried to eat though without much success when chatting voices and jokes were to be heard at the cottage the sound of her voice was usually the foremost but now she sat demure and quiet she was realizing the danger from which she had escaped and as is so often the case was beginning to fear it now that it was over  ah katie my bonny bird said her mother seeing that she was not herself and knowing that the excitement and overpowering feelings of gratitude were too much for hercome here you should be in bed my foolish little puss should you not  indeed she should said uncle bat who was somewhat hardhearted about the affair of the accident and had been cruel enough after hearing an account of it to declare that it was all katies fault  indeed she should and if she had gone to bed a little earlier in the evening it would have been all the better for master normans boat  oh mamma dont send me to bed said she with tears in her eyes pray dont send me to bed now im quite well only i cant talk because im thinking of what charley did for me and so saying she got up and hiding her face on her mothers shoulder burst into tears  my dearest child said mrs woodward im afraid youll make yourself ill well put off the reading wont we charley we have done enough for one evening  of course we will said he reading a stupid story will be very slow work after all weve gone through today  no no no said katie it shant be put off there wont be any other time for hearing it and mamma it must be read and i know it wont be stupid oh mamma dear mamma do let us hear it read im quite well now  mrs woodward found herself obliged to give way she had not the heart to bid her daughter go away to bed nor had she done so would it have been of any avail katie would only have lain and sobbed in her own room and very probably have gone into hysterics the best thing for her was to try to turn the current of her thoughts and thus by degrees tame down her excited feelings  well darling then we will have the story if charley will let us go and fetch it dearest katie raised herself from her mothers bosom and going across the room fetched the roll of papers to charley as he prepared to take it she took his hand in hers and bending her head over it tenderly kissed it you mustnt think said she that because i say nothing i dont know what it is that youve done for me but i dont know how to say it  charley was at any rate as ignorant what he ought to say as katie was he felt the pressure of her warm lips on his hand and hardly knew where he was he felt that he blushed and looked abashed and dreaded fearfully dreaded lest mrs woodward should surmise that he estimated at other than its intended worth her daughters show of affection for him  i shouldnt mind doing it every night said he in such weather as this i think it rather good fun going into the water with my clothes on katie looked up at him through her tears as though she would say that she well understood what that meant  mrs woodward saw that if the story was to be read the sooner they began it the better  come charley said she now for the romance katie come and sit by me but katie had already taken her seat a little behind charley quite in the shade and she was not to be moved  but i wont read it myself said charley you must read it mrs woodward  o yes mrs woodward you are to read it said norman  o yes do read it manna said linda  katie said nothing but she would have preferred that charley should have read it himself  well if i can said mrs woodward  snape says i write the worst hand in all somerset house said charley but still i think youll be able to manage it  i hate that mr snape said katie sotto voce and then mrs woodward unrolled the manuscript and began her task    chapter xxii  crinoline and macassar or my aunts will   well linda was right said mrs woodward it does begin with poetry  its only a song said charley apologeticallyand after all there is only one verse of thatand then mrs woodward began  crinoline and macassar  ladies and gentlemen that is the name of mr charles tudors new novel  crinoline and macassar said uncle bat are they intended for human beings names  they are the heroine and the hero as i take it said mrs woodward and i presume them to be human unless they turn out to be celestial  i never heard such names in my life said the captain  at any rate uncle they are as good as sir jib boom and captain hardaport said katie pertly  we wont mind about that said mrs woodward im going to begin and i beg i may not be interrupted  crinoline and macassar  the lovely crinoline was sitting alone at a lattice window on a summer morning and as she sat she sang with melancholy cadence the first part of the now celebrated song which had then lately appeared from the distinguished pen of sir g h  who is sir g h charley  oh it wouldnt do for me to tell that said charley that must be left to the tact and intelligence of my readers  oh very well said mrs woodward we will abstain from all impertinent questionsfrom the distinguished pen of sir g h the ditty which she sang ran as follows    my hearts at my office my heart is always there   my hearts at my office docketing with care   docketing the papers and copying all day   my hearts at my office though i be far away  ah me said the lady crinoline  whatis she a peers daughter said uncle bat  not exactly said charley its only a sort of semipoetic way one has of speaking of ones heroine  ah me said the lady crinolinehis heart his hearti wonder whether he has got a heart and then she sang again in low plaintive voice the first line of the song suiting the cadence to her own case    his heart is at his office his heart is always there  it was evident that the lady crinoline did not repeat the words in the feeling of their great author who when he wrote them had intended to excite to high deeds of exalted merit that portion of the british youth which is employed in the civil service of the country  crinoline laid down her luteit was in fact an accordionand gazing listlessly over the rails of the balcony looked out at the green foliage which adorned the enclosure of the square below  it was tavistock square the winds of march and the showers of april had been successful in producing the buds of may  ah charley thats taken from the old song said katie only youve put buds instead of flowers  thats quite allowable said mrs woodwardsuccessful in producing the buds of may the sparrows chirped sweetly on the housetop and the coming summer gladdened the hearts of allof all except poor crinoline  i wonder whether he has a heart said she and if he has i wonder whether it is at his office  as she thus soliloquized the door was opened by a youthful page on whose wellformed breast buttons seemed to grow like mushrooms in the meadows in august  mr macassar jones said the page and having so said he discreetly disappeared he was in his line of life a valuable member of society he had brought from his last place a twelvemonths character that was creditable alike to his head and heart he was now found to be a trustworthy assistant in the household of the lady crinolines mother and was the delight of his aged parents to whom he regularly remitted no inconsiderable portion of his wages let it always be remembered that the life even of a page may be glorious all honour to the true and brave  goodness charleyhow very moral you are said linda  yes said he thats indispensable its the intention of the daily delight always to hold up a career of virtue to the lower orders as the thing that pays honesty high wages and hot dinners those are our principles  youll have a deal to do before youll bring the lower orders to agree with you said uncle bat  we have a deal to do said charley and well do it the power of the cheap press is unbounded  as the page closed the door a light low melancholy step was heard to make its way across the drawingroom crinolines heart had given one start when she had heard the announcement of the wellknown name she had once glanced with eager inquiring eye towards the door but not in vain to her had an excellent mother taught the proprieties of elegant life long before macassar jones was present in the chamber she had snatched up the tambourframe that lay beside her and when he entered she was zealously engaged on the foxs head that was to ornament the toe of a leftfoot slipper who shall dare to say that those slippers were intended to grace the feet of macassar jones  but i suppose they were said katie  you must wait and see said her mother for my part i am not at all so sure of that  oh but i know they must be for shes in love with him said katie  oh mr macassar said the lady crinoline when he had drawn nigh to her and how are you today this mention of his christian name betrayed no undue familiarity as the two families were intimate and macassar had four elder brothers i am so sorry mamma is not at home she will regret not seeing you amazingly  macassar had his hat in his hand and he stood a while gazing at the fox in the pattern wont you sit down said crinoline  is it very dusty in the street today asked crinoline and as she spoke she turned upon him a face wreathed in the sweetest smiles radiant with elegant courtesy and altogether expressive of extreme gentility unsullied propriety and a very high tone of female education is it very dusty in the street today  charmed by the involuntary grace of her action macassar essayed to turn his head towards her as he replied he could not turn it much for he wore an allrounder but still he was enabled by a side glance to see more of that finished elegance than was perhaps good for his peace of mind  yes said he it is dustyit certainly is dusty ratherbut not veryand then in most streets theyve got the watercarts  ah i love those watercarts said crinoline the dust you know is so trying  to the complexion suggested macassar again looking round as best he might over the bulwark of his collar  crinoline laughed slightly it was perhaps hardly more than a simper and turning her lovely eyes from her work she said well to the complexion if you will what would you gentlemen say if we ladies were to be careless of our complexions  macassar merely sighed gentlyperhaps he had no fitting answer perhaps his heart was too full for him to answer he sat with his eye fixed on his hat which still dangled in his hand but his minds eye was far away  is it in his office thought crinoline to herself or is it here is it anywhere  have you learnt the song i sent you said he at last waking as it were from a trance  not yet said shethat is not quite that is i could not sing it before strangers yet  strangers said macassar and he looked at her again with an energy that produced results not beneficial either to his neck or his collar  crinoline was delighted at this expression of feeling at any rate it is somewhere said she to herself and it can hardly be all at his office  well i will not say strangers she said out loud it sounds it soundsi dont know how it sounds but what i mean is that as yet ive only sung it before mamma  i declare i dont know which is the biggest fool of the two said uncle bat very rudely as for him if i had him on the forecastle of a manofwar for a day or two id soon teach him to speak out  you forget sir said charley hes not a sailor hes only in the civil service were all very bashful in the civil service  i think he is rather spooney i must say said katie whereupon mrs woodward went on reading  its a sweet thing isnt it said macassar  oh very said crinoline with a rapturous expression which pervaded her whole head and shoulders as well as her face and bustvery sweet and so new  it quite comes home to me said macassar and he sighed deeply  then it is at his office said crinoline to herself and she sighed also  they both sat silent for a while looking into the squarecrinoline was at one window and macassar at the other i must go now said he i promised to be back at three  back where said she  at my office said he  crinoline sighed after all it was at his office it was too evident that it was there and nowhere else well and why should it not be there why should not macassar jones be true to his duty and to his country what had she to do with his heart why should she wish it elsewhere twas thus she tried to console herself but in vain had she had an office of her own it might perhaps have been different but crinoline was only a woman and often she sighed over the degradation of her lot  good morning miss crinoline said he  good morning mr macassar said she mamma will so regret that she has lost the pleasure of seeing you  and then she rung the bell macassar went downstairs perhaps somewhat slower with perhaps more of melancholy than when he entered the page opened the halldoor with alacrity and shut it behind him with a slam  all honour to the true and brave  crinoline again took up the note of her sorrow and with her lute in her hand she warbled forth the line which stuck like a thorn in her sweet bosom  his heart is in his officehis heart is always there  there said mrs woodward thats the end of the first chapter  well i like the page the best said linda because he seems to know what he is about  oh so does the lady said charley but it wouldnt at all do if we made the hero and heroine go about their work like humdrum people youll see that the lady crinoline knows very well whats what  oh charley pray dont tell us said katie i do so like mr macassar he is so spooney pray go on mamma  im ready said mrs woodward again taking up the manuscript  chapter ii  the lovely crinoline was the only daughter of fond parents and though they were not what might be called extremely wealthy considering the vast incomes of some residents in the metropolis and were not perhaps wont to mix in the highest circles of the belgravian aristocracy yet she was enabled to dress in all the elegance of fashion and contrived to see a good deal of that society which moves in the highly respectable neighbourhood of russell square and gower street  her dresses were made at the distinguished establishment of madame mantalini in hanover square at least she was in the habit of getting one dress there every other season and this was quite sufficient among her friends to give her a reputation for dealing in the proper quarter once she had got a bonnet direct from paris which gave her ample opportunity of expressing a frequent opinion not favourable to the fabricators of a british article she always took care that her shoes had within them the name of a french cordonnier and her gloves were made to order in the rue du bac though usually bought and paid for in tottenham court road  what a false creature said linda  false said charley and how is a girl to get along if she be not false what girl could live for a moment before the world if she were to tell the whole truth about the getup of her wardrobethe patchings and makebelieves the chipped ribbons and turned silks the little bills here and the little bills there how else is an allowance of £20 a year to be made compatible with an appearance of unlimited income how else are young men to be taught to think that in an affair of dress money is a matter of no moment whatsoever  oh charley charley dont be slanderous said mrs woodward  i only repeat what the editor says to mei know nothing about it myself only we are requested to hold the mirror up to natureand to art too i believe we are to set these things right you know  wewho are we said katie  why the daily delight said charley  but i hope theres nothing false in patching and turning said mrs woodward for if there be im the falsest woman alive    to gar the auld claes look amaist as weels the new  is i thought one of the most legitimate objects of a womans diligence  it all depends on the spirit of the stitches said charley the censor  well i must say i dont like mending up old clothes a bit better than charley does said katie but pray go on mamma so mrs woodward continued to read  on the day of macassars visit in tavistock square crinoline was dressed in a most elegant morning costume it was a very light barege muslin extremely full and which as she had assured her friend miss manasseh of keppel street had been sent home from the establishment in hanover square only the day before i am aware that miss manasseh instantly propagated an illnatured report that she had seen the identical dress in a milliners room up two pairs back in store street but then miss manasseh was known to be envious and had moreover seen twelve seasons out in those localities whereas the fair crinoline young thing had graced tavistock square only for two years and her mother was ready to swear that she had never passed the nursery door till she came there the ground of the dress was a light peagreen and the pattern was ivy wreaths entwined with pansies and tulipseach flounce showed a separate wreathand there were nine flounces the highest of which fairy circles was about three inches below the smallest waist that ever was tightly girded in steel and whalebone  macassar had once declared in a moment of ecstatic energy that a small waist was the chiefest grace in woman how often had the lady crinolines maid when in the extreme agony of her labour put a malediction on his name on account of this speech  it is unnecessary to speak of the drapery of the arms which showed the elaborate lace of the sleeve beneath and sometimes also the pearly whiteness of that rounded arm this was a sight which would almost drive macassar to distraction at such moments as that the hopes of the patriotic poet for the good of the civil service were not strictly fulfilled in the heart of macassar jones oh if the lady crinoline could but have known  it is unnecessary also to describe the strange and hidden mechanism of that mysterious petticoat which gave such full dimensions such ample sweeping proportions to the tout ensemble of the ladys appearance it is unnecessary and would perhaps be improper and as far as i am concerned is certainly impossible  here charley blushed as mrs woodward looked at him from over the top of the paper  let it suffice to say that she could envelop a sofa without the slightest effort throw her draperies a yard and a half from her on either side without any appearance of stretching completely fill a carriage or which was more frequently her fate entangle herself all but inextricably in a cab  a word however must be said of those little feet that peeped out now and again so beautifully from beneath the artistic constructions above alluded toof the feet or perhaps rather of the shoes but yet what can be said of them successfully that french name so correctly spelt so elaborately accented so beautifully finished in gold letters which from their form however one would say that the cordonnier must have imported from england was only visible to those favoured knights who were occasionally permitted to carry the shoes home in their pockets  but a word must be said about the hair dressed à limperatrice redolent of the sweetest patchouli disclosing all the glories of that ingenuous but perhaps too open brow a word must be said but alas how inefficacious to do justice to the ingenuity so wonderfully displayed the hair of the lady crinoline was perhaps more lovely than abundant to produce that glorious effect that effect which has now symbolized among english lasses the headdress à limperatrice as the one idea of feminine beauty every hair was called on to give its separate aid as is the case with so many of us who are anxious to put our best foot foremost everything was abstracted from the rear in order to create a show in the front then to complete the garniture of the head to make all perfect to leave no point of escape for the susceptible admirer of modern beauty some dorsal appendage was necessary of mornings as well as in the more fully bedizened period of evening society  everything about the sweet crinoline was wont to be green it is the sweetest and most innocent of colours but alas a colour dangerous for the hearts ease of youthful beauty hanging from the back of her head were to be seen moss and fennel and various grassesrye grass and timothy trefoil and cinquefoil vetches and clover and here and there young fern a story was told but doubtless false as it was traced to the mouth of miss manasseh that once while crinoline was reclining in a paddock at richmond having escaped with the young macassar from the heat of a neighbouring drawingroom a cow had attempted to feed from her head  oh charley a cow said katie  well but you see i dont give it as true said charley  i shall never get it done if katie wont hold her tongue said mrs woodward  but perhaps it was when at the seaside in september at broadstairs herne bay or dover crinoline and her mamma invigorated themselves with the seabreezes of the oceanperhaps it was there that she was enabled to assume that covering for her head in which her soul most delighted it was a tom and jerry hat turned up at the sides with a short but knowing feather velvet trimmings and a steel buckle blinking brightly in the noonday sun had macassar seen her in this he would have yielded himself her captive at once quarter or no quarter it was the most marked and perhaps the most attractive peculiarity of the lady crinolines face that the end of her nose was a little turned up this charm in unison with the upturned edges of her cruelhearted hat was found by many men to be invincible  we all know how dreadful is the spectacle of a saracens head as it appears or did appear painted on a huge board at the top of snow hill from that we are left to surmise with what tremendous audacity of countenance with what terrorstriking preparations of the outward man an eastern army is led to battle can any men so fearfully bold in appearance ever turn their backs and fly they look as though they could destroy by the glance of their ferocious eyes who could withstand the hirsute horrors of those fiery faces  there is just such audacity a courage of a similar description perhaps we may say an equal invincibility in the charms of those tom and jerry hats when duly put on over a face of the proper descriptionover such a face as that of the lady crinoline they give to the wearer an appearance of concentration of pluck but as the eastern array does quail before the quiet valour of europe so we may perhaps say does the open quick audacity of the tom and jerry tend to less powerful results than the modest enduring patience of the bonnet  so ends the second chapterbravo charley said mrs woodward in the name of the british female public i beg to thank you for your exertions  the editor said i was to write down turnedup hats said charley i rather like them myself  i hope my new slouch is not an audacious saracens head said linda  or mine said katie but you may say what you like about them now for mine is drowned  come girls there are four more chapters i see let me finish it and then we can discuss it afterwards  chapter iii  having thus described the lady crinoline  you havent described her at all said linda you havent got beyond her clothes yet  there is nothing beyond them said charley  you havent even described her face said katie you have only said that she had a turnedup nose  there is nothing further that one can say about it said charley  having thus described the lady crinoline continued mrs woodward it now becomes our duty as impartial historians to give some account of mr macassar jones  we are not prepared to give the exact name of the artist by whom mr macassar jones was turned out to the world so perfectly dressed a man were we to do so the signal service done to one establishment by such an advertisement would draw down on us the anger of the trade at large and the tailors of london would be in league against the daily delight it is sufficient to remark that the artists offices are not a hundred miles from pall mall nor need we expressly name the bootmaker to whom is confided the task of making those feet small by degrees and beautifully less the process we understand has been painful but the effect is no doubt remunerative  in three especial walks of dress has macassar jones been more than ordinarily careful to create a sensation and we believe we may assert that he has been successful in all we have already alluded to his feet ascending from them and ascending not far we come to his coat it is needless to say that it is a frock needless to say that it is a long frocklong as those usually worn by younger infants and apparently made so for the same purpose but look at the exquisitely small proportions of the collar look at the grace of the long sleeves the length of back the propriety the innate respectability the perfect decorumwe had almost said the high moral worthof the whole who would not willingly sacrifice any individual existence that he might become the exponent of such a coat macassar jones was proud to do so  but he had bestowed perhaps the greatest amount of personal attention on his collar it was a matter more within his own grasp than those great and important articles to which attention has been already drawn but one nevertheless on which he was able to expend the whole amount of his energy and genius some people may think that an allrounder is an allrounder and that if one is careful to get an allrounder one has done all that is necessary but so thought not macassar jones some men wear collars of two plies of linen some men of three but macassar jones wore collars of four plies some mensome sensual selfindulgent menappear to think that the collar should be made for the neck but macassar jones knew better he who never spared him self when the cause was good he knew that the neck had been made for the collarit was at any rate evident that such was the case with his own little can be said of his head except that it was small narrow and genteel but his hat might be spoken of and perhaps with advantage of the loose but studied tie of his inchwide cravat a paragraph might be made but we would fain not be tedious  we will only further remark that he always carried with him a wonderful representation of himself like to him to a miracle only smaller in its dimensions like as a duodecimo is to a folioa babe as it were of his own begettinga little alter ego in which he took much delight it was his umbrella look at the delicate finish of its lower extremity look at the long narrow and wellmade coat in which it is enveloped from its neck downwards without speck or blemish or wrinkle look at the little wooden head nicely polished with the effigy of a human face on one side of itlittle eyes it has and a sort of nose look closer at it and you will perceive a mouth not expressive indeed but still it is therea mouth and chin and is it or is it not an attempt at a pair of whiskers it certainly has a moustache  such were mr macassar jones and his umbrella he was an excellent clerk and did great credit to the important office to which he was attachednamely that of the episcopal audit board he was much beloved by the other gentlemen who were closely connected with him in that establishment and may be said for the first year or two of his service to have been not exactly the life and soul but we may perhaps say with more propriety the pervading genius of the room in which he sat  but alas at length a cloud came over his brow at first it was but a changing shadow but it settled into a dark veil of sorrow which obscured all his virtues and made the worthy senior of his room shake his thin grey locks once and again he shook them more in sorrow than in anger for he knew that macassar was in love and he remembered the days of his youth yes macassar was in love he had seen the lovely crinoline to see was to admire to admire was to love to lovethat is to love her to love crinoline the exalted the soughtafter the one so much in demand as he had once expressed himself to one of his bosom friendsto love her was to despair he did despair and despairing sighed and sighing was idle  but he was not all idle the genius of the man had that within it which did not permit itself to evaporate in mere sighs sighs with the highminded force themselves into the guise of poetry and so it had been with him he got leave of absence for a week and shut himself up alone in his lodgings for a week in his lodgings during the long evenings of winter did he remain unseen and unheard of his landlady thought that he was in debt and his friends whispered abroad that he had caught scarlatina but at the end of the seven days he came forth pale indeed but with his countenance lighted up by ecstatic fire and as he started for his office he carefully folded and put into his pocket the elegantly written poem on which he had been so intently engaged  im so glad we are to have more poetry said katie is it another song  youll see said mrs woodward  macassar had many bosom friends at his office to all of whom one by one he had confided the tale of his love for a while he doubted to which of them he should confide the secret of his inspiration but genius will not hide its head under a bushel and thus before long did macassars song become the common property of the episcopal audit board even the bishops sang it so macassar was assured by one of his brother clerks who was made of a coarser clay than his colleagueeven the bishops sang it when they met in council together on their own peculiar bench  it would be useless to give the whole of it here for it contained ten verses the last two were those which macassar was wont to sing to himself as he wandered lonely under the elms of kensington gardens    oh how she walks     and how she talks   and sings like a bird serene     but of this be sure     while the world shall endure   the loveliest lady thatll ever be seen   will still be the lady crinoline   the lovely lady crinoline  with her hair done all à limpératrice     sweetly done with the best of grease   she looks like a goddess or queen     and so i declare     and solemnly swear   that the loveliest lady that ever was seen   is still the lady crinoline   the lovely lady crinoline  and so ends the third chapter said mrs woodward  both katie and linda were beginning to criticize but mrs woodward repressed them sternly and went on with  chapter iv  it was a lovely day towards the end of may that macassar jones presenting himself before the desk of the senior clerk at one oclock begged for permission to be absent for two hours the request was preferred with meek and hesitating voice and with downcast eyes  the senior clerk shook his grey locks sadly sadly he shook his thin grey locks for he grieved at the sight which he saw twas sad to see the energies of this young man thus sapped in his early youth by the allabsorbing strength of a hopeless passion crinoline was now as it were a household word at the episcopal audit board the senior clerk believed her to be cruel and as he knew for what object these two hours of idleness were requested he shook his thin grey locks in sorrow  ill be back at three sir punctual said macassar  but mr jones you are absent nearly every day for the same period  today shall be the last today shall end it all said macassar with a look of wretched desperation  whatwhat would sir gregory say said the senior clerk  macassar jones sighed deeply nature had not made the senior clerk a cruel man but yet this allusion was cruel the young macassar had drunk deeply of the waters that welled from the fountain of sir gregorys philosophy he had been proud to sit humbly at the feet of such a gamaliel and now it rent his young heart to be thus twitted with the displeasure of the great master whom he so loved and so admired  well go mr jones said the senior clerk go but as you go resolve that tomorrow you will remain at your desk now go and may prosperity attend you  all shall be decided today said macassar and as he spoke an unusual spark gleamed in his eye he went and as he went the senior clerk shook his thin grey hairs he was a bachelor and he distrusted the charms of the sex  macassar returning to his desk took up his hat and his umbrella and went forth his indeed was a plight at which that old senior clerk might well shake his thin grey hairs in sorrow for macassar was the victim of mysterious circumstances which from his youth upwards had marked him out for a fate of no ordinary nature the tale must now be told  o dear said linda is it something horrid  i hope it is said katie perhaps hes already married to some old hag or witch  you dont say who his father and mother are but i suppose hell turn out to be somebody elses son said linda  hes a very nice young man for a small teaparty at any rate said uncle bat  the tale must now be told continued mrs woodward in his early years macassar jones had had a maiden aunt this lady died  oh mamma if you read it in that way i shall certainly cry said katie  well my dear if your heart is so susceptible you had better indulge it this lady died and left behind her  what said linda  a diamond ring said katie  a sealed manuscript which was found in a secret drawer suggested linda  perhaps a baby said uncle bat  and left behind her a will  did she leave anything else asked norman  ladies and gentlemen if i am to be interrupted in this way i really must resign my task said mrs woodward we shall never get to bed  i wont say another word said katie  in his early years macassar had had a maiden aunt this lady died and left behind her a will in which with many expressions of the warmest affection and fullest confidence she left £3000 in the three per cents  what are the three per cents said katie  the three per cents is a way in which people get some of their money to spend regularly when they have got a large sum locked up somewhere said linda  oh said katie  will you hold your tongue miss said mrs woodward  left £3000 in the three per cents to her nephew but she left it on these conditions that he should be married before he was twentyfive and that he should have a child lawfully born in the bonds of wedlock before he was twentysix and then the will went on to state that the interest of the money should accumulate till macassar had attained the latter age and that in the event of his having failed to comply with the conditions and stipulations above named the whole money principal and interest should be set aside and by no means given up to the said macassar but applied to the uses purposes and convenience of that excellent charitable institution denominated the princess charlottes lyingin hospital  now the nature of this will had been told in confidence by macassar to some of his brother clerks and was consequently well known at the episcopal audit board it had given rise there to a spirit of speculation against which the senior clerk had protested in vain bets were made some in favour of macassar and some in that of the hospital but of late the odds were going much against our hero it was well known that in three short months he would attain that disastrous age which if it found him a bachelor would find him also denuded of his legacy and then how short a margin remained for the second event the odds were daily rising against macassar and as he heard the bets offered and taken at the surrounding desks his heart quailed within him  and the lovely crinoline she also had heard of this eccentric will she and her mother £3000 with interest arising for some half score of years would make a settlement by no means despicable in tavistock square and would enable macassar to maintain a house over which even crinoline need not be ashamed to preside but what if the legacy should be lost she also knew to a day what was the age of her swain she knew how close upon her was that day which if she passed it unwedded would see her resolved to be deaf for ever to the vows of macassar still if she managed well there might be timeat any rate for the marriage  but alas macassar made no vows none at least which the most attentive ear could consider to be audible crinolines ear was attentive but hitherto in vain he would come there daily to tavistock square daily would that true and valiant page lay open the path to his mistresss feet daily would macassar sit there for a while and sigh but the envious hour would pass away while the wishedfor word was still unsaid and he would hurry back and complete with figures too often erroneous the audit of some diocesan balance  you must help him my dear said crinolines mamma  but he says nothing mamma said crinoline in tears  you must encourage him to speak my dear  i do encourage him but by that time it is always three oclock and then he has to go away  you should be quicker my dear you should encourage him more at once now try today if you cant do anything today i really must get your papa to interfere  crinoline had ever been an obedient child and now as ever she determined to obey but it was a hard task for her in three months he would be twentyfivein fifteen months twentysix she however would do her best and then if her efforts were unavailing she could only trust to providence and her papa  with sad and anxious heart did macassar that day take up his new silk hat take up also his darling umbrella and descend the sombre steps of the episcopal audit office seven to one on the lyingin were the last words which reached his ears as the door of his room closed behind him his was a dreadful position what if that sweet girl that angel whom he so worshipped what if she melted by his tale of sorrowthat is if he could prevail on himself to tell itshould take pity and consent to be hurried prematurely to the altar of hymen and then if after all the legacy should be forfeited poverty for himself he could endure at least he thought so but poverty for her could he bear that what if he should live to see her deprived of that green headdress robbed of those copious draperies reduced to english shoes compelled to desert that shrine in hanover square and all through him his brain reeled round his head swam his temples throbbed his knees knocked against each other his blood stagnated his heart collapsed a cold clammy perspiration covered him from head to foot he could hardly reach the courtyard and there obtain the support of a pillar dreadful thoughts filled his mind the thames the friendly thames was running close to him should he not put a speedy end to all his misery those horrid words that seven to one on the lyingin still rang in his ears were the chances really seven to one against his getting his legacy oh said he my aunt my aunt my aunt my aunt my aunt  but at last he roused the spirit of the man within him faint heart never won fair lady seemed to be whispered to him from every stone in somerset house the cool air blowing through the passages revived him and he walked forth through the wide portals resolving that he would return a happy thriving lover or that he would return no morethat night what would he care for sir gregory what for the thin locks of the senior clerk if crinoline should reject him  it was his custom as he walked towards tavistock square to stop at a friendly pastrycooks in covent garden and revive his spirits for the coming interview with banbury tarts and cherrybrandy in the moments of his misery something about the pastrycooks girl something that reminded him of crinoline it was probably her nose had tempted him to confide to her his love he had told her everything the kind young creature pitied him and as she ministered to his wants was wont to ask sweetly as to his passion  and how was the lovely lady crinoline yesterday asked she he had entrusted to her a copy of his poem  more beauteous than ever he said but somewhat indistinctly for his mouth was clogged with the banbury tart  and goodnatured i hope indeed i dont know how she can resist said the girl im sure youll make it all right today for i see youve got your winning way with you  winning way with seven to one against him macassar sighed and spilt some of his cherrybrandy over his shirt front the kindhearted girl came and wiped it for him i think ill have another glass said he with a deep voice he did take another glassand also ate another tart  hell pop today as sure as eggs now hes taken them two glasses of popping powder said the girl as he went out of the shop well its astonishing to me what the men find to be afraid of  and so macassar hastened towards tavistock square all too quickly for as he made his way across great russell street he found that he was very hot he leant against the rail and taking off his hat and gloves began to cool himself and wipe away the dust with his pockethandkerchief i wouldnt have minded the expense of a cab said he to himself only the chances are so much against me seven to one  but he had no time to lose he had had but two precious hours at his disposal and thirty minutes were already gone he hurried on to tavistock square and soon found that wellknown door open before him  the lady crinoline sits upstairs alone said the page and is athinking of you then he added in a whisper do you go at her straight mr macassar slipslap and no mistake  all honour to the true and brave  chapter v  as macassar walked across the drawingroom crinoline failed to perceive his presence although his boots did creak rather loudly such at least must be presumed to have been the case for she made no immediate sign of having noticed him she was sitting at the open window with her lute in hand gazing into the vacancy of the square below and as macassar walked across the room a deep sigh escaped from her bosom the page closed the door and at the same moment crinoline touched her lute or rather pulled it at the top and bottom and threw one wild witch note to the wind as she did so a line of a song escaped from her lips with a low melancholy but still rapturous cadence    his heart is at his office his heart is always there  oh mr macassar is that you she exclaimed she struggled to rise but finding herself unequal to the effort she sank back again on a chair dropped her lute on a soft footstool and then buried her face in her hands it was dreadful for macassar to witness such agony  is anything the matter said he  the matter said she ah ah  i hope you are not sick said he  sick said she well i fear i am very sick  what is it said he perhaps only bilious he suggested  oh oh oh said she  i see im in the way and i think i had better go and so he prepared to depart no no no said she jumping up from her chair oh mr macassar dont be so cruel do you wish to see me sink on the carpet before your feet  macassar denied the existence of any such wish and said that he humbly begged her pardon if he gave any offence  offence said she smiling sweetly on him sweetly but yet sadly offence nono offence indeed i dont know how you couldbut never mindi am such a silly thing ones feelings will sometimes get the better of one dont you often find it so  o yes quite so said macassar i think its the heat  hes a downright noodle said crinolines mamma to her sisterinlaw who lived with them the two were standing behind a chink in the door which separated the drawingroom from a chamber behind it  wont you sit down mr macassar macassar sat down mamma will be so sorry to miss you again shes calling somewhere in grosvenor square i believe she wanted me to go with her but i could not bring myself to go with her today its useless for the body to go out when the heart still remains at home dont you find it so  oh quite so said macassar the cherrybrandy had already evaporated before the blaze of all that beauty and he was bethinking himself how he might best take himself off let the hospital have the filthy lucre he would let the money go and would show the world that he loved for the sake of love alone he looked at his watch and found that it was already past two  crinoline when she saw that watch knew that something must be done at once she appreciated more fully than her lover did the value of this worlds goods and much as she doubtless sympathized with the wants of the hospital in question she felt that charity should begin at home so she fairly burst out into a flood of tears  macassar was quite beside himself he had seen her weep before but never with such frightful violence she rushed up from her chair and passing so close to him as nearly to upset him by the waft of her petticoats threw herself on to an ottoman and hiding her face on the stump in the middle of it sobbed and screeched till macassar feared that the buttons behind her dress would crack and fly off  oh oh oh sobbed crinoline  it must be the heat said macassar knocking down a flowerpot in his attempt to open the window a little wider o dear what have i done said he i think id better go  never mind the flowerpot said crinoline looking up through her tears oh oh oh oh me oh my heart  macassar looked at his watch he had only fortyfive minutes left for everything the expense of a cab would to be sure be nothing if he were successful but then what chance was there of that  can i do anything for you in the strand said he i must be at my office at three  in the strand she screeched what could he do for me in the strand heartlessheartlessheartless well gogogo to your office mr macassar your heart is there i know it is always there godont let me stand between you and your dutiesbetween you and sir gregory oh how i hate that man go why should i wish to prevent you of course i have no such wish to me it is quite indifferent only mamma will be so sorry to miss you you dont know how mamma loves you she loves you almost as a son but gogo pray go  and then crinoline looked at him oh how she looked at him it was as though all the goddesses of heaven were inviting him to come and eat ambrosia with them on a rosytinted cloud all the goddesses did we say no but one goddess the most beautiful of them all his heart beat violently against his ribs and he felt that he was almost man enough for anything instinctively his hand went again to his waistcoat pocket  you shant look at your watch so often said she putting up her delicate hand and stopping his there ill look at it for you its only just two and you neednt go to your office for this hour and as she squeezed it back into his pocket he felt her fingers pressing against his heart and felt her hairdone all à limpératricein sweet contact with his cheek there i shall hold it there said she so that you shant look at it again  will you stay till i bid you go said crinoline  macassar declared that he did not care a straw for the senior clerk or for sir gregory either he would stay there for ever he said  what for ever in mammas drawingroom said crinoline opening wide her lovely eyes with surprise  for ever near to you said macassar  oh mr macassar said crinoline dropping her hand from his waistcoat and looking bashfully towards the ground what can you mean  down went macassar on his knees and down went crinoline into her chair there was perhaps rather too much distance between them but that did not much matter now there he was on both knees with his hands clasped together as they were wont to be when he said his prayers with his umbrella beside him on one side and his hat on the other making his declaration in full and unmistakable terms a yard or two of floor more or less between them was neither here nor there at first the bashful crinoline could not bring herself to utter a distinct consent and macassar was very nearly up and away in a returning fit of despair but her goodnature came to his aid and as she quickly said i will i will i will he returned to his posture in somewhat nearer quarters and was transported into the seventh heaven by the bliss of kissing her hand  oh macassar said she  oh crinoline said he  you must come and tell papa tomorrow said she  he readily promised to do so  you had better come to breakfast before he goes into the city said she  and so the matter was arranged and the lovely lady crinoline became the affianced bride of the happy macassar  it was past three when he left the house but what did he care for that he was so mad with joy that he did not even know whither he was going he went on straight ahead and came to no check till he found himself waving his hat over his head in the new road he then began to conceive that his conduct must have been rather wild for he was brought to a standstill in a crossing by four or five cabmen who were rival candidates for his custom  somerset house old brick he shouted out as he jumped into a hansom and as he did so he poked one of the other cabbies playfully in the ribs with his umbrella  is mamma dont know as ow es hout i shouldnt vonder said the cabmanand away went macassar singing at the top of his voice as he sat in the cab    the loveliest lady that ever was seen   is the lovely lady crinoline  the cab passed through covent garden on its way stop at the pastrycooks at the corner said macassar up through the little trapdoor the cab drew up suddenly shes mine shes mine shouted macassar rushing into the shop and disregarding in the ecstasy of the moment the various customers who were quietly eating their ices shes mine shes mine    with her hair done all á limpératrice   sweetly done with the best of grease  and now for somerset house  arrived at those ancient portals he recklessly threw eighteenpence to the cabman and ran up the stone stairs which led to his office as he did so the clock with iron tongue tolled four but what recked he what it tolled he rushed into his room where his colleagues were now locking their desks and waving abroad his hat and his umbrella repeated the chorus of his song shes mine shes mine    the loveliest lady that ever was seen   is the lovely lady crinoline  and shes mine shes mine  exhausted nature could no more he sank into a chair and his brother clerks stood in a circle around him soon a spirit of triumph seemed to actuate them all they joined hands in that friendly circle and dancing with joyful glee took up with one voice the burden of the song      oh how she walks     and how she talks   and sings like a bird serene     but of this be sure     while the world shall endure   the loveliest lady that ever was seen     is still the lady crinoline     the lovely lady crinoline  and that old senior clerk with the thin grey hairwas he angry at this general ebullition of joy o no the just severity of his discipline was always tempered with genial mercy not a word did he say of that broken promise not a word of the unchecked diocesan balance not a word of sir gregorys anger he shook his thin grey locks but he shook them neither in sorrow nor in anger god bless you macassar jones said he god bless you  he too had once been young had once loved had once hoped and feared and hoped again and had once knelt at the feet of beauty but alas he had knelt in vain  may god be with you macassar jones said he as he walked out of the office door with his coloured bandana pressed to his eyes may god be with you and make your bed fruitful    for the loveliest lady that ever was seen     is the lovely lady crinoline  shouted the junior clerks still dancing in mad glee round the happy lover  we have said that they all joined in this kindly congratulation to their young friend but no there was one spirit there whom envy had soured one whom the happiness of another had made miserable one whose heart beat in no unison with these jocund sounds as macassars joy was at its height in the proud moment of his triumph a hated voice struck his ears and filled his soul with dismay once more  theres two to one still on the lyingin said this hateful lucifer  and so macassar was not all happy even yet as he walked home to his lodgings  chapter vi  we have but one other scene to record but one short scene and then our tale will be told and our task will be done and this last scene shall not after the usual manner of novelists be that of the wedding but rather one which in our eyes is of a much more enduring interest crinoline and macassar were duly married in bloomsbury church the dresses are said to have come from the house in hanover square crinoline behaved herself with perfect propriety and macassar went through his work like a man when we have said that we have said all that need be said on that subject  but we must beg our readers to pass over the space of the next twelve months and to be present with us in that front sittingroom of the elegant private lodgings which the married couple now prudently occupied in alfred place lodgings yes they were only lodgings for not as yet did they know what might be the extent of their income  in this room during the whole of a long autumn day sat macassar in a frame of mind not altogether to be envied during the greater portion of it he was alone but ever and anon some bustling woman would enter and depart without even deigning to notice the questions which he asked and then after a while he found himself in company with a very respectable gentleman in black who belonged to the medical profession is it coming asked macassar is it is it coming  well we hope sowe hope so said the medical gentleman if not today it will be tomorrow if i should happen to be absent mrs gamp is all that you could desire if not today it will certainly be tomorrowand so the medical gentleman went his way  now the coming morrow would be macassars birthday on that morrow he would be twentysix  all alone he sat there till the autumn sun gave way to the shades of evening some one brought him a mutton chop but it was raw and he could not eat he went to the sideboard and prepared to make himself a glass of negus but the water was all cold his water at least was cold though mrs gamps was hot enough it was a sad and mournful evening he thought he would go out for he found that he was not wanted but a low drizzling rain prevented him had he got wet he could not have changed his clothes for they were all in the wardrobe in his wifes room all alone he sat till the shades of evening were hidden by the veil of night  but what sudden noise is that he hears within the house why do those heavy steps press so rapidly against the stairs what feet are they which are so busy in the room above him he opens the sittingroom door but he can see nothing he has been left there without a candle he peers up the stairs but a faint glimmer of light shining through the keyhole of his wifes door is all that meets his eye oh my aunt my aunt he says as he leans against the banisters my aunt my aunt my aunt  what a birthday will this be for him on the morrow he already hears the sound of the hospital bells as they ring with joy at the acquisition of their new wealth he must dash from his lips tear from his heart banish for ever from his eyes that vision of a sweet little cottage at brompton with a charming dressingroom for himself and gas laid on all over the house  lodgings i hate i detest lodgings he said to himself connubial bliss and furnished lodgings are not compatible my aunt my aunt for what misery hast thou not to answer oh mrs gamp could you be so obliging as to tell me what oclock it is the last question was asked as mrs gamp suddenly entered the room with a candle macassars watch had been required for the use of one of the servants  its just halfpast heleven this wery moment as is said mrs gamp and the finest boy babby as my heyes which has seen a many has ever sat upon  up up to the ceiling went the horsehair cushion of the lodginghouse sofaup went the footstool after it and its four wooden legs in falling made a terrible clatter on the mahogany lootable macassar in his joy got hold of mrs gamp and kissed her heartily forgetful of the fumes of gin hurrah shouted he hurrah hurrah hurrah oh mrs gamp i feel sososoi really dont know how i feel  he danced round the room with noisy joy till mrs gamp made him understand how very unsuited were such riotous ebullitions to the weak state of his ladylove upstairs he then gave over not the dancing but the noise and went on capering round the room with suppressed steps ever and anon singing to himself in a whisper    the loveliest lady that ever was seen   is still the lady crinoline  a few minutes afterwards a knock at the door was heard and the monthly nurse entered she held something in her embrace but he could not see what he looked down pryingly into her arms and at the first glance thought that it was his umbrella but then he heard a little pipe and he knew that it was his child  we will not intrude further on the first interview between macassar and his heir                                         and so ends the romantic history of crinoline and macassar said mrs woodward and i am sure charley we are all very much obliged to you for the excellent moral lessons you have given us  im so delighted with it said katie i do so like that macassar  so do i said linda yawning and the old man with the thin grey hair  come girls its nearly one oclock and well go to bed said the mother uncle bat has been asleep these two hours  and so they went off to their respective chambers    chapter xxiii  surbiton colloquies   all further conversation in the drawingroom was forbidden for that night mrs woodward would have willingly postponed the reading of charleys story so as to enable katie to go to bed after the accident had she been able to do so but she was not able to do so without an exercise of a species of authority which was distasteful to her and which was very seldom heard seen or felt within the limits of surbiton cottage it would moreover have been very ungracious to snub charleys manuscript just when charley had made himself such a hero and she had therefore been obliged to read it but now that it was done she hurried katie off to bed not without many admonitions  good night she said to charley and god bless you and make you always as happy as we are now what a household we should have had tonight had it not been for you  charley rubbed his eyes with his hand and muttered something about there not having been the slightest danger in the world  and remember charley she said paying no attention to his mutterings we always liked youliked you very much but liking and loving are very different things now you are a dear dear friendone of the dearest  in answer to this charley was not even able to mutter so he went his way to the inn and lay awake half the night thinking how katie had kissed his hand during the other half he dreamt first that katie was drowned and then that norah was his bride  linda and katie had been so hurried off that they had only been just able to shake hands with harry and charley there is however an old proverb that though one man may lead a horse to water a thousand cannot make him drink it was easy to send katie to bed but very difficult to prevent her talking when she was there  oh linda she said what can i do for him  do for him said linda i dont know that you can do anything for him i dont suppose he wants you to do anything linda still looked on her sister as a child but katie was beginning to put away childish things  couldnt i make something for him lindasomething for him to keep as a present you know i would work so hard to get it done  work a pair of slippers as crinoline did said linda  katie was brushing her hair at the moment and then she sat still with the brush in her hand thinking no said she after a while not a pair of slippersi shouldnt like a pair of slippers  why not said linda  ohi dont knowbut i shouldnt katie had said that crinoline was working slippers for macassar because she was in love with him and having said so she could not now work slippers for charley poor katie she was no longer a child when she thought thus  then make him a purse said linda  a purse is such a little thing  then work him the cover for a sofa like what mamma and i are doing for gertrude  but he hasnt got a house said katie  hell have a house by the time youve done the sofa and a wife to sit on it too  oh linda you are so illnatured  why child what do you want me to say if you were to give him one of those grand long tobacco pipes they have in the shop windows thats what hed like the best or something of that sort i dont think he cares much for girls presents such as purses and slippers  doesnt he said katie mournfully  no not a bit you know hes such a rake  oh linda i dont think hes so very bad indeed i dont and mamma doesnt think so and you know harry said on easter sunday that he was much better than he used to be  i know harry is very goodnatured to him  and isnt charley just as goodnatured to harry i am quite sure he is harry has only to ask the least thing and charley always does it do you remember how charley went up to town for him the sunday before last  and so he ought said linda he ought to do whatever harry tells him  well linda i dont know why he ought said katie they are not brothers you know nor yet even cousins  but harry is veryso veryso very superior you know said linda  i dont know any such thing said katie  oh katie dont you know that charley is such a rake  but rakes are just the people who dont do whatever they are told so thats no reason and i am quite sure that charley is much the cleverer  and i am quite sure he is notnor half so clever nor nearly so well educated why dont you know the navvies are the most ignorant young men in london charley says so himself  thats his fun said katie besides he always makes little of himself i am quite sure harry could never have made all that about macassar and crinoline out of his own head  no because he doesnt think of such nonsensical things i declare miss katie i think you are in love with master charley  katie who was still sitting at the dressingtable blushed up to her forehead and at the same time her eyes were suffused with tears but there was no one to see either of those telltale symptoms for linda was in bed  i know he saved my life said katie as soon as she could trust herself to speak without betraying her emotioni know he jumped into the river after me and very very nearly drowned himself and i dont think any other man in the world would have done so much for me besides him  oh katie harry would in a moment  not for me perhaps he might for youthough im not quite sure that he would it was thus that katie took her revenge on her sister  im quite sure he would for anybody even for sally sally was an assistant in the back kitchen but i dont mean to say katie that you shouldnt feel grateful to charley of course you should  and so i do said katie now bursting out into tears overdone by her emotion and fatigue and so i doand i do love him and will love him if hes ever so much a rake but you know linda that is very different from being in love and it was very illnatured of you to say so very  linda was out of bed in a trice and sitting with her arm round her sisters neck  why you darling little foolish child you i was only quizzing said she dont you know that i love charley too  but you shouldnt quiz about such a thing as that if youd fallen into the river and harry had pulled you out then youd know what i mean but im not at all sure that he could have done it  katies perverse wickedness on this point was very nearly giving rise to another contest between the sisters lindas common sense however prevailed and giving up the point of harrys prowess she succeeded at last in getting katie into bed you know mamma will be so angry if she hears us said linda and i am sure you will be ill tomorrow  i dont care a bit about being ill totomorrow and yet i do too she added after a pause for its sunday it would be so stupid not to be able to go out tomorrow  well then try to go to sleep at onceand linda carefully tucked the clothes around her sister  i think it shall be a purse said katie  a purse will certainly be the best that is if you dont like the slippers and linda rolled herself up comfortably in the bed  noi dont like the slippers at all it shall be a purse i can do that the quickest you know its so stupid to give a thing when everything about it is forgotten isnt it  very stupid said linda nearly asleep  and when its worn out i can make another cant i  hmmm said linda quite asleep  and then katie went asleep also in her sisters arms  early in the morningthat is to say not very early perhaps between seven and eightmrs woodward came into their room and having inspected her charges desired that katie should not get up for morning church but lie in bed till the middle of the day  oh mamma it will be so stupid not going to church after tumbling into the river people will say that all my clothes are wet  people will about tell the truth as to some of them said mrs woodward but dont you mind about people but lie still and go to sleep if you can linda do you come and dress in my room  and is charley to lie in bed too said katie he was in the river longer than i was  its too late to keep charley in bed said linda for i see him coming along the road now with a towel hes been bathing  oh i do so wish i could go and bathe said katie  poor katie was kept in bed till the afternoon charley and harry however were allowed to come up to her bedroom door and hear her pronounce herself quite well  how dye do mr macassar said she  and how dye do my lady crinoline said harry after that katie never called charley mr macassar again  they all went to church and katie was left to sleep or read or think of the new purse that she was to make as best she might  and then they dined and then they walked out but still without katie she was to get up and dress while they were out so as to receive them in state in the drawingroom on their return four of them walked together for uncle bat now usually took himself off to his friend at hampton court on sunday afternoon mrs woodward walked with charley and harry and linda paired together  now said charley to himself now would have been the time to have told mrs woodward everything but for that accident of yesterday now i can tell her nothing to do so now would be to demand her sympathy and to ask for assistance and so he determined to tell her nothing  but the very cause which made charley dumb on the subject of his own distresses made mrs woodward inquisitive about them she knew that his life was not like that of harrysteady sober and discreet but she felt that she did not like him or even love him the less on this account nay it was not clear to her that these failings of his did not give him additional claims on her sympathies what could she do for him how could she relieve him how could she bring him back to the right way she spoke to him of his london life praised his talents encouraged him to exertion besought him to have some solicitude and above all some respect for himself and then with that delicacy which such a woman and none but such a woman can use in such a matter she asked him whether he was still in debt  charley with shame we must own it had on this subject been false to all his friends he had been false to his father and his mother and had never owned to them the half of what he owed he had been false to alaric and false to harry but now now at such a moment as this he would not allow himself to be false to mrs woodward  yes he said he was in debtrather  mrs woodward pressed him to say whether his debts were heavywhether he owed much  its no use thinking of it mrs woodward said he not the least i know i ought not to come down here and i dont think i will any more  not come down here said mrs woodward why not theres very little expense in that i dare say youd spend quite as much in london  ohof coursethree times as much perhaps that is if i had itbut i dont mean that  what do you mean said she  charley walked on in silence with melancholy look very crestfallen his thumbs stuck into his waistcoat pockets  upon my word i dont know what you mean said mrs woodward i should have thought coming to hampton might perhapsperhaps have kept youi dont exactly mean out of mischief that however in spite of her denial was exactly what mrs woodward did mean  so it doesbut said charley now thoroughly ashamed of himself  but what said she  i am not fit to be here said charley and as he spoke his manly selfcontrol all gave way and big tears rolled down his cheeks  mrs woodward in her womans heart resolved that if it might in any way be possible she would make him fit fit not only to be there but to hold his head up with the best in any company in which he might find himself  she questioned him no further then her wish now was not to torment him further but to comfort him she determined that she would consult with harry and with her uncle and take counsel from them as to what steps might be taken to save the brand from the burning she talked to him as a mother might have done leaning on his arm as she returned leaning on him as a woman never leans on a man whom she deems unfit for her society all this charleys heart and instinct fully understood and he was not ungrateful  but yet he had but little to comfort him he must return to town on monday return to mr snape and the lock entries to mr mruen and the three seasonsto mrs davis norah geraghty and that horrid mr peppermint he never once thought of clementina golightly to whom at that moment he was being married by the joint energies of undy scott and his cousin alaric  and what had linda and norman been doing all this time had they been placing mutual confidence in each other no they had not come to that yet linda still remembered the pang with which she had first heard of gertrudes engagement and harry norman had not yet been able to open his seared heart to a second love  in the course of the evening a letter was brought to captain cuttwater which did not seem to raise his spirits  whom is your letter from uncle said mrs woodward  from alaric said he gruffly crumpling it up and putting it into his pocket and then he turned to his rum and water in a manner that showed his determination to say nothing more on the matter  in the morning harry and charley returned to town captain cuttwater went up with them and all was again quiet at surbiton cottage    chapter xxiv  mr mbuffer accepts the chiltern hundreds   it was an anxious hour for the honourable undecimus scott when he first learnt that mr mbuffer had accepted the stewardship of the chiltern hundreds the stewardship of the chiltern hundreds does it never occur to anyone how many persons are appointed to that valuable situation or does anyone ever reflect why a member of parliament when he wishes to resign his post of honour should not be simply gazetted in the newspapers as having done so instead of being named as the new steward of the chiltern hundreds no one ever does think of it resigning and becoming a steward are one and the same thing with this difference however that one of the grand bulwarks of the british constitution is thus preserved  well mr mbuffer who having been elected by the independent electors of the tillietudlem burghs to serve them in parliament could not in accordance with the laws of the constitution have got himself out of that honourable but difficult position by any scheme of his own found himself on a sudden a free man the queen having selected him to be her steward for the district in question we have no doubt but that the deed of appointment set forth that her majesty had been moved to this step by the firm trust she had in the skill and fidelity of the said mr mbuffer but if so her majestys trust would seem to have been somewhat misplaced as mr mbuffer having been a managing director of a bankrupt swindle from which he had contrived to pillage some thirty or forty thousand pounds was now unable to show his face at tillietudlem or in the house of commons and in thus retreating from his membership had no object but to save himself from the expulsion which he feared it was however a consolation for him to think that in what he had done the bulwarks of the british constitution had been preserved  it was an anxious moment for undy the existing parliament had still a year and a half or possibly two years and a half to run he had already been withdrawn from the public eye longer than he thought was suitable to the success of his career he particularly disliked obscurity for he had found that in his case obscurity had meant comparative poverty an obscure man as he observed early in life had nothing to sell now undy had once had something to sell and a very good market he had made of it he was of course anxious that those halcyon days should return fond of him as the electors of tillietudlem no doubt were devoted as they might be in a general way to his interests still still it was possible that they might forget him if he remained too long away from their embraces out of sight out of mind is a proverb which opens to us the worst side of human nature but even at tillietudlem natures worst side might sometimes show itself  actuated by such feelings as these undy heard with joy the tidings of mbuffers stewardship and determined to rush to the battle at once battle he knew there must be to be brought in for the district of tillietudlem was a prize which had never yet fallen to any mans lot without a contest tillietudlem was no poor pocket borough to be disposed of this way or that way according to the caprice or venal call of some aristocrat the men of tillietudlem knew the value of their votes and would only give them according to their consciences the way to win these consciences to overcome the sensitive doubts of a free and independent tillietudlem elector undy knew to his cost  it was almost a question as he once told alaric whether all that he could sell was worth all that he was compelled to buy but having put his neck to the collar in this line of life he was not now going to withdraw tillietudlem was once more vacant and undy determined to try it again undaunted by former outlays to make an outlay however at any rate in electioneering matters it is necessary that a man should have in hand some ready cash at the present moment undy had very little and therefore the news of mr mbuffers retirement to the german baths for his health was not heard with unalloyed delight  he first went into the city as men always do when they want money though in what portion of the city they find it has never come to the authors knowledge charley tudor to be sure did get £5 by going to the banks of jordan but the supply likely to be derived from such a fountain as that would hardly be sufficient for undys wants having done what he could in the city he came to alaric and prayed for the assistance of all his friends energies in the matter alaric would not have been and was not unwilling to assist him to the extent of his own immediate means but his own immediate means were limited and undys desire for ready cash was almost unlimited  there was a certain railway or proposed railway in ireland in which undy had ventured very deeply more so indeed than he had deemed it quite prudent to divulge to his friend and in order to gain certain ends he had induced alaric to become a director of this line the line in question was the great west cork which was to run from skibbereen to bantry and the momentous question now hotly debated before the railway board was on the moot point of a branch to ballydehob if undy could carry the west cork and ballydehob branch entire he would make a pretty thing of it but if as there was too much reason to fear his irish foes should prevail and leaveas undy had once said in an eloquent speech at a very influential meeting of shareholdersand leave the unfortunate agricultural and commercial interest of ballydehob steeped in cimmerian darkness the chances were that poor undy would be well nigh ruined  such being the case he had striven not unsuccessfully to draw alaric into the concern alaric had bought very cheaply a good many shares which many people said were worth nothing and had by dint of undys machinations been chosen a director on the board undy himself meanwhile lay by hoping that fortune might restore him to parliament and haply put him on that committee which must finally adjudicate as to the great question of the ballydehob branch  such were the circumstances under which he came to alaric with the view of raising such a sum of money as might enable him to overcome the scruples of the tillietudlem electors and place himself in the shoes lately vacated by mr mbuffer  they were sitting together after dinner when he commenced the subject he and mrs val and clementina had done the tudors the honour of dining with them and the ladies had now gone up into the drawingroom and were busy talking over the chiswick affair which was to come off in the next week and after which mrs val intended to give a small evening party to the most élite of her acquaintance  we wont have all the world my dear she had said to gertrude but just a few of our own set that are really nice clementina is dying to try that new back step with m jaquêtanàpe so we wont crowd the room such were the immediate arrangements of the tudor and scott party  so mbuffer is off at last said scott as he seated himself and filled his glass after closing the diningroom door he brought his pigs to a bad market after all  he was an infernal rogue said alaric  well i suppose he was said undy and a fool into the bargain to be found out  he was a downright swindler said alaric  after all said the other not paying much attention to alarics indignation he did not do so very badly why mbuffer has been at it now for thirteen years he began with nothing he had neither blood nor money and god knows he had no social merits to recommend him he is as vulgar as a hog as awkward as an elephant and as ugly as an ape i believe he never had a friend and was known at his club to be the greatest bore that ever came out of scotland and yet for thirteen years he has lived on the fat of the land for five years he has been in parliament his wife has gone about in her carriage and every man in the city has been willing to shake hands with him  and what has it all come to said alaric whom the question of mbuffers temporary prosperity made rather thoughtful  well not so bad either he has had his fling for thirteen years and thats something thirteen good years out of a mans life is more than falls to the lot of every one and then i suppose he has saved something  and he is spoken of everywhere as a monster for whom hanging is too good  pshaw that wont hang him yesterday he was a god today he is a devil tomorrow hell be a man again thats all  but you dont mean to tell me undy that the consciousness of such crimes as those which mbuffer has committed must not make a man wretched in this world and probably in the next also  judge not and ye shall not be judged said undy quoting scripture as the devil did before him and as for consciousness of crime i suppose mbuffer has none at all i have no doubt he thinks himself quite as honest as the rest of the world he firmly believes that all of us are playing the same game and using the same means and has no idea whatever that dishonesty is objectionable  and you what do you think about it yourself  i think the greatest rogues are they who talk most of their honesty and therefore as i wish to be thought honest myself i never talk of my own  they both sat silent for a while undy bethinking himself what arguments would be most efficacious towards inducing alaric to strip himself of every available shilling that he had and alaric debating in his own mind that great question which he so often debated as to whether men men of the world the great and best men whom he saw around him really endeavoured to be honest or endeavoured only to seem so honesty was preached to him on every side but did he in his intercourse with the world find men to be honest or did it behove him a practical man like him a man so determined to battle with the world as he had determined did it behove such a one as he to be more honest than his neighbours  he also encouraged himself by that mystic word excelsior to him it was a watchword of battle repeated morning noon and night it was the prevailing idea of his life excelsior yes how great how grand how allabsorbing is the idea but what if a man may be going down down to tophet and yet think the while that he is scaling the walls of heaven  but you wish to think yourself honest he said disturbing undy just as that hero had determined on the way in which he would play his present hand of cards  i have not the slightest difficulty about that said undy and i dare say you have none either but as to mbuffer his going will be a great thing for us if as i dont doubt i can get his seat  it will be a great thing for you said alaric who as well as undy had his parliamentary ambition  and for you too my boy we should carry the ballydehob branch to a dead certainty and even if we did not do that wed bring it so near it that the expectation of it would send the shares up like mercury in fine weather they are at £2 12s 6d now and if i am in the house next session theyll be up to £7 10s before easter and whats more my dear fellow if we cant help ourselves in that way theyll be worth nothing in a very few months  alaric looked rather blank for he had invested deeply in this line of which he was now a director of a weeks standing or perhaps we should say sitting he had sold out all his golden hopes in the wheal mary jane for the sake of embarking his money and becoming a director in this irish railway and in one other speculation nearer home of which undy had a great opinion viz the limehouse thames bridge company such being the case he did not like to hear the west cork with the ballydehob branch spoken of so slightingly  the fact is a man can do anything if he is in the house and he can do nothing if he is not said undy you know our old aberdeen saying you scratch me and ill scratch you it is not only what a man may do himself for himself but it is what others will do for him when he is in a position to help them now there are those fellows i am handandglove with all of them but there is not one of them would lift a finger to help me as i am now but let me get my seat again and theyll do for me just anything i ask them vigil moves the new writ tonight i got a line from him asking me whether i was ready there was no good to be got by waiting so i told him to fire away  i suppose youll go down at once said alaric  well that as may beat least yes thats my intention but theres one thing needfuland that is the needful  money suggested alaric  yes moneycashrhinotinreadyor by what other name the goddess would be pleased to have herself worshipped money sir theres the difficulty now as ever even at tillietudlem money will have its weight  cant your father assist you said alaric  my father i wonder how hed look if he got a letter from me asking for money you might as well expect a goose to feed her young with blood out of her own breast like a pelican as expect that a scotch lord should give money to his younger sons like an english duke what would my father get by my being member for tillietudlem no i must look nearer home than my father what can you do for me  i  yes you said undy i am sure you dont mean to say youll refuse to lend me a helping hand if you can i must realize by the ballydehobs if i am once in the house and then youd have your money back at once  it is not that said alaric but i havent got it  i am sure you could let me have a thousand or so said undy i think a couple of thousand would carry it and i could make out the other myself  every shilling i have said alaric is either in the ballydehobs or in the limehouse bridge why dont you sell yourself  so i have said undy everything that i can without utter ruin the ballydehobs are not saleable as you know  what can i do for you then  undy set himself again to think i have no doubt i could get a thousand on our joint names that blackguard mruen would do it  who is mruen asked alaric  a low blackguard of a discounting jew christian he would do it but then heaven knows what he would charge and hed make so many difficulties that i shouldnt have the money for the next fortnight  i wouldnt have my name on a bill in such a mans hands on any account said alaric  well i dont like it myself said undy but what the deuce am i to do i might as well go to tillietudlem without my head as without money  i thought youd kept a lot of the mary janes said alaric  so i had but theyre gone now i tell you ive managed £1000 myself it would murder me now if the seat were to go into other hands id get the committee on the limehouse bridge and we should treble our money vigil told me he would not refuse the committee though of course the government wont consent to a grant if they can help it  well undy i can let you have £250 and that is every shilling i have at my bankers  they would not let you overdraw a few hundreds suggested undy  i certainly shall not try them said alaric  you are so full of scruple so green so young said undy almost in an enthusiasm of remonstrance what can be the harm of trying them  my credit  fal lal whats the meaning of credit how are you to know whether you have got any credit if you dont try come ill tell you how you can do it old cuttwater would lend it you for the asking  to this proposition alaric at first turned a deaf ear but by degrees he allowed undy to talk him over undy showed him that if he lost the tillietudlem burghs on this occasion it would be useless for him to attempt to stand for them again in such case he would have no alternative at the next general election but to stand for the borough of strathbogy in aberdeenshire whereas if he could secure tillietudlem as a seat for himself all the gaberlunzie interest in the borough of strathbogy which was supposed to be by no means small should be transferred to alaric himself indeed sandie scott the eldest hope of the gaberlunzie family would in such case himself propose alaric to the electors castalk cottage in which the hon sandie lived and which was on the outskirts of the gaberlunzie property was absolutely within the boundary of the borough  overcome by these and other arguments alaric at last consented to ask from captain cuttwater the loan of £700 that sum undy had agreed to accept as a sufficient contribution to that desirable public object the reseating himself for the tillietudlem borough and as alaric on reflection thought that it would be uncomfortable to be left penniless himself and as it was just as likely that uncle bat would lend him £700 as £500 he determined to ask for a loan of the entire sum he accordingly did so and the letter as we have seen reached the captain while harry and charley were at surbiton cottage the old gentleman was anything but pleased in the first place he liked his money though not with any overweening affection in the next place he had done a great deal for alaric and did not like being asked to do more and lastly he feared that there must be some evil cause for the necessity of such a loan so soon after alarics marriage  alaric in making his application had not done so actually without making any explanation on the subject he wrote a long letter worded very cleverly which only served to mystify the captain as alaric had intended that it should do captain cuttwater was most anxious that alaric whom he looked on as his adopted son should rise in the world he would have been delighted to think that he might possibly live to see him in parliament would probably have made considerable pecuniary sacrifice for such an object with the design therefore of softening captain cuttwaters heart alaric in his letter had spoken about great changes that were coming of the necessity that there was of his stirring himself of the great pecuniary results to be expected from a small present expenditure and ended by declaring that the money was to be used in forwarding the election of his friend scott for the tillietudlem district burghs  now the fact was that uncle bat though he cared a great deal for alaric did not care a ropes end for undy scott and could enjoy his rumpunch just as keenly if mr scott was in obscurity as he could possibly hope to do even if that gentleman should be promoted to be a lord of the treasury he was not at all pleased to think that his hardearned moidores should run down the gullies of the tillietudlem boroughs in the shape of muddy ale or vitriolic whisky and yet this was the first request that alaric had ever made to him and he did not like to refuse alarics first request so he came up to town himself on the following morning with harry and charley determined to reconcile all these difficulties by the light of his own wisdom  in the evening he returned to surbiton cottage having been into the city sold out stock for £700 and handed over the money to alaric tudor  on the following morning undy scott set out for scotland properly freighted mr whip vigil having in due course moved for a new writ for the tillietudlem borough in the place of mr mbuffer who had accepted the situation of steward of the chiltern hundreds    chapter xxv  chiswick gardens   the following thursday was as fine as a chiswick flowershowday ought to be and so very seldom is the party who had agreed to congregate therethe party that is whom we are to meetwas very select linda and katie had come up to spend a few days with their sister mrs val clementina gertrude and linda were to go in a carriage for which alaric was destined to pay and which mrs val had hired having selected it regardless of expense as one which by its decent exterior and polished outward graces conferred on its temporary occupiers an agreeable appearance of proprietorship the two miss neverbends sisters of fidus were also to be with them and they with katie followed humbly as became their station in a cab which was not only hired but which very vulgarly told the fact to all the world  slight as had been the intimacy between fidus neverbend and alaric at tavistock nevertheless a sort of friendship had since grown up between them alaric had ascertained that fidus might in a certain degree be useful to him that the good word of the aristides of the works and buildings might be serviceable and that in short neverbend was worth cultivating neverbend on the other hand when he perceived that tudor was likely to become a civil service hero a man to be named with glowing eulogy at all the government boards in london felt unconsciously a desire to pay him some of that reverence which a mortal always feels for a god and thus there was formed between them a sort of alliance which included also the ladies of the family  not that mrs val or even mrs a tudor encountered lactimel and ugolina neverbend on equal terms there is a distressing habitual humility in many unmarried ladies of an uncertain age which at the first blush tells the tale against them which they are so painfully anxious to leave untold in order to maintain their places but yet a little longer in that delicious world of love sighs and dancing partners from which it must be so hard for a maiden with all her youthful tastes about her to tear herself for ever away they smile and say pretty things put up with the caprices of married women and play second fiddle though the doing so in no whit assists them in their task nay the doing so does but stamp them the more plainly with that horrid name from which they would so fain escape their plea is for mercyhave pity on me have pity on me put up with me but for one other short twelve months and then if then i shall still have failed i will be content to vanish from the world for ever when did such plea for pity from one woman ever find real entrance into the heart of another  on such terms however the misses neverbend were content to follow mrs val to the chiswick flowershow and to feed on the crumbs which might chance to fall from the rich table of miss golightly to partake of broken meat in the shape of castoff adorers and regale themselves with lukewarm civility from the outsiders in the throng which followed that adorable heiress  and yet the misses neverbend were quite as estimable as the divine clementina and had once been perhaps as attractive as she is now they had never waltzed it is true as miss golightly waltzes it may be doubted indeed whether any lady ever did in the pursuit of that amusement ugolina was apt to be stiff and ungainly and to turn herself or allow herself to be turned as though she were made of wood she was somewhat flat in her figure looking as though she had been uncomfortably pressed into an unbecoming thinness of substance and a corresponding breadth of surface and this conformation did not assist her in acquiring a graceful flowing style of motion the elder sister lactimel was of a different form but yet hardly more fit to shine in the mazes of the dance than her sister she had her charms nevertheless which consisted of a somewhat stumpy dumpy comeliness she was altogether short in stature and very short below the knee she had fair hair and a fair skin small bones and copious soft flesh she had a trick of sighing gently in the evolutions of the waltz which young men attributed to her softness of heart and old ladies to her shortness of breath they both loved dancing dearly and were content to enjoy it whenever the chance might be given to them by the aid of miss golightlys crumbs  the two sisters were as unlike in their inward lights as in their outward appearance lactimel walked ever on the earth but ugolina never deserted the clouds lactimel talked prose and professed to read it ugolina read poetry and professed to write it lactimel was utilitarian cui bonothough probably in less classic phrasewas the question she asked as to everything ugolina was transcendental and denied that there could be real good in anything lactimel would have clothed and fed the hungry and naked so that all mankind might be comfortable ugolina would have brought mankind back to their original nakedness and have taught them to feed on the grasses of the field so that the claims of the body which so vitally oppose those of the mind might remain unheeded and despised they were both a little nebulous in their doctrines and apt to be somewhat unintelligible in their discourse when indulged in the delights of unrestrained conversation lactimel had a theory that every poor brother might eat of the fat and drink of the sweet might lie softly and wear fine linen if only some body or bodies could be induced to do their duties and ugolina was equally strong in a belief that if the mind were properly looked to all appreciation of human ill would cease but they delighted in generalizing rather than in detailed propositions and had not probably even in their own minds realized any exact idea as to the means by which the results they desired were to be brought about  they toadied mrs valpoor young women how little should they be blamed for this fault which came so naturally to them in their forlorn positionthey toadied mrs val and therefore mrs val bore with them they bored gertrude and gertrude for her husbands sake bore with them also they were confidential with clementina and clementina of course snubbed them they called clementina the sweetest creature lactimel declared that she was born to grace the position of a wife and mother and ugolina swore that her face was perfect poetry whereupon clementina laughed aloud and elegantly made a grimace with her nose and mouth as she turned the perfect poetry to her mother such were the ladies of the party who went to the chiswick flowershow and who afterwards were to figure at mrs vals little evening the dansant at which nobody was to be admitted who was not nice  they were met at the gate of the gardens by a party of young men of whom victoire jaquêtanàpe was foremost alaric and charley were to come down there when their office work was done undy was by this time on his road to tillietudlem and captain val was playing billiards at his club the latter had given a promise that he would make his appearancea promise however which no one expected or wished him to keep  the happy victoire was dressed up to his eyes that perhaps is not saying much for he was only a few feet high but what he wanted in quantity he fully made up in quality he was a wellmade shining jaunty little frenchman who seemed to be perfectly at ease with himself and all the world he had the smallest little pair of moustaches imaginable the smallest little imperial the smallest possible pair of boots and the smallest possible pair of gloves nothing on earth could be nicer or sweeter or finer than he was but he did not carry his finery like a hog in armour as an englishman so often does when an englishman stoops to be fine it sat as naturally on victoire as though he had been born in it he jumped about in his best patent leather boots apparently quite heedless whether he spoilt them or not and when he picked up miss golightlys parasol from the gravel he seemed to suffer no anxiety about his gloves  he handed out the ladies one after another as though his life had been passed in handing out ladies as indeed it probably hadin handing them out and handing them in and when mrs vals private carriage passed on he was just as courteous to the misses neverbend and katie in their cab as he had been to the greater ladies who had descended from the more ambitious vehicle as katie said afterwards to linda when she found the free use of her voice in their own bedroom he was a darling little duck of a man only he smelt so strongly of tobacco  but when they were once in the garden victoire had no time for anyone but mrs val and clementina he had done his duty by the misses neverbend and those other two insipid young english girls and now he had his own affairs to look after he also knew that miss golightly had £20000 of her own  he was one of those butterfly beings who seem to have been created that they may flutter about from flower to flower in the summer hours of such gala times as those now going on at chiswick just as other butterflies do what the butterflies were last winter or what will become of them next winter no one but the naturalist thinks of inquiring how they may feed themselves on flowerjuice or on insects small enough to be their prey is matter of no moment to the general world it is sufficient that they flit about in the sunbeams and add bright glancing spangles to the beauty of the summer day  and so it was with victoire jaquêtanàpe he did no work he made no honey he appeared to no one in the more serious moments of life he was the reverse of shylock he would neither buy with you nor sell with you but he would eat with you and drink with you as for praying he did little of that either with or without company he was clothed in purple and fine linen as butterflies should be clothed and fared sumptuously everyday but whence came his gay colours or why people fed him with pate and champagne nobody knew and nobody asked  like most frenchmen of his class he never talked about himself he understood life and the art of pleasing and the necessity that he should please too well to do so all that his companions knew of him was that he came from france and that when the gloomy months came on in england the months so unfitted for a french butterfly he packed up his azure wings and sought some more genial climate certain to return and be seen again when the world of london became habitable  if he had means of living no one knew it if he was in debt no one ever heard of it if he had a care in the world he concealed it he abounded in acquaintances who were always glad to see him and would have regarded it as quite de trop to have a friend nevertheless time was flying on with him as with others and butterfly as he was the idea of miss golightlys £20000 struck him with delightful amazement500000 francs 500000 francs and so he resolved to dance his very best warm as the weather undoubtedly was at the present moment  ah he was charmed to see madame and mademoiselle look so charmingly he said walking between mother and daughter but paying apparently much the greater share of attention to the elder lady in this respect we englishmen might certainly learn much from the manners of our dear allies we know well enough how to behave ourselves to our fair young countrywomen we can be civil enough to young womennature teaches us that but it is so seldom that we are sufficiently complaisant to be civil to old women and yet that after all is the soul of gallantry it is to the sex that we profess to do homage our theory is that feminine weakness shall receive from mans strength humble and respectful service but where is the chivalry where the gallantry if we only do service in expectation of receiving such guerdon as rosy cheeks and laughing eyes can bestow  it may be said that victoire had an object in being civil to mrs val but the truth is all french victoires are courteous to old ladies an englishman may probably be as forward as a frenchman in rushing into a flaming building to save an old womans life but then it so rarely happens that occasion offers itself for gallantry such as that a man however may with ease be civil to a dozen old women in one day  and so they went on walking through parterres and glasshouses talking of theatres balls dinnerparties picnics concerts operas of ladies married and single of single gentlemen who should be married and of married gentlemen who should be single of everything indeed except the flowers of which neither victoire nor his companions took the slightest notice  and madame really has a dance tonight in her own house  o yes said mrs val that is just a few quadrilles and waltzes for clementina i really hardly know whether the people will take the carpet up or no the people consisting of the cook and housemaidfor the page had of course come with the carriagewere at this moment hard at work wrenching up the nails as mrs val was very well aware  it will be delightful charming said victoire  just a few people of our own set you know said mrs val no crowd or fuss or anything of that sort just a few people that we know are nice in a quiet homely way  ah that is so pleasing said m victoire that is just what i like and is mademoiselle engaged for  no mademoiselle was not engaged either foror foror forc c c and then out came the little tablets under the dome of a huge greenhouse filled with the most costly exotics and clementina and her fellowlabourer in the cause of terpsichore went to work to make their arrangements for the evening  and the rest of the party followed them gertrude was accompanied by an englishman just as idle and quite as useless as m victoire of the butterfly tribe also but not so graceful and without colour  and then came the misses neverbend walking together and with them one on each side two tall frenchmen whose faces had been remodelled in that mould into which so large a proportion of parisians of the present day force their heads in order that they may come out with some look of the emperor about them were there not some such machine as this in operation it would be impossible that so many frenchmen should appear with elongated angular hard faces all as like each other as though they were brothers the cut of the beard the long pricklyended clotted moustache which looks as though it were being continually rolled up in saliva the sallow halfbronzed apparently unwashed colourthese may all perhaps be assumed by any man after a certain amount of labour and culture but how it has come to pass that every parisian has been able to obtain for himself a pair of the emperors long hard bony cruellooking cheeks no englishman has yet been able to guess that having the power they should have the wish to wear this mask is almost equally remarkable can it be that a political phase when stamped on a people with an iron hand of sufficient power of pressure will leave its impress on the outward body as well as on the inward soul if so a frenchman may perhaps be thought to have gained in the apparent stubborn wilfulness of his countenance some recompense for his compelled loss of all political wilfulness whatever  be this as it may the two misses neverbend walked on each with a stubborn longfaced frenchman at her side looking altogether not ill pleased at this instance of the excellence of french manners after them came linda talking to some acquaintance of her own and then poor dear little katie with another frenchman sterner more stubbornlooking more longfaced more like the pattern after whom he and they had been remodelled than any of them  poor little katie this was her first day in public with many imploring caresses with many halfformed tears in her bright eyes with many assurances of her perfect health she had induced her mother to allow her to come to the flowershow to allow her also to go to mrs vals dance at which there were to be none but such very nice people katie was to commence her life to open her ball with this flowershow in her imagination it was all to be one long bright flowershow in which however the sweet sorrowing of the sensitive plant would ever and anon invite her to pity and tears when she entered that narrow portal she entered the world and there she found herself walking on the wellmown grass with this huge stern bearded frenchman by her side as to talking to him that was quite out of the question at the gate some slight ceremony of introduction had been gone through which had consisted in all the frenchmen taking off their hats and bowing to the two married ladies and in the englishmen standing behind and poking the gravel with their canes but in this no special notice had of course been taken of katie and she had a kind of idea whence derived she knew not that it would be improper for her to talk to this man unless she were actually and bona fide introduced to him and then again poor katie was not very confident in her french and then her companion was not very intelligible in his english so when the gentleman asked is it that mademoiselle lofe de fleurs poor little katie felt herself tremble and tried in vain to mutter something and when again essaying to do his duty he suggested that all de beauté of londres did delight to valk itself at chisveek she was equally dumb merely turning on him her large eyes for one moment to show that she knew that he addressed her after that he walked on as silent as herself still keeping close to her side and other ladies who had not the good fortune to have male companions envied her happiness in being so attended  but alaric and charley were coming she knew alaric was her brotherinlaw now and therefore she would be delighted to meet him and charley dear charley she had not seen him since he went away that morning now four days since and four days was a long time considering that he had saved her life her busy little fingers had been hard at work the while and now she had in her pocket the purse which she had been so eager to make and which she was almost afraid to bestow  oh linda she had said i dont think i will after all it is such a little thing  nonsense child you wouldnt give him a worked counterpane little things are best for presents  but it isnt good enough she said looking at her handiwork in despair but nevertheless she persevered working in the golden beads with constant diligence so that she might be able to give it to charley among the chiswick flowers oh what a place it was in which to bestow a present with all the eyes of all the world upon her  and then this dance to which she was going the thought of what she would do there troubled her would anyone ask her to dance would charley think of her when he had so many grownup girls girls quite grown up all around him it would be very sad if at this london party it should be her fate to sit down the whole evening and see others dance it would suffice for her she thought if she could stand up with linda but she had an idea that this would not be allowed at a london party and then linda perhaps might not like it altogether she had much upon her mind and was beginning to think that perhaps she might have been happier to have stayed at home with her mamma she had not quite recovered from the effect of her toss into the water or the consequent excitement and a very little misery would upset her and so she walked on with her napoleonic companion from whom she did not know how to free herself through one glasshouse after another across lawns and along paths attempting every now and then to get a word with linda and not at all so happy as she had hoped to have been  at last gertrude came to her rescue they were all congregated for a while in one great flowerhouse and gertrude finding herself near her sister asked her how she liked it all  oh it is very beautiful said katie only  only what dear  would you let me come with you a little while look hereand she crept softly around to the other side of her sister sidling with little steps away from the frenchman at whom however she kept furtively looking as though she feared that he would detect her in the act look here gertrude she said twitching her sisters arm that gentleman thereyou see him dont you hes a frenchman and i dont know how to get away from him  how to get away from him said gertrude thats m delabarbe de lempereur a great friend of mrs vals and a very quiet sort of man i believe he wont eat you  no he wont eat me i know but i cant look at anything because he will walk so close to me maynt i come with you  gertrude told her she might and so katie made good her escape hiding herself from her enemy as well as she could behind her sisters petticoats he poor man was perhaps as rejoiced at the arrangement as katie herself at any rate he made no attempt to regain his prey but went on by himself looking as placidly stern as ever till he was absorbed by mrs vals more immediate party and then he devoted himself to her while m jaquêtanàpe settled with clementina the properest arrangement for the waltzes of the evening  katie was beginning to be tranquilly happy and was listening to the enthusiasm of ugolina neverbend who declared that flowers were the female poets fitting foodit may be doubted whether she had ever tried itwhen her heart leaped within her on hearing a sharp clear wellknown voice almost close behind her it was charley tudor after her silent promenade with m delabarbe de lempereur katie had been well pleased to put up with the obscure but yet endurable volubility of ugolina but now she felt almost as anxious to get quit of ugolina as she had before been to shake off the frenchman  flowers are natures chefdoeuvre said ugolina they convey to me the purest and most direct essence of that heavenly power of production which is the sweetest evidence which jehovah gives us of his presence  do they said katie looking over her shoulder to watch what charley was doing and to see whether he was coming to notice her  they are the bright stars of his immediate handiwork said ugolina and if our dim eyes could read them aright they would whisper to us the secret of his love  yes i dare say they would said katie who felt perhaps a little disappointed because charley lingered a while shaking hands with mrs val and clementina golightly  it was however but for a moment there was much shaking of hands to be done and a considerable taking off of hats to be gone through and as alaric and charley encountered the head of the column first it was only natural that they should work their way through it gradually katie however never guessedhow could shethat charley had calculated that by reaching her last he would be able to remain with her  she was still listening to ugolina who was mounting higher and higher up to heaven when she found her hand in charleys ugolina might now mount up and get down again as best she could for katie could no longer listen to her  alaric had not seen her yet since her ducking she had to listen to and to answer his congratulations charley standing by and making his comments  charley says you took to the water quite naturally and swam like a duck said alaric  only she went in head foremost said charley  all bathers ought to do that said alaric and tell me katie did you feel comfortable when you were in the water  indeed i dont recollect anything about it said she only that i saw charley coming to me just when i was going to sink for the last time  sink why im told that you floated like a deal board  the big hat and the crinoline kept her up said charley she had no idea of sinking  oh charley you know i was under the water for a long time and that if you had not come just at that very moment i should never have come up again  and then alaric went on and charley and katie were left together  how was she to give him the purse it was burning a hole in her pocket till she could do so and yet how was she to get it out of her possession into his and make her little speech here in the public garden she could have done it easily enough at home in the drawingroom at surbiton cottage  and how do you like the gardens asked charley  oh they are beautiful but i have hardly been able to see anything yet i have been going about with a great big frenchman there that man therehe has such a queer name  did his name prevent your seeing  no not his name i didnt know his name then  but it seemed so odd to be walking about with such a man as that but i want to go back and look at the black and yellow roses in that house there would you go with me that is if we may i wonder whether we may  charley was clearly of opinion that they might and should and would and so away they sallied back to the roses and katie began to enjoy the first instalment of the happiness which she had anticipated in the temple of the roses the crowd at first was great and she could not get the purse out of her pocket nor make her speech but after a while the people passed on and there was a lull before others filled their places and katie found herself opposite to a beautiful black rose with no one close to her but charley  i have got something for you she said and as she spoke she felt herself to be almost hot with blushing  something for me said charley and he also felt himself abashed he did not know why  its only a very little thing said katie feeling in her pocket and i am almost ashamed to ask you to take it but i made it all myself no one else put a stitch in it and so saying and looking round to see that she was not observed she handed her gift to charley  oh katie dearest katie said he i am so much obliged to youill keep it till i die  i didnt know what to make that was better said she  nothing on earth could possibly be better said he  a plate of bread and butter and a purse are a very poor return for saving ones life said she half laughing half crying  he looked at her with his eyes full of love and as he looked he swore within himself that come what might he would never see norah geraghty again but would devote his life to an endeavour to make himself worthy of the angel that was now with him katie the while was looking up anxiously into his face she was thinking of no other love than that which it became her to feel for the man who had saved her life she was thinking of no other love but her young heart was opening itself to a very different feeling she was sinking deep deep in waters which were to go near to drown her warm heart much nearer than those other waters which she fancied had all but closed for ever over her life  she looked into his face and saw that he was pleased and that for the present was enough for her she was at any rate happy now so they passed on through the roses and then lost themselves among the geraniums and wondered at the gigantic rhododendrons and beautiful azaleas and so went on from house to house and from flowerbed to flowerbed katie talking and charley listening till she began to wonder at her former supineness and to say both to herself and out loud to her companion how very very very glad she was that her mother had let her come  poor katiedear darling bonny katiesweet sweetest dearest child why oh why has that mother of thine that tenderhearted loving mother put thee unguarded in the way of such peril as this has she not sworn to herself that over thee at least she would watch as a hen does over her young so that no unfortunate love should quench thy young spirit or blanch thy cheeks bloom has she not trembled at the thought of what would have befallen thee had thy fate been such as lindas has she not oftenoh how oftenon her knees thanked the almighty god that lindas spirit was not as thine that this evil had happened to the lamb whose temper had been fitted by him to endure it and yethere thou artall unguarded all unaided left by thyself to drink of the cup of sweet poison and none near to warn thee that the draught is deadly  alastwould be useless to warn thee now the false god has been placed upon the altar the temple all shining with gems and gold has been built around him the incensecup is already swinging nothing will now turn the idolater from her worship nothing short of a miracle  our katies childish days are now all gone a womans passion glows within her breast though as yet she has not scanned it with a womans intelligence her mother listening to a childs entreaty had suffered her darling to go forth for a childs amusement it was doomed that the child should return no more but in lieu of her a fair heartladen maiden whose every fondest thought must henceforth be of a strangers welfare and a strangers fate  but it must not be thought that charley abused the friendship of mrs woodward and made love to katie as love is usually madewith warm words assurances of affection with squeezing of the hand with sighs and all a lovers ordinary catalogue of resources though we have said that he was a false god yet he was hardly to be blamed for the temple and gems and gold with which he was endowed not more so perhaps than the unconscious bud which is made so sacred on the banks of the egyptian river he loved too perhaps as warmly though not so fatally as katie did but he spoke no word of his love he walked among the flowers with her laughing and listening to her in his usual lighthearted easy manner every now and again his arm would thrill with pleasure as he felt on it the touch of her little fingers and his heart would leap within him as he gazed on the speaking beauty of her face but he was too honesthearted to talk to the young girl to mrs woodwards child of love he talked to her as to a childbut she listened to him and loved him as a woman  and so they rambled on till the hour appointed for quitting this elysium had arrived every now and again they had a glimpse of some one of their party which had satisfied katie that they were not lost at first clementina was seen tracing with her parasol on the turf the plan of a new dance then ugolina passed by them describing the poetry of the motion of the spheres in a full flow of impassioned eloquence to m delabarbe de lempereur cest toujours vrai ce que mademoiselle dit est toujours vrai was the frenchmans answer which they heard thrice repeated and then lactimel and captain val were seen together the latter having disappointed the prophecies which had been made respecting him lactimel had an idea that as the scotts were great people they were all in parliament and she was endeavouring to persuade captain val that something ought to be done for the poor  think said she only think captain scott of all the money that this fête must cost  a doosed sight said the captain hardly articulating from under his thick sandycoloured moustache which growing downwards from his nose looked like a heavy thatch put on to protect his mouth from the inclemency of the clouds above a doosed sight said the captain  now suppose captain scott that all this money could be collected the tickets you know and the dresses and  i wish i knew how to do it said the captain  lactimel went on with her little scheme for expending the cost of the flowershow in bread and bacon for the poor irish of saffron hill but charley and katie heard no more for the mild philosopher passed out of hearing and out of sight  at last katie got a poke in her back from a parasol just as charley had expended half a crown one of mr mruens last in purchasing for her one simple beautiful flower to put into her hair that night  you naughty puss said gertrude we have been looking for you all over the gardens mrs val and the miss neverbends have been waiting this halfhour katie looked terribly frightened come along and dont keep them waiting any longer they are all in the passage this was your fault master charley  o no it was not said katie but we thought  never mind thinking said gertrude but come along and so they hurried on and were soon replaced in their respective vehicles and then went back to town  well i do think the chiswick gardens is the nicest place in all the world said katie leaning back in the cab and meditating on her past enjoyment  they are very prettyvery said lactimel neverbend i only wish every cottar had such a garden behind his cottage i am sure we might manage it if we set about it in the right way  what as big as chiswick said katie  no not so big said lactimel but quite as nicely kept  i think the pigs would get in said katie  it would be much easier and more important too to keep their minds nicely said ugolina and there the pigs could never get in  no i suppose not said katie  i dont know that said lactimel    chapter xxvi  katies first ball   in spite of mrs vals oftrepeated assurance that they would have none but nice people she had done her best to fill her rooms and not unsuccessfully she had it is true eschewed the golightly party who resided some north of oxford street in the purlieus of fitzroy square and some even to the east of tottenham court road she had eschewed the golightlys and confined herself to the scott connexion but so great had been her success in life that even under these circumstances she had found herself able to fill her rooms respectably if indeed there was no absolute crowding if some space was left in the front drawingroom sufficient for the operations of dancers she could still attribute this apparent want of fashionable popularity to the selections of the few nice people whom she had asked the hon mrs val was no ordinary woman and understood well how to make the most of the goods with which the gods provided her  the miss neverbends were to dine with the tudors and go with them to the dance in the evening and their brother fidus was to meet them there charley was of course one of the party at dinner and as there was no other gentleman there alaric had an excellent opportunity when the ladies went up to their toilets to impress on his cousin the expediency of his losing no time in securing to himself miss golightlys twenty thousand pounds the conversation as will be seen at last became rather animated  well charley what do you think of the beautiful clementina said alaric pushing over the bottle to his cousin as soon as they found themselves alone a doosed fine girl as captain val says isnt she  a doosed fine girl of course said charley laughing she has too much go in her for me im afraid  marriage and children will soon pull that down shed make an excellent wife for such a man as you and to tell you the truth charley if youll take my advice youll lose no time in making up to her she has got that d french fellow at her heels and though i dont suppose she cares one straw about him it may be well to make sure  but you dont mean in earnest that you think that miss golightly would have me  indeed i doyou are just the man to get on with girls and as far as i can see you are just the man that will never get on in any other way under the sun  charley sighed as he thought of his many debts his poor prospects and his passionate love there seemed indeed to be little chance that he ever would get on at all in the ordinary sense of the word im sure shed refuse me said he still wishing to back out of the difficulty im sure she wouldive not got a penny in the world you know  thats just the reasonshe has got lots of money and you have got none  just the reason why she should refuse me you should say  wellwhat if she does theres no harm done faint heart never won fair lady youve everything to back youmrs val is led by undy scott and undy is all on your side  but she has got guardians hasnt she  yesher fathers first cousin old sam golightly he is dying or dead probably by this time only mrs val wont have the news brought to her because of this party he had a fit of apoplexy yesterday then theres her fathers brotherinlaw figgs hes bedridden when old golightly is off the hooks altogether another will be chosen and undy talks of putting in my name as that of a family friend so youll have everything to assist you  charley looked very grave he had not been in the habit of discussing such matters but it seemed to him that if alaric was about to become in any legal manner the guardian of miss golightlys fortune that that in itself was reason enough why he alaric should not propose such a match as this needy men to be sure did often marry rich ladies and the world looked on and regarded it only as a matter of course but surely it would be the duty of a guardian to protect his ward from such a fate if it were in his power to do so  alaric who saw something of what was going on in his cousins mind essayed to remove the impression which was thus made besides you know clementina is no chicken her fortune is at her own disposal all the guardians on earth cannot prevent her marrying you if she makes up her mind to do so  charley gulped down his glass of wine and then sat staring at the fire saying nothing further it was true enough that he was very poortrue enough that miss golightlys fortune would set him on his legs and make a man of himtrue enough perhaps that no other expedient of which he could think would do so but then there were so many arguments that were strong against the deed in the first place he thought it impossible that he should be successful in such a suit and then again it would hardly be honest to obtain such success if it were possible then thirdly he had no sort of affection whatsoever for miss golightly and fourthly lastly and chiefly he loved so dearly tenderly loved poor katie woodward  as he thought of this he felt horrorstricken with himself at allowing the idea of his becoming a suitor to another to dwell for an instant on his mind and looking up with all the resolution which he was able to summon he saidits impossible alaric quite impossible i couldnt do it  then what do you mean to do said alaric who was angry at having his scheme thus thwarted do you mean to be a beggaror if not how do you intend to get out of your difficulties  i trust not a beggar said charley sadly  what other hope have you what rational hope of setting yourself right  perhaps i may do something by writing said charley very bashfully  by writing ha ha ha and alaric laughed somewhat cruelly at the poor navvy do something by writing what will you do by writing will you make £20000or 20000 pence of all trades going that i should say is likely to be the poorest for a poor manthe poorest and the most heartbreaking what have you made already to encourage you  the editor says that crinoline and macassar will come to £4 10s  and when will you get it  the editor says that the rule is to pay six months after the date of publication the daily delight is only a new thing you know the editor says that if the sale comes up to his expectations he will increase the scale of pay  a prospect of £4 10s for a fortnights hard work thats a bad lookout my boy you had better take the heiress  it may be a bad lookout said charley whose spirit was raised by his cousins sneersbut at any rate its honest and ill tell you what alaric id sooner earn £50 by writing for the press than get £1000 in any other way you can think of it may be a poor trade in one way and authors i believe are poor but i am sure it has its consolations  well charley i hope with all my heart that you may find them for my own part seeing what a place the world is seeing what are the general aspirations of other men seeing what as it appears to me the creator has intended for the goal of our labours i look for advancement prosperity and such rank and station as i may be able to win for myself the labourer is worthy of his hire and i do not mean to refuse such wages as may come in my way  yes said charley who now that his spirit was roused determined to fight his battle manfully yes the labourer is worthy of his hire but were i to get miss golightlys fortune i should be taking the hire without labour  bah said alaric  it would be dishonest in every way for i do not love her and should not love her at the moment that i married her  honesty said alaric still sneering there is no sign of the dishonesty of the age so strong as the continual talk which one hears about honesty it was quite manifest that alaric had not sat at the feet of undy scott without profiting by the lessons which he had heard  with what face continued he can you pretend to be more honest than your neighbours  i know that it is wrong and unmanly too to hunt a girl down merely for what she has got  there are a great many wrong and unmanly men about then said alaric look through the houses of parliament and see how many men there have married for money aye and made excellent husbands afterwards ill tell you what it is charley it is all humbug in you to pretend to be better than others you are not a bit bettermind i do not say you are worse we have none of us too much of this honesty of which we are so fond of prating where was your honesty when you ordered the coat for which you know you cannot pay or when you swore to the bootmaker that he should have the amount of his little bill after next quarterday knowing in your heart at the time that he wouldnt get a farthing of it if you are so honest why did you waste your money today in going to chiswick instead of paying some portion of your debts honest you are i dare say indifferently honest as the world goes like the rest of us but i think you might put the burden of clementinas fortune on your conscience without feeling much the worse for it after what you have already gone through  charley became very red in the face as he sat silent listening to alarics addressnor did he speak at once at the first pause so alaric went on the truth i take it is that at the present moment you have no personal fancy for this girl  no i have not said charley  and you are so incredibly careless as to all prudential considerations as to prefer your immediate personal fancies to the future welfare of your whole life i can say no more if you will think well of my proposition i will do all i can to assist you i have no doubt you would make a good husband to miss golightly and that she would be very happy with you if you think otherwise there is an end of it but pray do not talk so much about your honestyyour tailor would arrest you tomorrow if he heard you  there are two kinds of honesty i take it said charley speaking with suppressed anger and sorrow visible in his face that which the world sees and that which it does not see for myself i have nothing to say in my own defence i have made my bed badly and must lie on it as it is i certainly will not mend it by marrying a girl that i can never love and as for you alaric all who know you and love you watch your career with the greatest hope we know your ambition and all look to see you rise in the world but in rising as you will do you should remember thisthat nothing that is wrong can become right because other people do it  well charley said the other thank you for the lecture i did not certainly expect it from you but it is not on that account the less welcome and now suppose we go upstairs and dress for mrs val and so they went upstairs  katies heart beat high as she got out of the carriagemrs vals private carriage had been kept on for the occasionand saw before and above her on the stairs a crowd of muslin crushing its way on towards the room prepared for dancing katie had never been to a ball before we hope that the word ball may not bring down on us the adverse criticism of the morning post it was probably not a ball in the strictly fashionable sense of the word but it was so to katie to all intents and purposes her dancing had hitherto been done either at childrens parties or as a sort of supplemental amusement to the evening teagatherings at hampton or hampton court she had never yet seen the muse worshipped with the premeditated ceremony of banished carpets chalked floors and hired musicians her heart consequently beat high as she made her way upstairs linked arminarm with ugolina neverbend  shall you dance much said ugolina  oh i hope so said katie  i shall not it is an amusement of which i am peculiarly fond and for which my active habits suit me this was probably said with some allusion to her sister who was apt to be short of breath but in the dances of the present day conversation is impossible and i look upon any pursuit as barbaric which stops the feast of reason and the flow of soul  katie did not quite understand this but she thought in her heart that she would not at all mind giving up talking for the whole evening if she could only get dancing enough but on this matter her heart misgave her to be sure she was engaged to charley for the first quadrille and second waltz but there her engagements stopped whereas clementina as she was aware had a whole book full of them what if she should get no more dancing when charleys good nature should have been expended she had an idea that no one would care to dance with her when older partners were to be had ah katie you do not yet know the extent of your riches or half the wealth of your own attractions  and then they all heard another little speech from mrs val she was really quite ashamedshe really wasto see so many people she could not wish any of her guests away that would be impossiblethough perhaps one or two might be spared she said in a confidential whisper to gertrude who the one or two might be it would be difficult to decide as she had made the same whisper to every one but she really was ashamed there was almost a crowd and she had quite intended that the house should be nearly empty the fact was everybody asked had come and as she could not of course have counted on that why she had got you see twice as many people as she had expected and then she went on and made the same speech to the next arrival  katie who wanted to begin the play at the beginning kept her eye anxiously on charley who was still standing with lactimel neverbend on his arm oh now said she to herself if he should forget me and begin dancing with miss neverbend but then she remembered how he had jumped into the water and determined that even with such provocation as that she must not be angry with him  but there was no danger of charleys forgetting come said he we must not lose any more time if we mean to dance the first set alaric will be our visàvishe is going to dance with miss neverbend and so they stood up katie tightened her gloves gave her dress a little shake looked at her shoes and then the work of the evening began  i shouldnt have liked to have sat down for the first dance she said confidentially to charley because its my first ball  sit down i dont suppose youll be let to sit down the whole evening youll be crying out for mercy about three or four oclock in the morning  its you to go on now said katie whose eyes were intent on the figure and who would not have gone wrong herself or allowed her partner to do so on any consideration and so the dance went on right merrily  ive got to dance the first polka with miss golightly said charley  and the next with me said katie  you may be sure i shant forget that  you lucky man to get miss golightly for a partner i am told she is the most beautiful dancer in the world  o nomademoiselleis much better said charley naming the principal stage performer of the day if one is to go the whole hog one had better do it thoroughly  katie did not quite understand then what he meant and merely replied that she would look at the performance in this however she was destined to be disappointed for charley had hardly left her before miss golightly brought up to her the identical m delabarbe de lempereur who had so terribly put her out in the gardens this was done so suddenly that katies presence of mind was quite insufficient to provide her with any means of escape the frenchman bowed very low and said nothing katie made a little curtsy and was equally silent then she felt her own arm gathered up and put within his and she stood up to take her share in the awful performance she felt herself to be in such a nervous fright that she would willingly have been home again at hampton if she could but as this was utterly impossible she had only to bethink herself of her steps and get through the work as best she might  away went charley and clementina leading the throng away went m jaquêtanàpe and linda away went another frenchman clasping in his arms the happy ugolina away went lactimel with a young weights and measuresand then came katies turn she pressed her lips together shut her eyes and felt the tall frenchmans arms behind her back and made a start twas like plunging into cold water on the first bathing day of the seasonce nest que le premier pas que coute when once off katie did not find it so bad the frenchman danced well and katie herself was a wicked little adept at home at surbiton dancing with another girl she had with great triumph tired out the fingers both of her mother and sister and forced them to own that it was impossible to put her down m de lempereur therefore had his work before him and he did it like a manas long as he could  katie who had not yet assumed the airs or will of a grownup young lady thought that she was bound to go on as long as her grand partner chose to go with her he on the other hand accustomed in his gallantry to obey all ladies wishes considered himself bound to leave it to her to stop when she pleased and so they went on with apparently interminable gyrations charley and the heiress had twice been in motion and had twice stopped and still they were going on ugolina had refreshed herself with many delicious observations and lactimel had thrice paused to advocate dancing for the million and still they went on the circle was gradually left to themselves and still they went on people stood round some admiring and others pitying and still they went on katie thinking of her steps and her business did not perceive that she and her partner were alone and ever and anon others of course joined inand so they went onand onand on  m delabarbe de lempereur was a strong and active man but he began to perceive that the lady was too much for him he was already melting away with his exertions while his partner was as cool as a cucumber she with her active young legs her lightly filled veins and small agile frame could have gone on almost for ever but m de lempereur was more encumbered gallantry was at last beat by nature his overtasked muscles would do no more for him and he was fain to stop dropping his partner into a chair and throwing himself in a state of utter exhaustion against the wall  katie was hardly out of breath as she received the congratulations of her friends but at the moment she could not understand why they were quizzing her in after times however she was often reproached with having danced a frenchman to death in the evening in revenge for his having bored her in the morning it was observed that m delabarbe de lempereur danced no more that evening indeed he very soon left the house  katie had not been able to see miss golightlys performance but it had been well worth seeing she was certainly no ordinary performer and if she did not quite come up to the remarkable movements which one sees on the stage under the name of dancing the fault was neither in her will nor her ability but only in her education charley also was peculiarly well suited to give her ample verge and room enough to show off all her perfections her most peculiar merit consisted perhaps in her power of stopping herself suddenly while going on at the rate of a hunt one way and without any pause or apparent difficulty going just as fast the other way this was done by a jerk which must one would be inclined to think have dislocated all her bones and entirely upset her internal arrangements but no it was done without injury or any disagreeable result either to her brain or elsewhere we all know how a steamer is manoeuvred when she has to change her course how we stop her and ease her and back her but miss golightly stopped and eased and backed all at once and that without collision with any other craft it was truly very wonderful and katie ought to have looked at her  katie soon found occasion to cast off her fear that her evenings happiness would be destroyed by a dearth of partners her troubles began to be of an exactly opposite description she had almost envied miss golightly her little book full of engagements and now she found herself dreadfully bewildered by a book of her own some one had given her a card and a pencil and every moment she could get to herself was taken up in endeavouring to guard herself from perfidy on her own part all down the card at intervals which were not very far apart there were great cs which stood for charley and her firmest feeling was that no earthly consideration should be allowed to interfere with those landmarks and then there were all manner of hieroglyphicssometimes unfortunately illegible to katie herselffrench names and english names mixed together in a manner most vexatious and to make matters worse she found that she had put down both victoire jaquêtanàpe and mr johnson of the weights by a great i and she could not remember with whom she was bound to dance the lancers and to which she had promised the last polka before supper one thing however was quite fixed when supper should arrive she was to go downstairs with charley  what dreadful news linda said charley did you hear it linda was standing up with mr neverbend for a sober quadrille and katie also was close by with her partner dreadful news indeed  what is it said linda  a man can die but once to be sure but to be killed in such a manner as that is certainly very sad  killed who has been killed said neverbend  well perhaps i shouldnt say killed he only died in the cab as he went home  died in a cab how dreadful said neverbend who who was it mr tudor  didnt you hear how very odd why m de lempereur to be sure i wonder what the coroner will bring it in  how can you talk such nonsense charley said linda  very well master charley said katie all that comes of being a writer of romances i suppose thats to be the next contribution to the daily delight  neverbend went off on his quadrille not at all pleased with the joke indeed he was never pleased with a joke and in this instance he ventured to suggest to his partner that the idea of a gentleman expiring in a cab was much too horrid to be laughed at  oh we never mind charley tudor said linda he always goes on in that way we all like him so much  mr neverbend who though not very young still had a susceptible heart within his bosom had been much taken by lindas charms he already began to entertain an idea that as a mrs neverbend would be a desirable adjunct to his establishment at some future period he could not do better than offer himself and his worldly goods to the acceptance of miss woodward he therefore said nothing further in disparagement of the family friend but he resolved that no such alliance should ever induce him to make mr charles tudor welcome at his house but what could he have expected the internal navigation had ever been a low place and he was surprised that the hon mrs val should have admitted one of the navvies inside her drawingroom  and so the ball went on mr johnson came duly for the lancers and m jaquêtanàpe for the polka johnson was great at the lancers knowing every turn and vagary in that most intricate and exclusive of dances and it need hardly be said that the polka with m jaquêtanàpe was successful the last honour however was not without evil results for it excited the envy of ugolina who proud of her own performance had longed but hitherto in vain to be whirled round the room by that wondrously expert foreigner  well my dear said ugolina with an air that plainly said that katie was to be treated as a child i hope you have had dancing enough  oh indeed i have not said katie fully appreciating the purport and cause of her companions remark not near enough  ahbut my dearyou should remember said ugolina your mamma will be displeased if you fatigue yourself  my mamma is never displeased because we amuse ourselves and i am not a bit fatigued and so saying katie walked off and took refuge with her sister gertrude what business had any ugolina neverbend to interfere between her and her mamma  then came the supper there was a great rush to get downstairs but charley was so clever that even this did not put him out of course there was no sitting down which means that the bashful retiring and obedient guests were to stand on their legs while those who were forward and impudent and disobedient found seats for themselves wherever they could charley was certainly among the latter class and he did not rest therefore till he had got katie into an old armchair in one corner of the room in such a position as to enable himself to eat his own supper leaning against the chimneypiece  i say johnson said he do bring me some ham and chickenits for a ladyim wedged up here and cant get outand johnson some sherry  the goodnatured young weights obeyed and brought the desired provisions  and johnsonupon my word im sorry to be so troublesomebut one more plateful if you pleasefor another ladya good deal if you please for this lady for shes very hungry and some more sherry  johnson again obeyedthe weights are always obedientand charley of course appropriated the second portion to his own purposes  oh charley that was a fibnow wasnt it you shouldnt have said it was for a lady  but then i shouldnt have got it  oh but thats no reason according to that everybody might tell a fib whenever they wanted anything  well everybody doeseverybody except you katie  o no said katieno they dontmamma and linda and gertrude never do nor harry norman he never does nor alaric  no harry norman never does said charley with something like vexation in his tone he made no exception to katies list of truthtellers but he was thinking within himself whether alaric had a juster right to be in the catalogue than himself harry norman never does certainly you must not compare me with them katie they are patterns of excellence i am all the other way as everybody knows he was half laughing as he spoke but katies sharp ear knew that he was more than half in earnest and she felt she had pained him by what she had said  oh charley i didnt mean that indeed i did not i know that in all serious things you are as truthful as they areand quite as goodthat is in many ways poor katie she wanted to console him she wanted to be kind and yet she could not be dishonest  quite as good no you know i am not  you are as goodhearted if not better and you will be as steady wont you charley i am sure you will and i know you are more clever really more clever than either of them  oh katie  i am quite sure you are i have always said so dont be angry with me for what i said  angry with you i couldnt be angry with you  i wouldnt for the world say anything to vex you i like you better than either of them though alaric is my brotherinlaw of course i do how could i help it when you saved my life  saved your life pooh i didnt save your life any boy could have done the same or any waterman about the place when you fell in the person who was nearest you pulled you out that was all  there was something almost approaching to ferocity in his voice as he said this and yet when katie timidly looked up she saw that he had turned his back to the room and that his eyes were full of tears he had felt that he was loved by this child but that he was loved from a feeling of uncalledfor gratitude he could not stop to analyse this to separate the sweet from the bitter but he knew that the latter prevailed it is so little flattering to be loved when such love is the offspring of gratitude and then when that gratitude is unnecessary when it has been given in mistake for supposed favours the acceptance of such love is little better than a cheat  that was not all said katie very decidedly it never shall be all in my mind if you had not been with us i should now have been drowned and cold and dead and mamma where would she have been oh charley i shall think myself so wicked if i have said anything to vex you  charley did not analyse his feelings nor did katie analyse hers it would have been impossible for her to do so but could she have done it and had she done it she would have found that her gratitude was but the excuse which she made to herself for a passionate love which she could not have excused even to herself in any other way  he said everything he could to reassure her and make her happy and she soon smiled and laughed again  now thats what my editor would call a nemesis said charley  oh thats a nemesis is it  johnson was cheated into doing my work and getting me my supper and then you scolded me and took away my appetite so that i couldnt eat it thats a nemesis johnson is avenged only unluckily he doesnt know it and wickedness is punished  well mind you put it into the daily delight but all the girls are going upstairs pray let me get out and so katie went upstairs again  it was then past one about two hours afterwards gertrude looking for her sister that she might take her home found her seated on a bench with her feet tucked under her dress she was very much fatigued and she looked to be so but there was still a bright laughing sparkle in her eye which showed that her spirits were not even yet weary  well katie have you had enough dancing  nearly said katie yawning  you look as if you couldnt stand  yes i am too tired to stand but still i think i could dance a little more only  only what  whisper said katie and gertrude put down her ear near to her sisters lips both my shoes are quite worn out and my toes are all out on the floor  it was clearly time for them to go home so away they all went    chapter xxvii  excelsior   the last words that katie spoke as she walked down mrs vals hall leaning on charleys arm as he led her to the carriage were these  you will be steady charley wont you you will try to be steady wont you dear charley and as she spoke she almost imperceptibly squeezed the arm on which she was leaning charley pressed her little hand as he parted from her but he said nothing what could he say in that moment of time in answer to such a request had he made the reply which would have come most readily to his lips it would have been this it is too late katietoo late for me to profit by a caution even from youno steadiness now will save me katie however wanted no other answer than the warm pressure which she felt on her hand  and then leaning back in the carriage and shutting her eyes she tried to think quietly over the events of the night but it was alas a dream and yet so like reality that she could not divest herself of the feeling that the ball was still going on she still seemed to see the lights and hear the music to feel herself whirled round the room and to see others whirling whirling whirling on every side of her she thought over all the names on her card and the little contests that had taken place for her hand and all charleys jokes and m de lempereurs great disaster and then as she remembered how long she had gone on twisting round with the poor unfortunate illused frenchman she involuntarily burst out into a fit of laughter  good gracious katie what is the matter i thought you were asleep said gertrude  so did i said linda what on earth can you be laughing at now  i was laughing at myself said katie still going on with her halfsuppressed chuckle and thinking what a fool i was to go on dancing so long with that m de lempereur oh dear gertrude i am so tired shall we be home soon and then she burst out crying  the excitement and fatigue of the day had been too much for her and she was now completely overcome ugolina neverbends advice though not quite given in the kindest way had in itself been good mrs woodward would in truth have been unhappy could she have seen her child at this moment katie made an attempt to laugh off her tears but she failed and her sobs then became hysterical and she lay with her head on her married sisters shoulder almost choking herself in her attempts to repress them  dear katie dont sob so said lindadont cry pray dont cry dear katie  she had better let it have its way said gertrude she will be better directly wont you katie  in a little time she was better and then she burst out laughing again i wonder why the man went on when he was so tired what a stupid man he must be  gertrude and linda both laughed in order to comfort her and bring her round  do you know i think it was because he didnt know how to say stop in english and then she burst out laughing again and that led to another fit of hysterical tears  when they reached home gertrude and linda soon got her into bed linda was to sleep with her and she also was not very long in laying her head on her pillow but before she did so katie was fast asleep and twice in her sleep she cried out oh charley oh charley then linda guessed how it was with her sister and in the depths of her loving heart she sorrowed for the coming grief which she foresaw  when the morning came katie was feverish and had a headache it was thought better that she should remain in town and alaric took linda down to hampton the next day mrs woodward came up and as the invalid was better she took her home but still she was an invalid the doctor declared that she had never quite recovered from her fall into the river and prescribed quiet and codliver oil all the truth about the chiswick fête and the five hours dancing and the wornout shoes was not told to him or he might perhaps have acquitted the watergods of the injury nor was it all perhaps told to mrs woodward  im afraid she tired herself at the ball said mrs woodward  i think she did a little said linda  did she dance much said mrs woodward looking anxiously  she did dance a good deal said linda  mrs woodward was too wise to ask any further questions  as it was a fine night alaric had declared his intention of walking home from mrs vals party and he and charley started together they soon parted on their roads but not before alaric had had time to notice charleys perverse stupidity as to miss golightly  so you wouldnt take my advice about clementina said he  it was quite impossible alaric said charley in an apologetic voice i couldnt do it and what is more i am sure i never shall  no not now you certainly cant do it now if i am not very much mistaken the chance is gone i think youll find she engaged herself to that frenchman tonight  very likely said charley  welli did the best i could for you good night old fellow  im sure im much obliged to you good night said charley  alarics suggestion with reference to the heiress was quite correct m jaquêtanàpe had that night proposed and been duly accepted he was to present himself to his loved ones honourable mother on the following morning as her future soninlaw comforted and supported in his task of doing so by an assurance from the lady that if her mother would not give her consent the marriage should go on all the same without it how delightful to have such a dancer for her lover thought clementina that was her excelsior  charley walked home with a sad heart he had that day given a pledge that he would on the morrow go to the cat and whistle and visit his ladylove since the night when he sat there with norah geraghty on his knee now nearly a fortnight since he had spent but little of his time there he had indeed gone there once or twice with his friend scatterall but had contrived to avoid any confidential intercourse with either the landlady or the barmaid alleging as an excuse for his extraordinary absence that his time was wholly occupied by the demands made on it by the editor of the daily delight mrs davis however was much too sharp and so also we may say was miss geraghty to be deceived they well knew that such a young man as charley would go wherever his inclination led him till lately it had been all but impossible to get him out of the little back parlour at the cat and whistle now it was nearly as difficult to get him into it they both understood what this meant  youd better take up with peppermint and have done with it said the widow whats the good of your shillyshallying till youre as thin as a whippingpost if you dont mind what youre after hell be off too  and the d go along with him said miss geraghty who had still about her a twang of the county clare from whence she came  with all my heart said mrs davis i shall save my hundred pounds but if youll be led by me youll not throw peppermint over till youre sure of the other and take my word for it youre  i hate peppermint  nonsense hes an honest good sort of man and a deal more likely to keep you out of want than the other  hereupon norah began to cry and to wipe her beautiful eyes with the glasscloth hers indeed was a cruel position her face was her fortune and her fortune she knew was deteriorating from day to day she could not afford to lose the lover that she loved and also the lover that she did not love matrimony with her was extremely desirable and she was driven to confess that it might very probably be either now or never much as she hated peppermint she was quite aware that she would take him if she could not do better but then was it absolutely certain that she must lose the lover that so completely suited her taste mrs davis said it was norah herself confiding as it is so natural that ladies should do a little too much in her own beauty thought that she couldnt but have a chance left she also had her high aspirations she desired to rise in the world to leave goes of gin and screws of tobacco behind her and to reach some position more worthy of the tastes of a woman excelsior translated doubtless into excellent irish was her motto also it would be so great a thing to be the wife of charles tudor esq of the civil service and more especially as she dearly and truly loved the same charles tudor in her heart of hearts  she knew however that it was not for her to indulge in the luxury of a heart if circumstances absolutely forbade it to eat and drink and clothe herself and if possible to provide eating and drinking and clothes for her future years this was the business of life this was the only real necessity she had nothing to say in opposition to mrs davis and therefore she went on crying and again wiped her eyes with the glasscloth  mrs davis however was no stern monitor unindulgent to the weakness of human nature when she saw how norah took to heart her sad fate she resolved to make one more effort in her favour she consequently dressed herself very nicely put on her best bonnet and took the unprecedented step of going off to the internal navigation and calling on charley in the middle of his office  charley was poking over the kennett and avon lock entries with his usual official energy when the office messenger came up and informed him that a lady was waiting to see him  a lady said charley what lady and he immediately began thinking of the woodwards whom he was to meet that afternoon at chiswick  im sure i cant say sir all that she said was that she was a lady answered the messenger falsely for he well knew that the woman was mrs davis of the cat and whistle  now the clerks at the internal navigation were badly off for a waitingroom and in no respect can the different ranks of different public offices be more plainly seen than in the presence or absence of such little items of accommodation as this at the weights and measures there was an elegant little chamber carpeted furnished with leathernbottomed chairs and a clock supplied with creamlaid notepaper new pens and the times newspaper quite a little elysium in which to pass half an hour while the secretary whom one had called to see was completing his last calculation on the matter of the decimal coinage but there were no such comforts at the internal navigation there was indeed a little room at the top of the stairs in which visitors were requested to sit down but even here two men were always at workat work or else at play  into this room mrs davis was shown and there charley found her long and intimately as the young navvy had been acquainted with the landlady of the cat and whistle he had never before seen her arrayed for the outer world it may be doubted whether sir john falstaff would at the first glance have known even dame quickly in her bonnet that is if dame quickly in those days had had a bonnet at any rate charley was at fault for a moment and was shaking hands with the landlady before he quite recognized who she was  the men in the room however had recognized her and charley well knew that they had done so  mr tudor she began not a bit abashed i want to know what it is you are agoing to do  though she was not abashed charley was and very much so however he contrived to get her out of the room so that he might speak to her somewhat more privately in the passage the gentlemen at the internal navigation were well accustomed to this mode of colloquy as their tradesmen not unfrequently called with the view of having a little conversation which could not conveniently be held in the public room  and mr tudor what are you agoing to do about that poor girl there said mrs davis as soon as she found herself in the passage and saw that charley was comfortably settled with his back against the wall  she may go to hongkong for me that is what charley should have said but he did not say it he had neither the sternness of heart nor the moral courage to enable him to do so he was very anxious it is true to get altogether quit of norah geraghty but his present immediate care was confined to a desire of getting mrs davis out of the office  do said charley oh i dont know ill come and settle something some of these days let me see whensay next tuesday  settle something said mrs davis if you are an honest man as i take you there is only one thing to settle when do you mean to marry her  hush said charley for as she was speaking mr snape came down the passage leading from mr oldescholes room hush mr snape as he passed walked very slowly and looked curiously round into the widows face ill be even with you old fellow for that said charley to himself and it may be taken for granted that he kept his word before long  oh it is no good hushing any more said mrs davis hardly waiting till mr snapes erect ears were out of hearing hushing wont do no good theres that girl adying and her gravell be atop of your head mr tudor mind i tell you that fairly so now i want to know what it to youre agoing to do and then mrs davis lifted up the lid of a market basket which hung on her left arm took out her pockethandkerchief and began to wipe her eyes  unfortunate charley an idea occurred to him that he might bolt and leave her but then the chances were that she would make her way into his very room and tell her story there out before them all he well knew that this woman was capable of many things if her temper were fairly roused and yet what could he say to her to induce her to go out from that building and leave him alone to his lesser misfortunes  shes adying i tell you mr tudor continued the landlady and if she do die be sure of this i wont be slow to tell the truth about it im the only friend shes got and im not going to see her put upon so just tell me this in two wordswhat is it youre agoing to do and then mrs davis replaced her kerchief in the basket stood boldly erect in the middle of the passage waiting for charleys answer  just at this moment mr snape again appeared in the passage going towards mr oldescholes room the pernicious old man he hated charley tudor and to tell the truth there was no love lost between them charley afflicted and out of spirits as he was at the moment could not resist the opportunity of being impertinent to his old foe im afraid youll make yourself very tired mr snape if you walk about so much said he mr snape merely looked at him and then hard at mrs davis and passed on to mr oldescholes room  well mr tudor will you be so good as to tell me what it is youre going to do about this poor girl  my goodness mrs davis you know how i am situatedhow can you expect me to give an answer to such a question in such a place as this ill come to the cat and whistle on tuesday  gammon said the eloquent lady you know you means gammon  charley perhaps did mean gammon but he protested that he had never been more truthfully in earnest in his life mr oldescholes door opened and mrs davis perceiving it whipped out her handkerchief in haste and again began wiping her eyes not without audible sobs confound the woman said charley to himself what on earth shall i do with her  mr oldescholes door opened and out of it came mr oldeschole and mr snape following him what means the clerk had used to bring forth the secretary need not now be inquired forth they both came and passed along the passage brushing close by charley and mrs davis mr oldeschole when he saw that one of the clerks was talking to a woman who apparently was crying looked very intently on the ground and passed by with a quick step mr snape looked as intently at the woman and passed very slowly each acted according to his lights  i dont mean gammon at all mrs davisindeed i dontill be there on tuesday night certainly if not sooneri will indeedi shall be in a desperate scrape if they see me here talking to you any longer there is a rule against women being in the office at all  and theres a rule against the clerks marrying i suppose said mrs davis  the colloquy ended in charley promising to spend the saturday evening at the cat and whistle with the view of then and there settling what he meant to do about that there girl nothing short of such an undertaking on his part would induce mrs davis to budge had she known her advantage she might have made even better terms he would almost rather have given her a written promise to marry her barmaid than have suffered her to remain there till mr oldeschole should return and see her there again so mrs davis with her basket and pockethandkerchief went her way about her marketing and charley as he returned to his room gave the strictest injunctions to the messenger that not on any ground or excuse whatever was any woman to be again allowed to see him at the office  when therefore on the fine summer morning with the early daylight all bright around him charley walked home from mrs vals party he naturally felt sad enough he had one sixpence left in his pocket he was engaged to spend the evening of the following day with the delightful norah at the cat and whistle then and there to plight her his troth in whatever formal and most irretrievable manner mrs davis might choose to devise and as he thought of these things he had ringing in his ears the last sounds of that angel voice you will be steady charley wont you i know you will dear charleywont you now  steady would not the best thing for him be to step down to waterloo bridge and throw himself over he still had money enough left to pay the tollthough not enough to hire a pistol and so he went home and got into bed  on that same day the day that was to witness charleys betrothal to miss geraghty and that of m jaquêtanàpe with miss golightly alaric tudor had an appointment with sir gregory hardlines at the new office of the civil service examination board alaric had been invited to wait upon the great man in terms which made him perfectly understand that the communication to be made was one which would not be unpleasing or uncomplimentary to himself indeed he pretty well guessed what was to be said to him since his promotion at the weights and measures he had gone on rising in estimation as a man of value to the civil service at large nearly two years had now passed since that date and in these pages nothing has been said of his official career during the time it had however been everything that he or his friends could have wished it to be he had so put himself forward as absolutely to have satisfied the actual chief clerk of his office and was even felt by some of the secretaries to be treading very closely on their heels  and yet a great portion of his time had been spent not at the weights and measures but in giving some sort of special assistance to sir gregorys board the authorities at the weights and measures did not miss him they would have been well content that he should have remained for ever with sir gregory  he had also become somewhat known to the official world even beyond the confines of the weights and measures or the examination board he had changed his club and now belonged to the downing he had there been introduced by his friend undy to many men whom to know should be the very breath in the nostrils of a rising official aspirant mr whip vigil of the treasury had more than once taken him by the hand and even the chancellor of the exchequer usually nodded to him whenever that oertasked functionary found a moment to look in at the official club  things had not been going quite smoothly at the examination board tidings had got about that mr jobbles was interfering with sir gregory and that sir gregory didnt like it to be sure when this had been indiscreetly alluded to in the house by one of those gentlemen who pass their leisure hours in looking out for raws in the hide of the government carcass some other gentleman some gentleman from the treasury bench had been able to give a very satisfactory reply for why indeed should any gentleman sit on the treasury bench if he be not able when so questioned to give very satisfactory replies giving satisfactory replies to illnatured questions is one may say the constitutional work of such gentlemen who have generally well learned how to do so and earned their present places by asking the selfsame questions themselves when seated as younger men in other parts of the house  but though the answer given in this instance was so eminently satisfactory as to draw down quite a chorus of triumphant acclamations from the official supporters of government nevertheless things had not gone on at the board quite as smoothly as might have been desirable mr jobbles was enthusiastically intent on examining the whole adult male population of great britain and had gone so far as to hint that female competitors might at some future time be made subject to his allmeasuring rule and compass sir gregory however who having passed his early days in an office may perhaps be supposed to have had some slight prejudice remaining in favour of ancient customs was not inclined to travel so quickly moreover he preferred following his own lead to taking any other lead whatever that mr jobbles might point out as preferable  mr jobbles wanted to crush all patronage at a blow any system of patronage would lamentably limit the number of candidates among whom his examination papers would be distributed he longed to behold crowding around him an attendance as copious as mr spurgeons and to see every head bowed over the posing questions which he should have dictated no legion could be too many for him he longed to be at this great work but his energies were crushed by the opposition of his colleagues sir gregory thought and sir warwick though he hardly gave a firm support to sir gregory would not lend his countenance to mr jobblessir gregory thought that enough would be done for the present if they merely provided that every one admitted into the service should be educated in such a manner as to be fit for any profession or calling under the sun and that with this slight proviso the question of patronage might for the present remain untouched do you he would have said to the great officers of government appoint whom you like in this respect remain quite unfettered i however i am the st peter to whom are confided the keys of the elysium do you send whatever candidates you please it is for me merely to say whether or not they shall enter but mr jobbles would have gone much farther he would have had all mankind for candidates and have selected from the whole mass those most worthy of the high reward and so there was a split at the examination board which was not to be healed even by the very satisfactory reply given by the treasury gentleman in the house of commons  neither sir gregory nor his rival were men likely to give way and it soon appeared manifest to the powers that be that something must be done it therefore came to light that mr jobbles had found that his clerical position was hardly compatible with a seat at a lay board and he retired to the more congenial duties of a comfortable prebendal stall at westminster so that by his close vicinity as was observed by a newspaper that usually supported the government he might be able to be of material use whenever his advice should be required by the board of commissioners sir gregory in the meantime was instructed to suggest the name of another colleague and therefore he sent for alaric tudor  alaric of course knew well what had been going on at the board he had been sir gregorys confidential man all through had worked out cases for him furnished him with arguments backed his views and had assisted him whenever such a course had been necessary in holding mr jobbles head under the pump alaric knew well on which side his bread was buttered and could see with a glance which star was in the ascendant he perfectly understood the points and merits of the winning horse he went in to win upon sir gregory and he won when mr jobbles made his last little speech at the board and retired to his house in the deans yard alaric felt tolerably certain that he himself would be invited to fill the vacant place  and he was so invited that is £1200 a year at any rate said he to himself as with many words of submissive gratitude he thanked his patron for the nomination that is £1200 a year so far so good and now what must be the next step excelsior it is very nice to be a commissioner and sit at a board at sir gregorys right hand much nicer than being a junior clerk at the weights and measures like harry norman but there are nicer things even than that there are greater men even than sir gregory richer figures than even £1200 a year  so he went to his old office wrote his resignation and walked home meditating to what next step above he should now aspire to rise excelsior he still said to himself excelsior  at the same moment charley was leaving the internal navigation and as he moved with unusual slowness down the steps he bethought himself how he might escape from the fangs of his norah how if such might still be possible he might fit himself for the love of katie woodward excelsior such also was the thought of his mind but he did not dare to bring the word to utterance it was destined that his thoughts should be interrupted by no very friendly hand    chapter xxviii  outerman v tudor   charley sat at his office on the saturday afternoon very meditative and unlike himself what was he to do when his office hours were over in the first place he had not a shilling in the world to get his dinner his habit was to breakfast at home at his lodgings with harry and then to dine as best he might at some tavern if he had not the good fortune to be dining out he had a little dinner bill at a house which he frequented in the strand but the bill he knew had reached its culminating point it would he was aware be necessary that it should be decreased not augmented at the next commercial transaction which might take place between him and the tavernkeeper  this was not the first time by many in which he had been in a similar plightbut his resource in such case had been to tell the truth gallantly to his friend mrs davis and some sort of viands not at all unprepossessing to him in his hunger would always be forthcoming for him at the cat and whistle this supply was now closed to him were he under his present circumstances to seek for his dinner from the fair hands of norah geraghty it would be tantamount to giving himself up as lost for ever  this want of a dinner however was a small misfortune in comparison with others which afflicted him should or should he not keep his promise to mrs davis and go to the cat and whistle that evening that was the question which disturbed his equanimity and hindered him from teasing mr snape in his usual vivacious manner  and here let it not be said that charley must be altogether despicable in being so weak that he is not only a vulgar rake in his present habits but a fool also and altogether spiritless and of a low disposition persons who may so argue of him who so argue of those whom they meet in the real living world are ignorant of the twists and turns and rapid changes in character which are brought about by outward circumstances many a youth abandoned by his friends to perdition on account of his folly might have yet prospered had his character not been set down as gone before in truth it was well formed it is not one calf only that should be killed for the returning prodigal oh fathers mothers uncles aunts guardians and elderly friends in general kill seven fatted calves if seven should unfortunately be necessary  and then there was a third calamity charley had at this moment in his pocket a certain document which in civil but still somewhat peremptory language invited him to meet a very celebrated learned pundit being no less than one of her majestys puisne judges at some court in westminster to explain why he declined to pay to one nathaniel outerman a tailor the sum of c c c and the document then went on to say that any hesitation on charleys part to accept this invitation would be regarded as great contempt shown to the said learned pundit and would be treated accordingly now charley had not paid the slightest attention to this requisition from the judge it would he conceived have been merely putting his head into the lions mouth to do so but yet he knew that such documents meant something that the day of grace was gone by and that mr nathaniel outerman would very speedily have him locked up  so charley sat meditative over his lock entries and allowed even his proposed vengeance on mr snape to be delayed  i say charley said scatterall coming over and whispering to him you couldnt lend me half a crown could you  charley said nothing but looked on his brother navvy in a manner that made any other kind of reply quite unnecessary  i was afraid it was so said scatterall in a melancholy voice and then as if by the brilliance of his thought he had suddenly recovered his spirits he made a little proposition  ill tell you what you might do charley i put my watch up the spout last week its a silver turnip so i only got fifteen shillings yours is a cox and savary and its gold im sure youd get £3 for it easilyperhaps £3 3s now if youll do that and take my turnip down ill let you have the turnip to wear if youll let me have ten shillings of the money you see youd get clearlet me see how much and scatterall went to work with a sheet of foolscap paper endeavouring to make some estimate of what amount of ready cash charley might have in his pocket on completion of this delicate little arrangement  you be d said charley  youll not do it then said dick  charley merely repeated with a little more emphasis the speech which he had just before made  oh very well said scatterall there couldnt have been a fairer bargain at least it was all on your side for you would have had the watch to wear and nearly all the money too  charley still repeated the same little speech this was uncivil for it had evidently been looked on by scatterall as unsatisfactory  oh very well said that gentleman now in a state of mild anger only i saw that you had a fine new purse and i thought youd wish to have something to put in it  charley again repeated his offensive mandate but he did it in a spirit of bravado in order to maintain his reputation the allusion to the purse made him sadder than ever he put his hand into his breastpocket and felt that it was near his heart and then he fancied that he again heard her wordsyou will be steady wont you dear charley  at four oclock he was by no means in his usual hurry to go away and he sat there drawing patterns on his blottingpaper and chopping up a stick of sealingwax with his penknife in a very disconsolate way scatterall went corkscrew went mr snape having carefully brushed his hat and taken down from its accustomed peg the old cotton umbrella also took his departure and the fourth navvy who inhabited the same room went also the ironfingered hand of time struck a quarter past four on the somerset house clock and still charley tudor lingered at his office the maid who came to sweep the room was thoroughly amazed and knew that something must be wrong  just as he was about to move mr oldeschole came bustling into the room where is corkscrew said he gone said charley and scatterall asked oldeschole gone sir said charley and mr snape said the secretary oh he is gone of course said charley taking his revenge at last  then mr tudor i must trouble you to copy these papers for me at once they are wanted immediately for sir gregory hardlines it was quite clear that mr oldeschole was very much in earnest about the job and that he was rejoiced to find that he still had one clerk to aid him  charley sat down and did the required work on any other day he would greatly have disliked such a summons but now he did not care much about it he made the copies however as quickly as he could and then took them in to mr oldeschole  the worthy secretary rewarded him by a lecture a lecture however which as charley well understood was intended all in kindness he told him how mr snape complained of him how the office books told against him how the clerks talked and all somerset house made stories of his grotesque iniquities with penitential air charley listened and promised mr oldeschole promised also that bygones should be bygones i wonder whether the old cock would lend me a fivepound note i dare say he would said charley to himself as he left the office he abstained however from asking for it  returning to his room he took his hat and went downstairs as he was sauntering forth through the archway into the strand a man with a decent coat but a very bad hat came up to him  im afraid i must trouble you to go with me mr tudor said the man  all right said charley outerman i suppose isnt it  all right said the bailiff  and away the two walked together to a sponginghouse in cursitor street  charley had been arrested at the suit of mr outerman the tailor he perfectly understood the fact and made no special objection to following the bailiff one case was at any rate off his mind he could not now be his will to do so ever so good keep his appointment with norah geraghty perhaps it was quite as well for him to be arrested just at this moment as be left at liberty it must have come sooner or later so he walked on with the bailiff not without some feeling of consolation  the man had suggested to him a cab but charley had told him without the slightest mauvaise honte that he had not about him the means of paying for a cab the man again suggested that perhaps he had better go home and get some money as he would find it in cursitor street very desirable to have some to this charley replied that neither had he any money at home  thats blue said the man  it is rather blue said charley and on they went very amicably arminarm  we need not give any detailed description of charleys prisonhouse he was luckily not detained there so long as to make it necessary that we should become acquainted with his fellowcaptives or even have much intercourse with his jailers he was taken to the sponginghouse and it was there imparted to him that he had better send for two thingsfirst of all for money which was by far the more desirable of the two and secondly for bail which even if forthcoming was represented as being at best but a dubious advantage  theres mrs davis shed bail you of course and willing said the bailiff  mrs davis said charley surprised that the man should know aught of his personal acquaintances  yes mrs davis of the cat and whistle shed do it in course along of miss geraghty  charley perceived with a shudder that his matrimonial arrangements were known and talked of even in the distant world of cursitor street he declined however the assistance of the landlady which no doubt would have been willingly forthcoming and was divided between his three friends alaric harry and mr mruen alaric was his cousin and his natural resource in such a position but he had lately rejected alarics advice and now felt a disinclination to call upon him in his difficulty harry he knew would assist him would at once pay mr outermans bill and relieve him from all immediate danger but the sense of what he already owed to norman made him unwilling to incur further obligationsso he decided on sending for mr mruen in spite of his being so poorly supplied with immediate cash it was surmised from his appearance clothes and known rank that any little outlay made in his behalf would be probably repaid and he was therefore furnished with a messenger on credit this man was first to call at mr mruens with a note and then to go to charleys lodgings and get his brushes razors c these being the first necessaries of life for which a man naturally looks when once overtaken by such a misfortune as that with which charley was now afflicted  in the process of time the brushes and razors came and so did mr mruen  this is very kind of you said charley in rather a doleful voice for he was already becoming tired of cursitor street  mr mruen twisted his head round inside his cravat and put out three fingers by way of shaking hands with the prisoner  you seem pretty comfortable here said mruen charley dissented to this and said that he was extremely uncomfortable  and what is it that i can do for you mr tudor said mruen  do for me why bail me to be sure they wont let me out unless somebody bails me you know i shant run away  bail you said mruen  yes bail me said charley you dont mean to say that you have any objection  mr mruen looked very sharply at his young client from head to foot i dont know about bail he said its very dangerous very why didnt you send for mr norman or your cousin  because i didnt choose said charleybecause i preferred sending to some one i could pay for the trouble  hahaha laughed mruen but thats just itcan you pay you owe me a great deal of money mr tudor you are so unpunctual you know  there are two ways of telling that story said charley but come i dont want to quarrel with you about that nowyou go bail for me now and youll find your advantage in it you know that well enough  hahaha laughed the goodhumoured usurer hahahawell upon my word i dont know you owe me a great deal of money mr tudor now what oclock is it by you i wonder  charley took out his watchthe cox and savary before alluded toand said that it was past seven  aye youve a very nice watch i see come mr tudor you owe me a great deal of money and you are the most unpunctual young man i know but yet i dont like to see you distressed ill tell you what nowdo you hand over your watch to me just as a temporary loanyou cant want it here you know and ill come down and bail you out tomorrow  charley declined dealing on these terms and then mr mruen at last went away leaving charley to his fate and lamenting quite pathetically that he was such an unpunctual young man so very unpunctual that it was impossible to do anything to assist him charley however manfully resisted the second attack upon his devoted watch  thats very blue very blue indeed said the master of the house as mr mruen took his departurehant you got no huncles nor hants nor nothin of that sort  charley declared that he had lots of uncles and aunts grandfathers and grandmothers and a perfect wealth of cousins and that he would send for some of the leading members of his family tomorrow satisfied with this the man supplied him with bread and cheese gin and water and plenty of tobacco and fortified with these comforts charley betook himself at last very lugubriously to a filthy uninviting bed  he had we have seen sent for his brushes and hence came escape but in a manner that he had little recked of and of which had he been asked he would as little have approved mrs richards his landlady was not slow in learning from the messenger how it came to pass that charley wanted the articles of his toilet so suddenly demanded why you see hes just been quodded said the boy  mrs richards was quite enough up to the world and had dealt with young men long enough to know what this meant nor indeed was she much surprised she had practical knowledge that charley had no strong propensity to pay his debts and she herself was not unaccustomed to answer the emissaries of mr outerman and other greedy tradesmen who were similarly situated to mrs richards herself charley was not in debt and she had therefore nothing to embitter her own feelings against him indeed she had all that fondness for him which a lodginghouse keeper generally has for a handsome dissipated easytempered young man and when she heard that he had been quodded immediately made up her mind that steps must be taken for his release  but what was she to do norman who she was aware would unquod him immediately if he were in the way was down at hampton and was not expected to be at his lodgings for two or three days after some cogitation mrs richards resolved that there was nothing for it but to go down to hampton herself and break the news to his friends charley would not have been a bit obliged to her had he known it but mrs richards acted for the best there was a train down to hampton court that night and a return train to bring her home againso off she started  mrs woodward had on that same afternoon taken down katie who was still an invalidnorman had gone down with them and was to remain there for some few daysgoing up and down every morning and evening mrs woodward was sitting in the drawingroom linda and katie were with her the latter lying in state on her sofa as invalid young ladies should do captain cuttwater was at hampton court and norman was on the water when a fly from the railway made its way up to the door of the cottage  mrs richards maam said the demure parlourmaid ushering in the lodginghouse keeper who in her churchgoing best made a very decent appearance  oh mrs richards how are you said mrs woodward who knew the woman very wellpray sit downare there any news from london  oh maam such newssuch bad newsmister charley up jumped katie from her sofa and stood erect upon the floor she stood there with her mouth slightly open with her eyes intently fixed on mrs richards with her little hands each firmly clenched drawing her breath with hard short palpitating efforts there she stood but said nothing  oh mrs richardswhat is it said mrs woodward for heavens sake what is the matter  oh maam hes been took said mrs richards  took repeated mrs woodward katie dear katiesit down my childsit down  oh mamma oh mamma said she apparently unable to move and certainly all but unable to stand  tell us mrs richards what is itwhat has happened to mr tudor and as she spoke mrs woodward got up and passed her arm around her younger daughters waistlinda also got up and joined the group  why maam said mrs richards hes been took by the bailiffs and now hes in prison  katie did not faint she never had fainted and probably did not know the way but she clenched her hands still tighter breathed harder than before and repeated her appeal to her mother in a voice of agony oh mamma oh mamma  katie had no very accurate conception of what an arrest for debt meant she knew that next to death imprisonment was the severest punishment inflicted on erring mortals and she now heard that charley was in prison she did not stop to think whether it was for his life or for some more limited period it was enough for her to know that this terrible misfortune had come upon him to him who to her young fancy was so bright so good so clever so excellent upon him who had saved her lifeupon him whom she so dearly loved  oh mamma oh mamma she said and then in agony she shut her eyes and shuddered violently  mrs woodward was greatly afflicted she was indeed sorry to hear such tidings of charley tudor but her grief was now deeper even than that she could not be longer blind to the sort of feeling which her child evinced for this young man she could not think that these passionate bursts of overpowering sorrow were the result of mere childish friendship she could not but see that her katies bosom now held a womans heart and that that heart was no longer her own  and then mrs woodward reflected of what nature of what sort was this man whom she had allowed to associate with her darling almost as a brother does with his sister whom she had warmed in her bosom till he had found an opportunity of inflicting this deadly wound with terrible bitterness she upbraided herself as she sat down and bade mrs richards go on with her tale she knew that nothing which could now be said would add to katies anguish  mrs richards story was soon told it simply amounted to thisthat mister charley as she always called him had been arrested for debt at the suit of a tailor and that she had learnt the circumstances from the fact of the prisoner having sent for his brushes  and so i thought the best thing was to come and tell mr norman said mrs richards concluding her speech  nothing could be done till norman came in linda went out with mrs richards to get some refreshment in the diningroom and mrs woodward sat with her arm round katies neck on the sofa comforting her with kisses and little caressing touches but saying nothing katie still unconscious of her passion gave way to spasmodic utterance of her own grief  oh mamma she said what can be done what can we do you will do something mamma wont you poor charley dear charley harry will do somethingwont he wont harry go to london and do something  mrs woodward did what she could to quiet her something should be done she said they must wait till harry came in and then settle what was best nothing could be done till harry came in you must be patient katie or else you will make yourself really ill  katie became afraid that she would be sent off to bed on the score of her illness before harry had come and thus lose the advantage of hearing what was the step decided on so she sat silent in the corner of her sofa feigning to be asleep but pondering in her mind what sort of penalties were the penalties of imprisonment how dreadful how endurable or how unendurable would they put chains on him would they starve him would they cut off his beautiful brown hair  mrs woodward sat silent waiting for harrys return when first she had watched katies extreme misery and guessed the secret of her childs heart she had felt something like hard bitter anger against charley but by degrees this feeling softened down it was by no means natural to her nor akin to her usual tenderness after all the fault hitherto was probably more her own than his  mrs richards was sent back to town she was thanked for the trouble she had taken and told that mr norman would do in the matter all that was necessary to be done so she took her departure and linda returned to the drawingroom  unfortunately captain cuttwater came in first they none of them mentioned charleys misfortune to him charley was no favourite with uncle bat and his remarks would not have been of the most cheering tendency  at last norman came also he came as was his wont through the drawingroom window and throwing himself into a chair began to tell the girls how much they had lost by not joining him on the river  harry said mrs woodward step into the diningroom with me for a moment  harry got up to follow her katie and linda also instantly jumped from their seats to do the same mrs woodward looked round and motioned to them to stay with their uncle linda obediently though reluctantly remained but katies impulse was too strong for her she gave one imploring look at her mother a look which mrs woodward well understood and then taking silence for consent crept into the diningroom  harry said mrs woodward as soon as the diningroom door was closed charley has been arrested and then she told him how mrs richards had been at the cottage and what was the nature of the tidings she had brought  norman was not much surprised nor did he feign to be so he took the news so coolly that katie almost hated him did she say who had arrested him or what was the amount he asked  mrs woodward replied that she knew no more than what she had already told katie stood in the shade with her eyes fixed upon her cousin but as yet she said nothing how cruel how stonyhearted must he be to hear such dreadful tidings and remain thus undisturbed had charley heard that norman was arrested he would have been half way to london by this time so at least thought katie  something can be done for him harry can there not we must contrive to do somethingeh harry said mrs woodward  i fear it is too late to do anything tonight said harry looking at his watch the last train is gone and i could not possibly find him out before twelve  and tomorrow is sunday said mrs woodward  oh harry pray do something said katie pray pray pray do oh harry think of charley being in prison oh harry he would do anything for you and then she burst into tears and caught hold of harrys arm and the front of his coat to add force to her entreaty  katie said her mother dont be so foolish harry will of course do whatever is best  but mamma he says he will do nothing why does he not go at once  i will go at once dear katie said he i will go now directly i dont know whether we can set him free tonight or even tomorrow as tomorrow is sunday but it certainly shall be done on monday you may be sure of that at any rate whatever can be done shall be done and without further talk upon the subject he took his hat and went his way  may god almighty bless him said mrs woodward how infinitely greater are truth and honesty than any talent however brilliant she spoke only to herself and no one even guessed what was the nature of the comparison which she thus made  as soon as norman was gone katie went to bed and in the morning she was pronounced to be too unwell to get up and indeed she was far from well during the night she only slept by short starts and in her sleep she was restless and uneasy then when she woke she would burst out into fits of tears and lie sobbing hysterically till she slept again in the morning mrs woodward said something about charleys misconduct and this threw her into a wretched state of misery from which nothing would rouse her till her mother promised that the prodigal should not be thrown over and abandoned  poor mrs woodward was in a dreadful state of doubt as to what it now behoved her to do she felt that however anxious she might be to assist charley for his own sake it was her bounden duty to separate him from her child whatever merits he might haveand in her eyes he had manyat any rate he had not those which a mother would desire to see in the future husband of her daughter he was profligate extravagant careless and idle his prospects in life were in every respect bad he had no selfrespect no selfreliance no moral strength was it not absolutely necessary that she should put a stop to any love that might have sprung up between such a man as this and her own young brighteyed darling  put a stop to it yes indeed most expedient nay absolutely necessaryif it were only possible now when it was too late she began to perceive that she had not known of what material her own child was formed at sixteen gertrude and linda had in reality been little more than children in manner katie had been more childish even than them and yetmrs woodward as she thought of these things felt her heart faint within her  she was resolved that cost what it might charley must be banished from the cottage but at the first word of assumed displeasure that she uttered katie fell into such an agony of grief that her soft heart gave way and she found herself obliged to promise that the sinner should be forgiven katie the while was entirely unconscious of the state of her own feelings had she thought that she loved him as women love had any thought of such love and of him together even entered her mind she could not have talked of him as she now talked had he been her brother she could not have been less guarded in her protestations of affection or more open in her appeals to her mother that he might be forgiven such was her present state but it was doomed that her eyes should soon be opened and that she should know her own sorrow  on the sunday afternoon norman returned to hampton with the tidings that charley was once more a free man the key of gold which he had taken with him had been found potent enough to open all barriers even those with which the sanctity of sunday had surrounded the prisoner mr outerman and the bailiff and the messenger had all been paid their full claims and charley with his combs and brushes had returned to the more benign custody of mrs richards  and why didnt he come down with you said katie to norman who had gone up to her bedroom to give her the good tidings  norman looked at mrs woodward but made no reply  he would probably prefer remaining in town at present said mrs woodward it will be more comfortable for him to do so  and then katie was left alone to meditate why charley should be more comfortable after his arrest in london than at hampton and after a while she thought that she had surmised the truth poor charley perhaps he is ashamed he need not be ashamed to come at any rate to me    chapter xxix  easy is the slope of hell   the electors for the tillietudlem district burghs disgusted by the roguery of mr mbuffer and anxiously on the alert to replace him by a strictly honest man returned our friend undy by a glorious majority he had no less than 312 votes as opposed to 297 and though threatened with the pains and penalties of a petition he was not a little elated by his success a petition with regard to the tillietudlem burghs was almost as much a matter of course as a contest at any rate the threat of a petition was so undy however had lived through this before and did not fear but that he might do so again threatened folks live long parliamentary petitions are very costly and undys adversaries were if possible even in more need of money than himself  he communicated his good fortune to his friend alaric in the following letter  bellenden arms tillietudlem july 185  my dear director  here i am once more a constituent part of the legislative wisdom of the united kingdom thanks to the patriotic discretion of the potwallopers burgagetenants and tenpound freeholders of these loyal towns the situation is a proud one i could only wish that it had been less expensive i am plucked as clean as ever was pigeon and over and above the loss of every feather i carried old mcleury my agent here will have a bill against me that will hardly be settled before the next election i do not complain however a man cannot have luxuries without paying for them and this special luxury of serving ones country in parliament is one for which a man has so often to pay without the subsequent fruition of the thing paid for that a successful candidate should never grumble however much he may have been mulcted they talk of a petition but thank god there are still such things as recognizances and moreover to give mcleury his due i do not think he has left a hole open for them to work at he is a thorough rascal but no man does better work  i find there is already a slight rise in the west corks keep your eye open if you find you can realize £4 4s or even £4 sell and let the west of cork and ballydehob go straight to the devil we should then be able to do better with our money but i doubt of such a sale with so large a stock as we hold i got a letter yesterday from that cork attorney and i find that he is quite prepared to give way about the branch he wants his price of course and he must have it when once we have carried that point then it will be plain sailing our only regret then will be that we didnt go further into it the calls of course must be met i shall be able to do something in october but shall not have a shilling soonerunless i sell which i will not do under 80s  i was delighted to hear of your promotion not that youll remain in the shop long but it gives you a better name and a better claim old golightly was buried yesterday as of course you have heard mrs val quite agrees with me that your name had better be put in as that of clems trustee shes going to marry that d frenchman what an unmitigated ass that cousin of yours must be i cant say i admire her taste but nevertheless she is welcome for me it would however be most scandalous if we were to allow him to get possession of her money he would as a matter of course make ducks and drakes of it in no time speculate probably in some russian railway or polish mine and lose every shilling you will of course see it tied up tight in the hands of the trustees and merely pay him or if possible her the interest of it now that i am once more in i hope we shall be able to do something to protect the fortunes of married women  you will be quite safe in laying out clems money or a portion of it in the west corks indeed i dont know how you could well do better with it you will find figgs a mere shadow i think we can pull through in this manner if not we must getto take our joint bill he would sooner do that than have the works stopped but then we should have to pay a tremendous price for it  so we were well out of the mary janes at last the take last month was next to nothing and now shes full of water manylodes hung on till just the last and yet got out on his feet after all that fellow will make a mint of money yet what a pity that he should be such a rogue if he were honest honest enough i mean to be trusted he might do anything  i shall leave this on wednesday night take the oaths on thursday and will see you in the evening mcarthy desmond will at once move that i be put on the west cork committee in place of nogo who wont act my shares are all at present registered in vals name it will be well however to have them all transferred to you  yours ever  us  mcleury has pledged himself to put me in again without further expense if i have to stand before the next general election in consequence of taking place under government i earnestly hope his sincerity may be tried  during the month of july alaric was busy enough he had to do the work of his new office to attend to his somewhat critical duties as director of the west cork railway to look after the interests of miss golightly whose marriage was to take place in august and to watch the parliamentary career of his friend undy with whose pecuniary affairs he was now bound up in a manner which he could not avoid feeling to be very perilous  july passed by and was now over and members were looking to be relieved from their sultry labours and to be allowed to seek air and exercise on the mountains the ballydehob branch line had received the sanction of parliament through the means which the crafty undy had so well understood how to use but from some cause hitherto not sufficiently fathomed the shares had continued to be depressed in value in spite of that desirable event it was necessary however that calls should be paid up to the amount of £5 a share and as undy and alaric held nearly a thousand shares between them a large amount of money was required this however was made to be forthcoming from miss golightlys fortune  on the first of august that interesting young lady was married to the manshall we say of her heart or of her feet the marriage went off very nicely but as we have already had one wedding and as others may perhaps be before us we cannot spare much time or many pages to describe how miss golightly became madame jaquêtanàpe the lady seemed well pleased with everything that was done and had even in secret but one care in the world there was to be a dance after she and her victoire were gone and she could not join in it  we however are in the position as regards clementina in which needy gentlemen not unfrequently place themselves with reference to rich heiresses we have more concern with her money than herself she was married and m jaquêtanàpe became the happy possessor of an income of £800 a year everybody conceived him to behave well on the occasion he acknowledged that he had very little means of his ownabout 4000 francs a year from rents in paris he expressed himself willing to agree to any settlement thinking perhaps with wisdom that he might in this way best make sure of his wifes income and was quite content when informed that he would receive his quarterly payments from so respectable a source as one of her majestys commissioners for the regulation of the civil service the bank of france could not have offered better security  thus alaric obtained full control of miss golightlys fortune for figgs his cotrustee was as has been said a shadow he obtained the full control of £20000 and out of it he paid the calls due upon the west cork shares held both by himself and undy scott but he put a salve upon his conscience and among his private memoranda appertaining to that ladys money affairs he made an entry intelligible to any who might read it that he had so invested this money on her behalf the entry was in itself a liea foolish palpable lieand yet he found in it something to quiet remorse and stupefy his conscience  undy scott had become tyrannical in his logic as soon as he had persuaded alaric to make use of a portion of madame jaquêtanàpes marriage portion you have taken part of the girls money was undys argument you have already converted to your own purposes so much of her fortune it is absurd for you now to talk of conscience and honesty of your high duties as a trustee of the inviolable distinction between meum and tuum you have already shown that the distinction is not inviolable let us have no more such nonsense there are still left £15000 on which we can trade open the till and let us go on swimmingly with the business  alaric was not addressed absolutely in these words he would not probably have allowed the veil with which he still shrouded his dishonesty to be withdrawn with so rough a hand but that which was said was in effect the same in september he left town for a few weeks and went down to scotland still with undy scott he had at first much liked this mans society for scott was gay lively clever and a good companion at all points but latterly he had become weary of him he now put up with him as men in business have to put up with partners whom they may not like or perhaps to speak the truth openly he bore with him as a rogue bears with his confederate though he absolutely hates his brother rogue on account of his very roguery alaric tudor was now a rogue despite his high office his grand ideas his exalted ambition despite his talent zeal and welldirected official labours he was a rogue a thief a villain who had stolen the money of the orphan who had undertaken a trust merely that he might break it a robber doubly disgraced by being a robber with an education a bill sykes without any of those excuses which a philanthropist cannot but make for wretches brought up in infamy  alas alas how is it that in these days such men become rogues how is it that we see in such frightful instances the impotency of educated men to withstand the allurements of wealth men are not now more keen after the pleasures which wealth can buy than were their forefathers one would rather say that they are less so the rich labour now and work with an assiduity that often puts to shame the sweat in which the poor man earns his bread the rich rogue or the rogue that would be rich is always a laborious man he allows himself but little recreation for dishonest labour admits of no cessation his wheel is one which cannot rest without disclosing the nature of the works which move it it is not for pleasure that men    put rancours in the vessel of their peace  nor yet primarily for ambition men do not wish to rise by treachery or to become great through dishonesty the object the ultimate object which a man sets before himself is generally a good one but he sets it up in so enviable a point of view his imagination makes it so richly desirable by being gazed at it becomes so necessary to existence that its attainment is imperative the object is good but the means of attaining itthe path to the objectah there is the slip expediency is the dangerous wind by which so many of us have wrecked our little boats  and we do so more now than ever because great ships swimming in deepest waters have unluckily come safe to haven though wafted there by the same pernicious wind every great man who gains a great end by dishonest means does more to deteriorate his country and lower the standard of his countrymen than legions of vulgar thieves or nameless unaspiring rogues who has injured us so much in this way as he whose name still stands highest among modern politicians who has given so great a blow to political honesty has done so much to banish from mens minds the idea of a liferuling principle as sir robert peel  it would shock many were we to attribute to him the roguery of the sadleirs and camerons of the robsons and redpaths of the present day but could we analyse causes and effects we might perhaps do so with no injustice he has taught us as a great lesson that a man who has before him a mighty object may dispense with those oldfashioned rules of truth to his neighbours and honesty to his own principles which should guide us in ordinary life at what point ordinary life ends at what crisis objects may be considered great enough to justify the use of a dispensing power that he has not taught us that no sir robert peel can teach us that must unfortunately be left to the judgement of the individual how prone we are each of us to look on our own object as great how ready to make excuses for receiving such a lesson for our guide how willing to think that we may be allowed to use this dispensing power ourselvesthis experience teaches us in very plain language  thrice in his political life did sir robert peel change his political creed and carry or assist to carry with more or less of selfgratulation the measures of his adversaries thrice by doing so he kept to himself that political power which he had fairly forfeited by previous opposition to the requirements of his country such an apposition of circumstances is at any rate suspicious but let us give him credit for the expression of a true belief of a belief at first that the cornlaws should be maintained and then of a belief that they should not let us with a forced confidence in his personal honesty declare so much of him nevertheless he should surely have felt had he been politically as well as personally honest that he was not the man to repeal them  but it was necessary his apologist will say that the cornlaws should be repealed he saw the necessity and yielded to it it certainly was necessary very necessary very unavoidable absolutely necessary one may say a fact which the united efforts of all the peels of the day could in nowise longer delay having already delayed it to the utmost extent of their power it was essential that the cornlaws should be repealed but by no means essential that this should be done by sir robert peel  it was a matter of indifference to us englishmen who did the deed but to sir robert peel it was a matter of great moment that he should do it he did it and posterity will point at him as a politician without policy as a statesman without a principle as a worshipper at the altar of expediency to whom neither vows sworn to friends nor declarations made to his country were in any way binding had sir robert peel lived and did the people now resolutely desire that the church of england should be abandoned that lords and commons should bow the neck that the crown should fall who can believe that sir robert peel would not be ready to carry out their views readers it may be that to you such deeds as those are horrible even to be thought of or expressed to me i own that they are so so also to sir robert peel was catholic emancipation horrible so was reform of parliament so was the corn law repeal they were horrible to him horrible to be thought of horrible to be expressed but the people required these measures and therefore he carried them arguing on their behalf with all the astuteness of a practised statesman  that sir robert peel should be a worshipper of expediency might be matter of small moment to any but his biographer were it not that we are so prone to copy the example of those whose names are ever in our mouths it has now become the doctrine of a large class of politicians that political honesty is unnecessary slow subversive of a mans interests and incompatible with quick onward movement such a doctrine in politics is to be deplored but alas who can confine it to politics it creeps with gradual but still with sure and quick motion into all the doings of our daily life how shall the man who has taught himself that he may be false in the house of commons how shall he be true in the treasury chambers or if false there how true on the exchange and if false there how shall he longer have any truth within him  and thus alaric tudor had become a rogue and was obliged as it were in his own defence to consort with a rogue he went down to scotland with undy leaving his wife and child at home not because he could thus best amuse his few leisure days but because this new work of his this laborious trade of roguery allowed him no leisure days when can villany have either days or hours of leisure  among other things to be done in the north alaric was to make acquaintance with the constituents of the little borough of strathbogy which it was his ambition to represent in the next parliament strathbogy was on the confines of the gaberlunzie property and indeed the lords eldest son who was the present member lived almost within the municipal boundary castocks cottage as his residence was called was but a humble house for a peers eldest son but mr scott was not ashamed to live there and there for a while he entertained his brother undy and alaric tudor mr scott intended when the present session was over to retire from the labours of parliamentary life it may be that he thought that he had done enough for his country it may be that the men of strathbogy thought that he had not done enough for them it may be that there was some family understanding between him and his brother this however was clear that he did not intend to stand again himself and that he professed himself ready to put forward alaric tudor as a worthy successor and to give him the full benefit and weight of the gaberlunzie interest  but not for nothing was alaric to receive such important assistance  there are but 312 electors altogether said undy one morning as they went out shooting and out of these we can command a hundred and twenty it must be odd if you cannot get enough outsiders to turn them into a majority indeed you may look on it as a certain seat no man in england or scotland could give you one more certain  this was not the first occasion on which undy had spoken of all that he was doing for his friend and alaric therefore somewhat disgusted with the subject made no reply  i never had things made so easy for me when i wasnt in continued undy nor have i ever found them so easy since i dont suppose it will cost you above £500 or at most £600 altogether  well that will be a comfort said alaric  a comfort why i should say it would what with the election and petition together tillietudlem never cost me less than £2000 it cost me just as much too when i was thrown out  that was a bore for you said alaric  upon my word you take it rather coolly said undy another man would thank a fellow for putting such a nice thing in his way  if the obligation be so deep said alaric becoming very red in the face i would rather not accept it it is not too late for you to take the cheaper seat to yourself if you prefer it and i will look elsewhere  oh of course perhaps at tillietudlem but for heavens sake my dear fellow dont let us quarrel about it you are perfectly welcome to whatever assistance we can give you at strathbogy i only meant to say that i hope it will be efficacious and on the score of expense ill tell you what well dothat is if you think that fair well put the cost of the two elections together and share and share alike  considering that the election will not take place for at least more than twelve months there will be time enough to settle that said alaric  well thats true too said undy and then they went on and for some time separated on the mountain complaining when they met again of the game being scarce and the dogs wild as men always do but as they walked home undy who regretted the loss of good time again began about money matters  how many of those bridge shares will you take said he this was a projected bridge from poplar to rotherhithe which had been got up by some city gentlemen and as to which undy scott was or pretended to be very sanguine  none said alaric unless i can get rid of those confounded west cork and ballydehobs i can buy nothing more of anything  believe me my dear fellow the ballydehobs are no such confounded things at all if you are ever a rich man it will be through the ballydehobs but what you say about the bridge shares is nonsense you have a large command of capital and you cannot apply it better  alaric winced and wished in his heart that clementina jaquêtanàpe née golightly with all her money was buried deep in the bogs of ballydehob though he was a rogue he could not yet bear his roguery with comfort to himself it sat however as easy on undy as though he had been to the manner born  i have no capital now at my disposal said he and i doubt whether i should be doing right to lay out a wards money in such a manner  a slight smile came over undys gay unconcerned features it was very slight but nevertheless it was very eloquent and very offensive also alaric understood it well it made him hate the owner of it but it made him hate himself still more  it is as well to be hung for a sheep as for a lamb said undys smile and moreover continued the smile is it not ridiculous enough for you alaric tudor rogue as you are to profess to me undy scott rogue as i am any solicitude as to your wards welfare seeing that you have already taken to yourself for your own dishonest purposes a considerable slice of the fortune that has been trusted to your keeping you have done this and yet you talk to me of not having capital at your disposal you have capital and you will dispose of that capital for your own purposes as long as a shilling remains uninvested of your wards money we are both rogues god knows it and you and i know it but i am not such a hypocritical rogue as to make mock boasts of my honesty to my brother rogue  this was certainly a long speech to have been made by a smile which crossed mr scotts face but for a moment but every word of it was there expressed and every word of it was there read alaric did not at all like being addressed so uncivilly it seemed to tend but little to that excelsior for which his soul panted but what could he do how could he help himself was it not all true could he contradict the smile alas it was true it was useless for him now to attempt even to combat such smiles excelsior indeed his future course might now probably be called by some very different designation easy very easy is the slope of hell  before they had returned to castocks cottage undy had succeeded in persuading his friend that the game must be played onon and on and out if a man intends to make a fortune in the sharemarket he will never do it by being bold one day and timid the next no turf bettingbook can be made up safely except on consistent principles halfmeasures are always ruinous in matters of speculation one attempt is made safe by another no man it is true can calculate accurately what may be the upshot of a single venture but a sharp fellow may calculate with a fair average of exactness what will be the aggregate upshot of many ventures all mercantile fortunes have been made by the knowledge and understanding of this rule if a man speculates but once and again now and then as it were he must of course be a loser he will be playing a game which he does not understand and playing it against men who do understand it men who so play always lose but he who speculates daily puts himself exactly in the reversed position he plays a game which experience teaches him to play well and he plays generally against men who have no such advantage of course he wins  all these valuable lessons did undy scott teach to alaric tudor and the result was that alaric agreed to orderfor self and partnera considerable number of shares in the limehouse bridge company easy very easy is the slope of hell  and then in the evening on this evening and other evenings on all evenings they talked over the prospects of the west cork and ballydehob branch and of the limehouse bridge which according to undys theory is destined to work quite a revolution in the eastend circles of the metropolis undy had noble ideas about this bridge the shares at the present moment were greatly at a discountso much the better for they could be bought at a cheaper rate and they were sure to rise to some very respectable figure as soon as undy should have played out with reference to them the parliamentary game which he had in view  and so from morning to morning and from night to night they talked over their unholy trade till the price of shares and the sounds of sums of money entered into alarics soul and this perhaps is one of the greatest penalties to which men who embark in such trade are doomed that they can never shake off the remembrance of their calculations they can never drop the shop they have no leisure no ease they can never throw themselves with loose limbs and vacant mind at large upon the worlds green sward and call children to come and play with them at the weights and measures alarics hours of business had been from ten to five in undys office they continued from one noon till the next incessantly even in his dreams he was working in the share market  on his return to town alaric found a letter from captain cuttwater pressing very urgently for the repayment of his money it had been lent on the express understanding that it was to be repaid when parliament broke up it was now the end of october and uncle bat was becoming uneasy  alaric when he received the letter crushed it in his hand and cursed the strictness of the man who had done so much for him on the next day another slice was taken from the fortune of madame jaquêtanàpe and his money with the interest was remitted to captain cuttwater    chapter xxx  mrs woodwards request   we will now go back for a while to hampton the author for one does so with pleasure though those who dwell there be not angels yet it is better to live with the woodwards and harry norman with uncle bat or even with the unfortunate charley than with such as alaric and undy scott the man who is ever looking after money is fitting company only for the devils of whom indeed he is already one  but charley cannot any longer be called one of the cottage circle it was now the end of october and since the day of his arrest he had not yet been there he had not been asked nor would he go uninvited as after what had passed at hampton court bridge he surely might have done  and consequently they were all unhappy no one was more so than charley when the prospect of the happy evening with norah had been so violently interrupted by his arrest he had among his other messages sent word to the cat and whistle excusing his absence by a statement of the true cause from that day to this of which we are now speaking he had seen neither mrs davis nor her fair protégée  nor were they better contented at the cottage mrs woodward was harassed by different feelings and different fears which together made her very unhappy her katie was still ill not ill indeed so that she was forced to keep her bed and receive daily visits from pernicious doctors but nevertheless so ill as to make a mother very anxious  she had never been quite strong quite herself from the night of mrs vals dance the doctor who had attended her declared that her ducking in the river had given her cold and that this not having been duly checked still hung about her then she had been taken to a physician in london who poked her on the back and tapped her on the breast listened to her lungs through a wooden pipesuch was the account which katie gave herself when she returned homeand prescribed rum and milk and codliver oil declaring with an authoritative nod that there was no organic diseaseas yet  and what shall we do with her doctor asked mrs woodward  go on with the rum and milk and codliver oil you cant do better  and the cough doctor  why if that doesnt go before the cold weather begins you may as well take her to torquay for the winter  oh consumption thou scourge of englands beauty how many mothers gasping with illsuppressed fears have listened to such words as thesehave listened and then hoped listened again and hoped again with fainter hopes have listened again and then hoped no more  but there was much on mrs woodwards mind which she could not bring herself to tell to any doctor but which still left in her breast an impression that she was perhaps keeping back the true cause of katies illness charley had not been at hampton since his arrest and it was manifest to all that katie was therefore wretched  but why do you not ask him mamma she had urged when her mother suggested that he stayed away because he did not like to show himself after what had occurred what will he think of us he that saved my life mamma oh mamma you promised to forgive him do ask him you know he will come if you ask him  mrs woodward could not explain to hercould not explain to any onewhy she did not invite him norman guessed it all and mrs woodward saw that he had done so but still she could not talk to him of katies feelings could not tell him that she feared her child was heartladen with so sad a love so mrs woodward had no confidant in her sorrow no counsel which she could seek to aid her own wavering judgement it was prudent she thought that katie and charley should be kept apart prudent was it not even imperative on her to save her child from such a fate but then when she saw the rosy cheek grow pale by degrees as she watched the plump little arms grow gradually thin and wan as those high spirits fell and that voice which had ever been so frequent in the house and so clearwhen the sound of it became low and rare then her heart would misgive her and she would all but resolve to take the only step which she knew would bring a bright gleam on her childs face and give a happy tone to her darlings voice  during the earlier portion of these days katie had with eager constancy reiterated her request that charley should be asked to hampton but of a sudden her prayers ceased she spoke no more of charley asked no longer after his coming ceased even to inquire frequently of his welfare but yet when his name was mentioned she would open wide her bright eyes would listen with all her ears and show only too plainly to one who watched her as a mother only can watch what were the thoughts which filled her heart  linda she had said one night as they sat in their room preparing themselves for bed linda why does not mamma invite charley to come down to hampton  oh i dont know said linda who however if she did not know was not far wrong in the guess she made i suppose she thinks hed be ashamed to show himself after having been in prison  ashamed why should he be ashamed after so long didnt you hear harry say that the same thing often happens to young men is he never to come here again dear linda i know you know do tell me  well im sure i do not know if thats not the reason  oh linda dear linda yes you do said katie throwing herself on her knees resting her arms on her sisters lap and looking up wistfully into her sisters face her long hair was streaming down her back her white naked feet peeped out from beneath her bedroom dress and large tears glistened in her eyes who could have resisted the prayers of such a suppliant certainly not linda the softhearted linda  do tell me continued katie do tell mei am sure you know and linda if it is wrong to ask mamma about it ill never never ask her again i know mamma is unhappy about it if my asking is wrong ill not make her unhappy any more in that way  linda for a while did not know what to answer her hesitating manner immediately revealed to katie that there was a secret and that her sister could tell it if she would  oh linda do tell me do tell me dear linda you ought to tell me for mammas sake  at last with much hesitation linda told her the whole tale  perhaps mamma thinks that you are too fond of charley  an instant light flashed across katies heartacross her heart and brain and senses not another word was necessary to explain to her the whole mystery to tell the whole tale to reveal to her the secret of her own love of her mothers fears and of his assumed unwillingness she got up slowly from her knees kissed her sisters cheek and neck smiled at her so sweetly so sadly and then sitting on her old seat began playing with her long hair and gazing at vacancy  it is only what i guess you know katieyou would make me tell you but i am sure there is nothing in it  dear linda said she you are so good i am so much obliged to you  after that katie spoke no further of charley but it was evident to them all that though she said nothing she had not ceased to think of him nor did her cheek again become rosy nor her arms round nor her voice happy she got weaker than ever and poor mrs woodward was overcome with sorrow  nor was this the only cause of grief at surbiton cottage during the last few weeks a bitter estrangement had taken place between the woodwards and the tudors alaric tudor that is and gertrude two years had now passed since norman had chosen to quarrel with alaric and during all that period the two had never spoken amicably together though they had met on business very frequently on all such occasions alaric had been unperturbed and indifferent whereas norman had been gloomy and had carried a hostile brow and angry eye at their period of life two years generally does much to quiet feelings of illwill and pacify animosity but normans feelings had by no means been quieted nor his animosity pacified he had loved alaric with a close and manly love now he hated him with a close and i fear i may say a manly hatred alaric had as he thought answered his love by treachery and there was that in normans heart which would not allow him to forgive one who had been a traitor to him he had that kind of selfishness so common to us but of which we are so unconscious which will not allow us to pardon a sin against our own amour propre alaric might have been forgiven though he had taken his friends money distanced him in his office though he had committed against him all offences which one friend can commit against another all but this norman had been proud of his love and yet ashamed of itproud of loving such a girl as gertrude and ashamed of being known to be in love at all he had confided his love to alaric and alaric had robbed him of his love and wounded both his pride and his shame  norman lacked the charity which should have been capable of forgiving even this he now looked at all alarics doings through a different glass from that which he had used when alaric had been dear to him he saw or thought that he saw that his successful rival was false ambitious treacherous and dishonest he made no excuses for him gave him no credit for his industry accorded no admiration to his talent he never spoke ill of alaric tudor to others but he fed his own heart with speaking and thinking ill of him to himself  of gertrude he thought very differently he had taught himself to disconnect her from the treachery of her husbandor rather her memory for from the day on which he had learnt that she was engaged to alaric he had never seen her he still loved the remembrance of her in his solitary walks with mrs woodward he would still speak of her as he might of one in some distant clime for whose welfare he was deeply interested he had seen and caressed her baby at hampton she was still dear to him had alaric been called to his long account it would have been his dearest wish to have become at some future tune the husband of his widow  to all these feelings on normans part alaric was very indifferent but their existence operated as a drawback on his wifes comfort and to a certain degree on his own mrs woodward would not banish norman from the cottage even for her daughters sake and it came by degrees to be understood that the tudors man and wife should not go there unless they were aware that norman was absent norman on the other hand did absent himself when it was understood that alaric and gertrude were coming and thus the woodwards kept up their intercourse with both  but this was a bore alaric thought it most probable that norman would marry one of the younger sisters and he knew that family quarrels are uncomfortable and injudicious when therefore he became a civil service commissioner and was thus removed from business intercourse with norman he conceived that it would be wise to arrange a reconciliation he discussed the matter with gertrude and she fully agreeing with him undertook the task of making the proposal through her mother this she did with all the kindness and delicacy of a woman she desired her mother to tell harry how much she had valued his friendship how greatly she regretted the loss of it how anxious her husband was to renew if possible their former terms of affection mrs woodward by no means sanguine undertook the commission she undertook it and utterly failed and when gertrude in her disappointment spoke bitterly of normans bitterness both mother and sister both mrs woodward and linda took normans part  i wish it could be otherwise said mrs woodward i wish it for all our sakes but he is a man not easily to be turned and i cannot blame him he has suffered very much  gertrude became very red her mothers words contained a reproach against herself tacit and unintended indeed but not the less keenly felt  i am not aware that mr norman has any cause of just complaint she said against any one unless it be himself for the sake of charity and old associations we have wished that all ideas of injury should be forgiven and forgotten if he chooses still to indulge his rancour he must do so i had taken him to be a better christian  more words had sprung from these mrs woodward who in truth loved norman the better for the continuance of his sorrow would not give up his part and so the mother and child parted and the two sisters parted not quarrelling indeed not absolutely with angry words but in a tone of mind towards each other widely differing from that of former years mrs woodward had lost none of the love of the parent but gertrude had forgotten somewhat of the reverence of the child  all this had added much to the grief created by katies illness  and then of a sudden katie became silent as well as sad and ill silent and sad but so soft so loving in her manner her gentle little caresses the tender love ever lying in her eye the constant pressure of her thin small hand would all but break her mothers heart katie would sit beside her on the sofa in the drawingroom for hours a book taken up as an excuse would be in her lap and she would sit there gazing listlessly into the vacant daylight till the evening would come and then when the room was shaded and sombre when the light of the fire merely served to make the objects indistinct she would lean gently and by degrees upon her mothers bosom would coax her mothers arm round her neck and would thus creep as it were into her mothers heart of hearts and then slow tears would trickle down her cheeks very slow one by one till they would fall as telltales on her mothers hand  katie my darling katie the mother would say  im only tired mamma would be her answer dont move mamma pray dont move i am so comfortable  and then at night she would put herself to rest close circled in lindas arms she would twist up her little feet and lie so quiet there that linda would remain motionless that she might not disturb her katies sleep but soon warm tears would be running on her bosom and she would know that katie was still thinking of her love  linda among all her virtues had not that of reticence and her mother had soon learnt from her what had been said that night in their bedroom about charley but this violation of confidence if it was a violation was hardly necessary to make mrs woodward aware of what was passing in her daughters bosom when katie ceased to ask that charley might be sent for when she ceased to plead for his pardon and to praise his virtues mrs woodward knew well the cause of her silence it was not that others suspected her love but that she had learned to suspect it herself it was not that she was ashamed of loving charley but that she felt at once that such love would distress her mothers heart  as she sat there that night fingering her silken hair she had asked herself whether in truth this man was master of her heart she had probed her young bosom which now by a sudden growth became quick with a womans impulse and she had owned to herself that she did love him he was dearer to her she found than all in the world beside fondly as she loved her sister sweet to her as were her mothers caresses their love was not as precious to her as his might be and then she remembered what he was what was the manner of his life what his character how different he was from alaric or harry norman she remembered this and knew that her love was an unhappy passion herself she would have sacrificed prisoner as he had been debtor as he was drunkard penniless and a spendthrift she would not have hesitated to take him for her guide through life and have done what a woman might to guide him in return but she would not sacrifice her mother she saw now why charley was not asked and silently acquiesced in his banishment  she was not yet quite seventeen not yet seventeen the reader will say she was still such a child and yet arguing to herself about spendthrift debtors and selfsacrifice all this bombast at sixteen and a half no my ungentle reader not all this bombast at sixteen and a half the bombast is mine it is my fault if i cannot put into fitting language the thoughts which god put into her young heart in her minds soliloquy charleys vices were probably all summed up in the one word unsteady why is he so unsteady why does he like these wicked things and then as regarded mrs woodward she did but make a resolve that not even for her love would she add to the unhappiness of that loving tenderest mother there was no bombast in katie either expressed or unexpressed  after much consideration on the matter mrs woodward determined that she should ask charley down to the cottage in the first place she felt bitterly her apparent ingratitude to him when last they had been together the day after katies escape at the bridge when his tale had just been read she had told him with the warmth of somewhat more than friendly affection that henceforth they must be more than common friends she had promised him her love she had almost promised him the affection and care of a mother and now how was she keeping her promise he had fallen into misfortune and she had immediately deserted him over and over again she said to herself that her first duty was to her own child but even with this reflection she could hardly reconcile herself to her neglect of him  and then moreover she felt that it was impossible that all their friendship all their mutual regard should die away suddenly without any explanation an attempt to bring about this would not cure katies love if this were done would not katie always think of charleys wrong  and lastly it was quite clear that katie had put a check on her own heart a meeting now might be the reverse of dangerous it would be well that katie should use herself to be with him now again well at any rate that she should see him once before their proposed journey to torquay for alas the journey to torquay was now insisted on by the london physicianinsisted on although he opined with a nod somewhat less authoritative than his former nod that the young lady was touched by no organic disease  and then said mrs woodward to herself his heart is good and i will speak openly to him and so charley was again invited to the cottage after some demurring between him and norman he accepted the invitation  mrs vals dance had taken place in june and it was now late in october four months had intervened and during that period charley had seen none of the woodwards he had over and over again tried to convince himself that this was his own fault and that he had no right to accuse mrs woodward of ingratitude but he was hardly successful he did feel in spite of himself that he had been dropped because of the disgrace attaching to his arrest that mrs woodward had put him aside as being too bad to associate with her and her daughters and that it was intended that henceforth they should be strangers  he still had katies purse and he made a sort of resolve that as long as he kept that in his possession as long as he had that near his heart he would not go near norah geraghty this resolution he had kept but though he did not go to the cat and whistle he frequented other places which were as discreditable or more so he paid many very fruitless visits to mr mruen contrived to run up a score with the proprietor of the dancing saloon in holborn and was as negligent as ever in the matter of the lock entries  it is no use now he would say to himself when some aspirations for higher things came across his heart it is too late now to go back those who once cared for me have thrown me over and then he would again think of waterloo bridge and the monument and of what might be done for threepence or fourpence in a pistol gallery  and then at last came the invitation to hampton he was once more to talk to mrs woodward and associate with lindato see katie once more when he had last left the house he had almost been as much at home as any one of the family and now he was to return to it as a perfect stranger as he travelled down with norman by the railway he could not help feeling that the journey was passing over too quickly he was like a prisoner going to his doom as he crossed the bridge and remembered how katie had looked when she lay struggling in the water how he had been feted and caressed after pulling her out he made a bitter contrast between his present position and that which he then enjoyed were it not for very shame he would have found it in his heart to return to london  and then in a moment they were at the cottage door the road had never been so short norman who had not fathomed charleys feelings was happy and lightheartedmore so than was usual with him for he was unaffectedly glad to witness charleys return to hampton he rang sharply at the door and when it was opened walked with happy confidence into the drawingroom charley was bound to follow him and there he found himself again in the presence of mrs woodward and her daughters katie would fain have absented herself but mrs woodward knew that the first meeting could take place in no more favourable manner  mrs woodward bade him welcome with a collected voice and assured if not easy manner she shook hands with him cordially and said a few words as to her pleasure of seeing him again then he next took lindas hand and she too made a little speech more awkwardly than her mother saying something mal à propos about the very long time he had been away and then she laughed with a little titter trying to recover herself and at last he came to katie there was no getting over it she also stretched out her now thin hand and charley as he touched it perceived how altered she was katie looked up into his face and tried to speak but she could not articulate a word she looked into his face and then at mrs woodward as though imploring her mothers aid to tell her how to act or what to say and then finding her power of utterance impeded by rising sobs she dropped back again on her seat and hid her face upon the arm of the sofa  our katie is not so well as when you last saw heris she charley said mrs woodward she is very weak just now but thank god she has we believe no dangerous symptoms about her you have heard perhaps that we are going to torquay for the winter  and so they went on talking the ice was broken and the worst was over they did not talk it is true as in former days there was no confidence between them now and each of them felt that there was none but they nevertheless fell into a way of unembarrassed conversation and were all tolerably at their ease  and then they went to dinner and charley was called on to discuss admiralty matters with uncle bat and then he and norman sat after dinner a little longer than usual and then they had a short walk during which katie remained at home but short as it was it was quite long enough for it was very dull and then there was tea and then more constrained conversation in which katie took no part whatever and then mrs woodward and the girls took their candles and charley went over to the inn on the other side of the road oh how different was this from the former evenings at surbiton cottage  charley had made no plan for any special interview with katie had indeed not specially thought about it at all but he could not but feel an intense desire to say one word to her in private and learn whether all her solicitude for him was over dear charley you will be steady wont you those had been her last words to him nothing could have been sweeter although they brought before his mind the remembrance of his own unworthy career they had been inexpressibly sweet as testifying the interest she felt in him and was that all over now had it all been talked away by mrs woodwards cautious wisdom because he had lain for one night in a sponginghouse  but the next day came and as it passed it appeared to him that no opportunity of speaking one word to her was to be allowed to him  she did not however shun him she was not up at breakfast but she sat next to him at lunch and answered him when he spoke to her  in the evening they again went out to walk and then charley found that linda and norman went one way and that he was alone with mrs woodward it was manifest to him that this arrangement had been made on purpose and he felt that he was to undergo some private conversation the nature of which he dreaded he dreaded it very much when he heard it it made him very wretched but it was not the less full of womanly affection and regard for him  i cannot let you go from us charley began mrs woodward without telling you how deep a sorrow it has been to me to be so long without seeing you i know you have thought me very ungrateful  ungrateful mrs woodward o no i have done nothing to make gratitude necessary  yes charley you haveyou have done much too much you have saved my childs life  o no i did not said he besides i hate gratitude i dont want any one to be grateful to me gratitude is almost as offensive as pity of course i pulled kate out of the water when she fell in and i would have done as much for your favourite cat he said this with something of bitterness in his tone it was not much for though he felt bitterly he did not intend to show it but mrs woodwards ear did not fail to catch it  dont be angry with us charley dont make us more unhappy than we already are  unhappy said he as though he thought that all the unhappiness in the world was at the present moment reserved for his own shoulders  yes we are not so happy now as we were when you were last with us poor katie is very ill  but you dont think there is any danger mrs woodward  there are many tones in which such a question may be askedand is asked from day to dayall differing widely from each other and giving evidence of various shades of feeling in the speaker charley involuntarily put his whole heart into it mrs woodward could not but love him for feeling for her child though she would have given so much that the two might have been indifferent to each other  i do not know she said we hope not but i should not be sent with her to torquay if she were not very ill she is very ill and it is absolutely essential that nothing should be allowed to excite her painfully i tell you this charley to excuse our apparent unkindness in not having you here sooner  charley walked by her in silence why should his coming excite her more than normans what could there be painful to her in seeing him did the fact of his having been arrested attach to his visit any peculiar probability of excitement  do not suppose that we have not thought of you continued mrs woodward we have all done so daily nay i have done so myself all but hourly ah charley you will never know how truly i love you  charleys heart was as soft as it was inflammable he was utterly unable to resist such tenderness as mrs woodward showed to him he had made a little resolution to be stiff and stern to ask for no favour and to receive none not to palliate his own conduct or to allow mrs woodward to condemn it he had felt that as the woodwards had given him up they had no longer any right to criticize him to them at least one and all to mrs woodward and her daughters his conduct had been sans reproche they had no cause to upbraid him on their own account and they had now abandoned the right to do so on his own with such assumed sternness he began his walk but now it had all melted before the warmth of one tender word from a womans mouth  i know i am not worth thinking about said he  do not say so pray do not say so do not think that we say so to ourselves i grieve for your faults charley i know they are grievous and wicked but i know how much there is of good in you i know how clever you are how excellent your heart is how sweet your disposition i trust i trust in god you may reform and be the pride of your friends i trust that i yet may be proud of knowing you  no one will ever be proud of me said charley  we shall all be proud of you if you will resolve to turn away from childish things now that you are no longer a childyour faults are faults which as yet may be so easily relinquished but oh charley and then mrs woodward paused and looked wistfully into his face she had now come to the point at which she had to make her prayer to him she had resolved to tell him the cause of her fears and to trust to his honour to free her from them now was the moment for her to speak out but now that the moment was come the words were wanting  she looked wistfully into his face but he did not even guess what was her meaning he knew the secret of his own love but he did not know that katie also had her secret he had never dreamt that his faults among all their ill effects had paled her cheek made wan her arm silenced her voice and dimmed her eye when he had heard katie cough he had in nowise connected the hated sound with his own arrest he had thought only of his own love  oh charleyi know i can trust you said mrs woodward i know you are gentle and good you will be gentle and good to us will you not you will not make us all wretched  charley declared that he would not willingly do anything to cause pain to any of them  noi am sure you will not and therefore charley you must not see katie any more  at this time they had turned off the road into a shady lane in which the leaves of autumn were beginning to fall a path led over a stile away from the lane into the fields and mrs woodward had turned towards it as though intending to continue their walk in that direction but when she had reached the stile she had sat down upon the steps of it and charley had been listening to her standing by leaning on the top rail  and therefore charley you must not see katie any more so much she said and then she looked into his face with imploring eyes  it was impossible that he should answer her at once he had to realize so much that had hitherto not been expressed between them before he could fully understand what she meant and then he was called on to give up so much that he now learnt for the first time was within his reach before he could answer her he had to assure himself that katie loved him he had to understand that her love for one so abandoned was regarded as fatal and he had to reply to a mothers prayer that he would remove himself from the reach of a passion which to him was worth all the world beside  he turned his face away from her but still stood leaning on the stile with his arms folded on it she watched him for a while in silence and at last she saw big tears drop from his face on to the dust of the path on the farther side there they came rolling down large globules of sorrow nothing is so painful to a woman as a man in tears and mrs woodwards heart was wrung to its very core why was he not like alaric or norman so that she might make him welcome to her daughters heart  she leant towards him and put her hand caressingly on his arm it shall be so shall it not charley  oh of course if you say so  i have your word then if i have your word that will be a perfect bond i have your word have i not charley  whatnever see her in my life said he turning almost fiercely on mrs woodward  that you know is more than you can promise said she very gently it is not to the letter of the promise that i would bind you but to its spirit you understand well what i mean you know what i wish and why i wish it say that you will obey my wish and i will leave the mode of doing it to your own honour have i your promise  he shook her hand off his arm almost roughly though unintentionally and turning sharply round leant with his back against the stile the traces of tears were still on his cheeks but he was no longer crying there was however a look on his face of heartrending sorrow which mrs woodward could hardly endure  i do understand you said he and since you demand it i will promise and then they walked home side by side without interchanging a single word  when they reached the house mrs woodward went to her room and charley found himself alone with katie  i hope you find yourself better this evening said he  oh i am quite well she answered with her sweetest kindest voice i am quite well only sometimes i am a little weak  he walked up to the window as though to pass on to the lawn but the season was too far advanced for that and the window was locked he retraced his steps therefore and passing out of the drawingroom into the hall stood at the open front door till he heard mrs woodward come down then he followed her into the room  goodbye he said to her suddenly i shall start by the early train tomorrow and shall not see you she pressed his hand but he in nowise returned the pressure goodbye linda goodbye katie good night captain cuttwater and so he went his way as adam did when he was driven out of paradise  early on the following morning the cook while engaged in her most matutinal duties was disturbed by a ring at the front door she and she only of the household was up and as she had not completed her toilet with much minuteness she was rather embarrassed when on opening the door she saw mr charles tudor  i beg your pardon cook for troubling you so early but i have left something in the drawingroom i can find it myself and so saying he hurried into the room so as to prevent the servant from following him  katie had a wellworn wellknown little workbox which in years now long past had been given to her either by alaric or harry doubtless she had now workboxes grander both in appearance and size but nevertheless whether from habit or from choice her custom was in her daily needlework to use this old friend often and often had charley played with it many wicked pranks once while katie had as yet no pretension to be grown up he had put a snail into it and had incurred her severe displeasure he had stuffed it full of acorns and been rewarded by being pelted with them round the lawn and had filled it with nuts for which he had not found it so difficult to obtain pardon he knew every hole and corner in it he was intimate with all her little feminine nicknacksher silver thimble her scissors her bit of wax and the yardmeasure which twisted itself in and out of an ivory cottagehe knew them all as well as though they were his own and he knew also where the workbox stood  he closed the door behind him and then with his quickest motion raised the lid and put within the box just under the bit of work on which she was employed a light small paper parcel it contained the purse which she had worked for him and had given to him with such sweet affection at the chiswick flowershow    chapter xxxi  how apollo saved the navvy   about the middle of november the woodwards went to torquay and remained there till the following may norman went with them to see them properly settled in their new lodgings and visited them at christmas and once again during their stay there he then went down to fetch them home and when they all returned informed charley with whom he was still living that he was engaged to linda it was arranged he said that they were to be married in august  on the whole the journey to torquay was considered to have been successful katies health had been the only object in going there and the main consideration while they remained she returned if not well at any rate not worse she had got through the winter and her lungs were still pronounced to be free from those dreadful signs of decay the name of which has broken so many mothers hearts and sent dismay into the breasts of so many fathers during her sojourn at torquay she had grown much and as is often the case with those who grow quickly she had become weak and thin people at torquay are always weak and thin and mrs woodward had not therefore been greatly frightened at this her spirits though by no means such as they had been in former days had improved she had occupied herself more than she had done during the last two months at hampton and had at least so mrs woodward fondly flattered herself ceased to be always thinking of charley tudor it was quite clear that she had firmly made up her mind to some certain line of conduct with reference to him she never mentioned his name nor was it mentioned in her hearing by either her mother or sister during their stay at torquay when norman came down she always found some opportunity of inquiring from him as to charleys health and welfare but she did this in a manner which showed that she had succeeded in placing her feelings wonderfully under control  on that monday morning on which charley had returned to town after his early visit to her workbox she had not failed to find the purse linda was with her when she did so but she had contrived so to conceal her emotion that nothing was seen and nothing suspected she felt at once that it was intended that all intercourse should be broken off between them she knew instinctively that this was the effect of some precaution on her mothers part and with a sad bosom and a broken heart she acquiesced in it she said nothing even to herself of the truth and constancy of her love she made no mental resolution against any other passion she did not even think whether or not she might ever be tempted to love another but she felt a dumb aching numbness about her heart and looking round about her she seemed to feel that all was dark and dismal  and so they sojourned through the winter at torquay the effort which katie made was undoubtedly salutary to her she took again to her work and her lessonsstudies we should probably now call themand before she left torquay she had again learned how to smile but not to laugh with that gay ringing silver laughter ringing but yet not loud which to charleys ear had been as sweet as heavenly music during this time uncle bat remained at hampton keeping bachelors house by himself  and then while they were at torquay linda and norman became engaged to each other their loves were honest true and happy but not of a nature to give much scope to a novelist of a romantic turn linda knew she was not normans first love and requited norman of course by telling him something not much of alarics falseness to her norman made but one ungenerous stipulation it was this that in marrying him linda must give up all acquaintance with her brotherinlaw he would never he said be the means of separating two sisters she and gertrude might have such intercourse together as their circumstances might render possible but it was quite out of the question that either he harry norman or his wife should ever again associate with alaric tudor  in such matters linda had always been guided by others so she sighed and promised and the engagement was duly ratified by all the parties concerned  we must now return to charley when he got back to town he felt that he had lost his amulet his charm had gone from him and he had nothing now left whereby to save himself from ruin and destruction he was utterly flung over by the woodwards that now was to him an undoubted fact when mrs woodward told him that he was never again to see katie that was of course tantamount to turning him out of the cottage it might be all very well to talk to him of affection and friendship but it was manifest that no further signs of either were to be shown to him he had proved himself to be unworthy and was no more to be considered as one of the circle which made the drawingroom at surbiton cottage its centre he could not quite explain all this to norman as he could not tell him what had passed between him and mrs woodward but he said enough to make his friend know that he intended to go to hampton no more  it would be wrong perhaps to describe charley as being angry with mrs woodward he knew that she was only doing her duty by her child he knew that she was actuated by the purest and best of motives he was not able to say a word against her even to himself but nevertheless he desired to be revenged on hernot by injuring her not by injuring katiebut by injuring himself he would make mrs woodward feel what she had done by rushing himself on his own ruin he would return to the cat and whistlehe would keep his promise and marry norah geraghtyhe would go utterly to destruction and then mrs woodward would know and feel what she had done in banishing him from her daughters presence  having arrived at this magnanimous resolution after a fortnights doubt and misery he proceeded to put his purpose into execution it was now some considerable time since he had been at the cat and whistle he had had no further visit from mrs davis but he had received one or two notes both from her and norah to which as long as he had katies purse he was resolute in not replying messages also had reached him from the landlady through dick scatterall in the last of which he was reminded that there was a trifle due at the bar and another trifle for money lent  one night having lashed himself up to a fit state of wretched desperation he found himself at the wellknown corner of the street leading out of the strand on his journey thither he had been trying to realize to himself what it would be to be the husband of norah geraghty what would be the joy of returning to a small house in some dingy suburb and finding her to receive him could he really love her when she would be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh the wife of his bosom and the mother of his children in such a case would he ever be able to forget that he had known katie woodward would those words of hers ever ring in his ears then as nowyou will be steady dear charley wont you  there are those who boast that a gentleman must always be a gentleman that a man let him marry whom he will raises or degrades his wife to the level of his own condition and that king cophetua could share his throne with a beggarwoman without sullying its splendour or diminishing its glory how a king may fare in such a condition the author knowing little of kings will not pretend to say nor yet will he offer an opinion whether a lowly match be fatally injurious to a marquess duke or earl but this he will be bold to affirm that a man from the ordinary ranks of the upper classes who has had the nurture of a gentleman prepares for himself a hell on earth in taking a wife from any rank much below his owna hell on earth and alas too often another hell elsewhere also he must either leave her or loathe her she may be endowed with all those moral virtues which should adorn all women and which thank god are common to women in this country but he will have to endure habits manners and ideas which the close contiguity of married life will force upon his disgusted palate and which must banish all love man by instinct desires in his wife something softer sweeter more refined than himself and though in failing to obtain this the fault may be all his own he will not on that account the more easily reconcile himself to the want  charley knew that he was preparing such misery for himself as he went along determined to commit a moral suicide by allying himself to the barmaid he constrained himself to look with his minds eye upon this picture and on that  he had felt of what nature was the sort of love with which katie woodward had inspired his heart and he felt also what was that other sort of love to which the charms of norah geraghty had given birth  norah was a fine girl smart enough in her outward apparel but apt occasionally to disclose uncomfortable secrets if from any accident more than her outward apparel might momentarily become visible when dressed up for a sunday excursion she had her attractions and even on ordinary evenings a young man such as charley after imbibing two or three glasses of spirits and water and smoking two or three cigars might find her to be what some of her friends would have called very good company as to her mind had charley been asked about it he would probably have said that he was ignorant whether she had any but this he did know that she was sharp and quick alert in counting change and gifted with a peculiar power of detecting bad coin by the touch such was norah geraghty whom charley was to marry  and then that other portrait was limned with equal accuracy before his eyes katie with all her juvenile spirit was delightfully feminine every motion of hers was easy and every form into which she could twist her young limbs was graceful she had all the nice ideas and ways which a girl acquires when she grows from childhood to womans stature under the eye of a mother who is a lady katie could be untidy on occasions but her very untidiness was inviting all her belongings were nice she had no hidden secrets the chance revealing of which would disgrace her she might come in from her island palaces in a guise which would call down some wouldbecensorious exclamation from her mother but all others but her mother would declare that katie in such moments was more lovely than ever and katies beauty pleased more than the eyeit came home to the mind and heart of those who saw her it spoke at once to the intelligence and required for its full appreciation an exercise of the mental faculties as well as animal senses if the owner of that outward form were bad or vile one would be inclined to say that nature must have lied when she endowed her with so fair an index such was katie woodward whom charley was not to marry  as he turned down norfolk street he thought of all this as the gambler sitting with his razor before him with which he intends to cut his throat may be supposed to think of the stakes which he has failed to win and the fortune he has failed to make norah geraghty was charleys razor and he plunged boldly into the cat and whistle determined to draw it at once across his weasand and sever himself for ever from all that is valuable in the world  it was now about eleven oclock at which hour the cat and whistle generally does its most stirring trade this charley knew but he also knew that the little back parlour even if there should be an inmate in it at the time of his going in would soon be made private for his purposes  when he went in mrs davis was standing behind the counter dressed in a cap of wonderful grandeur and a red tabinet gown which rustled among the pots and jars sticking out from her to a tremendous width inflated by its own magnificence and a substratum of crinoline charley had never before seen her arrayed in such royal robes her accustomed maid was waiting as usual on the guests and another girl also was assisting but norah did not appear to charleys first impatient glance  he at once saw that something wonderful was going on the front parlour was quite full and the ministering angel was going in and out quickly with more generous supplies of the gifts of bacchus than were usual at the cat and whistle gin and water was the ordinary tipple in the front parlour and any one of its denizens inclined to cut a dash above his neighbours generally did so with a bottom of brandy but now mrs davis was mixing portwine negus as fast as her hands could make it  and then there were standing round the counter four or five customers faces well known to charley all of whom seemed to be dressed with a splendour second only to that of the landlady one man had on an almost new brown frock coat with a black velvet collar and white trousers two had blue swallowtailed coats with brass buttons and a fourth a dashing young lawyers clerk from clements inn was absolutely stirring a mixture which he called a mint julep with a yellow kid glove dangling out of his hand  they all stood back when charley entered they had been accustomed to make way for him in former days and though he had latterly ceased to rule at the cat and whistle as he once did they were too generous to trample on fallen greatness he gave his hand to mrs davis across the counter and asked her in the most unconcerned voice which he could assume what was in the wind she tittered and laughed told him he had come too late for the fun and then retreated into the little back parlour whither he followed her she was at any rate in a good humour and seemed quite inclined to forgive his rather uncivil treatment of her notes and messages  in the back parlour charley found more people drinking and among them three ladies of mrs daviss acquaintance they were all very fine in their apparel and very comfortable as to their immediate employment for each had before her a glass of hot tipple one of them a floridfaced dame about fifty charley had seen before and knew to be the wife of a pork butcher and sausage maker in the neighbourhood directly he entered the room mrs davis formally introduced him to them all a very particular friend of mine mrs allchops and of norahs too i can assure you said mrs davis  ah mr tudor and how be you a sight of you is good for sore eyes said she of the sausages rising with some difficulty from her chair and grasping charleys hand with all the pleasant cordiality of old friendship  the genleman seems to be a little too late for the fair said a severe lodginghouse keeper from cecil street    them as wills not when they may    when they wills they shall have nay  said a sarcastic rival barmaid from a neighbouring public to whom all norahs wrongs and all mr tudors false promises were fully known  charley was not the fellow to allow himself to be put down even by feminine raillery so he plucked up his spirit sad as he was at heart and replied to them all en masse  well ladies whats in the wind now you seem to be very cosy here all of you suppose you allow me to join you  with a eart and a alf said mrs allchops squeezing her corpulence up to the end of the horsehair sofa so as to make room for him between herself and the poetic barmaid id sooner have a gentleman next to me nor a lady hany day of the week so come and sit down my birdie  but charley as he was about to accept the invitation of his friend mrs allchops caught mrs daviss eye and followed her out of the room into the passage step up to the landing mr tudor said she and charley stepped up come in here mr tudoryou wont mind my bedroom for once and charley followed her in not minding her bedroom  of course you know what has happened mr tudor said she  devil a bit said charley  laws nowdont you indeed well that is odd  how the deuce should i know wheres norah  whyshes at gravesend  at gravesendyou dont mean to say shes  i just do then shes just gone and got herself spliced to peppermint this morning they had the banns said these last three sundays and this morning they was at st martins at eight oclock and has been here junketing ever since and now theyre away to gravesend  gravesend said charley struck by the suddenness of his rescue as the gambler would have been had some stranger seized the razor at the moment when it was lifted to his throat  yes gravesend said mrs davis and theyll come up home to his own house by the first boat tomorrow  so norahs married said charley with a slight access of sentimental softness in his voice  shes been and done it now mr tudor and no mistake and its better so aint it why lord love you shed never have done for you you know and shes the very article for such a man as peppermint  there was something goodnatured in this and so charley felt it as long as mrs davis could do anything to assist her cousins views by endeavouring to seduce or persuade her favourite lover into a marriage she left no stone unturned working on her cousins behalf but now now that all those hopes were over now that norah had consented to sacrifice love to prudence why should mrs davis quarrel with an old friend any longerwhy should not things be made pleasant to him as to the others  and now mr tudor come down and drink a glass to their healths and wish em both well and dont mind what them women says to you youre well out of a mess and now its all over im glad it is as it is  charley went down and took his glass and drank prosperity to the bride and bridegroom the sarcastic rival barmaid said little snappish things to him offered him a bit of green ribbon and told him that if he minded hisself somebody might perhaps take him yet but charley was proof against this  he sat there about half an hour and then went his way shaking hands with all the ladies and bowing to the gentlemen on the following day as soon as he left his office he called at the cat and whistle and paid his little bill there and said his last farewell to mrs davis he never visited the house again now that norah was gone the attractions were not powerful reader you and i will at the same time say our farewells to mrs davis to mr peppermint also and to his bride if thou art an elegant reader unaccustomed to the contamination of pipes and glasses i owe thee an apology in that thou hast been caused to linger a while among things so unsavoury but if thou art one who of thine own will hast taken thine ease in thine inn hast enjoyed the freedom of a sanded parlour hast known that ginger is hot in the mouth and made thyself lighthearted with a yard of clay then thou wilt confess there are worse establishments than the cat and whistle less generous landladies than mrs davis  when all this happened the woodwards had not been long at torquay mr peppermint was made a happy man before christmas and therefore charley was left to drift before the wind without the ballast of any ladys love to keep him in sailing trim poor fellow he had had wealth on one side beauty and love on another and on the third all those useful qualities which miss geraghty has been described as possessing he had been thus surrounded by feminine attractions and had lost them all two of those from whom he had to choose had married others and he was banished from the presence of the third under such circumstances what could he do but drift about the gulfs and straits of the london ocean without compass or rudder and bruise his timbers against all the sunken rocks that might come in his way  and then norman told him of his coming marriage and charley was more sad than ever and thus matters went on with him till the period at which our story will be resumed at the return of the woodwards to hampton  in the meantime another winter and another spring had passed over alarics head and now the full tide of the london season found him still rising and receiving every day more of the worlds homage sir gregory hardlines had had every reason to praise his own judgement in selecting mr tudor for the vacant seat among the magi  from that moment all had gone smooth with sir gregory there was no one to interfere with his hobby or run counter to his opinion alaric was all that was conciliatory and amiable in a colleague he was not submissive and cringing and had he been so sir gregory to do him justice would have been disgusted but neither was he selfopinionated nor obstinate like mr jobbles he insisted on introducing no crotchets of his own and allowed sir gregory all the credit of the commission  this all went on delightfully for a while but on one morning early in may alaric somewhat disturbed the equanimity of his chief by communicating to him his intention of becoming a candidate for the representation of the borough of strathbogy at the next general election which was to take place very shortly after the close of the session sir gregory was dumbfounded and expressed himself as incapable of believing that tudor really meant to throw up £1200 a year on the mere speculation of its being possible that he should get into parliament men in general as sir gregory endeavoured to explain with much eloquence go into parliament for the sake of getting places of £1200 a year for what earthly reason should alaric again be going to the bottom of the ladder seeing that he had already attained a rung of such very respectable altitude alaric said to himself excelsior to sir gregory he suggested that it might be possible that he should get into parliament without giving up his seat at the board earth and heaven it might be hoped would not come together even though so great a violence as this should be done to the timehonoured practices of the government sir gregory suggested that it was contrary to the constitution alaric replied that the constitution had been put upon to as great an extent before this and had survived sir gregory regarded it as all but impossible and declared it to be quite unusual alaric rejoined that something of the same kind had been done at the poor law board to this sir gregory replied gently pluming his feathers with conscious greatness that at the poor law board the chief of the commission was the parliamentary officer alaric declared that he was perfectly willing to give way if sir gregory would go into the house himself to this sir gregory demurred not feeling himself called on to change the sphere of his utility and so the matter was debated between them till at last sir gregory promised to consult his friend the chancellor of the exchequer the ice was thus broken and alaric was quite contented with the part which he had taken in the conversation  with his own official prospects in spite of the hazardous step which he now meditated he was quite contented he had an idea that in the public service of the government as well as in all other services men who were known to be worth their wages would find employment he was worth his wages men who could serve their country well who could adapt themselves to work who were practical easy in harness able to drive and patient to be driven were not unfortunately as plentiful as blackberries he began to perceive that a really useful man could not be found miscellaneously under every hat in pall mall he knew his own value and did not fear but that he should find a price for it in some of the worlds markets he would not therefore allow himself to be deterred from further progress by any fear that in doing so he risked the security of his daily bread no not though the risk extended to his wife she had taken him for better or worse if the better came she should share it if the worse why let her share that also with such consolation as his affection might be able to offer  there was something noble in this courage in this lack of prudence it may be a question whether men in marrying do not become too prudent a single man may risk anything says the world but a man with a wife should be sure of his means why so a man and a woman are but two units a man and a woman with ten children are but twelve units it is sad to see a man starvingsad to see a woman starvingvery sad to see children starving but how often does it come to pass that the man who will work is seen begging his bread we may almost say neverunless indeed he be a clergyman let the idle man be sure of his wifes bread before he marries her but the working man one would say may generally trust to gods goodness without fear  with his official career alaric was as we have said well contented in his stockjobbing line of business he also had had moments of great exaltation and some moments of considerable depression the west corks had vacillated both he and undy had sold and bought and sold again and on the whole their stake in that stupendous national line of accommodation was not so allabsorbing as it had once been but if money had been withdrawn from this it had been invested elsewhere and the great sum borrowed from madame jaquêtanàpes fortune had been in no part replacedone full moiety of it had been takenmay one not say stolento enable alaric and undy to continue their speculations  the undertaking to which they were now both wedded was the limehouse and rotherhithe bridge of this undy was chairman and alaric was a director and at the present moment they looked for ample fortune or what would nearly be ample ruin to the decision of a committee of the house of commons which was about to sit with the view of making inquiry as to the necessity of the bridge in question  mr nogo the member for mile end was the parent of this committee he asserted that the matter was one of such vital importance not only to the whole metropolis but to the country at large that the government were bound in the first place to give a large subsidy towards building the bridge and afterwards to pay a heavy annual sum towards the amount which it would be necessary to raise by tolls mr whip vigil on the other hand declared on the part of government that the bridge was wholly unnecessary that if it were built it ought to be pulled down again and that not a stiver could be given out of the public purse with such an object  on this they joined issue mr nogo prayed for a committee and mr vigil having duly consulted his higher brethren in the government conceded this point it may easily be conceived how high were now the hopes both of undy scott and alaric tudor it was not at all necessary for them that the bridge should ever be built that probably was out of the question that very likely neither of them regarded as a possibility but if a committee of the house of commons could be got to say that it ought to be built they might safely calculate on selling out at a large profit  but who were to sit on the committee that was now the allmomentous question    chapter xxxii  the parliamentary committee   there is a sport prevalent among the downs in hampshire to which though not of a high degree much interest is attached men and boys with social glee and happy boyish shouts congregate together on a hillside at the mouth of a narrow hole and proceed with the aid of a welltrained bulldog to draw a badger if the badger be at all commendable in his class this is by no means an easy thing to do he is a sturdy animal and well fortified with sharp and practised teeth his hide is of the toughest his paws of the strongest and his dead power of resistance so great as to give him more than an equal chance with the bulldog the delighted sportsmen stand round listening to the growls and snarls the tearings gnawings and bloody struggles of the combatants withinwell done badgerwell done bulldogdraw him bulldogbite him badger each has his friends and the interest of the moment is intense the badger it is true has done no harm he has been doing as it was appointed for him to do poor badger in that hole of his but then why were badgers created but to be drawn why indeed but to be drawn or not to be drawn as the case may be see the bulldog returns minus an ear with an eye hanging loose his nether lip torn off and one paw bitten through and through limping dejected beaten glaring fearfully from his one remaining eye the dog comes out and the badger within rolls himself up with affected ease hiding his bloody wounds from the public eye  so it is that the sport is played in hampshire and so also at westminsterwith a difference however in hampshire the two brutes retain ever their appointed natures the badger is always a badger and the bulldog never other than a bulldog at westminster there is a juster reciprocity of position the badger when drawn has to take his place outside the hole and fight again for the home of his love while the victorious bulldog assumes a state of badgerdom dons the skin of his enemy and in his turn submits to be baited  the pursuit is certainly full of interest but it is somewhat deficient in dignity  the parliamentary committee which was to sit with reference to the limehouse and rotherhithe bridge had been one of the effects of a baitingmatch such as that above described in this contest the enemies of the proud occupier of the den on the mountainside had not been contented to attempt to expel him with a single bulldog a whole pack had been let loose at his devoted throat bulldogs had been at him and terriers mastiffs bloodhounds lurchers and curs but so accustomed was he to the contest so knowing in his fence so ready with all the weapons given to him by nature that in spite of the numbers and venom of his enemies he had contrived to hold his own some leading hounds had fallen to rise no more others had retreated yelping to their kennels to lie quiet for a while till time might give them courage for a new attack the country round was filled with the noise of their plaints and the yowling and howling of canine defeat the grey old badger meanwhile sat proud in his hole with all his badger kin around him and laughed his wellknown badger laugh at his disconsolate foes such a brock had not for years been seen in the countryside so cool so resolute so knowing in his badger ways so impregnable in his badger hole and so goodhumoured withal he could bite full sore with those old teeth of his and yet he never condescended to show them a badger indeed of whom the country might well be proud  but in the scramble of the fight some little curs had been permitted to run away with some little bones and in this way mr nogo the member for mile end had been allowed to carry his motion for a committee to inquire as to the expediency of the governments advancing a quarter of a million towards the completion of that momentous national undertaking the building of a bridge from limehouse to rotherhithe  very much had been said about this bridge till men living out of the light of parliamentary life nine hundred and ninetynine men that is out of every thousand in the queens dominions had begun to think that it was the great want of the age men living in the light the supporters of the bridge as well as its enemies knew very well that such an erection was quite unneeded and would in all probability never be made but then the firm of blocks piles and cofferdam who held a vast quantity of the bridge shares and who were to be the contractors for building it had an allpowerful influence in the borough of limehouse where would mr nogo be if he did not cultivate the friendship of such men as blocks piles and cofferdam  and so mr nogo and those who acted with mr nogomen that is who had little jobs of their own to do and in the doing of which mr nogo occasionally assisted undy scott for instance and suchlikethese men i say had talked much about the bridge and gentlemen on the treasury bench who could have afforded to show up the folly of the scheme and to put mr nogo down at once had he been alone felt themselves under the necessity of temporizing as to giving a penny of the public money for such a purpose that they knew was out of the question that mr nogo never expected that they all knew mr nogo never expected but as mr nogos numbers were so respectable it was necessary to oppose him in a respectable parliamentary steady manner he had fifteen with him had he been quite alone mr vigil would have sneered him off had he had but four to back him the old badger would have laughed them out of face with a brace of grins but fifteen mr whip vigil thought that the committee would be the most safe so would the outer world be brought to confess that the interests of limehouse and poplar rotherhithe and deptford had not been overlooked by a careful government  but of whom was the committee to be made up that was now the question which to mr nogo in his hour of temporary greatness was truly momentous he of course was to be the chairman and to him appertained the duty of naming the other members of naming them indeedso much he could undoubtedly do by the strength of his own privilege but of what use to name a string of men to whom mr vigil would not consent mr nogo did he do so would have to divide on every name and be beaten at every division there would be no triumph in that no mr nogo fully understood that his triumph must be achievedif he were destined to a triumphby an astute skill in his selection not by an open choice of friends he must obtain a balance on his side but one in which the scale would lean so slightly to his side that mr vigils eyes might be deceived those who knew mr vigil best were inclined to surmise that such an arrangement was somewhat beyond mr nogos political capacity there is a proverb which goes to show that a certain little lively animal may be shaved if he be caught napping but then the difficulty of so catching him is extreme  mr nogo at the head of the list put mr vigil himself this of course was a necessity to himwould that he could have dispensed with it then he named sundry supporters of the government sundry members also of the opposition and he filled up the list with certain others who could not be regarded as sure supporters of one side or the other but with whom for certain reasons he thought he might in this particular case be safe undy scott was of course not among the number as mr nogo would only have damaged his cause by naming a man known to have a pecuniary interest in the concern  the member for mile end was doubtless sharp but mr vigil was sharper his object was in fact merely to do his duty to the country by preventing a profuse and useless expenditure of money his anxiety was a perfectly honest oneto save the exchequer namely but the circumstances of the case required that he should fight the battle according to the tactics of the house and he well understood how to do so  when the list was read he objected to two or three namesonly to two or three they were not those of staunch enemies of the government nor did he propose in their places the names of staunch supporters he suggested certain gentlemen who from their acquaintance with bridges tolls rivers c would as he said be probably of use he also was sure of his men and as he succeeded with two of them he was also pretty sure of his committee  and then the committee met and a lot of witnesses were in attendance the chairman opened his case and proceeded to prove by the evidence of sundry most respectable men connected with limehouse and with the portions of surrey and kent lying immediately opposite to it that the most intense desire for friendly and commercial intercourse was felt but that though absolutely close to each other the districts were so divided by adverse circumstances circumstances which were monstrous considering the advance of science in the nineteenth century that the dearest friends were constrained to perpetual banishment from each other and that the men of kent were utterly unable to do any trade at limehouse and the limehousians equally unable to carry on traffic in surrey  it was wonderful that the narrow river should be so effective for injury one gentleman from poplar proved that having given his daughter in marriage to a man of deptford two years since he had not yet been able to see her since that day her house by the crows flight was but seven furlongs from his own but as he kept no horse he could not get to her residence without a four hours walk for which he felt himself to be too old he was however able to visit his married daughter at reading and be back to tea the witness declared that his life was made miserable by his being thus debarred from his child and he wiped his eyes with his pockethandkerchief piteously sitting there in front of the committee in answer to mr vigil he admitted that there might be a ferry but stated that he did not know having had from childhood an aversion to the water he had not inquired he was aware that some rash people had gone through the tunnel but for himself he did not think the tunnel a safe mode of transit  another gentleman belonging to rotherhithe who was obliged to be almost daily at blackwall maintained two horses for the express purpose of going backwards and forwards round by london bridge they cost him £70 per annum each such a bridge as that now proposed and which the gentleman declared that he regarded as an embryo monument of national glory would save him £140 per annum he then proceeded to make a little speech about the spirit of the age and the influence of routine which he described as a gloomy gnome but his oratory was cruelly cut short by mr vigil who demanded of him whether he ever used the river steamers the witness shuddered fearfully as he assured the committee that he never did and referred to the cricket whose boilers burst in the year 1842 besides he had he said his things to carry with him  another witness told how unsafe was the transit of heavy goods by barge from one side of the river to another he had had a cargo of marine stores which would go to sea before their time the strong ebb of the tide joined to the river current had positively carried the barge away and its course had not been stopped till it had drifted on shore at purfleet he acknowledged that something had transpired of the bargemen being drunk but he had no knowledge himself that such had been the case no other cargoes of his own had been carried away but he had heard that such was often the case he thought that the bridge was imperatively demanded would the tolls pay he felt sure that they would why then should not the bridge be built as a commercial speculation without government aid he thought that in such cases a fostering government was bound to come forward and show the way he had a few shares in the bridge himself he had paid up £1 a share they were now worth 2s 6d each they had been worth nothing before the committee had been ordered to sit he declined to give any opinion as to what the shares would be worth if the money were granted  ladies at limehouse proved that if there were a bridge they could save 30s a year each by buying their tea and sugar at rotherhithe and so singular are the usages of trade that the ladies of rotherhithe would benefit their husbands equally and return the compliment by consuming the bread of limehouse the shores of kent were pining for the beef of the opposite bank and only too anxious to give in return the surplus stock of their own poultry  let but a bridge be opened as was asserted by one animated vendor of rope and poplar would soon rival pimlico perhaps that might not be desirable in the eyes of men who lived in the purlieus of the court and who were desirous to build no new bridge except that over the ornamental water in st jamess park upon uttering which the ropevendor looked at mr vigil as though he expected him to sink at once under the table  mr blocks of the great firm of blocks piles and cofferdam then came forward he declared that a large sum of money was necessary before this great national undertaking could be begun in a spirit worthy of the nineteenth century it was intended to commence the approaches on each side of the river a quarter of a mile from the first abutment of the bridge in order to acquire the necessary altitude without a steep ascent he then described what a glorious bridge this bridge would be how it would eclipse all bridges that had ever been built how the fleets of all nations would ride under it how many hundred thousand square feet of wrought iron would be consumed in its construction how many tons of portland stone in the abutments parapets and supporting walls how much timber would be buried twenty fathoms deep in the mud of the river how many miles of pavingstone would be laid down mr blocks went on with his astonishing figures till the committee were bewildered and even mr vigil though well used to calculations could hardly raise his mind to the dimensions of the proposed undertaking  the engineer followed and showed how easily this great work could be accomplished there was no difficulty literally none the patronage of the crown was all that was required the engineer was asked whether by the word patronage he meant money and after a little laughing and a few counter questions he admitted that in his estimation patronage and money did mean the same thing  such was the case made out by the promoters of the bridge and the chairman and his party were very sanguine of success they conceived that mr blocks figures had completely cowed their antagonists  mr vigil then took his case in hand and brought forward his witnesses it now appeared that the intercourse between the people living on each side of the river was immense and ever on the increase limehouse it would seem had nothing to do but to go to deptford and that deptford consumed all its time in returning the visit little children were sent across continually on the most trifling errands going and coming for one halfpenny an immense income was made by the owners of the ferry no two adjacent streets in london had more to do with each other than had the lanes of rotherhithe and the lanes of limehouse westminster and lambeth were further apart and less connected by friendly intercourse the frequenters of the ferry were found to outnumber the passengers over waterloo bridge by ten to one  indeed so lamentable a proposition as this of building a bridge across the river had never before been mooted by the public men conversant with such matters gave it as their opinion that no amount of tolls that could reasonably be expected would pay one per cent on the money which it was proposed to expend that sum however they stated would not more than half cover the full cost of the bridge traffic would be prohibited by the heavy charges which would be necessary and the probability would be that the ferry would still continue to be the ordinary mode of crossing the river  a gentleman accustomed to use strong figures of speech declared that if such a bridge were built the wisest course would be to sow the surface with grass and let it out for grazing this witness was taken specially in hand by mr nogo and targed very tightly mr vigil had contrived to prove out of the mouths of inimical witnesses the very reverse of that which they had been summoned thither to assert the secret of the ferry had been first brought to the light by the gentleman who could not visit his daughter at deptford and so on these triumphs had evidently been very pleasant to mr vigil and mr nogo thought that he might judiciously take a leaf out of the treasury book actuated by this ambition he with the assistance of his friend the mcarthy desmond put no less than 2250 questions to the gentleman who suggested the grazing in order to induce him to say that if there were a bridge men would probably walk over it but they could not bring him to own to a single passenger unless they would abandon the tolls the most that they could get from him was that perhaps an old woman with more money than wit might go over it on a sunday afternoon ifwhich he did not believeany old woman existed in that part of the world who had more money than wit  this witness was kept in the chair for three days during which mr vigil was nearly driven wild by the loss of his valuable time but he did not complain nor would he have complained though he might have absented himself had the witness been kept in the chair three weeks instead of three days the expense of the committee including witnesses shorthandwriters and printing was about £60 a day but it never occurred to any one of the number to get up and declare with indignation that such a waste of money and time on so palpably absurd a scheme was degrading and to demand an immediate close of their labours it all went smoothly to the end and mr nogo walked off from his task with the approving conscience of a patriotic legislator  at the close the members met to prepare their report it was then the first week in august and they were naturally in a hurry to finish their work it was now their duty to decide on the merits of what they had heard to form a judgement as to the veracity of the witnesses and declare on behalf of the country which they represented whether or no this bridge should be built at the expense of the nation  with his decision each was ready enough but not one of them dreamed of being influenced by anything which had been said before them all the worldthat is all that were in any way concerned in the matterknew that the witnesses for the bridge were anxious to have it built and that the witnesses against the bridge were anxious to prevent the building it would be the worst of ignorance ignorance of the usage of the world we live in to suppose that any member of parliament could be influenced by such manoeuvres besides was not the mind of each man fully known before the committee met  various propositions were made by the members among themselves and various amendments moved the balance of the different parties had been nearly preserved a decided victory was not to be expected on either side at last the resolution to which the committee came was this that this committee is not prepared under existing circumstances to recommend a grant of public money for the purpose of erecting a bridge at limehouse but that the committee consider that the matter is still open to consideration should further evidence be adduced  mr vigil was perfectly satisfied he did not wish to acerbate the member for mile end and was quite willing to give him a lift towards keeping his seat for the borough if able to do so without cost to the public exchequer at limehouse the report of the committee was declared by certain persons to be as good as a decision in their favour it was only postponing the matter for another session but mr vigil knew that he had carried his point and the world soon agreed with him he at least did his work successfully and considering the circumstances of his position he did it with credit to himself  a huge blue volume was then published containing among other things all mr nogos 2250 questions and their answers and so the limehouse and rotherhithe bridge dropped into oblivion and was forgotten    chapter xxxiii  to stand or not to stand   sir gregory hardlines had been somewhat startled by alarics announcement of his parliamentary intentions it not unnaturally occurred to that great man that should mr tudor succeed at strathbogy and should he also succeed in being allowed to hold his office and seat together he tudor would very soon become first fiddle at the civil service examination board this was a view of the matter which was by no means agreeable to sir gregory not for this had he devoted his time his energy and the best powers of his mind to the office of which he was at present the chief not for this had he taken by the hand a young clerk and brought him forward and pushed him up and seated him in high places to have kept mr jobbles would have been better than this he at any rate would not have aspired to parliamentary honours  and when sir gregory came to look into it he hardly knew whether those bugbears with which he had tried to frighten tudor were good serviceable bugbears such as would stand the strain of such a mans logic and reason was there really any reason why one of the commissioners should not sit in parliament would his doing so be subversive of the constitution or would the ministers of the day object to an additional certain vote this last point of view was one in which it did not at all delight sir gregory to look at the subject in question he determined that he would not speak on the matter to the chancellor of the exchequer or to any of the government wigs who might be considered to be bigger wigs than himself  and alaric thought over the matter coolly also he looked at it till the bugbears shrank into utter insignificance till they became no more than forms of shreds and patches put up to frighten birds out of cherryorchards  why should the constitution be wounded by the presence of one more commissioner in parliament why should not he do his public duty and hold his seat at the same time as was done by so many others but he would have to go out if the ministry went out that was another difficulty another bugbear more substantial perhaps than the others but he was prepared to meet even that he was a poor man his profession was that of the civil service his ambition was to sit in parliament he would see whether he could not combine his poverty with his profession and with his ambition also sir gregory resolved in his fear that he would not speak to the chancellor of the exchequer on the matter alaric on the other hand in his audacity resolved that he would do so  it was thus that sir gregory regarded the matter see all that i have done for this man said he to himself see how i have warmed him in my bosom how i have lifted him to fortune and renown how i have heaped benefits on his head if gratitude in this world be possible that man should be grateful to me if one man can ever have anothers interest at heart that man should have a heartfelt anxiety as to my interest and yet how is it i have placed him in the chair next to my own and now he is desirous of sitting above me  twas thus sir gregory communed with himself but alarics soliloquy was very different a listener who could have overheard both would hardly have thought that the same question was being discussed by the two i have got so high said alaric by my own labour by my own skill and tact and why should i stop here i have left my earliest colleagues far behind me have distanced those who were my competitors in the walk of life why should i not still go on and distance others also why stop when i am only second or third it is very natural that sir gregory should wish to keep me out of parliament i cannot in the least blame him let us all fight as best each may for himself he does not wish a higher career i do sir gregory will now do all that he can to impede my views because they are antagonistic to his own very well i must only work the harder to overcome his objections there was no word in all this of gratitude there was no thought in alarics mind that it behoved him to be grateful to sir gregory it was for his own sake not for his pupils that sir gregory had brought this pupil forward grateful indeed in public life when is there time for gratitude who ever thinks of other interest than his own  such was alarics theory of life but not the less would he have expected gratitude from those whom he might serve such also very probably was sir gregorys theory when he thought of those who had helped him instead of those whom he himself had helped  and so they met and discussed alarics little proposition  since i saw you yesterday said sir gregory i have been thinking much of what you were saying to me of your wish to go into parliament  i am very much obliged to you said alaric  i need hardly tell you tudor how anxious i am to further your advancement i greatly value your ability and diligence and have shown that i am anxious to make them serviceable to the public  i am fully aware that i owe you a great deal sir gregory  oh i dont mean that thats nothing i am not thinking of myself i only want you to understand that i am truly anxious to see you take that line in public matters which may make your services most valuable to the public and which may redound the most to your own advantage i have thought of what you said to me with the most mature deliberation and i am persuaded that i shall best do my duty to you and to the service by recommending you to abandon altogether your idea of going into parliament  sir gregory said this in his weightiest manner he endeavoured to assume some of that authority with which he had erst cowed the young tudor at the weights and measures and as he finished his speech he assumed a profound look which ought to have been very convincing  but the time was gone by with alaric when such tricks of legerdemain were convincing to him a grave brow compressed lips and fixed eyes had no longer much effect upon him he had a point to gain and he was thinking of that and not of sir gregorys grimaces  then you will not see the chancellor of the exchequer on the subject  no said sir gregory it would be useless for me to do so i could not advocate such a scheme feeling certain that it would be injurious both to yourself and to the service and i would not desire to see the chancellor with the view of opposing your wishes  i am much obliged to you for that at any rate said alaric  but i do hope that you will not carry your plan any farther when i tell you as i do with the utmost sincerity that i feel certain that an attempt to seat yourself in parliament can only lead to the ruin of your prospects as a civil servantprospects which are brighter now than those of any other young man in the servicei cannot but think that you must hesitate before you take any step which will in my opinion render your resignation necessary  i shall be sorry to resign sir gregory as i have such true pleasure in serving with you  and i presume a salary of £1200 a year is not unacceptable said sir gregory with the very faintest of smiles  by no means said alaric i am a poor man depending altogether on my own exertions for an income i cannot afford to throw away a chance  then take my word for it you should give up all idea of parliament said sir gregory who thought that he had carried his point  but i call a seat in parliament a chance said alaric the best chance that a man circumstanced as i am can possibly have i have the offer of a seat sir gregory and i cant afford to throw it away  then it is my duty to tell you as the head of your office that it will be your duty to resign before you offer yourself as a candidate  that you mean is your present opinion sir gregory  yes mr tudor that is my opinionan opinion which i shall be forced to express to the chancellor of the exchequer if you persist in this infatuation  alaric looked very grave but not a whit angry i am sorry for it sir gregory very sorry i had hoped to have had your countenance  i would give it you mr tudor if i could consistently with my duty as a public servant but as i cannot i am sure you will not ask for it how fidus neverbend would have admired the chief commissioner could he have seen and heard him at this moment but he continued relaxing for a while the muscles of his face i hope i do hope you will think better of this what are you to gain come tudor think of it that way what are you to gain you with a wife and young family coming up about your heels what are you to gain by going into parliament that is what i ask you what are you to gain it was delightful to see how pleasantly practical sir gregory could become when he chose to dismount from his high horse  it is considered a high position in this country that of a member of parliament said alaric a man in gaining that is generally supposed to have gained something  true quite true it is a desirable position for a rich man or a rich mans eldest son or even for a poor man if by getting into parliament he can put himself in the way of improving his income but my dear tudor you are in none of these positions abandon the idea my dear tudorpray abandon it if not for your own sake at any rate do so for that of your wife and child  sir gregory might as well have whistled not a word that he said had the slightest effect on alaric how was it possible that his words should have any effect seeing that alaric was convinced that sir gregory was pleading for his own advantage and not for that of his listener alaric did listen he received all that sir gregory said with the most profound attention schooled his face into a look of the most polite deference and then with his most cruel tone informed sir gregory that his mind was quite made up and that he did intend to submit himself to the electors of strathbogy  and as to what you say about my seat at the board sir gregory you may probably be right perhaps it will be as well that i should see the chancellor of the exchequer myself  who will to cupar maun to cupar said sir gregory i can only say mr tudor that i am very sorry for you and very sorry for your wifevery sorry very sorry indeed  and who will to strathbogy maun to strathbogy said alaric laughing there is certainly an air of truth about the proverb as applied to myself just at present but the fact is whether for good or for bad i maun to strathbogy that is my present destiny the fact that i have a wife and a child does make the step a most momentous one but sir gregory i should never forgive myself were i to throw away such an opportunity  then i have nothing more to say mr tudor  of course i shall try to save my place continued alaric  i look upon that as quite impossible said sir gregory  it can do me no harm at any rate to see the chancellor of the exchequer if he tells me that a seat in parliament and a seat at the board are incompatible and that as one of the civil service commissioners i am not free to stand for the borough i will in that case sir gregory put my resignation in your hands before i publish my address  and so they parted each determined to do all that in him lay to thwart the wishes of the other alaric was not in the least influenced by anything that sir gregory had said to him he had made up his mind and was determined to be turned from it by no arguments that his colleague could use but nevertheless he could not but be meditative as walking home across the parks he thought of his wife and child it is true that he had a second trade he was a stockjobber as well as a civil service commissioner but he already perceived how very difficult it was to realize an income to which he could trust from that second precarious pursuit he had also lived in a style considerably beyond that which his official income would have enabled him to assume he had on the whole he thought done very well but yet it would be a dreadful thing to have to trust to so precarious a livelihood he had realized nothing he had not yet been able to pay back the money which he had so fraudulently taken and to acquit himself of a debt which now lay daily heavier and heavier on his soul he felt that he must repay not only that but undys share also before he could again pass a happy day or a quiet night this plan of throwing up £1200 a year would badly assist him in getting rid of this incubus  but still that watchword of his goaded him onexcelsior he still said to himself excelsior if he halted now now when the ball was at his foot he might never have another chance very early in life before a beard was on his chin before he could style himself a man according to the laws of his country he had determined within himself that a seat in parliament was the only fitting ambition for an englishman that was now within his reach would he be such a dastard as to draw back his hand and be deterred from taking it by old womens tales of prudence and the selfinterested lectures of sir gregory hardlines  excelsior there was not much that could be so styled in that debt of his to m and madame jaquêtanàpe if he could only pay that off he felt that he could brave the world without a fear come what come might he would sell out and do so the bridge committee was sitting and his shares were already worth more than he had paid for them mr blocks had just given his evidence and the commercial world was willing enough to invest in the limehouse bridge he would sell out and put his conscience at rest  but then to do so successfully he must induce undy to do so too and that he knew would not at present be an easy task who had ever been successful in getting back money from undy scott he had paid the last halfyears interest with most commendable punctuality and was not that a great deal from undy scott  but what if this appropriation of anothers money what if this fraud should be detected and exposed before he had succeeded in paying back the £10000 what if he should wake some morning and find himself in the grip of some newgate myrmidon a terrible new law had just been passed for the protection of trust property a law in which he had not felt the slightest interest when he had first seen in the daily newspapers some tedious account of the passing of the various clauses but which was now terrible to his innermost thoughts  his walk across the parks was not made happy by much selftriumph in spite of his commissionership and coming parliamentary honours his solitary moments were seldom very happy it was at his club when living with undy and undys peers that he was best able to throw off his cares and enjoy himself but even then high as he was mounted on his fasttrotting horse black care would sit behind him ever mounted on the same steed  and bitterly did poor gertrude feel the misery of these evenings which her husband passed at his club but she never reviled him or complained she never spoke of her sorrow even to her mother or sister she did not even blame him in her own heart she knew that he had other business than that of his office higher hopes than those attached to his board and she taught herself to believe that his career required him to be among public men  he had endeavoured to induce her to associate constantly with mrs val so that her evenings might not be passed alone but gertrude after trying mrs val for a time had quietly repudiated the closeness of this alliance mrs val had her ideas of excelsior her ambition to rule and these ideas and this ambition did not at all suit gertrudes temper not even for her husbands sake could she bring herself to be patronized by mrs val they were still very dear friends of course but they did not live in each others arms as alaric had intended they should do  he returned home after his interview with sir gregory and found his wife in the drawingroom with her child he usually went down from his office to his club and she was therefore the more ready to welcome him for having broken through his habit on the present occasion  she left her infant sprawling on the floor and came up to greet him with a kiss  gersaid he putting his arm round her and embracing heri have come home to consult you on business and then he seated himself on the sofa taking her with him and still in his arms there was but little doubt that she would consent to anything which he could propose to her after such a fashion in such a guise as this that he knew full well  well love said she and what is the business about you know that i always think that to be best which you think to be best  yes ger but this is a very important matter and then he looked grave but managed at the same time to look happy and contented this is a matter of vital importance to you and i will do nothing in it without your consent  what is best for you must be best for me said gertrude kissing his forehead  then he explained to her what had passed between himself and sir gregory and what his own ideas were as regarded the borough of strathbogy sir gregory said he is determined that i shall not remain at the board and sit in parliament at the same time but i do not see why sir gregory is to have his own way in everything if you are not afraid of the risk i will make up my mind to stand it at all events and to resign if the minister makes it imperative if however you fear the result i will let the matter drop and tell the scotts to find another candidate i am anxious to go into parliament i confess but i will never do so at the expense of your peace of mind  the way in which he put upon her the whole weight of the decision was not generous nor was the mode he adopted of inducing her to back his own wishes if there were risk to herand in truth there was fearful riskit was his duty to guard her from the chance not hers to say whether such danger should be encountered or no the nature of her answer may be easily surmised she was generous though he was not she would never retard his advance or be felt as a millstone round his neck she encouraged him with all her enthusiasm and bade him throw prudence to the winds if he rose must she not rise also whatever step in life was good for him must it not be good for her as well and so that matter was settled between thempleasantly enough  he endured a fortnight of considerable excitement during which he and sir gregory did not smile at each other and then he saw the chancellor of the exchequer that gentleman promised to speak to the prime minister feeling himself unable to answer the question put to him definitely out of his own head and then another fortnight passed on at the end of that time the chancellor of the exchequer sent for alaric and they had a second interview  well mr tudor said the great man this is a matter of very considerable importance and one on which i am not even yet prepared to give you a positive answer  this was very good news for alaric sir gregory had spoken of the matter as one on which there could be no possible doubt he had asserted that the british lion would no longer sleep peaceably in his lair if such a violence were put on the constitution as that meditated by the young commissioner it was quite clear that the chancellor of the exchequer and the prime minister also looked at it in a very different light they doubted and alaric was well aware that their doubt was as good as certainty to him  the truth was that the prime minister had said to the chancellor of the exchequer in a halfserious halfjocular way that he didnt see why he should reject a vote when offered to him by a member of the civil service the man must of course do his workand should it be found that his office work and his seat in parliament interfered with each other why he must take the consequences and iforormade a row about it in the house and complained why in that case also mr tudor must take the consequences and then enough having been said on that matter the conversation dropped  i am not prepared to give a positive answer said the chancellor of the exchequer who of course did not choose to commit himself  alaric assured the great man that he was not so unreasonable as to expect a positive answer positive answers as he well knew were not often forthcoming among official men official men as he had already learnt prefer to do their business by answers which are not positive he himself had become adverse to positive answers since he had become a commissioner and was quite prepared to dispense with them in the parliamentary career which he hoped that he was now about to commence this much however was quite clear that he might offer himself as a candidate to the electors of strathbogy without resigning and that sir gregorys hostile remonstrance on the subject should he choose to make one would not be received as absolute law by the greater powers  accordingly as alaric was elated sir gregory was depressed he had risen high but now this young tyro whom he had fostered was about to climb above his head o the ingratitude of men  alaric however showed no triumph he was more submissive more gracious than ever to his chief it was only to himself that he muttered excelsior    chapter xxxiv  westminster hall   the parliamentary committee pursued their animated inquiries respecting the limehouse bridge all through the sultry month of july how mr vigil must have hated mr nogo and the mcarthy desmond how sick he must have been of that eternal witness who with imperturbable effrontery answered the 2250 questions put to him without admitting anything to mr vigil it was all mere nonsense sheer waste of time had he been condemned to sit for eight days in close contiguity to the clappers of a small mill he would have learnt as much as he did from the witnesses before the committee nevertheless he went through it and did not lose his temper he smiled sweetly on mr nogo every morning and greeted the titled irishman with his easy familiar nod as though the continued sitting of this very committee was of all things to him the most desirable such is mr vigils peculiar tact such his special talent these are the giftsgifts by no means ordinarywhich have made him right honourable and recommended him to the confidence of successive badgers  but though the committee was uninteresting to mr vigil it was not so to the speculative inhabitants of limehouse or to the credulous shopkeepers of rotherhithe on the evening of the day on which mr blocks was examined the shares went up 20 per cent and when his evidence was published in extenso the next saturday morning by the capel court sharebuyer a periodical which served for bible and prayerbook as well as a compendium of the whole duty of man to undy scott and his friends a further rise in the price of this now valuable property was the immediate consequence  now then was the time for alaric to sell and get out of his difficulties if ever he could do so shares which he bought for 30s were now worth nearly £2 10s he was strongly of opinion that they would fall again and that the final result of the committee would leave them of a less value than their original purchasemoney and probably altogether valueless he could not however act in the matter without consulting undy so closely linked were they in the speculation and even at the present price his own shares would not enable him to pay back the full amount of what he had taken  the joint property of the two was however at its present market price worth £12000£10000 would make him a free man he was perfectly willing to let undy have the full use of the difference in amount nay he was ready enough to give it to him altogether if by so doing he could place the whole of his wards money once more in safety with the power of offering such a douceur to his friends rapacity he flattered himself that he might have a chance of being successful he was thus prepared to discuss the matter with his partner  it so happened that at the same moment undy was desirous of discussing the same subject their joint interest namely in the limehouse bridge there was no difficulty therefore in their coming together they met at the door of the committeeroom when mr nogo had just put his 999th question to the adverse witness and as the summons to prayers prevented the 1000th being proceeded with at that moment undy and alaric sauntered back along the passages and then walking up and down the immense space of westminster hall said each to the other what he had to say on the matter mooted between them  undy was in great glee and seemed to look on his fortune as already made they had at first confined their remarks to the special evidence of the witness who had last been in the chair and undy with the volubility which was common to him when he was in high spirits had been denouncing him as an ass who was injuring his own cause by his over obstinacy  nothing that he can say said undy will tell upon the sharemarket the stock is rising from hour to hour and piles himself told me that he knew from sure intelligence that the chancellor of the exchequer is prepared to give way whatever vigil may say to the contrary their firm piles says is buying every share they can lay their hands on  then in gods name let them buy ours said alaric  buy ours said undy you dont mean to tell me that you wish to sell now you dont mean to say that you want to back out now that the game is all going our own way  indeed i do and i intend to do so just listen to me undy  i tell you fairly tudor i will not sell a share what you may choose to do with your own i cannot say but if you will be guided by me you will keep every share you have got instead of selling we should both add to our stock i at any rate am resolved to do so  listen to me undy said alaric  the truth is said undywho at the present moment preferred talking to listeningthe truth is you do not understand buying and selling shares we should both be ruined very quickly were i to allow myself to be led by you you are too timid too much afraid of risking your money your speculative pluck hardly rises higher than the three per cents and never soars above a firstclass mortgage on land  i could be as sanguine as you are and as bold said alaric were i venturing with my own money  in the name of goodness get that bugbear out of your head said undy whatever good it might have done you to think of that some time ago it can do you no good now there was a bitter truth in this which made alarics heart sink low within his breast wherever the money came from whose property it may have been or be it has been used and now your only safety is in making the best use of it a little daring a little audacityit is that which ruins men when you sit down to play brag you must brag it out or lose your money  but my dear fellow there is no question here of losing money if we sell now we shall realize about £2000  and will that or the half of that satisfy you is that your idea of a good thing will that be sufficient to pay for the dozen of bad things which a fellow is always putting his foot into it wont satisfy me i can tell you that at any rate  alaric felt very desirous of keeping undy in a good humour he wished if possible to persuade him rather than to drive him to coax him into repaying this money and not absolutely to demand the repayment come said he what do you call a good thing yourself  i call cent per cent a good thing and ill not sell a share till they come up to that  theyll never do that undy  thats your opinion i think differently and im sure you will own i have had more experience of the sharemarket than you have when i see such men as blocks and piles buying fast i know very well which way the wind blows a man may be fishing a long time tudor in these waters before he gets such a haul as this but he must be a great fool to let go his net when he does get it  they both then remained silent for a time for each was doubtful how best to put forward the view which he himself wished to urge their projects were diametrically different and yet neither could carry his own without the assistance of the other  i tell you what i propose said undy  wait a moment undy said alaric listen to me for one moment i can hear nothing till you do so and then i will hear anything  well what is it  we have each of us put something near to £5000 into this venture  i have put more said scott  very well but we have each of us withdrawn a sum equal to that i have named from my wards fortune for this purpose  i deny that said undy i have taken nothing from your wards fortune i have had no power to do so you have done as you pleased with that fortune but i am ready to admit that i have borrowed £5000not from your ward but from you  alaric was nearly beside himself but he still felt that he should have no chance of carrying his point if he lost his temper  that is ungenerous of you scott to say the least of it but well let that pass to enable me to lend you the £5000 and to enable me to join you in this speculation £10000 has been withdrawn from clementinas fortune  i know nothing about that said scott  know nothing about it said alaric looking at him with withering scorn but undy was not made of withering material and did not care a straw for his friends scorn  nothing whatever said he  well so be it said alaric but the fact is the money has been withdrawn  i dont doubt that in the least said undy i am not now going to argue whether the fault has been most mine or yours continued alaric  well that is kind of you said undy considering that you are the girls trustee and that i have no more to do with it than that fellow in the wig there  i wish at any rate you would let me explain myself said alaric who felt that his patience was fast going and who could hardly resist the temptation of seizing his companion by the throat and punishing him on the spot for his iniquity  i dont prevent you my dear fellowonly remember this i will not permit you to assert without contradicting you that i am responsible for clems fortune now go on and explain away as hard as you like  alaric under these circumstances found it not very easy to put what he had to say into any words that his companion would admit he fully intended at some future day to thrust scotts innocence down his throat and tell him that he was not only a thief but a mean lying beggarly thief but the present was not the time too much depended on his inducing undy to act with him  ten thousand pounds has at any rate been taken  that i wont deny  and half that sum has been lent to you  i acknowledge a debt of £5000  it is imperative that £10000 should at once be repaid  i have no objection in life  i can sell my shares in the limehouse bridge continued alaric for £6000 and i am prepared to do so  the more fool you said undy if you do it especially as £6000 wont pay £10000 and as the same property if overheld another month or two in all probability will do so  i am ready to sacrifice that and more than that said alaric if you will sell out £4000 and let me at once have that amount so as to make up the full sum i owe i will make you a free present of the remainder of the debt come undy you cannot but call that a good thing you will have pocketed two thousand pounds according to the present market value of the shares and that without the slightest risk  undy for a while seemed staggered by the offer whether it was alarics extreme simplicity in making it or his own good luck in receiving it or whether by any possible chance some all but dormant remnant of feeling within his heart was touched we will not pretend to say but for a while he walked on silent as though wavering in his resolution and looking as if he wished to be somewhat more civil somewhat less of the bully than he had been  there was no one else to whom alaric could dare to open his heart on this subject of his wards fortune there was none other but this ally of his to whom he could confide whom he could consult unpromising therefore though undy was as a confederate alaric when he thought he saw this change in his manner poured forth at once the full tide of his feelings  undy said he pray bear with me a while the truth is i cannot endure this misery any longer i do not now want to blame anyone but myself the thing has been done and it is useless now to talk of blame the thing has been done and all that now remains for me is to undo it to put this girls money back again and get this horrid weight from off my breast  upon my word my dear fellow i did not think that you took it in such a light as that said undy  i am miserable about it said alaric it keeps me awake all night and destroys all my energy during the day  oh thats all bile said undy you should give up fish for a few days and take a blue pill at night  scott this money must be paid back at once or i shall lose my senses fortune has so far favoured me as to enable me to put my hand at once on the larger portion of it you must let me have the remainder in gods name say that you will do so  undy scott unfortunately had not the power to do as he was asked whether he would have done so had he had the power may be doubtful he was somewhat gravelled for an answer to alarics earnest supplication and therefore made none till the request was repeated  in gods name let me have this money repeated alaric you will then have made two thousand pounds by the transaction  my dear tudor said he your stomach is out of order i can see it as well as possible from the way you talk  here was an answer for a man to get to the most earnest appeal which he could make here was comfort for a wretch suffering from fear remorse and shame as alaric was suffering he had spoken of his feelings and his heart but these were regions quite out of undy scotts cognizance take a blue pill said he and youll be as right as a trivet in a couple of days  what was alaric to say what could he say to a man who at such a crisis could talk to him of blue pills for a while he said nothing but the form of his face changed a darkness came over his brow which scott had never before seen there the colour flew from his face his eyes sparkled and a strange appearance of resolute defiance showed itself round his mouth scott began to perceive that his medical advice would not be taken in good part  scott said he stopping short in his walk and taking hold of the collar of his companions coat not loosely by the button but with a firm grip which undy felt that it would be difficult to shake offscott you will find that i am not to be trifled with you have made a villain of me i can see no way to escape from my ruin without your aid but by the living god if i fall you shall fall with me tell me now will you let me have the sum i demand if you do not i will go to your brothers wife and tell her what has become of her daughters money  you may go to the devils wife if you like it said undy and tell her whatever you please  you refuse then said alaric still keeping hold of undys coat  come take your hand off said undy you will make me think your head is wrong as well as your stomach if you go on like this take your hand off and listen to me i will then explain to you why i cannot do what you would have me take your hand away i say do you not see that people are looking at us  they were now standing at the upper end of the hallclose under the steps which lead to the houses of parliament and as undy said the place was too public for a display of physical resentment alaric took his hand away well said he now tell me what is to hinder you from letting me have the money you owe me  only this said undy that every share i have in the concern is made over by way of security to old mcleury and he now holds them till i have redeemed them i have no power of selling  alaric when he heard these words could hardly prevent himself from falling in the middle of the hall all his hopes were then over he had no chance of shaking this intolerable burden from his shoulders he had taken the womans money this money which had been entrusted to his honour and safekeeping and thrown it into a bottomless gulf  and now listen to me said undy looking at his watch i must be in the house in ten or fifteen minutes for this bill about married women is on and i am interested in it listen to me now for five minutes all this that you have been saying is sheer nonsense  i think youll find that it is not all nonsense said alaric  oh i am not in the least afraid of your doing anything rash youll be cautious enough i know when you come to be cool especially if you take a little physic what i want to say is thisclems money is safe enough i tell you these bridge shares will go on rising till the beginning of next session instead of selling what we should do is to buy up six or seven thousand pounds more  what with clementinas money  its as well to be hung for a sheep as a lamb besides your doing so is your only safety my brother val insists upon having 250 shares  your brother val said alaric  yes val and why shouldnt he i would give them to him if i could but i cant mcleury as i tell you has every share of mine in his possession  your brother val wants 250 shares and does he expect me to give them to him  welli rather think he does that is not to give them of course you dont suppose he wants you to make him a present of money but he wants you to accommodate him with the price of them you can either do that or let him have so many of your own it will be as broad as it is long and hell give you his note of hand for the amount  now it was well known among the acquaintance of the scott family that the note of hand of the honourable captain val was not worth the paper on which it was written  alaric was so astonished at this monstrous request coming as it did after such a conversation that he did not well know how to take it  was undy mad or was he in joke what man in his senses would think of lending six or seven hundred pounds to val scott i suppose you are in jest said he somewhat bitterly  i never was more in earnest in my life said undy ill just explain how the matter is and as you are sharp enough youll see at once that you had better oblige him val you know is always hard up he cant touch a shilling of that womans money and just at present he has none of his own so he came to me this morning to raise the wind  and you are kind enough to pass him on to me  listen a moment i did not do anything of the kind i never lend money to val its a principle with me not to do so and he knows it  then just tell him that my principles in this respect are identical with your own  thats all very well and you may tell him so yourself if you like it but hear first of all what his arguments are of course i told him i could do nothing for him but said he you can get tudor to do it i told him of course that i could do nothing of the kind oh said val i know the game you are both playing i know all about clems money val you know never says much he was playing pool at the time at the club but he came back after his stroke and whispered to meyou and tudor must let me have 250 of those shares and then itll be all right now val you know is a most determined fellow  alaric when he heard this looked up into his companions face to see whether he was talking to the evil one himself oh what a net of ruin was closing round himhow inextricable were the toils into which he had fallen  after all continued undy what he asks is not much and i really think you should do it for him he is quite willing to give you his assistance at strathbogy and he is entitled to some accommodation  some accommodation repeated alaric almost lost in the consideration of his own misery  yes i really think he is and tudor you may be sure of this you know you will be quite safe with him val is the very soul of honour do this for him and youll hear no more about it you may be quite sure hell ask for nothing further and that hell never say a word to annoy you hes devilish honourable is val no man can be more so though perhaps you wouldnt think it  devilish honourable said alaric only he would like to have a bribe  a bribe said scott come my dear fellow dont you make an ass of yourself val is like the rest of us when money is going he likes to have a share of it if you come to that every man who is paid either for talking or for not talking is bribed  i dont know that i ever heard of a much clearer case of a bribe than this which you now demand for your brother  bribe or no bribe said undy looking at his watch i strongly advise you to do for him what he asks it will be better for all of us and let me give you another piece of advice never use hard words among friends do you remember the mary janes which manylodes brought for you in his pocket to the hotel at tavistock here alaric turned as pale as a spectre dont talk of bribes my dear fellow we are all of us giving and taking bribes from our cradles to our graves but men of the world generally call them by some prettier names now if you are not desirous to throw your cards up altogether get these shares for val and let him or me have them tomorrow morning and so saying undy disappeared into the house through the side door out of the hall which is appropriated to the use of honourable members  and then alaric was left alone he had never hitherto realized the true facts of the position in which he had placed himself but now he did so he was in the hands of these men these miscreants these devils he was completely at their mercy and he already felt that they were as devoid of mercy as they were of justice a cold sweat broke out all over him and he continued walking up and down the hall ignorant as to where he was and what he was doing almost thoughtless stunned as it were by his misery and the conviction that he was a ruined man he had remained there an hour after undy had left him before he roused himself sufficiently to leave the hall and think of returning home it was then seven oclock and he remembered that he had asked his cousin to dine with him he got into a cab therefore and desired to be driven home  what was he to do on one point he instantly made up his mind he would not give one shilling to captain val he would not advance another shilling to undy and he would at once sell out his own shares and make such immediate restitution as might now be in his power the mention of manylodes and the mining shares had come home to him with frightful reality and nearly stunned him what right indeed had he to talk of bribes with scornhe who so early in his own life had allowed himself to be bought how could he condemn the itching palm of such a one as val scotthe who had been so ready to open his own when he had been tempted by no want by no poverty  he would give nothing to captain val to bribe him to silence he knew that if he did so he would be a slave for ever the appetite of such a shark as that when once he has tasted blood is unappeasable there is nothing so ruinous as buying the silence of a rogue who has a secret  what you buy you never possess and the price that is once paid must be repaid again and again as often as the rogue may demand it any alternative must be better than this  and yet what other alternative was there he did not doubt that val when disappointed of his prey would reveal whatever he might know to his wife or to his stepson then there would be nothing for alaric but confession and ruin and how could he believe what undy scott had told him who else could have given information against him but undy himself who else could have put up so heavily stupid a man as captain scott to make such a demand was it not clear that his own colleague his own partner his own intimate associate undy scott himself was positively working out his ruin where were now his high hopes where now his seat in parliament his authority at the board his proud name his soaring ambition his constant watchword excelsior ah meno no longer excelsior but he thought of the cells of newgate of convict prisons and then of his young wife and of his baby  he made an effort to assume his ordinary demeanour and partially succeeded he went at once up to his drawingroom and there he found charley and gertrude waiting dinner for him luckily he had no other guests  are you ill alaric said gertrude directly she saw him  ill no said he only fagged dearest fagged and worried and badgered and bored but thank god not ill and he endeavoured to put on his usual face and speak in his usual tone i have kept you waiting most unmercifully for your dinner charley but then i know you navvies always lunch on mutton chops  oh i am not particularly in a hurry said charley but i deny the lunch this has been a bad season for mutton chops in the neighbourhood of somerset house somehow they have not grown this year  alaric ran up to prepare for dinner and his wife followed him  oh alaric said she you are so pale what is the matter do tell me and she put her arm through his took hold of his hand and looked up into his face  the matter nothing is the mattera man cant always be grinning and he gently shook her off and walked through their bedroom to his own dressingroom having entered it he shut the door and then sitting down bowed his head upon a small table and buried it in his hands all the world seemed to go round and round with him he was giddy and he felt that he could not stand  gertrude paused a moment in the bedroom to consider and then followed him what is it you want said he as soon as he heard the handle turn do leave me alone for one moment i am fagged with the heat and i want one minutes rest  oh alaric i see you are ill said she for gods sake do not send me from you and coming into the room she knelt down beside his chair i know you are suffering alaric do let me do something for you  he longed to tell her everything he panted to share his sorrows with one other bosom to have one near him to whom he could speak openly of everything to have one counsellor in his trouble in that moment he all but resolved to disclose everything to her but at last he found that he could not do it charley was there waiting for his dinner and were he now to tell his secret to his wife neither of them neither he nor she would be able to act the host or hostess if done at all it could not at any rate be done at the present moment  i am better now said he giving a long and deep sigh and then he threw his arms round his wife and passionately embraced her my own angel my best best love how much too good or much too noble you are for such a husband as i am  i wish i could be good enough for you she replied as she began to arrange his things for dressing you are so tired dearest wash your hands and come downdont trouble yourself to dress this evening unless indeed you are going out again  gertrude said he if there be a soul on earth that has not in it a spark of what is good or generous it is the soul of undy scott and so saying he began the operations of his toilet  now gertrude had never liked undy scott she had attributed to him whatever faults her husband might have as a husband and at the present moment she was not inclined to fight for any of the scott family  he is a very worldly man i think said she  worldlynobut hellish said alaric hellish and damnable and fiendish  oh alaric what has he done  never mind i cannot tell you he has done nothing it is not that he has done anything or can do anything to mebut his heartbut never mindi wishi wish i had never seen him  alaric if it be about money tell me the worst and ill bear it without a murmur as long as you are well i care for nothing elsehave you given up your place  no dearest no i can keep my place it is nothing about that i have lost no money i have rather made money it is the ingratitude of that man which almost kills me but come dearest we will go down to charley and gertrude mind this be quite civil to mrs val at present we will break from the whole set before long but in the meantime i would have you be very civil to mrs val  and so they went down to dinner and alaric after taking a glass of wine played his part almost as though he had no weight upon his soul after dinner he drank freely and as he drank his courage rose why should i tell her he said to himself as he went to bed the chances are that all will yet go well    chapter xxxv  mrs vals new carriage   on the next morning alaric went to his office without speaking further as to the trouble on his mind and endeavoured to comfort himself as best he might as he walked down to his office then he had also to decide whether it would better suit his purpose to sell out at once and pay up every shilling that he could or whether he would hold on and hope that undys predictions would be fulfilled and that the bridge shares would go on rising till they would sell for all that was required of him  unfortunate man what would he have given now to change his position for normans single clerkship or even for charleys comparative poverty  gertrude stayed within all day but not all day in solitude about four in the afternoon the hon mrs val called and with her came her daughter clem now madame jaquêtanàpe and the two misses neverbend m jaquêtanàpe had since his marriage made himself very agreeable to his honourable motherinlaw so much so that he now occupied the place in her good graces which undy had formerly filled and which after undys reign had fallen to alarics lot mrs val liked to have about her some confidential gentleman and as she never thought of placing her confidence in her husband she was prone to select first one man and then another as her taste and interest dictated immediately after their marriage victoire and clem had consented to join housekeeping with their parent nothing could be more pleasant than this their income was unembarrassed and mrs val for the first time in her life was able to set up her carriage among the effects arising from this cause the female neverbends who had lately been worshippers of gertrude veered round in their idolatry and paid their vows before mrs vals new yellow panels in this new carriage now came the four ladies to pay a morning visit to mrs tudor it was wonderful to see into how small dimensions the misses neverbend had contrived to pack not themselves but their crinoline  as has before been hinted gertrude did not love mrs val nor did she love clem the danseuse nor did she specially love the misses neverbend they were all of a class essentially different from that in which she had been brought up and moreover mrs val was not content to allow gertrude into her set without ruling over her or at any rate patronizing her gertrude had borne with them all for her husbands sake and was contented to do so yet for a while longer but she thought in her heart that she would be able to draw some consolation from her husbands misfortune if it should be the means of freeing her from mrs val  oh my dear said mrs val throwing herself down into a sofa as though she were exhaustedwhat a dreadful journey it is to you up here how those poor horses will stand it this weather i dont know but it nearly kills me it does indeed the tudors as has been said lived in one of the quiet streets of westbournia not exactly looking into hyde park but very near to it mrs val on the other hand lived in ebury street pimlico her house was much inferior to that of the tudors it was small ill built and afflicted with all the evils which bad drainage and bad ventilation can produce but then it was reckoned to be within the precincts of belgravia and was only five minutes walk from buckingham palace mrs val therefore had fair ground for twitting her dear friend with living so far away from the limits of fashion you really must come down somewhat nearer to the world indeed you must my dear said the hon mrs val  we are thinking of moving but then we are talking of going to st johns wood or islington said gertrude wickedly  islington said the honourable mrs val nearly fainting  is not islington and st giles the same place asked the innocent clem with some malice however to counterbalance her innocence  o no said lactimel st giles is where the poor wretched starving irish dwell their utter misery in the middle of this rich metropolis is a crying disgrace to the prime minister poor badger how much he has to bear only think continued lactimel with a soft pathetic drawl they have none to feed them none to clothe them none to do for them  it is a great question said ugolina whether promiscuous charity is a blessing or a curse it is probably the greatest question of the age i myself am inclined to think  but ma said madame jaquêtanàpe mrs tudor doesnt really mean that she is going to live at st giles does she  i said islington said gertrude we may go to st giles next perhaps had she known all how dreadful would such jokes have been to her  mrs val saw that she was being quizzed and not liking it changed the conversation ugolina said she might i trouble you to look out of the front window i hope those stupid men of mine are not letting the horses stand still they were so warm coming here that they will be sure to catch cold the stupid men however were round the corner at the publichouse and ugolina could only report that as she did not see them she supposed the horses were walking about  and so said mrs val mr tudor is thinking of resigning his place at the civil service board and standing for that borough of lord gaberlunzies in aberdeenshire  i really cannot say said gertrude but i believe he has some idea of going into parliament i rather believe he will continue to hold his place  oh that i know to be impossible i was told that by a gentleman who has been much longer in the service than mr tudor and who understands all its bearings she here alluded to fidus neverbend  i cannot say said gertrude i do not think mr tudor has quite made up his mind yet  well my dear ill tell you fairly what i think about it you know the regard i have for you and mr tudor he too is clementinas trustee that is to say her fortune is partly consigned to his care so i cannot but have a very great interest about him and be very anxious that he should do well now my dear ill tell you fairly what i think and what all the world is saying he ought not to think of parliament he ought not indeed my dear i speak for your sake and your childs he is not a man of fortune and he ought not to think of parliament he has a very fine situation and he really should be contented  this was intolerable to gertrude she felt that she must put mrs val down and yet she hardly knew how to do it without being absolutely rude whereas her husband had specially begged her to be civil to this woman at present oh said she with a slight smile mr tudor will be able to take care of himself you will find i hope that there is no cause for uneasiness  well i hope not i am sure i hope not said mrs val looking very grave but i tell you fairly that the confidence which we all have in your husband will be much shaken if he does anything rash he should think of this you know he has no private fortune to back him we must remember that  gertrude became very red in the face but she would not trust herself to answer mrs val at the spur of the moment  it makes such a difference when one has got no private fortune said madame jaquêtanàpe the heiress does it not lactimel  oh indeed it does said lactimel i wish every one had a private fortune it would be so nice wouldnt it  there would be very little poetry in the world if you were to banish poverty said ugolina poverty may be called the parent of poetry look at milton how poor he was and homer he begged his bread  but lord byron was not a beggar said clem contemptuously  i do hope mr tudor will think of what he is doing continued mrs val it is certainly most goodnatured and most disinterested of my dear fatherinlaw lord gaberlunzie to place his borough at mr tudors disposal it is just like him dear good old nobleman but my dear it will be a thousand pities if mr tudor should be led on by his lordships kindness to bring about his own ruin  mrs val had once in her life seen his goodnatured lordship soon after her marriage she had insisted on captain val taking her down to the family mansion she stayed there one night and then left it and since that had shown no further desire to visit cauldkail castle she did not the less delight to talk about her dear good fatherinlaw the lord why should she give his son val board and lodging but that she might be enabled to do so she was not the woman to buy an article and not make of it all the use of which it might be capable  pray do not concern yourself said gertrude i can assure you mr tudor will manage very well for himselfbut should any misfortune happen to him he will not you may be certain attribute it to lord gaberlunzie  i am told that sir gregory is most opposed to it continued mrs val i heard that from mr neverbend who is altogether in sir gregorys confidencedid not you my dears and she turned round to the sisters of fidus for confirmation  i heard my brother say that as mr tudors office is not parliamentary but permanent and as he has to attend from ten till four  alaric has not to attend from ten till four said gertrude who could not endure the idea that her husband should be ranked with common clerks like fidus neverbend  oh i didnt know said lactimel meekly perhaps fidus only meant that as it is one of those offices where the people have something to do the commissioners couldnt be in their offices and in parliament at the same time  i did understand said ugolina that sir gregory hardlines had put his veto upon it but i must confess that it is a subject which i have not sufficiently studied to enable me  its £1200 a year isnt it asked the bride  twelve hundred pounds a year said her mothera very serious consideration when there is no private fortune to back it on either side now if it were victoire  he couldnt sit in parliament ma because hes an alienonly for that i shouldnt think of his doing anything else  perhaps that may be altered before long said lactimel graciously  if jews are to be admitted said ugolina who certainly belong to an alien nation a nation expressly set apart and separated from all peoplea peculiar nation distinct from all others i for one cannot discern  what ugolina could or could not discern about the jews was communicated perhaps to madame jaquêtanàpe or to lactimel but not to gertrude or to mrs val for the latter taking gertrude apart into a corner as it were of the sofa began confidentially to repeat to her her fears about her husband  i see my dear said she that you dont like my speaking about it  upon my word said gertrude i am very indifferent about it but would it not be better if you said what you have to say to my husband  i intend to do so i intend to do that also but i know that a wife ought to have influence over her husband and i believe that you have influence over yours  not the least said gertrude who was determined to contradict mrs val in everything  i am sorry to hear it said mrs val who among all her excellent acquirements did not possess that specially excellent one of understanding repartee i am very sorry to hear it and i shall certainly speak to him the more seriously on that account i think i have some influence over him at any rate i ought to have  i dare say you have said gertrude alaric always says that no experience is worth anything that is not obtained by years  mrs val at least understood this and continued her lecture with some additional severity well my dear i am glad he has so much wisdom but what i was going to say is this you know how much we have at stake with mr tudorwhat a very large sum of clementinas money lies in his hands now i really should not have consented to the arrangement had i thought it possible that mr tudor would have given up his income with the idea of going into parliament it wouldnt have been right or prudent of me to do so i have the greatest opinion of your husbands talents and judgement or i should not of course have entrusted him with the management of clementinas fortune but i really shall think it right to make some change if this project of his goes on  why what is it you suspect said gertrude do you think that mr tudor intends to use your daughters income if he loses a portion of his own i never heard such a thing in my life  hush my deargentlyi would not for worlds let clementina hear a word of this it might disturb her young happiness she is so charmed with her husband her married life is so fortunate victoire is sososo everything that we all wish that i would not for the world breathe in her hearing a shadow of a suspicion  good gracious mrs scott what do you mean suspicionwhat suspicion do you suspect my husband of robbing you oh gertrude poor gertrude she was doomed to know it all before long  oh dear no said mrs val nothing of the kind i assure you of course we suspect nothing of the sort but one does like to have ones money in safe hands of course mr tudor wouldnt have been chosen as trustee if he hadnt had a good income of his own and look here my dearand mrs val whispered very confidentially mr tudor we all know is greatly concerned in this bridge that the committee is sitting about and he and my brotherinlaw undecimus are always dealing in shares gentlemen do i know and therefore i dont say that there is anything against it but considering all i hope mr tudor wont take it ill if we propose to change our trustee  i am very certain he will not said gertrude it is a laborious business and he will be glad enough to be rid of it when he was asked to accept it he thought it would be illnatured to refuse i am certain however he will be very glad to give up the work to any other person who may be appointed i will be sure to tell him this evening what you have said  you need not trouble yourself to do that said mrs val i shall see him myself before long  it will be no trouble said gertrude very indignantly for she was very angry and had as she thought great cause for anger i shall certainly think it my duty to do so after what has passed of course you will now take steps to relieve him as soon as possible  you have taken me up a great deal too quick my dear said mrs val i did not intend  ohone cant be too quick on such a matter as this said gertrude when confidence is once lost between two persons it is better that the connexion which has grown out of confidence should be put an end to as soon as possible  lost confidence i said nothing about lost confidence  alaric will so understand it i am quite sure at any rate i will tell him what you have said suspicion indeed who has dared to suspect him of anything not honest or upright  gertrudes eyes flashed with anger as she vindicated her absent lord mrs val had been speaking with bated breath so that no one had heard her but she to whom she was speaking but gertrude had been unable so to confine her answers and as she made her last reply madame jaquêtanàpe and the misses neverbend were all ears  ha ha ha laughed mrs val upon my word my dear it is amusing to hear you take it up however i assure you i meant nothing but what was kind and friendly come clementina we have been sitting here a most unconscionable time will you allow me my dear to ring for my carriage  mamma said clem have you asked mrs tudor to our little dance  no my dear i have left that for you to do its your party you knowbut i sincerely hope mrs tudor will come  oh yes said clementina the tongue of whose eloquence was now loosened you must come mrs tudor indeed you must it will be so charming just a few nice people you know and nothing more  thank you said gertrude but i never dance now she had inwardly resolved that nothing should ever induce her again to enter mrs vals house  oh but you must come said clementina it will be so charming we only mean to dance one kind of dancethat new thing they have just brought over from spainthe contrabandista it is a polka step only very quick and you take every other turn by yourself so you have to take your partner up and let him go as quick as possible you dont know how charming it is and it will be all the rage we are to have the music out in the street just as they have in spain  it would be much too difficult for me said gertrude  it is difficult said the enthusiastic clem but victoire gives us lessons in it everyday from twelve to twodoesnt he ugolina  im afraid i shouldnt have time to go to school said gertrude  oh it doesnt take much timesix or seven or eight lessons will do it pretty well i have almost learnt it already and ugolina is coming on very fast lactimel is not quite so perfect she has learnt the step but she cannot bring herself to let victoire go quick enough do come and bring mr tudor with you  as he has not to attend from ten till four he could come and take lessons too said lactimel who now that she was no longer a hangeron of gertrudes could afford to have her little revenge  that would be delightful said clem mr charles tudor does come in sometimes at twelve oclock and i think he does it almost as well as victoire  gertrude however would go neither to the rehearsals nor to the finished performance and as mrs vals men had by this time been induced to leave the beershop the whole party went away leaving gertrude to her meditations    chapter xxxvi  ticklish stock   alaric returned from his office worn and almost as wretched as he had been on the day before he had spent a miserable day in the morning sir gregory had asked him whether he had finally made up his mind to address the electors of strathbogy no not finally said alaric but i think i shall do so  then i must tell you tudor said sir gregory speaking more in sorrow than in anger that you will not have my countenance i cannot but think also that you are behaving with ingratitude alaric prepared to make some petulant answer but sir gregory in the meantime left the room  every one was falling away from him he felt inclined to rush after sir gregory and promise to be guided in this matter solely by him but his pride prevented him though he was no longer sanguine and confident as he had been a week ago still his ambition was high those who play brag must brag it out or they will lose their money this had been said by undy but it was not the less true on that account alaric felt that he was playing brag and that his only game was to brag it out  he walked home slowly through the parks his office and house were so circumstanced that though they were some two miles distant he could walk from one to the other almost without taking his feet off the grass this had been the cause of great enjoyment to him but now he sauntered on with his hands behind his back staring straight before him with fixed eyes going by his accustomed route but never thinking for a moment where he was the tune was gone when he could watch the gambols of children smile at the courtships of nurserymaids watch the changes in the dark foliage of the trees and bend from his direct path hither and thither to catch the effects of distant buildings and make for his eye halfrural landscapes in the middle of the metropolis no landscapes had beauty for him now the gambols even of his own baby were unattractive to him leaves might bud forth and nourish and fall without his notice how went the sharemarket that was the only question that had an interest for him the dallyings of capel court were the only courtships that he now cared to watch  and with what a terribly eager eye had he now to watch them if his shares went up quickly at once with an unprecedented success he might possibly be saved that was all but if they did not such was the phase of life under which at the present moment it behoved him to exist  and then when he reached his home how was he welcomed with all the fond love which a loving wife can show so much at least was his but before he had felt the sweetness of her caresses before he had acknowledged how great was the treasure that he possessed forth from her eager lips had come the whole tale of mrs vals impertinence  i will never see her again alaric never she talked of her daughters money and said something of suspicion suspicion gertrudes eye again flashed fire with anger and she all but stamped with her little foot upon the ground suspicion suspect him her husband the choice of her heart her alaric the human god whom she worshipped suspect him of robbery her lord her heart her soul the strong staff on which she leaned so securely with such true feminine confidence suspect him of common vile dishonestyyou will never ask me to see her again will you alaric  what was he to say to her how was he to bear this his heart yearned to tell her all he longed for the luxury of having one bosom to whom he could entrust his misery his slight remaining hope but how could he himself at one blow by one word destroy the high and polished shaft on which she whom he loved had placed him he could not do it he would suffer by himself hope by himself cease to hope by himself and endure all till either his sufferings or his hopes should be over  he had to pretend that he was indignant at mrs vals interference he had to counterfeit the feelings of outraged honour which was so natural to gertrude this he failed to do well had he been truly honesthad that womans suspicion really done him injusticehe would have received his wifes tidings with grave displeasure and have simply resolved to acquit himself as soon as possible of the disagreeable trust which had been reposed in him but such was not now his conduct he contented himself by calling mrs val names and pretended to laugh at her displeasure  but you will give up this trust wont you said gertrude  i will think about it said he before i do anything i must consult old figgs things of that kind cant be put out of their course by the spleen of an old woman like mrs val  oh alaric i do so wish you had had nothing to do with these scotts  so do i said he bitterly i hate thembut gertrude dont talk about them now my head aches and i am tired  he sat at home the whole evening and though he was by no means gay and hardly affectionate in his demeanour to her yet she could not but feel that some good effect had sprung from his recent dislike to the scotts since it kept him at home with her lately he had generally spent his evenings at his club she longed to speak to him of his future career of his proposed seat in parliament of his officework but he gave her no encouragement to speak of such things and as he pleaded that he was ill she left him in quiet on the sofa  on the next morning he again went to his office and in the course of the morning a note was brought to him from undy it ran as follows  my dear tudor  is val to have the shares let me have a line by the bearer  yours ever  u s  to this he replied by making an appointment to meet undy before dinner at his own office  at the time fixed undy came and was shown by the sole remaining messenger into alarics private room the two shook hands together in their accustomed way undy smiled goodhumouredly as he always did and alaric maintained his usual composed and uncommunicative look  well said undy sitting down how about those shares  i am glad you have come said alaric because i want to speak to you with some earnestness  i am quite in earnest myself said undy and so by g is val i never saw a fellow more in earnestnor yet apparently more hard up i hope you have the shares ready or else a cheque for the amount  look here undy if my doing this were the only means of saving both you and me from rotting in gaol by the creator that made me i would not do it  i dont know that it will have much effect upon me one way or the other said undy coolly but it seems to me to be the only way that can save yourself from some such fate shall i tell you what the clauses are of this new bill about trust property  i know the clauses well enough i know my own position and i know yours also  d your impudence said undy how do you dare to league me with your villany have i been the girls trustee have i drawn or could i have drawn a shilling of her money i tell you tudor you are in the wrong box you have one way of escape and one only i dont want to ruin you ill save you if i can i think you have treated the girl in a most shameful way nevertheless ill save you if i can but mark this if this money be not at once produced i cannot save you  alaric felt that he was covered with cold perspiration his courage did not fail him he would willingly have taken undy by the throat could his doing so have done himself or his cause any good but he felt that he was nearly overset by the cool deep villany of his companion  i have treated the girl badlyvery badly he said after a pause whether or no you have done so too i leave to your own conscience if you have a conscience i do not now mean to accuse you but you may know this for certainmy present anxiety is to restore to her that which i have taken from her and for no earthly considerationnot to save my own wifewill i increase the deficiency  why man what nonsense you talkas if i did not know all the time that you have your pocket full of these shares  whatever i have i hold for her if i could succeed in getting out of your hands enough to make up the full sum that i owe her  you will succeed in getting nothing from me when i borrowed £5000 from you it was not understood that i was to be called upon for the money in three or four months time  now look here scott you have threatened me with ruin and a prison and i will not say but your threats may possibly prove true it may be that i am ruined but if i fall you shall share my fall  thats false said undy i am free to hold my head before the world which you are not i have done nothing to bring me to shame  nothing to bring you to shame and yet you would now have me give you a further portion of this girls money  nothing i care nothing about the girls money i have not touched it nor do i want to touch it i bring you a message from my brother you have ample means of your own to comply with his request  then tell your brother said alaric now losing all control over his tempertell your brother if indeed he have any part in this villanytell your brother that if it were to save me from the gallows he should not have a shilling i have done very badly in this matter i have acted shamefully and i am ashamed but  oh i want to hear none of your rhapsodies said undy if you will not now do what i ask you i may as well go and you may take the consequences and he lifted his hat as though preparing to take his leave  but you shall hear me said alaric rising quickly from his seat and standing between undy and the door undy very coolly walked to the bell and rang it i have much to answer for continued alaric but i would not have your sin on my soul i would not be as black as you are though by being so i could save myself with certainty from all earthly punishment  as he finished the messenger opened the door show mr scott out said alaric  by by said undy you will probably hear from mrs val and her daughter tomorrow and so saying he walked jauntily along the passage and went jauntily to his dinner at his club it was part of his philosophy that nothing should disturb the even tenor of his way or interfere with his animal comforts he was at the present moment over head and ears in debt he was playing a game which in all human probability would end in his ruin the ground was sinking beneath his feet on every side and yet he thoroughly enjoyed his dinner alaric could not make such use of his philosophy undy scott might be the worse man of the two but he was the better philosopher  not on the next day or on the next did alaric hear from mrs val but on the following monday he got a note from her begging him to call in ebury street she underscored every line of it once or twice and added in a postscript that he would she was sure at once acknowledge the necessity of her request as she wished to communicate with him on the subject of her daughters fortune  alaric immediately sent an answer to her by a messenger my dear mrs scott said he i am very sorry that an engagement prevents my going to you this evening but as i judge by your letter and by what i have heard from gertrude that you are anxious about this trust arrangement i will call at ten tomorrow morning on my way to the office  having written and dispatched this he sat for an hour leaning with his elbows on the table and his hands clasped looking with apparent earnestness at the rows of books which stood inverted before him trying to make up his mind as to what step he should now take  not that he sat an hour undisturbed every five minutes some one would come knocking at the door the name of some aspirant to the civil service would be brought to him or the card of some influential gentleman desirous of having a little job perpetrated in favour of his own peculiarly interesting but perhaps not very highlyeducated young candidate but on this morning alaric would see no one to every such intruder he sent a reply that he was too deeply engaged at the present moment to see any one after one he would be at liberty c c  and so he sat and looked at the books but he could in nowise make up his mind he could in nowise bring himself even to try to make up his mindthat is to make any true effort towards doing so his thoughts would run off from him not into the happy outer world but into a multitude of noisy unpleasant paths all intimately connected with his present misery but none of which led him at all towards the conclusions at which he would fain arrive he kept on reflecting what sir gregory would think when he heard of it what all those clerks would say at the weights and measures among whom he had held his head so high what shouts there would be among the navvies and other low pariahs of the service how harry norman would exultbut he did not yet know harry normanhow the woodwards would weep how gertrudeand then as he thought of that he bowed his head for he could no longer endure the open light of day at one oclock he was no nearer to any decision than he had been when he reached his office  at three he put himself into a cab and was taken to the city oh the city the weary city where men go daily to look for money but find none where every heart is eaten up by an accursed famishing after gold where dark gloomy banks come thick on each other like the black ugly apertures to the realms below in a mining district each of them a separate little pitmouth into hell alaric went into the city and found that the shares were still rising that imperturbable witness was still in the chair at the committee and men said that he was disgusting the members by the impregnable endurance of his hostility a man who could answer 2250 questions without admitting anything must be a liar such a one could convince no one and so the shares went on rising rising and rising and messrs blocks piles and cofferdam were buying up every share either doing that openlyor else selling on the sly  alaric found that he could at once realize £7600 were he to do this there would be at any rate seveneighths of his wards fortune secure  might he not in such a case calculate that even mrs vals heart would be softened and that time would be allowed him to make up the small remainder oh but in such case he must tell mrs val and could he calculate on her forbearance might he not calculate with much more certainty on her love of triumphing would he not be her slave if she had the keeping of his secret and why should he run so terrible a risk of destroying himself why should he confide in mrs val and deprive himself of the power of ever holding up his head again when possibly he might still run out his course with full sails and bring his vessel into port giving no knowledge to the world of the perilous state in which she had been thus ploughing the deep he need not at any rate tell everything to mrs val at his coming visit on the morrow  he consulted his broker with his easiest air of common concern as to his money and the broker gave him a dubious opinion they may go a little higher sir indeed i think they will but they are ticklish stock siruncommon ticklish i should not like to hold many myself sir alaric knew that the man was right they were ticklish stock but nevertheless he made up his mind to hold on a little longer  he then got into another cab and went back to his office and as he went he began to bethink himself to whom of all his friends he might apply for such a loan as would enable him to make up this sum of money if he sold his shares on the morrow captain cuttwater was good for £1000 but he knew that he could not get more from him it would be bad borrowing he thought from sir gregory intimate as he had been with that great man he knew nothing of his money concerns but he had always heard that sir gregory was a close man sir warwick his other colleague was in easy circumstances but then he had never been intimate with sir warwick normanah if he had known norman now norman would have pulled him through but hope in that quarter there was of course none norman was gone and normans place had been filled by undy scott what could be done with undy scott he had already tried fidus neverbend he had a little money saved but fidus was not the man to do anything without security he he alaric tudor he whose credit had stood did stand so high did not know where to borrow how to raise a thousand pounds and yet he felt that had he not wanted it so sorely he could have gotten it easily  he was in a bad state for work when he got back to the office on that day he was flurried ill at ease wretched all but distracted nevertheless he went rigidly to it and remained there till late in the evening he was a man generally blessed with excellent health but now he suddenly found himself ill and all but unable to accomplish the task which he had prescribed to himself his head was heavy and his eyes weak and he could not bring himself to think of the papers which lay before him  then at last he went home and had another sad and solitary walk across the parks during which he vainly tried to rally himself again and collect his energies for the work which he had to do it was in such emergencies as this that he knew that it most behoved a man to fall back upon what manliness there might be within him now was the time for him to be true to himself he had often felt proud of his own energy of purpose and now was the opportunity for him to use such energy if his pride in this respect had not been all in vain  such were the lessons with which he endeavoured to strengthen himself but it was in vain he could not feel courageoushe could not feel hopefulhe could not do other than despair when he got home he again prostrated himself again declared himself ill again buried his face in his hands and answered the affection of his wife by saying that a man could not always be cheerful could not always laugh gertrude though she was very far indeed from guessing the truth felt that something extraordinary was the matter and knew that her husbands uneasiness was connected with the scotts  he came down to dinner and though he ate but little he drank glass after glass of sherry he thus gave himself courage to go out in the evening and face the world at his club he found undy there as he expected but he had no conversation with him though they did not absolutely cut each other alaric fancied that men stared at him and sat apart by himself afraid to stand up among talking circles or to put himself forward as it was his wont to do he himself avoided other men and then felt that others were avoiding him he took up one evening paper after another pretending to read them but hardly noticing a word that came beneath his eye at last however a name struck him which riveted his attention and he read the following paragraph which was among many others containing information as to the coming elections  strathbogywe hear that lord gaberlunzies eldest son will retire from this borough and that his place will be filled by his brother the honourable captain valentine scott the family have been so long connected with strathbogy by ties of friendship and near neighbourhood and the mutual alliance has been so much to the taste of both parties that no severance need be anticipated  alarics first emotion was one of anger at the whole scott tribe and his first resolve was to go down to strathbogy and beat that inanimate fool captain val on his own ground but he was not long in reflecting that under his present circumstances it would be madness in him to bring his name prominently forward in any quarrel with the scott family this disappointment he might at any rate bear it would be well for him if this were all he put the paper down with an affected air of easy composure and walked home through the glaring gaslights still trying to thinkstill trying but in vain to come to some definite resolve  and then on the following morning he went off to call on mrs val he had as yet told gertrude nothing when she asked him what made him start so early he merely replied that he had business to do on his road as lie went he had considerable doubt whether or no it would be better for him to break his word to mrs val and not go near her at all in such event he might be sure that she would at once go to work and do her worst but nevertheless he would gain a day or probably two and one or two days might do all that he required whereas he could not see mrs val without giving her some explanation which if false would be discovered to be false and if true would be selfcondemnatory he again however failed to decide and at last knocked at mrs vals door merely because he found himself there  he was shown up into the drawingroom and found of course mrs val seated on a sofa and he also found which was not at all of course captain val on a chair on one side of the table and m victoire jaquêtanàpe on the other mrs val shook hands with him much in her usual way but still with an air of importance in her face the frenchman was delighted to see m tudere and the honourable val got up from his chair said how do and then sat down again  i requested you to call mr tudor said mrs val opening her tale in a most ceremonious manner because we all think it necessary to know somewhat more than has yet been told to us of the manner in which my daughters money has been invested  captain val wiped his moustache with the middle finger of his right hand by way of saying that he quite assented to his wifes proposition and victoire remarked that madame was a leetle anxious just a leetle anxious not that anything could be wrong with m tudere but because she was one excellent mamma  i thought you knew mrs scott said alaric that your daughters money is in the funds  then i may understand clearly that none of the amount so invested has been sold out or otherwise appropriated by you said mrs val  will you allow me to inquire what has given rise to these questions just at the present moment asked alaric  yes certainly said mrs val rumours have reached my husbandrumours which i am happy to say i do not believethat my daughters money has been used for purposes of speculation whereupon captain val again wiped his upper lip but did not find it necessary to speak  may i venture to ask captain scott from what source such rumours have reached him  ahhawhat source d lies very likely d lies i dare say but people do talkehyou know so much the eloquent embryo member for strathbogy vouchsafed   and therefore mr tudor you mustnt be surprised that we should ask you this question  it is one simple simple question said victoire and if m tudere will say that it is all right i for myself will be satisfied the amiable victoire to tell the truth was still quite satisfied to leave his wifes income in alarics hands and would not have been at all satisfied to remove it to the hands of his respected steppapainlaw or even his admired mammainlaw  when i undertook this trust said alaric which i did with considerable hesitation i certainly did not expect to be subjected to any such crossexamination as this i consider such questions as insults and therefore i shall refuse to answer them you mrs scott have of course a right to look after your daughters interests as has m jaquêtanàpe to look after those of his wife but i will not acknowledge that captain scott has any such right whatsoever nor can i think that his conduct in this matter is disinterested and as he spoke he looked at captain val but he might just as well have looked at the door captain val only wiped his moustache with his finger once more my answer to your inquiries mrs scott is thisi shall not condescend to go into any details as to madame jaquêtanàpe s fortune with anyone but my cotrustee i shall however on saturday next be ready to give up my trust to any other person who may be legally appointed to receive it and will then produce all the property that has been entrusted to my keeping and so saying alaric got up and took his hat as though to depart  and do you mean to say mr tudor that you will not answer my question said mrs scott  i mean to say most positively that i will answer no questions said alaric  oh confound not do at all d said the captain the girls money all gone and you wont answer questions  no shouted alaric walking across the room till he closely confronted the captain nonoi will answer no questions that may be asked in your hearing but that your wifes presence protects you i would kick you down your own stairs before me  captain val retreated a stephe could retreat no moreand wiped his moustache with both hands at once mrs val screamed victoire took hold of the back of a chair as though he thought it well that he should be armed in the general battle that was to ensue and alaric without further speech walked out of the room and went away to his office  so you have given up strathbogy said sir gregory to him in the course of the day  i think i have said alaric considering all things i believe it will be the best for me to do so  not a doubt of it said sir gregorynot a doubt of it my dear fellow and then sir gregory began to evince by the cordiality of his official confidence that he had fully taken alaric back into his good graces it was nothing to him that strathbogy had given up alaric instead of alaric giving up strathbogy he was sufficiently pleased at knowing that the danger of his being supplanted by his own junior was over  and then alaric again went into the weary city again made inquiries about his shares and again returned to his office and thence to his home  but on his return to his office he found lying on his table a note in undys handwriting but not signed in which he was informed that things would yet be well if the required shares should be forthcoming on the following day  he crumpled the note tight in his hand and was about to fling it among the waste paper but in a moment he thought better of it and smoothing the paper straight he folded it and laid it carefully on his desk  that day on his visit into the city he had found that the bridge shares had fallen to less than the value of their original purchasemoney and that evening he told gertrude everything the author does not dare to describe the telling    chapter xxxvii  tribulation   we must now return for a short while to surbiton cottage it was not so gay a place as it once had been merry laughter was not so often heard among the shrubbery walks nor was a boat to be seen so often glancing in and out between the lawn and the adjacent island the cottage had become a demure staid abode of which captain cuttwater was in general the most vivacious inmate and yet there was soon to be marrying and giving in marriage  lindas weddingday had twice been fixed that firstnamed had been postponed in consequence of the serious illness of normans elder brother the life of that brother had been very different in its course from harrys it had been dissipated at college in riotous living and had since been stained with debauchery during the career of his early manhood in london the consequence had been that his health had been broken down and he was now tottering to an early grave  cuthbert norman was found to be so ill when the day first named for lindas marriage approached that it had been thought absolutely necessary to postpone the ceremony what amount of consolation mrs woodward might have received from the knowledge that her daughter by this young mans decease would become mrs norman of normansgrove we need not inquire but such consolation if it existed at all did not tend to dispel the feeling of sombre disappointment which such delay was sure to produce the heir however rallied and another day early in august was fixed  katie the while was still an invalid and as such puzzled all the experience of that very experienced medical gentleman who has the best aristocratic practice in the neighbourhood of hampton court he and the london physician agreed that her lungs were not affected but yet she would not get well the colour would not come to her cheeks the flesh would not return to her arms nor the spirit of olden days shine forth in her eyes she did not keep her bed or confine herself to her room but she went about the house with a slow noiseless gentle tread so unlike the step of that katie whom we once knew  but that which was a mystery to the experienced medical gentleman was no mystery to her mother mrs woodward well knew why her child was no longer rosy plump and débonnaire as she watched her katie move about so softly as she saw her constant attempt to smile whenever her mothers eye was on her that mothers heart almost gave way she almost brought herself to own that she would rather see her darling the wife of an idle ruined spendthrift than watch her thus drifting away to an early grave these days were by no means happy days for mrs woodward  when that july day was fixed for lindas marriage certain invitations were sent out to bid the family friends to the wedding these calls were not so numerous as they had been when gertrude became a bride no sir gregory was to come down from town no gallant speechmakers from london clubs were to be gathered there to wake the echoes of the opposite shore with matrimonial wit mrs woodward could not bear that her daughter should be married altogether as it were in the dark but for many considerations the guests were to be restricted in numbers and the mirth was to be restrained and quiet  when the list was made out katie saw it and saw that charleys name was not there  mamma she said touching her mothers arm in her sweet winning way may not charley come to lindas wedding you know how fond harry is of him would not harry wish that he should be here  mrs woodwards eyes immediately filled with tears and she looked at her daughter not knowing how to answer her she had never spoken to katie of her love no word had ever passed between them on the subject which was now always nearest to the hearts of them both mrs woodward had much in her character as a mother that was excellent nay all but perfect but she could not bring herself to question her own children as to the inward secrets of their bosoms she knew not at once how to answer katies question and so she looked up at her with wistful eyes laden with tears  you may do so mamma said katie katie was already a braver woman than her mother i think harry would like it and poor charley will feel hurt at being left out you may do it mamma if you like it will not do any harm  mrs woodward quite understood the nature of the promise conveyed in her daughters assurance and replied that charley should be asked he was asked and promised of course to come but when the wedding was postponed when the other guests were put off he also was informed that his attendance at hampton was not immediately required and so he still remained a stranger to the cottage  and then after a while another day was named the guests and charley with them were again invited and norman was again assured that he should be made happy but alas his hopes were again delusive news arrived at surbiton cottage which made it indispensable that the marriage should be again postponed news worse than any which had ever yet been received there news which stunned them all and made it clear to them that this year was no time for marrying alaric had been arrested alaric their own gertrudes own husband their soninlaw and brotherinlaw the proud the high the successful the towering man of the world alaric had been arrested and was to be tried for embezzling the money of his ward  these fatal tidings were brought to hampton by harry norman himself how they were received we must now endeavour to tell  but that it would be tedious we might describe the amazement with which that news was received at the weights and measures though the great men at the weights were jealous of alaric they were not the less proud of him they had watched him rise with a certain amount of displeasure and yet they had no inconsiderable gratification in boasting that two of the magi the two working magi of the civil service had been produced by their own establishment when therefore tidings reached them that tudor had been summoned in a friendly way to bow street that he had there passed a whole morning and that the inquiry had ended in his temporary suspension from his official duties and in his having to provide two bailsmen each for £1000 as security that he would on a certain day be forthcoming to stand his trial at the old bailey for defrauding his wardwhen i say these tidings were carried from room to room at the weights and measures the feelings of surprise were equalled by those of shame and disappointment  no one knew who brought this news to the weights and measures no one ever does know how such tidings fly one of the junior clerks had heard it from a messenger to whom it had been told downstairs then another messenger who had been across to the treasury chambers with an immediate report as to a projected change in the size of the authorized butterfirkin heard the same thing and so the news by degrees was confirmed  but all this was not sufficient for norman as soon as the rumour reached him he went off to bow street and there learnt the actual truth as it has been above stated alaric was then there and the magistrates had decided on requiring bail he had in fact been committed  it would be dreadful that the woodwards should first hear all this from the lips of a stranger and this reflection induced norman at once to go to hampton but it was dreadful also to find himself burdened with the task of first telling such tidings when he found himself knocking at the cottage door he was still doubtful how he might best go through the work he had before him  he found that he had a partial reprieve but then it was so partial that it would have been much better for him to have had no such reprieve at all mrs woodward was at sunbury with linda and no one was at home but katie what was he to do was he to tell katie or was he to pretend that all was right that no special business had brought him unexpectedly to hampton  oh harry linda will be so unhappy said katie as soon as she saw him they have gone to dine at sunbury and they wont be home till ten or eleven uncle bat dined early with me and he has gone to hampton court linda will be so unhappy but good gracious harry is there anything the matter  mrs woodward has not heard from gertrude today has she  nonot a wordgertrude is not ill is she oh do tell me said katie who now knew that there was some misfortune to be told  no gertrude is not ill  is alaric ill then is there anything the matter with alaric  he is not ill said norman but he is in some trouble i came down as i thought your mother should be told  so much he said but would say no more in this he probably took the most unwise course that was open to him he might have held his tongue altogether and let katie believe that love alone had brought him down as it had done so often before or he might have told her all feeling sure that all must be told her before long but he did neither he left her in suspense and the consequence was that before her mothers return she was very ill  it was past eleven before the fly was heard in which linda and her mother returned home katie had then gone upstairs but not to bed she had seated herself in the armchair in her mothers dressingroom and sitting there waited till she should be told by her mother what had occurred when the sound of the wheels caught her ears she came to the door of the room and held it in her hand that she might learn what passed she heard lindas sudden and affectionate greeting she heard mrs woodwards expression of gratified surprise and then she heard also normans solemn tone by which as was too clear all joy all gratification was at once suppressed then she heard the diningroom door close and she knew that he was telling his tale to linda and her mother  o the misery of that next hour for an hour they remained there talking and katie knew nothing of what they were talking she knew only that norman had brought unhappiness to them all a dozen different ideas passed across her mind first she thought that alaric was dismissed then that he was dead was it not possible that harry had named alarics name to deceive her might not this misfortune whatever it was be with charley might not he be dead oh better so than the other she knew and said as much to herself over and over again but she did not the less feel that his death must involve her own also  at last the diningroom door opened and she heard her mothers step on the stairs her heart beat so that she could hardly support herself she did not get up but sat quite quiet waiting for the tidings which she knew that she should now hear her mothers face when she entered the room nearly drove her to despair mrs woodward had been crying bitterly violently convulsively crying and when one has reached the age of forty the traces of such tears are not easily effaced even from a womans cheek  mamma mamma what is it pray pray tell me oh mamma what is it said katie jumping up and rushing into her mothers arms  oh katie said mrs woodward why are you not in bed oh my darling i wish you were in bed i do so wish you were in bedmy child my child and seating herself in the nearest chair mrs woodward again gave herself up to uncontrolled weeping  then linda came up with the copious tears still streaming down her face she made no effort to control them at her age tears are the easiest resource in time of grief norman had kept her back a moment to whisper one word of love and she then followed her mother into the room  katie was now kneeling at her mothers feet linda she said with more quietness than either of the others was able to assume what has happened what makes mamma so unhappy has anything happened to alaric but linda was in no state to tell anything  do tell me mamma said katie do tell me all at once has anythinganything happened toto charley  oh it is worse than that a thousand times worse than that said mrs woodward who in the agony of her own grief became for the instant ungenerous  katies blood rushed back to her heart and for a moment her own hand relaxed the hold which she had on that of her mother she had never spoken of her love for her mothers sake she had been silent for her mothers sake she had determined to suffer and be silentnow and ever well she would bear this also it was but for a moment she relaxed her hold and then again she tightened her fingers round her mothers hand and held it in a firmer grasp it is alaric then she said  god forgive me said mrs woodward speaking through her sobsgod forgive me i am a brokenhearted woman and say i know not what my katie my darling my best of darlingswill you forgive me  oh mamma said katie kissing her mothers hands and her arms and the very hem of her garment oh mamma do not speak so but i wish i knew what this sorrow is so that i might share it with you may i not be told mamma is it about alaric  yes katie alaric is in trouble  what troubleis he ill  nohe is not ill it is about money  has he been arrested asked katie thinking of charleys misfortune could not harry get him out harry is so good he would do anything even for alaric when he is in trouble  he will do everything for him that he can said linda through her tears  he has not been arrested said mrs woodward he is still at home but he is in trouble about miss golightlys moneyandand he is to be tried  tried said katie tried like a criminal  katie might well express herself as horrified yes he had to be tried like a criminal tried as pickpockets housebreakers and shoplifters are tried and for a somewhat similar offence with this difference however that pickpockets housebreakers and shoplifters are seldom educated men and are in general led on to crime by want he was to be tried for the offence of making away with some of miss golightlys money for his own purposes this was explained to katie with more or less perspicuity and then gertrudes mother and sisters lifted up their voices together and wept  he might it is true be acquitted they would none of them believe him to be guilty though they all agreed that he had probably been imprudent but then the public shame of the trial the disgrace which must follow such an accusation what a downfall was here oh gertrude oh gertrude sobbed mrs woodward and indeed at that time it did not fare well with gertrude  it was very late before mrs woodward and her daughters went to bed that night and then katie though she did not specially complain was very ill she had lately received more than one wound which was still unhealed and now this additional blow though she apparently bore it better than the others altogether upset her when the morning came she complained of headache and it was many days after that before she left her bed  but mrs woodward was up early indeed she could hardly be said to have been in bed at all for though she had lain down for an hour or two she had not slept early in the morning she knocked at harrys door and begged him to come out to her he was not long in obeying her summons and soon joined her in the little breakfast parlour  harry said she you must go and see alaric  harrys brow grew black on the previous evening he had spoken of alaric without bitterness nay almost with affection of gertrude he had spoken with the truest brotherly love he had assured mrs woodward that he would do all that was in his power for them that he would spare neither his exertions nor his purse he had a truer idea than she had of what might probably be the facts of the case and was prepared by all the means at his disposal to help his sisterinlaw if such aid would help her but he had not thought of seeing alaric  i do not think it would do any good said he  yes harry it will it will do the greatest good whom else can i get to see him who else can find out and let us know what really is required of us what we ought to do i would do it myself but i could not understand it and he would never trust us sufficiently to tell me all the truth  we will make charley go to him he will tell everything to charley if he will to anyone  we cannot trust charley he is so thoughtless so imprudent besides harry i cannot tell everything to charley as i can to you if there be any deficiency in this womans fortune of course it must be made good and in that case i must raise the money i could not arrange all this with charley  there cannot i think be very much wanting said norman who had hardly yet realized the idea that alaric had actually used his wards money for his own purposes he has probably made some bad investment or trusted persons that he should not have trusted my small property is in the funds and i can get the amount at a moments notice i do not think there will be any necessity to raise more money than that at any rate whatever happens you must not touch your own income think of katie  but harrydear good generous harryyou are so good so generous but harry we need not talk of that now you will see him though wont you  it will do no good said harry we have no mutual trust in each other  do not be unforgiving harry now that he requires forgiveness  if he does require forgiveness mrs woodward if it shall turn out that he has been guilty god knows that i will forgive him i trust this may not be the case and it would be useless for me to thrust myself upon him now when a few days may replace us again in our present relations to each other  i dont understand you harry why should there always be a quarrel between two brothers between the husbands of two sisters i know you mean to be kind i know you are most kind most generous but why should you be so stern  what i mean is thisif i find him in adversity i shall be ready to offer him my hand it will then be for him to say whether he will take it but if the storm blow over in such case i would rather that we should remain as we are  norman talked of forgiveness and accused himself of no want of charity in this respect he had no idea that his own heart was still hard as the nether millstone against alaric tudor but yet such was the truth his money he could give he could give also his time and mind he could lend his best abilities to rescue his former friend and his own former love from misfortune he could do this and he thought therefore that he was forgiving but there was no forgiveness in such assistance there was generosity in it for he was ready to part with his money there was kindness of heart for he was anxious to do good to his fellowcreature but there were with these both pride and revenge alaric had outtopped him in everything and it was sweet to normans pride that his hand should be the one to raise from his sudden fall the man who had soared so high above him alaric had injured him and what revenge is so perfect as to repay gross injuries by great benefits is it not thus that we heap coals of fire on our enemies heads not that norman indulged in thoughts such as these not that he resolved thus to gratify his pride thus to indulge his revenge he was unconscious of his own sin but he was not the less a sinner  no said he i will not see him myself it will do no good  mrs woodward found that it was useless to try to bend him that indeed she knew from a long experience it was then settled that she should go up to gertrude that morning travelling up to town together with norman and that when she had learned from her daughter or from alaricif alaric would talk to her about his concernswhat was really the truth of the matter she should come to normans office and tell him what it would be necessary for him to do  and then the marriage was again put off this in itself was a great misery as young ladies who have just been married or who may now be about to be married will surely own the words put off are easily written the necessity of such a put off is easily arranged in the pages of a novel an enforced delay of a month or two in an affair which so many folk willingly delay for so many years sounds like a slight thing but nevertheless a matrimonial put off is under any circumstances a great grief to have to counterwrite those halcyon notes which have given glad promise of the coming event to pack up and put out of sight and if possible out of mind the now odious finery with which the house has for the last weeks been strewed to give the necessary information to the pastrycook from whose counter the sad tidings will be disseminated through all the neighbourhood to annul the orders which have probably been given for rooms and horses for the happy pair to live during the coming interval a mark for pitys unpitying finger to feel and know and hourly calculate how many slips there may be between the disappointed lip and the still distant cup all these things in themselves make up a great grief which is hardly lightened by the knowledge that they have been caused by a still greater grief  these things had linda now to do and the poor girl had none to help her in the doing of them a few hurried words were spoken on that morning between her and norman and for the second time she set to work to put off her wedding katie the meantime lay sick in bed and mrs woodward had gone to london to learn the worst and to do the best in this dire affliction that had come upon them    chapter xxxviii  alaric tudor takes a walk   there is undoubtedly a propensity in human love to attach itself to excellence but it has also as undoubtedly a propensity directly antagonistic to this and which teaches it to put forth its strongest efforts in favour of inferiority watch any fair flock of children in which there may be one blighted bud and you will see that that blighted one is the mothers darling what filial affection is ever so strong as that evinced by a child for a parent in misfortune even among the rough sympathies of schoolboys the cripple the sickly one or the orphan without a home will find the warmest friendship and a stretch of kindness love that must bow and do reverence to superiority can protect and foster inferiority and what is so sweet as to be able to protect  gertrudes love for her husband had never been so strong as when she learnt that that love must now stand in the place of all other sympathies of all other tenderness alaric told her of his crime and in his bitterness he owned that he was no longer worthy of her love she answered by opening her arms to him with more warmth than ever and bidding him rest his weary head upon her breast had they not taken each other for better or for worse had not their bargain been that they would be happy together if such should be their lot or sad together if god should so will itand would she be the first to cry off from such a bargain  it seldom happens that a womans love is quenched by a mans crime women in this respect are more enduring than men they have softer sympathies and less acute less selfish appreciation of the misery of being joined to that which has been shamed it was not many hours since gertrude had boasted to herself of the honour and honesty of her lord and tossed her head with defiant scorn when a breath of suspicion had been muttered against his name then she heard from his own lips the whole truth learnt that that odious woman had only muttered what she soon would have a right to speak out openly knew that fame and honour high position and pride of life were all gone and then in that bitter hour she felt that she had never loved him as she did then  he had done wrong he had sinned grievously but no sooner did she acknowledge so much than she acknowledged also that a man may sin and yet not be all sinful that glory may be tarnished and yet not utterly destroyed that pride may get a fall and yet live to rise again he had sinned and had repented and now to her eyes he was again as pure as snow others would now doubt him that must needs be the case but she would never doubt him no not a whit the more in that he had once fallen he should still be the cynosure of her eyes the pride of her heart the centre of her hopes marina said of her lord when he came to her shattered in limb from the hands of the torturer    i would not change   my exiled mangled persecuted husband   alive or dead for prince or paladin   in story or in fable with a world   to back his suit  gertrude spoke to herself in the same language she would not have changed her alaric branded with infamy as he now was or soon would be for the proudest he that carried his head high among the proud ones of the earth such is womans love such is the love of which a mans heart is never capable  alarics committal had taken place very much in the manner in which it was told at the weights and measures he had received a note from one of the bow street magistrates begging his attendance in the private room at the policeoffice there he had passed nearly the whole of one day and he was also obliged to pass nearly the whole of another in the same office on this second day the proceedings were not private and he was accompanied by his own solicitor  it would be needless to describe how a plain case was as usual made obscure by the lawyers how acts of parliament were consulted how the magistrate doubted how indignant alarics attorney became when it was suggested that some insignificant piece of evidence should be admitted which whether admitted or rejected could have no real bearing on the case in these respects this important examination was like other important examinations of the same kind such as one sees in the newspapers whenever a man above the ordinary felons rank becomes amenable to the outraged laws it ended however in alaric being committed and giving bail to stand his trial in about a fortnights time and in his being assured by his attorney that he would most certainly be acquitted that bit of paper on which he had made an entry that certain shares bought by him had been bought on behalf of his ward would save him so said the attorney to which however alaric answered not much could any acutest lawyer let him be made of never so fine an assortment of forensic indignation now whitewash his name and set him again right before the world he of course communicated with sir gregory and agreed to be suspended from his commissionership till the trial should be over his two colleagues then became bail for him  so much having been settled he got into a cab with his attorney and having dropped that gentleman on the road he returned home the excitement of the examination and the necessity for action had sustained him but nowwhat was to sustain him now how was he to get through the intervening fortnight banished as he was from his office from his club and from all haunts of men his attorney who had other rogues to attend to besides him made certain set appointments with himand for the rest he might sit at home and console himself as best he might with his own thoughts excelsior this was the pass to which excelsior had brought sic itur ad astroalas his road had taken him hitherto in quite a different direction  he sent for charley and when charley came he made gertrude explain to him what had happened he had confessed his own fault once to his own wife and he could not bring himself to do it again charley was thunderstruck at the greatness of the ruin but he offered what assistance he could give anything that he could do he would alaric had sent for him for a purpose and that purpose at any rate charley could fulfil he went into the city to ascertain what was now the price of the limehouse bridge shares and returned with the news that they were falling falling falling  no one else called at alarics door that day mrs val though she did not come there by no means allowed her horses to be idle she went about sedulously among her acquaintance dropping tidings of her daughters losses they will have enough left to live upon thank god said she but did you ever hear of so barefaced so iniquitous a robbery well i am not cruel but my own opinion is that he should certainly be hanged  to this ugolina assented fully adding that she had been so shocked by the suddenness and horror of the news as to have become perfectly incapacitated ever since for any high order of thought  lactimel whose soft bosom could not endure the idea of putting an end to the life of a fellowcreature suggested perpetual banishment to the penal colonies perhaps norfolk island and what will she do said lactimel  indeed i cannot guess said ugolina her education has been sadly deficient  none but charley called on alaric that day and he found himself shut up alone with his wife and child his own house seemed to him a prison he did not dare to leave it he did not dare to walk out and face the public as long as daylight continued he was ashamed to show himself and so he sat alone in his diningroom thinking thinking thinking do what he would he could not get those shares out of his mind they had entered like iron into his soul as poison into his blood they might still rise they might yet become of vast value might pay all his debts and enable him to begin again and then this had been a committee day he had had no means of knowing how things had gone there of learning the opinions of the members of whispering to mr piles or hearing the law on the matter laid down by the heavy deep voice of the great mr blocks and so he went on thinking thinking thinking but ever as though he had a clockweight fixed to his heart and pulling at its strings for after all what were the shares or the committee to him let the shares rise to ever so fabulous a value let the chancellor of the exchequer be ever so complaisant in giving away his money what avail would it be to him what avail now he must stand his trial for the crime of which he had been guilty  with the utmost patience gertrude endeavoured to soothe him and to bring his mind into some temper in which it could employ itself she brought him their baby thinking that he would play with his child but all that he said wasmy poor boy i have ruined him already and then turning away from the infant he thrust his hands deep into his trouserspockets and went on calculating about the shares  when the sun had well set and the daylight had at last dwindled out he took up his hat and wandered out among the new streets and rows of houses which lay between his own house and the western railway he got into a district in which he had never been before and as he walked about here he thought of the fate of other such swindlers as himselfyes though he did not speak the word he pronounced it as plainly and as often in the utterance of his mind as though it was being rung out to him from every steeple in london he thought of the fate of such swindlers as himself how one had been found dead in the streets poisoned by himself how another after facing the cleverest lawyers in the land was now dying in a felons prison how a third had vainly endeavoured to fly from justice by aid of wigs false whiskers painted furrows and other disguises should he try to escape also and avoid the ignominy of a trial he knew it would be in vain he knew that at this moment he was dogged at the distance of some thirty yards by an amiable policeman in mufti placed to watch his motions by his two kind bailsmen who preferred this small expense to the risk of losing a thousand pounds apiece  as he turned short round a corner into the main road leading from the railway station to bayswater he came close upon a man who was walking quickly in the opposite direction and found himself face to face with undy scott how on earth should undy scott have come out there to bayswater at that hour of the night he the constant denizen of clubs the wellknown frequenter of pall mall the member for the tillietudlem burghs whose every hour was occupied in the looking after things political or things commercial who could have expected him in a back road at bayswater there however he was and alaric before he knew of his presence had almost stumbled against him  scott said alaric starting back  hallo tudor what the deuce brings you here but i suppose youll ask me the same question said undy  alaric tudor could not restrain himself you scoundrel said he seizing undy by the collar you utterly unmitigated scoundrel you premeditated wilful villain and he held undy as though he intended to choke him  but undy scott was not a man to be thus roughly handled with impunity and in completing the education which he had received the use of his fists had not been overlooked he let out with his right hand and struck alaric twice with considerable force on the side of his jaw so that the teeth rattled in his mouth  but alaric at the moment hardly felt it you have brought me and mine to ruin said he you have done it purposely like a fiend but low as i have fallen i would not change places with you for all that the earth holds i have been a villain but such villany as yoursugh and so saying he flung his enemy from him and undy tottering back saved himself against the wall  in a continued personal contest between the two men undy would probably have had the best of it for he would certainly have been the cooler of the two and was also the more skilful in such warfare but he felt in a moment that he could gain nothing by thrashing tudor whereas he might damage himself materially by having his name brought forward at the present moment in connexion with that of his old friend  you reprobate said he preparing to pass on it has been my misfortune to know you and one cannot touch pitch and not be defiled but thank god youll come by your deserts now if you will take my advice youll hang yourself and so they parted  the amiable policeman in mufti remained at a convenient distance during this little interview having no special mission to keep the peace pending his present employment but as he passed by he peered into undys face and recognized the honourable member for the tillietudlem burghs a really sharp policeman knows every one of any note in london it might perhaps be useful that evidence should be given at the forthcoming trial of the little contest which we have described if so our friend in mufti was prepared to give it  on the following morning at about eleven a cab drove up to the door and alaric standing at the diningroom window saw mrs woodward get out of it  theres your mother said alaric to his wife i will not see herlet her go up to the drawingroom  oh alaric will you not see mamma  how can i with my face swollen as it is now besides what would be the good what can i say to her i know well enough what she has to say to me without listening to it  dear alaric mamma will say nothing to you that is not kind do see her for my sake alaric  but misery had not made him docile he merely turned from her and shook his head impatiently gertrude then ran out to welcome her mother who was in the hall  and what a welcoming it was come upstairs mamma come into the drawingroom said gertrude who would not stop even to kiss her mother till they found themselves secured from the servants eyes she knew that one word of tenderness would bring her to the ground  mamma mamma she almost shrieked and throwing herself into her mothers arms wept convulsively mrs woodward wanted no more words to tell her that alaric had been guilty  but gertrude how much is it whispered the mother as after a few moments of passionate grief they sat holding each others hands on the sofa how much money is wanting can we not make it up if it be all paid before the day of trial will not that do will not that prevent it  gertrude could not say she knew that £10000 had been abstracted mrs woodward groaned as she heard the sum named but then there were those shares which had not long since been worth much more than half that sum which must still be worth a large part of it  but we must know dearest before harry can do anything said mrs woodward  gertrude blushed crimson when harry normans name was mentioned and had it come to thatthat they must look to him for aid  can you not ask him love said mrs woodward i saw him in the diningroom go and ask him when he knows that we are doing our best for him surely he will help us  gertrude with a heavy heart went down on her message and did not return for fifteen or twenty minutes it may easily be conceived that normans name was not mentioned between her and her husband but she made him understand that an effort would be made for him if only the truth could be ascertained  it will be of no use said he  dont say so alaric we cannot tell what may be of use but at any rate it will be weight off your heart to know that this money has been paid it is that which overpowers you now and not your own misfortune  at last he suffered her to lead him and she put down on paper such figures as he dictated to her it was however impossible to say what was the actual deficiency that must depend upon the present value of the shares these he said he was prepared to give over to his own attorney if it was thought that by so doing he should be taking the best steps towards repairing the evil he had done and then he began calculating how much the shares might possibly be worth and pointing out under what circumstances they should be sold and under what again they should be overheld till the market had improved all this was worse than greek to gertrude but she collected what facts she could and then returned to her mother  and they discussed the matter with all the wit and all the volubility which women have on such occasions paper was brought forth and accounts were made out between them not such as would please the eyes of a civil service examiner but yet accurate in their way how they worked and racked their brains and strained their womens nerves in planning how justice might be defeated and the dishonesty of the loved one covered from shame uncle bat was ready with his share he had received such explanation as mrs woodward had been able to give and though when he first heard the news he had spoken severely of alaric still his money should be forthcoming for the service of the family he could produce some fifteen hundred pounds and would if needs be that he should do so then harrybut the pen fell from gertrudes fingers as she essayed to write down harry normans contribution to the relief of her husbands misery  remember gertrude love in how short a time he will be your brother  but when will it be mamma is it to be on thursday as we had planned of course mamma i cannot be there  and then there was a break in their accounts and mrs woodward explained to gertrude that they had all thought it better to postpone lindas marriage till after the trial and this of course was the source of fresh grief when men such as alaric tudor stoop to dishonesty the penalties of detection are not confined to their own hearthstone the higher are the branches of the tree and the wider the greater will be the extent of earth which its fall will disturb  gertrudes pen however again went to work the shares were put down at £5000 if they can only be sold for so much i think we may manage it said mrs woodward i am sure that harry can get the remainderindeed he said he could have more than that  and what will linda do  linda will never want it love and if she did what of that would she not give all she has for you  and then mrs woodward went her way to normans office without having spoken to alaric you will come again soon mamma said gertrude mrs woodward promised that she would  and mamma and she whispered close into her mothers ear as she made her next request and mamma you will be with me on that day  we need not follow norman in his efforts to have her full fortune restored to madame jaquêtanàpe he was daily in connexion with alarics lawyer and returned sometimes with hope and sometimes without it mrs vals lawyer would receive no overtures towards a withdrawal of the charge or even towards any mitigation in their proceedings unless the agent coming forward on behalf of the ladys late trustee did so with the full sum of £20000 in his hands  we need not follow charley who was everyday with alaric and who was unknown to alaric an agent between him and norman well charley what are they doing today was alarics constant question to him even up to the very eve of his trial  if any spirit ever walks it must be that of the stockjobber for how can such a one rest in its grave without knowing what shares are doing    chapter xxxix  the last breakfast   and that day was not long in coming indeed it came with terrible alacrity much too quickly for gertrude much too quickly for norman and much too quickly for alarics lawyer to alaric only did the time pass slowly for he found himself utterly without employment  norman and uncle bat between them had raised something about £6000 but when the day came on which they were prepared to dispose of the shares the limehouse bridge was found to be worth nothing they were as the broker had said ticklish stock so ticklish that no one would have them at any price when undy together with his agent from tillietudlem went into the market about the same time to dispose of theirs they were equally unsuccessful how the agent looked and spoke and felt may be imagined for the agent had made large advances and had no other security but undy had borne such looks and speeches before and merely said that it was very oddextremely odd he had been greatly deceived by mr piles mr piles also said it was very odd but he did not appear to be nearly so much annoyed as the agent from tillietudlem and it was whispered that queer as things now looked messrs blocks piles and cofferdam had not made a bad thing of the bridge  overture after overture was made to the lawyer employed by mrs vals party norman first offered the £6000 and the shares then when the shares were utterly rejected by the sharebuying world he offered to make himself personally responsible for the remainder of the debt and to bind himself by bond to pay it within six months at first these propositions were listened to and alarics friends were led to believe that the matter would be handled in such a way that the prosecution would fall to the ground but at last all composition was refused the adverse attorney declared first that he was not able to accept any money payment short of the full amount with interest and then he averred that as criminal proceedings had been taken they could not now be stayed whether or no alarics night attack had anything to do with this whether undy had been the means of instigating this rigid adherence to justice we are not prepared to say  that day for which gertrude had prayed her mothers assistance came all too soon they had become at last aware that the trial must go on charley was with them on the last evening and completed their despair by telling them that their attorney had resolved to make no further efforts at a compromise  perhaps the most painful feeling to gertrude through the whole of the last fortnight had been the total prostration of her husbands energy and almost of his intellect he seemed to have lost the power of judging for himself and of thinking and deciding what conduct would be best for him in his present condition he who had been so energetic so full of life so ready for all emergencies so clever at devices so able to manage not only for himself but for his friends he was as it were paralysed and unmanned he sat from morning to night looking at the empty firegrate and hardly ventured to speak of the ordeal that he had to undergo  his lawyer was to call for him on the morning of the trial and mrs woodward was to be at the house soon after he had left it he had not yet seen her since the inquiry had commenced and it was very plain that he did not wish to do so mrs woodward was to be there and to remain till his fate had been decided and thennot a word had yet been said as to the chance of his not returning but mrs woodward was aware that he would probably be unable to do so and felt that if such should be the case she could not leave her daughter alone  and so alaric and his wife sat down to breakfast on that last morning she had brought their boy down but as she perceived that the childs presence did not please his father he had been sent back to the nursery and they were alone she poured out his tea for him put bread upon his plate and then sat down close beside him endeavouring to persuade him to eat she had never yet found fault with him she had never even ventured to give him counsel but now she longed to entreat him to collect himself and take a mans part in the coming trial he sat in the seat prepared for him but instead of eating he thrust his hands after his accustomed manner into his pockets and sat glowering at the teacups  come alaric wont you eat your breakfast said she  no breakfast nohow can i eat now how can you think that i could eat at such a time as this do you take yours never mind me  but dearest you will be faint if you do not eat think what you have to go through remember how many eyes will be on you today  he shuddered violently as she spoke and motioned to her with his hand not to go on with what she was saying  i know i know said she passionately dearest dearest lovei know how dreadful it is would that i could bear it for you would that i could  he turned away his head for a tear was in his eye it was the first that had come to his assistance since this sorrow had come upon him  dont turn from me dearest alaric do not turn from me now at our last moments to me at least you are the same noble alaric that you ever were  noble said he with all the selfscorn which he so truly felt  to me you are now as ever but alaric i do so fear that you will want strength physical strength you know to go through all this i would have you bear yourself like a man before them all  it will be but little matter said he  it will be matter it will be matter to me my darling darling husband rouse yourself and she knelt before his knees and prayed to him for my sake do it eat and drink that you may have the power of a man when all the world is looking at you if god forgives us our sins surely we should so carry ourselves that men may not be ashamed to do so  he did not answer her but he turned to the table and broke the bread and put his lips to the cup and then she gave him food as she would give it to a child and he with a childs obedience ate and drank what was put before him as he did so every now and again a single tear forced itself beneath his eyelid and trickled down his face and in some degree gertrude was comforted  he had hardly finished his enforced breakfast when the cab and the lawyer came to the door the learned gentleman had the good taste not to come in and so the servant told them that mr gitemthruet was there  say that your master will be with him in a minute said gertrude quite coolly and then the room door was again closed and the husband and wife had now to say adieu  alaric rose from his chair and made a faint attempt to smile well gertrude said he it has come at last  she rushed into his embrace and throwing her arms around him buried her face upon his breast alaric alaric my husband my love my best my own my only love  i cannot say much now gertrude but i know how good you are you will come and see me if they will let you wont you  see you said she starting back but still holding him and looking up earnestly into his face see you and then she poured out her love with all the passion of a ruth whither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if aught but death part thee and me see you alaric oh it cannot be that they will hinder the wife from being with her husband but alaric she went on do not droop now lovewill you  i cannot brazen it out said he i know too well what it is that i have done  no not that alaric i would not have that but remember all is not over whatever they may do ah how little will really be over whatever they can do you have repented have you not alaric  i think so i hope so said alaric with his eyes upon the ground  you have repented and are right before god do not fear then what man can do to you i would not have you brazen alaric but be manly be collected be your own self the man that i have loved the man that i do now love so well better better than ever and she threw herself on him and kissed him and clung to him and stroked his hair and put her hand upon his face and then holding him from her looked up to him as though he were a hero whom she all but worshipped  gertrude gertrudethat i should have brought you to this  never mind said she we will win through it yetwe will yet be happy together far far away from hereremember thatlet that support you through all and now alaric you will come up for one moment and kiss him before you go  the man will be impatient  never mind let him be impatientyou shall not go away without blessing your boy come up alaric and she took him by the hand and led him like a child into the nursery  where is the nurse bring him herepapa is going awayalley boy give papa a big kiss  alaric for the first time for the fortnight took the little fellow into his arms and kissed him god bless you my bairn said he and grant that all this may never be visited against you here or hereafter  and now go said gertrude as they descended the stairs together and may god in his mercy watch over and protect you and give you back to me and alaric wherever you are i will be close to you remember that i will be quite quite close to you now one kissoh dearest dearest alarictheretherenow go and so he went and gertrude shutting herself into her room threw herself on to the bed and wept aloud    chapter xl  mr chaffanbrass   we must now follow alaric to his trial he was of course much too soon at court all people always are who are brought to the court perforce criminals for instance and witnesses and other suchlike unfortunate wretches whereas many of those who only go there to earn their bread are very often as much too late he was to be tried at the old bailey as i have never seen the place and as so many others have seen it i will not attempt to describe it here mr gitemthruet was quite at home he hustled and jostled elbowed and ordered as though he were the second great man of the place and the client whom he was to defend was the first in this latter opinion he was certainly right alaric was the hero of the day and people made way for him as though he had won a victory in india and was going to receive the freedom of the city in a box as he passed by a gleam of light fell on him from a window and at the instant three different artists had him photographed daguerreotyped and bedevilled four graphic members of the public press took down the details of his hat whiskers coat trousers and boots and the subeditor of the daily delight observed that there was a slight tremor in the first footstep which he took within the precincts of the prison but in every other respect his demeanour was dignified and his presence manly he had lightbrown gloves one of which was on his left hand but the other was allowed to swing from his fingers the court was extremely crowded and some fair ladies appeared there to grace its customarily ungracious walls on the bench we observed lord killtime sir gregory hardlines and mr whip vigil mr undecimus scott who had been summoned as a witness by the prisoner was also accommodated by the sheriffs with a seat such was the opening paragraph of the seven columns which were devoted by the daily delight to the allabsorbing subject  but mr gitemthruet made his way through artists reporters and the agitated crowd with that happy air of command which can so easily be assumed by men at a moments notice when they feel themselves to be for that moment of importance come this way mr tudor follow me and we will get on without any trouble just follow me close said mr gitemthruet to his client in a whisper which was audible to not a few tudor who was essaying and not altogether unsuccessfully to bear the public gaze undismayed did as he was bid and followed mr gitemthruet  now said the attorney well sit heremr chaffanbrass will be close to us there so that i can touch him up as we go along of course you know you can make any suggestion only you must do it through me heres his lordship uncommon well he looks dont he youd hardly believe him to be seventyseven but hes not a day less if he isnt any more and he has as much work in him yet as you or i pretty nearly if you want to insure a mans life mr tudor put him on the bench then hell never die we lawyers are not like bishops who are always for giving up and going out on a pension  but alaric was not at the moment inclined to meditate much on the long years of judges he was thinking or perhaps trying to think whether it would not be better for him to save this crowd that was now gathered together all further trouble and plead guilty at once he knew he was guilty he could not understand that it was possible that any juryman should have a doubt about it he had taken the money that did not belong to him that would be made quite clear he had taken it and had not repaid it there was the absolute corpus delicti in court in the shape of a deficiency of some thousands of pounds what possible doubt would there be in the breast of anyone as to his guilt why should he vex his own soul by making himself for a livelong day the gazingstock for the multitude why should he trouble all those wigged counsellors when one word from him would set all at rest  mr gitemthruet i think ill plead guilty said he  plead what said mr gitemthruet turning round upon his client with a sharp angry look it was the first time that his attorney had shown any sign of disgust displeasure or even disapprobation since he had taken alarics matter in hand plead what ah youre joking i know upon my soul you gave me a start  alaric endeavoured to explain to him that he was not joking nor in a mood to joke but that he really thought the least vexatious course would be for him to plead guilty  then i tell you it would be the most vexatious proceeding ever i heard of in all my practice but you are in my hands mr tudor and you cant do it you have done me the honour to come to me and now you must be ruled by me plead guilty why with such a case as you have got you would disgrace yourself for ever if you did so think of your friends mr tudor if you wont think of me or of yourself  his lawyers eloquence converted him and he resolved that he would run his chance during this time all manner of little legal preliminaries had been going on and now the court was ready for business the jury were in their box the courtkeeper cried silence and mr gitemthruet was busy among his papers with frantic energy but nothing was yet seen of the great mr chaffanbrass  i believe we may go on with the trial for breach of trust said the judge i do not know why we are waiting  then up and spoke mr younglad who was alarics junior counsel mr younglad was a promising commonlaw barrister now commencing his career of whom his friends were beginning to hope that he might if he kept his shoulders well to the collar at some distant period make a living out of his profession he was between forty and fortyfive years of age and had already overcome the natural diffidence of youth in addressing a learned bench and a crowded court  my lud said younglad my learned friend mr chaffanbrass who leads for the prisoner is not yet in court perhaps my lud on behalf of my client i may ask for a few moments delay  and if mr chaffanbrass has undertaken to lead for the prisoner why is he not in court said the judge looking as though he had uttered a poser which must altogether settle mr younglads business  but mr younglad had not been sitting and walking and listening let alone talking occasionally in criminal courts for the last twenty years to be settled so easily  my lud if your ludship will indulge me with five minutes delaywe will not ask more than five minutesyour ludship knows no one better the very onerous duties  when i was at the bar i took no briefs to which i could not attend said the judge  i am sure you did not my lud and my learned friend should he ever sit in your ludships seat will be able to say as much for himself when at some future time he may be but my lud mr chaffanbrass is now in court and as he spoke mr chaffanbrass carrying in his hand a huge old blue bag which as he entered he took from his clerks hands and bearing on the top of his head a wig that apparently had not been dressed for the last ten years made his way in among the barristers caring little on whose toes he trod whose papers he upset or whom he elbowed on his road mr chaffanbrass was the cock of this dunghill and well he knew how to make his crowing heard there  and now pray let us lose no more time said the judge  my lord if time has been lost through me i am very sorry but if your lordships horse had fallen down in the street as mine did just now  my horse never falls down in the street mr chaffanbrass  some beasts my lord can always keep their legs under them and others cant and men are pretty much in the same condition i hope the former may be the case with your lordship and your lordships cob for many years the judge knowing of old that nothing could prevent mr chaffanbrass from having the last word now held his peace and the trial began  there are not now too many pages left to us for the completion of our tale but nevertheless we must say a few words about mr chaffanbrass he was one of an order of barristers by no means yet extinct but of whom it may be said that their peculiarities are somewhat less often seen than they were when mr chaffanbrass was in his prime he confined his practice almost entirely to one class of work the defence namely of culprits arraigned for heavy crimes and in this he was if not unrivalled at least unequalled rivals he had who thick as the skins of such men may be presumed to be not unfrequently writhed beneath the lashes which his tongue could inflict to such a perfection had he carried his skill and power of fence so certain was he in attack so invulnerable when attacked that few men cared to come within the reach of his forensic flail to the old stagers who were generally opposed to him the gentlemen who conducted prosecutions on the part of the crown and customarily spent their time and skill in trying to hang those marauders on the public safety whom it was the special business of mr chaffanbrass to preserve unhung to these he was if not civil at least forbearing but when any barrister who was comparatively a stranger to him ventured to oppose him there was no measure to his impudent sarcasm and offensive sneers  those however who most dreaded mr chaffanbrass and who had most occasion to do so were the witnesses a rival lawyer could find a protection on the bench when his powers of endurance were tried too far but a witness in a court of law has no protection he comes there unfeed without hope of guerdon to give such assistance to the state in repressing crime and assisting justice as his knowledge in this particular case may enable him to afford and justice in order to ascertain whether his testimony be true finds it necessary to subject him to torture one would naturally imagine that an undisturbed thread of clear evidence would be best obtained from a man whose position was made easy and whose mind was not harassed but this is not the fact to turn a witness to good account he must be badgered this way and that till he is nearly mad he must be made a laughingstock for the court his very truths must be turned into falsehoods so that he may be falsely shamed he must be accused of all manner of villany threatened with all manner of punishment he must be made to feel that he has no friend near him that the world is all against him he must be confounded till he forget his right hand from his left till his mind be turned into chaos and his heart into water and then let him give his evidence what will fall from his lips when in this wretched collapse must be of special value for the best talents of practised forensic heroes are daily used to bring it about and no member of the humane society interferes to protect the wretch some sorts of torture are as it were tacitly allowed even among humane people eels are skinned alive and witnesses are sacrificed and no ones blood curdles at the sight no soft heart is sickened at the cruelty  to apply the thumbscrew the boot and the rack to the victim before him was the work of mr chaffanbrasss life and it may be said of him that the labour he delighted in physicked pain he was as little averse to this toil as the cat is to that of catching mice and indeed he was not unlike a cat in his method of proceeding for he would as it were hold his prey for a while between his paws and pat him with gentle taps before he tore him he would ask a few civil little questions in his softest voice glaring out of his wicked old eye as he did so at those around him and then when he had his mouse well in hand out would come his envenomed claw and the wretched animal would feel the fatal wound in his tenderest part  mankind in general take pleasure in cruelty though those who are civilized abstain from it on principle on the whole mr chaffanbrass is popular at the old bailey men congregate to hear him turn a witness inside out and chuckle with an inward pleasure at the success of his cruelty this mr chaffanbrass knows and like an actor who is kept up to his high mark by the necessity of maintaining his character he never allows himself to grow dull over his work therefore mr chaffanbrass bullies when it is quite unnecessary that he should bully it is a labour of love and though he is now old and stiff in his joints though ease would be dear to him though like a gladiator satiated with blood he would as regards himself be so pleased to sheathe his sword yet he never spares himself he never spares himself and he never spares his victim  as a lawyer in the broad and high sense of the word it may be presumed that mr chaffanbrass knows little or nothing he has indeed no occasion for such knowledge his business is to perplex a witness and bamboozle a jury and in doing that he is generally successful he seldom cares for carrying the judge with him such tactics indeed as his are not likely to tell upon a judge that which he loves is that a judge should charge against him and a jury give a verdict in his favour when he achieves that he feels that he has earned his money let others the young lads and spooneys of his profession undertake the milkandwater work of defending injured innocence it is all but an insult to his practised ingenuity to invite his assistance to such tasteless business give him a case in which he has all the world against him justice with her sword raised high to strike truth with open mouth and speaking eyes to tell the bloody tale outraged humanity shrieking for punishment a case from which mercy herself with averted eyes has loathing turned and bade her sterner sister do her work give him such a case as this and then you will see mr chaffanbrass in his glory let him by the use of his high art rescue from the gallows and turn loose upon the world the wretch whose hands are reeking with the blood of father mother wife and brother and you may see mr chaffanbrass elated with conscious worth rub his happy hands with infinite complacency then will his ambition be satisfied and he will feel that in the verdict of the jury he has received the honour due to his genius he will have succeeded in turning black into white in washing the blackamoor in dressing in the fair robe of innocence the foulest filthiest wretch of his day and as he returns to his home he will be proudly conscious that he is no little man  in person however mr chaffanbrass is a little man and a very dirty little man he has all manner of nasty tricks about him which make him a disagreeable neighbour to barristers sitting near to him he is profuse with snuff and very generous with his handkerchief he is always at work upon his teeth which do not do much credit to his industry his wig is never at ease upon his head but is poked about by him sometimes over one ear sometimes over the other now on the back of his head and then on his nose and it is impossible to say in which guise he looks most cruel most sharp and most intolerable his linen is never clean his hands never washed and his clothes apparently never new he is about five feet six in height and even with that stoops greatly his custom is to lean forward resting with both hands on the sort of desk before him and then to fix his small brown basilisk eye on the victim in the box before him in this position he will remain unmoved by the hour together unless the elevation and fall of his thick eyebrows and the partial closing of his wicked eyes can be called motion but his tongue that moves there is the weapon which he knows how to use  such is mr chaffanbrass in public life and those who only know him in public life can hardly believe that at home he is one of the most easy goodtempered amiable old gentlemen that ever was poohpoohed by his grownup daughters and occasionally told to keep himself quiet in a corner such however is his private character not that he is a fool in his own house mr chaffanbrass can never be a fool but he is so essentially goodnatured so devoid of any feeling of domestic tyranny so placid in his domesticities that he chooses to be ruled by his own children but in his own way he is fond of hospitality he delights in a cosy glass of old port with an old friend in whose company he may be allowed to sit in his old coat and old slippers he delights also in his books in his daughters music and in three or four live pet dogs and birds and squirrels whom morning and night he feeds with his own hands he is charitable too and subscribes largely to hospitals founded for the relief of the suffering poor  such was mr chaffanbrass who had been selected by the astute mr gitemthruet to act as leading counsel on behalf of alaric if any human wisdom could effect the escape of a client in such jeopardy the wisdom of mr chaffanbrass would be likely to do it but in truth the evidence was so strong against him that even this newgate hero almost feared the result  i will not try the patience of anyone by stating in detail all the circumstances of the trial in doing so i should only copy or at any rate might copy the proceedings at some of those modern causes célèbres with which all those who love such subjects are familiar and why should i force such matters on those who do not love them the usual opening speech was made by the chief man on the prosecuting side who in the usual manner declared that his only object was justice that his heart bled within him to see a man of such acknowledged public utility as mr tudor in such a position that he sincerely hoped that the jury might find it possible to acquit him but that and then went into his but with so much venom that it was clearly discernible to all that in spite of his protestations his heart was set upon a conviction  when he had finished the witnesses for the prosecution were calledthe poor wretches whose fate it was to be impaled alive that day by mr chaffanbrass they gave their evidence and in due course were impaled mr chaffanbrass had never been greater the day was hot and he thrust his wig back till it stuck rather on the top of his coatcollar than on his head his forehead seemed to come out like the head of a dog from his kennel and he grinned with his black teeth and his savage eyes twinkled till the witnesses sank almost out of sight as they gazed at him  and yet they had very little to prove and nothing that he could disprove they had to speak merely to certain banking transactions to say that certain moneys had been so paid in and so drawn out in stating which they had their office books to depend on but not the less on this account were they made victims to one clerk it was suggested that he might now and then once in three months or so make an error in a figure and having acknowledged this he was driven about until he admitted that it was very possible that every entry he made in the bank books in the course of the year was false and you such as you said mr chaffanbrass do you dare to come forward to give evidence on commercial affairs go down sir and hide your ignominy the wretch convinced that he was ruined for ever slunk out of court and was ashamed to show himself at his place of business for the next three days  there were ten or twelve witnesses all much of the same sort who proved among them that this sum of twenty thousand pounds had been placed at alarics disposal and that now alas the twenty thousand pounds were not forthcoming it seemed to be a very simple case and to alarics own understanding it seemed impossible that his counsel should do anything for him but as each impaled victim shrank with agonized terror from the torture mr gitemthruet would turn round to alaric and assure him that they were going on well quite as well as he had expected mr chaffanbrass was really exerting himself and when mr chaffanbrass did really exert himself he rarely failed  and so the long day faded itself away in the hot sweltering court and his lordship at about seven oclock declared his intention of adjourning of course a cause célèbre such as this was not going to decide itself in one day alarics guilt was clear as daylight to all concerned but a man who had risen to be a civil service commissioner and to be entrusted with the guardianship of twenty thousand pounds was not to be treated like a butcher who had merely smothered his wife in an ordinary way or a housebreaker who had followed his professional career to its natural end more than that was due to the rank and station of the man and to the very respectable retaining fee with which mr gitemthruet had found himself enabled to secure the venom of mr chaffanbrass so the jury retired to regale themselves en masse at a neighbouring coffeehouse alaric was again permitted to be at large on bail the amiable policeman in mufti still attending him at a distance and mr chaffanbrass and his lordship retired to prepare themselves by rest for the morrows labours  but what was alaric to do he soon found himself under the guardianship of the constant gitemthruet in a neighbouring tavern and his cousin charley was with him charley had been in court the whole day except that he had twice posted down to the west end in a cab to let gertrude and mrs woodward know how things were going on he had posted down and posted back again and crowded as the court had been he had contrived to make his way in using that air of authority to which the strongestminded policeman will always bow till at last the very policemen assisted him as though he were in some way connected with the trial  on his last visit at gertrudes house he had told her that it was very improbable that the trial should be finished that day she had then said nothing as to alarics return to his own house it had indeed not occurred to her that he would be at liberty to do so charley at once caught at this and strongly recommended his cousin to remain where he was you will gain nothing by going home said he gertrude does not expect you mrs woodward is there and it will be better for all parties that you should remain mr gitemthruet strongly backed his advice and alaric so counselled resolved to remain where he was charley promised to stay with him and the policeman in mufti without making any promise at all silently acquiesced in the arrangement charley made one more visit to the west saw norman at his lodgings and mrs woodward and gertrude in albany place and then returned to make a night of it with alaric we need hardly say that charley made a night of it in a very different manner from that to which he and his brother navvies were so well accustomed    chapter xli  the old bailey   the next morning at ten oclock the court was again crowded the judge was again on his bench prepared for patient endurance and lord killtime and sir gregory hardlines were alongside of him the jury were again in their box ready with pen and paper to give their brightest attentiona brightness which will be dim enough before the long day be over the counsel for the prosecution were rummaging among their papers the witnesses for the defence were sitting there among the attorneys with the exception of the honourable undecimus scott who was accommodated with a seat near the sheriff and whose heart to tell the truth was sinking somewhat low within his breast in spite of the glass of brandy with which he had fortified himself alaric was again present under the wings of mr gitemthruet and the great mr chaffanbrass was in his place he was leaning over a slip of paper which he held in his hand and with compressed lips was meditating his attack upon his enemies on this occasion his wig was well over his eyes and as he peered up from under it to the judges face he cocked his nose with an air of supercilious contempt for all those who were immediately around him  it was for him to begin the days sport by making a speech not so much in defence of his client as in accusation of the prosecutors it had never he said been his fate he might say his misfortune to hear a case against a man in a respectable position opened by the crown with such an amount of envenomed virulence he was then reminded that the prosecution was not carried on by the crown then said he we may attribute this virulence to private malice that it is not to be attributed to any fear that this english bride should lose her fortune or that her french husband should be deprived of any portion of his spoil i shall be able to prove to a certainty did i allow myself that audacity of denunciation which my learned friend has not considered incompatible with the dignity of his new silk gown could i permit myself such latitude of invective as he has adopteda slight laugh was here heard in the court and an involuntary smile played across the judges faceyes continued mr chaffanbrass i boldly aver that i have never forgotten myself and what is due to humanity as my learned friend did in his address to the jury gentlemen of the jury you will not confound the natural indignation which counsel must feel when defending innocence from the false attacks with the uncalledfor the unprofessional acerbity which has now been used in promoting such an accusation as this i may at times be angry when i see mean falsehood before me in vain assuming the garb of truthfor with such juries as i meet here it generally is in vaini may at times forget myself in anger but if we talk of venom virulence and eager hostility i yield the palm without a contest to my learned friend in the new silk gown  he then went on to dispose of the witnesses whom they had heard on the previous day and expressed a regret that an exposé should have been made so disgraceful to the commercial establishments of this great commercial city it only showed what was the effect on such establishments of that undue parsimony which was now one of the crying evils of the times having thus shortly disposed of them he came to what all men knew was the real interest of the days doings but said he the evidence in this case to which your attention will be chiefly directed will be not that for the accusation but that for the defence it will be my business to show to you not only that my client is guiltless but to what temptations to be guilty he has been purposely and wickedly subjected i shall put into that bar an honourable member of the house of commons who will make some revelations as to his own life who will give us an insight into the ways and means of a legislator which will probably surprise us all not excluding his lordship on the bench he will be able to explain to usand i trust i may be able to induce him to do so for it is possible that he may be a little coyhe will be able to explain to us why my client who is in no way connected either with the scotts or the golightlys or the figgs or the jaquêtanàpes why he was made the ladys trustee and he will also perhaps tell us after some slight gentle persuasion whether he has himself handled or attempted to handle any of this ladys money  mr chaffanbrass then went on to state that as the forms of the court would not give him the power of addressing the jury again he must now explain to them what he conceived to be the facts of the case he then admitted that his client in his anxiety to do the best he could with the fortune entrusted to him had invested it badly the present fate of these unfortunate bridge shares as to which the commercial world had lately held so many different opinions proved that but it had nevertheless been a bona fide investment made in conjunction with and by the advice of mr scott the ladys uncle who thus for his own purposes got possession of money which was in truth confided to him for other purposes his client mr chaffanbrass acknowledged had behaved with great indiscretion but the moment he found that the investment would be an injurious one to the lady whose welfare was in his hands he at once resolved to make good the whole amount from his own pocket that he had done so or at any rate would have done so but for this trial would be proved to them nobler conduct than this it was impossible to imagine whereas the ladys uncle the honourable member of parliament the gentleman who had made a stalkinghorse of his mr chaffanbrasss client refused to refund a penny of the spoil and was now the instigator of this most unjust proceeding  as mr chaffanbrass thus finished his oration undy scott tried to smile complacently on those around him but why did the big drops of sweat stand on his brow as his eye involuntarily caught those of mr chaffanbrass why did he shuffle his feet and uneasily move his hands and feet hither and thither as a man does when he tries in vain to be unconcerned why did he pull his gloves on and off and throw himself back with that affected air which is so unusual to him all the court was looking at him and every one knew that he was wretched wretched aye indeed he was for the assurance even of an undy scott the hardened man of the clubs the thrice elected and twice rejected of tillietudlem fell prostrate before the wellknown hot pincers of chaffanbrass the torturer  the first witness called was henry norman alaric looked up for a moment with surprise and then averted his eyes mr gitemthruet had concealed from him the fact that norman was to be called he merely proved this that having heard from mrs woodward who was the prisoners motherinlaw and would soon be his own motherinlaw that a deficiency had been alleged to exist in the fortune of madame jaquêtanàpe he had on the part of mrs woodward produced what he believed would cover this deficiency and that when he had been informed that more money was wanting he had offered to give security that the whole should be paid in six months of course on him mr chaffanbrass exercised none of his terrible skill and as the lawyers on the other side declined to crossexamine him he was soon able to leave the court this he did speedily for he had no desire to witness alarics misery  and then the honourable undecimus scott was put into the witnessbox it was suggested on his behalf that he might give his evidence from the seat which he then occupied but this mr chaffanbrass would by no means allow his intercourse with mr scott he said must be of a nearer closer and more confidential nature than such an arrangement as that would admit a witness to his way of thinking was never an efficient witness till he had his arm on the rail of a witnessbox he must trouble mr scott to descend from the grandeur of his present position he might return to his seat after he had been examinedif he then should have a mind to do so our friend undy found that he had to obey and he was soon confronted with mr chaffanbrass in the humbler manner which that gentleman thought so desirable  you are a member of the house of commons i believe mr scott began mr chaffanbrass  undy acknowledged that he was so  and you are the son of a peer i believe  a scotch peer said undy  oh a scotch peer said mr chaffanbrass bringing his wig forward over his left eye in a manner that was almost irresistible a scotch peera member of parliament and son of a scotch peer and you have been a member of the government i believe mr scott  undy confessed that he had been in office for a short time  a member of parliament a son of a peer and one of the government of this great and free country you ought to be a proud and a happy man you are a man of fortune too i believe mr scott  that is a matter of opinion said undy different people have different ideas i dont know what you call fortune  why i call £20000 a fortunethis sum that the lady had who married the frenchman have you £20000  i shall not answer that question  have you £10000 you surely must have as much as that as i know you married a fortune yourselfunless indeed a falsehearted trustee has got hold of your money also come have you got £10000  i shall not answer you  have you got any income at all now i demand an answer to that on your oath sir  my lord must i answer such questions said undy  yes sir you must answer them and many more like them said mr chaffanbrass my lord it is essential to my client that i should prove to the jury whether this witness is or is not a penniless adventurer if he be a respectable member of society he can have no objection to let me know whether he has the means of living  perhaps mr scott said the judge you will not object to state whether or no you possess any fixed income  have you or have you not got an income on which you live demanded mr chaffanbrass  i have an income said undy not however in a voice that betokened much selfconfidence in the strength of his own answer  you have an income have you and now mr scott will you tell us what profession you follow at this moment with the object of increasing your income i think we may surmise by the tone of your voice that your income is not very abundant  i have no profession said undy  on your oath you are in no profession  not at present  on your oath you are not a stockjobber  undy hesitated for a moment  by the virtue of your oath sir are you a stockjobber or are you not  no i am not at least i believe not  you believe not said mr chaffanbrassand it would be necessary to hear the tone in which this was said to understand the derision which was implied you believe you are not a stockjobber are you or are you not constantly buying shares and selling sharesrailway sharesbridge sharesmining sharesand suchlike  i sometimes buy shares  and sometimes sell them  yesand sometimes sell them  where mr chaffanbrass had got his exact information we cannot say but very exact information he had acquired respecting undys little transactions he questioned him about the mary janes and old friendships about the west corks and the ballydehob branch about sundry other railways and canals and finally about the limehouse bridge and then again he asked his former question and now said he will you tell the jury whether you are a stockjobber or no  it is all a matter of opinion said undy perhaps i may be in your sense of the word  my sense of the word said mr chaffanbrass you are as much a stockjobber sir as that man is a policeman or his lordship is a judge and now mr scott i am sorry that i must go back to your private affairs respecting which you are so unwilling to speak i fear i must trouble you to tell me thishow did you raise the money with which you bought that latter batchthe large lump of the bridge sharesof which we were speaking  i borrowed it from mr tudor said undy who had prepared himself to answer this question glibly  you borrowed it from mr alaric tudorthat is from the gentleman now upon his trial you borrowed it i believe just at the time that he became the ladys trustee  yes said undy i did so  you have not repaid him as yet  nonot yet said undy  i thought not can you at all say when mr tudor may probably get his money  i am not at present prepared to name a day when the money was lent it was not intended that it should be repaid at an early day  oh mr tudor did not want his money at an early daydidnt he but nevertheless he has i believe asked for it since and that very pressingly  he has never asked for it said undy  allow me to remind you mr scott that i have the power of putting my client into that witnessbox although he is on his trial and having so reminded you let me again beg you to say whether he has not asked you for repayment of this large sum of money very pressingly  no he has never done so  by the value of your oath sirif it has any valuedid not my client beseech you to allow these shares to be sold while they were yet saleable in order that your nieces trust money might be replaced in the english funds  he said something as to the expediency of selling them and i differed from him  you thought it would be better for the ladys interest that they should remain unsold  i made no question of the ladys interest i was not her trustee  but the shares were bought with the ladys money  what shares asked undy  what shares sir those shares which you had professed to hold on the ladys behalf and which afterwards you did not scruple to call your own those shares of yourssince you have the deliberate dishonesty so to call themthose shares of yours were they not bought with the ladys money  they were bought with the money which i borrowed from mr tudor  and where did mr tudor get that money  that is a question you must ask himself said undy  it is a question sir that just at present i prefer to ask you now sir be good enough to tell the jury whence mr tudor got that money or tell them if you dare do so that you do not know  undy for a minute remained silent and mr chaffanbrass remained silent also but if the fury of his tongue for a moment was at rest that of his eyes was as active as ever he kept his gaze steadily fixed upon the witness and stood there with compressed lips still resting on his two hands as though he were quite satisfied thus to watch the prey that was in his power for an instant he glanced up to the jury and then allowed his eyes to resettle on the face of the witness as though he might have said there gentlemen there he isthe son of a peer a member of parliament what do you think of him  the silence of that minute was horrible to undy and yet he could hardly bring himself to break it the judge looked at him with eyes which seemed to read his inmost soul the jury looked at him condemning him one and all alaric looked at him with fierce glaring eyes of hatred the same eyes that had glared at him that night when he had been collared in the street the whole crowd looked at him derisively but the eyes of them all were as nothing to the eyes of mr chaffanbrass  i never saw him so great i never did said mr gitemthruet whispering to his client and alaric even he felt some consolation in the terrible discomfiture of his enemy  i dont know where he got it said undy at last breaking the terrible silence and wiping the perspiration from his brow  oh you dont said mr chaffanbrass knocking his wig back and coming well out of his kennel after waiting for a quarter of an hour or so you are able to tell the jury at last that you dont know anything about it he took the small trifle of change out of his pocket i suppose  i dont know where he took it from  and you didnt ask  no  you got the money that was all you know but this was just at the time that mr tudor became the ladys trustee i think you have admitted that  it may have been about the time  yes it may have been about the time as you justly observe mr scott luckily you know we have the dates of the two transactions but it never occurred to your innocent mind that the money which you got into your hands was a part of the ladys fortune that never occurred to your innocent mindeh mr scott  i dont know that my mind is a more innocent mind than your own said undy  i dare say not well did the idea ever occur to your guilty mind  perhaps my mind is not more guilty than your own either  then may god help me said mr chaffanbrass for i must be at a bad pass you told us just now mr scott that some time since mr tudor advised you to sell these shareswhat made him give you this advice  he meant he said to sell his own  and he pressed you to sell yours  yes  he urged you to do so more than once  yes i believe he did  and now mr scott can you explain to the jury why he was so solicitous that you should dispose of your property  i do not know why he should have done so unless he wanted back his money  then he did ask for his own money  no he never asked for it but if i had sold the shares perhaps he might have asked for it  oh said mr chaffanbrass and as he uttered the monosyllable he looked up at the jury and gently shook his head and gently shook his hands mr chaffanbrass was famous for these little silent addresses to the jurybox  but not even yet had he done with this suspicious loan we cannot follow him through the whole of his examination for he kept our old friend under the harrow for no less than seven hours though he himself made no further statement to the jury he made it perfectly plain by undys own extracted admissions or by the hesitation of his denials that he had knowingly received this money out of his nieces fortune and that he had refused to sell the shares bought with this money when pressed to do so by tudor in order that the trustmoney might be again made up  there were those who blamed mr chaffanbrass for thus admitting that his client had made away with his wards money by lending it to undy but that acute gentleman saw clearly that he could not contend against the fact of the property having been fraudulently used but he saw that he might induce the jury to attach so much guilt to undy that tudor would as it were be whitened by the blackness of the others villany the judge he well knew would blow aside all this froth but then the judge could not find the verdict  towards the end of the day when undy was thoroughly worn outat which time however mr chaffanbrass was as brisk as ever for nothing ever wore him out when he was pursuing his gamewhen the interest of those who had been sweltering in the hot court all the day was observed to flag mr chaffanbrass began twisting round his finger a bit of paper of which those who were best acquainted with his manner knew that he would soon make use  mr scott said he suddenly dropping the derisive sarcasm of his former tone and addressing him with all imaginable courtesy could you oblige me by telling me whose handwriting that is and he handed to him the scrap of paper undy took it and saw that the writing was his own his eyes were somewhat dim and he can hardly be said to have read it it was a very short memorandum and it ran as follows all will yet be well if those shares be ready tomorrow morning  well mr scott said the lawyer do you recognize the handwriting  undy looked at it and endeavoured to examine it closely but he could not his eyes swam and his head was giddy and he felt sick could he have satisfied himself that the writing was not clearly and manifestly his own he would have denied the document altogether but he feared to do this the handwriting might be proved to be his own  it is something like my own said he  something like your own is it said mr chaffanbrass as though he were much surprised like your own well will you have the goodness to read it  undy turned it in his hand as though the proposed task were singularly disagreeable to him why thought he to himself should he be thus browbeaten by a dirty old newgate lawyer why not pluck up his courage and at any rate show that he was a man no said he i will not read it  then i will gentlemen of the jury have the goodness to listen to me of course there was a contest then between him and the lawyers on the other side whether the document might or might not be read but equally of course the contest ended in the judges decision that it should be read and mr chaffanbrass did read it in a voice audible to all men all will yet be well if those shares be ready tomorrow morning we may take it as admitted i suppose that this is in your handwriting mr scott  it probably may be though i will not say that it is  do you not know sir with positive certainty that it is your writing  to this undy made no direct answer what is your opinion mr scott said the judge you can probably give an opinion by which the jury would be much guided  i think it is my lord said undy  he thinks it is said mr chaffanbrass addressing the jury well for once i agree with you i think it is alsoand how will you have the goodness to explain it to whom was it addressed  i cannot say  when was it written  i do not know  what does it mean  i cannot remember  was it addressed to mr tudor  i should think not  now mr scott have the goodness to look at the jury and to speak a little louder you are in the habit of addressing a larger audience than this and cannot therefore be shamefaced you mean to tell the jury that you think that that note was not intended by you for mr tudor  i think not said undy  but you cant say who it was intended for  no  and by the virtue of your oath you have told us all that you know about it undy remained silent but mr chaffanbrass did not press him for an answer you have a brother named valentine i think now captain val had been summoned also and was at this moment in court mr chaffanbrass requested that he might be desired to leave it and consequently he was ordered out in charge of a policeman  and now mr scottwas that note written by you to mr tudor with reference to certain shares which you proposed that mr tudor should place in your brothers hands now sir i ask you as a member of parliament as a member of the government as the son of a peer to give a true answer to that question and then again undy was silent and again mr chaffanbrass leant on the desk and glared at him and remember sir member of parliament and nobleman as you are you shall be indicted for perjury if you are guilty of perjury  my lord said undy writhing in torment am i to submit to this  mr chaffanbrass said the judge you should not threaten your witness mr scottsurely you can answer the question  mr chaffanbrass seemed not to have even heard what the judge said so intently were his eyes fixed on poor undy well mr scott he said at last very softly is it convenient for you to answer me did that note refer to a certain number of bridge shares which you required mr tudor to hand over to the stepfather of this lady  undy had no trust in his brother he felt all but sure that under the fire of mr chaffanbrass he would confess everything it would be terrible to own the truth but it would be more terrible to be indicted for perjury so he sat silent  my lord perhaps you will ask him said mr chaffanbrass  mr scott you understand the questionwhy do you not answer it asked the judge but undy still remained silent  you may go now said mr chaffanbrass your eloquence is of the silent sort but nevertheless it is very impressive you may go now and sit on that bench again if after what has passed the sheriff thinks proper to permit it  undy however did not try that officers complaisance he retired from the witnessbox and was not again seen during the trial in any conspicuous place in the court  it was then past seven oclock but mr chaffanbrass insisted on going on with the examination of captain val it did not last long captain val also was in that disagreeable position that he did not know what undy had confessed and what denied so he also refused to answer the questions of mr chaffanbrass saying that he might possibly damage himself should he do so this was enough for mr chaffanbrass and then his work was done  at eight oclock the court again adjourned again charley posted offfor the third time that dayto let gertrude know that even as yet all was not over and again he and alaric spent a melancholy evening at the neighbouring tavern and then again on the third morning all were reassembled at the old bailey  or rather they were not all reassembled but few came now and they were those who were obliged to come the crack piece of the trial that portion to which among the connoisseurs the interest was attached that was all over mr chaffanbrass had done his work undy scott the member of parliament had been gibbeted and the rest was in comparison stale flat and unprofitable the judge and jury however were there so were the prosecuting counsel so were mr chaffanbrass and mr younglad and so was poor alaric the work of the day was commenced by the judges charge and then alaric to his infinite dismay found how all the sophistry and laboured arguments of his very talented advocate were blown to the winds and shown to be worthless gentlemen said the judge to the jurors after he had gone through all the evidence and told them what was admissible and what was notgentlemen i must especially remind you that in coming to a verdict in the matter no amount of guilt on the part of any other person can render guiltless him whom you are now trying or palliate his guilt if he be guilty an endeavour has been made to affix a deep stigma on one of the witnesses who has been examined before you and to induce you to feel rather than to think that mr tudor is at any rate comparatively innocentinnocent as compared with that gentleman that is not the issue which you are called on to decide not whether mr scott for purposes of his own led mr tudor on to guilt and then turned against him but whether mr tudor himself has or has not been guilty under this act of parliament that has been explained to you  as regards the evidence of mr scott i am justified in telling you that if the prisoners guilt depended in any way on that evidence it would be your duty to receive it with the most extreme caution and to reject it altogether if not corroborated that evidence was not trustworthy and in a great measure justified the treatment which the witness encountered from the learned barrister who examined him but mr scott was a witness for the defence not for the prosecution the case for the prosecution in no way hangs on his evidence  if it be your opinion that mr tudor is guilty and that he was unwarily enticed into guilt by mr scott that the whole arrangement of this trust was brought about by mr scott or others to enable him or them to make a catspaw of this new trustee and thus use the ladys money for their own purposes such an opinion on your part may justify you in recommending the prisoner to the merciful consideration of the bench but it cannot justify you in finding a verdict of not guilty  as alaric heard this and much more to the same effect his hopes which certainly had been high during the examination of undy scott again sank to zero and left him in despair he had almost begun to doubt the fact of his own guilt so wondrously had his conduct been glossed over by mr chaffanbrass so strikingly had any good attempt on his part been brought to the light so black had scott been made to appear ideas floated across his brain that he might go forth not only free of the law but whitewashed also in mens opinions that he might again sit on his throne at the civil service board again cry to himself excelsior and indulge the old dreams of his ambition  but alas the deliberate and wellpoised wisdom of the judge seemed to shower down cold truth upon the jury from his very eyes his words were low in their tone though very clear impassive delivered without gesticulation or artifice such as that so powerfully used by mr chaffanbrass but alaric himself felt that it was impossible to doubt the truth of such a man impossible to suppose that any juryman should do so ah me why had he brought himself thus to quail beneath the gaze of an old man seated on a bench with what object had he forced himself to bend his once proud neck he had been before in courts such as this and had mocked within his own spirit the paraphernalia of the horsehair wigs the judges faded finery and the red cloth he had laughed at the musty stale solemnity by which miscreants were awed and policemen enchanted now these things told on himself heavily enough he felt now their weight and import  and then the jury retired from the court to consider their verdict and mr gitemthruet predicted that they would be hungry enough before they sat down to their next meal his lordship was dead against us said mr gitemthruet but that was a matter of course we must look to the jury and the city juries are very fond of mr chaffanbrass i am not quite sure however that mr chaffanbrass was right i would not have admitted so much myself but then no one knows a city jury so well as mr chaffanbrass  other causes came on and still the jury did not return to court mr chaffanbrass seemed to have forgotten the very existence of alaric tudor and was deeply engaged in vindicating a city butcher from an imputation of having vended a dead ass by way of veal all his indignation was now forgotten and he was full of boisterous fun filling the court with peals of laughter one oclock came two three four five six seven and still no verdict at the latter hour when the court was about to be adjourned the foreman came in and assured the judge that there was no probability that they could agree eleven of them thought one way while the twelfth was opposed to them you must reason with the gentleman said the judge i have my lord said the foreman but its all thrown away upon him reason with him again said the judge rising from his bench and preparing to go to his dinner  and then one of the great fundamental supports of the british constitution was brought into play reason was thrown away upon this tough juryman and therefore it was necessary to ascertain what effect starvation might have upon him a verdict that is a unanimous decision from these twelve men as to alarics guilt was necessary it might be that three would think him innocent and nine guilty or that any other division of opinion might take place but such divisions among a jury are opposed to the spirit of the british constitution twelve men must think alike or if they will not they must be made to do so reason with him again said the judge as he went to his own dinner had the judge bade them remind him how hungry he would soon be if he remained obstinate his lordship would probably have expressed the thought which was passing through his mind there is one of us my lord said the foreman who will i know be very ill before long he is already so bad that he cant sit upright  there are many ludicrous points in our blessed constitution but perhaps nothing so ludicrous as a juryman praying to a judge for mercy he has been caught shut up in a box perhaps for five or six days together badgered with half a dozen lawyers till he is nearly deaf with their continual talking and then he is locked up until he shall die or find a verdict such at least is the intention of the constitution the death however of three or four jurymen from starvation would not suit the humanity of the present age and therefore when extremities are nigh at hand the dying jurymen with medical certificates are allowed to be carried off it is devoutly to be wished that one juryman might be starved to death while thus serving the constitution the absurdity then would cure itself and a verdict of a majority would be taken  but in alarics case reason or hunger did prevail at the last moment and as the judge was leaving the court he was called back to receive the verdict alaric also was brought back still under mr gitemthruets wing and with him came charley a few officers of the court were there a jailer and a policeman or two those whose attendance was absolutely necessary but with these exceptions the place was empty not long since men were crowding for seats and the policemen were hardly able to restrain the pressure of those who pushed forward but now there was no pushing the dingy dirty benches a few inches of which had lately been so desirable were not at all in request and were anything but inviting in appearance alaric sat himself down on the very spot which had lately been sacred to mr chaffanbrass and mr gitemthruet seated above him might also fancy himself a barrister there they sat for five minutes in perfect silence the suspense of the moment cowed even the attorney and charley who sat on the other side of alaric was so affected that he could hardly have spoken had he wished to do so  and then the judge who had been obliged to rearray himself before he returned to the bench again took his seat and an officer of the court inquired of the foreman of the jury in his usual official language what their finding was  guilty on the third count said the foreman not guilty on the four others we beg however most strongly to recommend the prisoner to your lordships merciful consideration believing that he has been led into this crime by one who has been much more guilty than himself  i knew mr chaffanbrass was wrong said mr gitemthruet i knew he was wrong when he acknowledged so much god bless my soul in a court of law one should never acknowledge anything whats the use  and then came the sentence he was to be confined at the penitentiary at millbank for six months the offence said the judge of which you have been found guilty and of which you most certainly have been guilty is one most prejudicial to the interests of the community that trust which the weaker of mankind should place in the stronger that reliance which widows and orphans should feel in their nearest and dearest friends would be destroyed if such crimes as these were allowed to pass unpunished but in your case there are circumstances which do doubtless palliate the crime of which you have been guilty the money which you took will i believe be restored the trust which you were courted to undertake should not have been imposed on you and in the tale of villany which has been laid before us you have by no means been the worst offender i have therefore inflicted on you the slightest penalty which the law allows me mr tudor i know what has been your career how great your services to your country how unexceptionable your conduct as a public servant i trust i do trust i most earnestly most hopefully trust that your career of utility is not over your abilities are great and you are blessed with the power of thinking i do beseech you to consider while you undergo that confinement which you needs must suffer how little any wealth is worth an uneasy conscience  and so the trial was over alaric was taken off in custody the policeman in mufti was released from his attendance and charley with a heavy heart carried the news to gertrude and mrs woodward  and as for me said gertrude when she had so far recovered from the first shock as to be able to talk to her motheras for me i will have lodgings at millbank    chapter xlii  a parting interview   mrs woodward remained with her eldest daughter for two days after the trial and then she was forced to return to hampton she had earnestly entreated gertrude to accompany her with her child but mrs tudor was inflexible she had she said very much to do so much that she could not possibly leave london the house and furniture were on her hands and must be disposed of their future plans must be arranged and then nothing she said should induce her to sleep out of sight of her husbands prison or to omit any opportunity of seeing him which the prison rules would allow her  mrs woodward would not have left one child in such extremity had not the state of another child made her presence at the cottage indispensable katies anxiety about the trial had of course been intense so intense as to give her a false strength and somewhat to deceive linda as to her real state tidings of course passed daily between london and the cottage but for three days they told nothing on the morning of the fourth day however norman brought the heavy news and katie sank completely under it when she first heard the result of the trial she swooned away and remained for some time nearly unconscious but returning consciousness brought with it no relief and she lay sobbing on her pillow till she became so weak that linda in her fright wrote up to her mother begging her to return at once then wretched as it made her to leave gertrude in her trouble mrs woodward did return  for a fortnight after this there was an unhappy household at surbiton cottage lindas marriage was put off till the period of alarics sentence should be over and till something should be settled as to his and gertrudes future career it was now august and they spoke of the event as one which perhaps might occur in the course of the following spring at this time also they were deprived for a while of the comfort of normans visits by his enforced absence at normansgrove harrys eldest brother was again ill and at last the news of his death was received at hampton under other circumstances such tidings as those might to a certain extent have brought their own consolation with them harry would now be mr norman of normansgrove and linda would become mrs norman of normansgrove harrys mother had long been dead and his father was an infirm old man who would be too glad to give up to his son the full management of the estate now that the eldest son was a man to whom that estate could be trusted all those circumstances had of course been talked over between harry and linda and it was understood that harry was now to resign his situation at the weights and measures but alarics condition gertrudes misery and katies illness threw all such matters into the background katie became no better but then the doctors said that she did not become any worse and gave it as their opinion that she ought to recover she had youth they said on her side and then her lungs were not affected this was the great question which they were all asking of each other continually the poor girl lived beneath a stethoscope and bore all their pokings and tappings with exquisite patience she herself believed that she was dying and so she repeatedly told her mother mrs woodward could only say that all was in gods hands but that the physicians still encouraged them to hope the best  one day mrs woodward was sitting with a book in her usual place at the side of katies bed she looked every now and again at her patient and thought that she was slumbering and at last she rose from her chair to creep away so sure was she that she might be spared for a moment but just as she was silently rising a thin slight pale hand crept out from beneath the clothes and laid itself on her arm  i thought you were asleep love said she  no mamma i was not asleep i was thinking of something dont go away mamma just now i want to ask you something  mrs woodward again sat down and taking her daughters hand in her own caressed it  i want to ask a favour of you mamma said katie  a favour my darling what is it you know i will do anything in my power that you ask me  ah mamma i do not know whether you will do this  what is it katie i will do anything that is for your good i am sure you know that katie  mamma i know i am going to die oh mamma dont say anything now dont cry nowdear dear mamma i dont say it to make you unhappy but you know when i am so ill i ought to think about it ought i not mamma  but katie the doctor says that he thinks you are not so dangerously ill you should not therefore despond it will increase your illness and hinder your chance of getting well that would be wrong wouldnt it love  mamma i feel that i shall never again be well and therefore it was useless telling mrs woodward not to cry what else could she do dear mamma i am so sorry to make you unhappy but you are my own mamma and therefore i must tell you i can be happy still mamma if you will let me talk to you about it  you shall talk dearest i will hear what you say but oh katie i cannot bear to hear you talk of dying i do not think you are dying if i did think so my child my trust in your goodness is so strong that i should tell you  you know mamma it might have been much worse suppose i had been drowned when he when charley you know saved me and as she mentioned his name a tear for the first time ran down each cheek how much worse that would have been think mamma what it would be to be drowned without a moment for ones prayers  it is quite right we should prepare ourselves for death whether we live or whether we die we shall be better for doing that  katie still held her mothers hand in hers and lay back against the pillows which had been placed behind her back and now mamma she said at last i am going to ask you this favouri want to see charley once more  mrs woodward was so much astonished at the request that at first she knew not what answer to make to see charley she said at last  yes mamma i want to see charley once more there need be no secrets between us now mamma  there have never been any secrets between us said mrs woodward embracing her you have never had any secrets from me  not intentionally mamma i have never meant to keep anything secret from you and i know you have known what i felt about charley  i know that you have behaved like an angel my child i know your want of selfishness your devotion to others has been such as to shame me i know your conduct has been perfect oh my katie i have understood it and i have so loved you so admired you  katie smiled through her tears as she returned her mothers embrace well mamma she said at any rate you know that i love him oh mamma i do love him so dearly it is not now like gertrudes love or lindas i know that i can never be his wife i did know before that for many reasons i ought not to wish to be so but now i know i never never can be  mrs woodward was past the power of speaking and so katie went on  but i do not love him the less for that reason i think i love him the more i never never could have loved anyone else mamma never never and that is one reason why i do not so much mind being ill now  mrs woodward bowed forward and hid her face in the counterpane but she still kept hold of her daughters hand  and mamma she continued as i do love him so dearly i feel that i should try to do something for him i ought to do so and mamma i could not be happy without seeing him he is not just like a brother or a brotherinlaw such as harry and alaric we are not bound to each other as relations are but yet i feel that something does bind me to him i know he doesnt love me as i love him but yet i think he loves me dearly and if i speak to him now mamma now that i amthat i am so ill perhaps he will mind me mamma it will be as though one came unto him from the dead  mrs woodward did not know how to refuse any request that katie might now make to her and felt herself altogether unequal to the task of refusing this request for many reasons she would have done so had she been able in the first place she did not think that all chance of katies recovery was gone and then at the present moment she felt no inclination to draw closer to her any of the tudor family she could not but feel that alaric had been the means of disgracing and degrading one child and truly deeply warmly as she sympathized with the other she could not bring herself to feel the same sympathy for the object of her love it was a sore day for her and hers that on which the tudors had first entered her house  nevertheless she assented to katies proposal and undertook the task of asking charley down to hampton  since alarics conviction charley led a busy life and as men who have really something to do have seldom time to get into much mischief he had been peculiarly moral and respectable it is not surprising that at such a moment gertrude found that alarics newer friends fell off from him of course they did nor is it a sign of ingratitude or heartlessness in the world that at such a period of great distress new friends should fall off new friends like ones best coat and polished patentleather dress boots are only intended for holiday wear at other times they are neither serviceable nor comfortable they do not answer the required purposes and are ill adapted to give us the ease we seek a new coat however has this advantage that it will in time become old and comfortable so much can by no means be predicted with certainty of a new friend woe to those men who go through the world with none but new coats on their backs with no boots but those of polished leather with none but new friends to comfort them in adversity  but not the less when misfortune does come are we inclined to grumble at finding ourselves deserted gertrude though she certainly wished to see no mrs val and no miss neverbends did feel lonely enough when her mother left her and wretched enough but she was not altogether deserted at this time charley was true to her and did for her all those thousand nameless things which a woman cannot do for herself he came to her everyday after leaving his office and on one excuse or another remained with her till late every evening  he was not a little surprised one morning on receiving mrs woodwards invitation to hampton mrs woodward in writing had had some difficulty in wording her request she hardly liked asking charley to come because katie was ill nor did she like to ask him without mentioning katies illness i need not explain to you she said in her note that we are all in great distress poor katie is very ill and you will understand what we must feel about alaric and gertrude harry is still at normansgrove we shall all be glad to see you and katie who never forgets what you did for her insists on my asking you at once i am sure you will not refuse her so i shall expect you tomorrow charley would not have refused her anything and it need hardly be said that he accepted the invitation  mrs woodward was at a loss how to receive him or what to say to him though katie was so positive that her own illness would be fatala symptom which might have confirmed those who watched her in their opinion that her disease was not consumptionher mother was by no means so desponding she still thought it not impossible that her child might recover and so thinking could not but be adverse to any declaration on katies part of her own feelings she had endeavoured to explain this to her daughter but katie was so carried away by her enthusiasm was at the present moment so devoted and as it were exalted above her present life that all that her mother said was thrown away upon her mrs woodward might have refused her daughters request and have run the risk of breaking her heart by the refusal but now that the petition had been granted it was useless to endeavour to teach her to repress her feelings  charley said mrs woodward when he had been some little time in the house our dear katie wants to see you she is very ill you know  charley said he knew she was ill  you remember our walk together charley  yes said charley i remember it well i made you a promise then and i have kept it i have now come here only because you have sent for me this he said in the tone which a man uses when he feels himself to have been injured  i know it charley you have kept your promise i knew you would and i know you will i have the fullest trust in you and now you shall come and see her  charley was to return to town that night and they had not therefore much time to lose they went upstairs at once and found linda and uncle bat in the patients room it was a lovely august evening and the bedroom window opening upon the river was unclosed katie as she sat propped up against the pillows could look out upon the water and see the reedy island on which in happy former days she had so delighted to let her imagination revel  it is very good of you to come and see me charley said she as he made his way up to her bedside  he took her wasted hand in his own and pressed it and as he did so a tear forced itself into each corner of his eyes she smiled as though to cheer him and said that now she saw him she could be quite happy only for poor alaric and gertrude she hoped she might live to see alaric again but if not charley was to give him her bestbest love  live to see him of course you will said uncle bat  whats to hinder you uncle bat like the rest of them tried to cheer her and make her think that she might yet live  after a while uncle bat went out of the room and linda followed him mrs woodward would fain have remained but she perfectly understood that it was part of the intended arrangement with katie that charley should be alone with her i will come back in a quarter of an hour she said rising to follow the others you must not let her talk too much charley you see how weak she is  mamma when you come knock at the door will you said katie mrs woodward who found herself obliged to act in complete obedience to her daughter promised that she would and then they were left alone  sit down charley said she he was still standing by her bedside and now at her bidding he sat in the chair which captain cuttwater had occupied come here nearer to me said she this is where mamma always sits and linda when mamma is not here charley did as he was bid and changing his seat came and sat down close to her bedhead  charley do you remember how you went into the water for me said she again smiling and pulling her hand out and resting it on his arm which lay on the bed beside her  indeed i do katiei remember the day very well  that was a very happy day in spite of the tumble was it not charley and do you remember the flowershow and the dance at mrs vals  charley did remember them all well ah me how often had he thought of them  i think of those days so oftentoo often continued katie but dear charley i cannot remember too often that you saved my life  charley once more tried to explain to her that there was nothing worthy of notice in his exploit of that day  well charley i may think as i like you know she said with something of the obstinacy of old days i think you did save my life and all the people in the world wont make me think anything else but charley i have something now to tell you  he sat and listened it seemed to him as though he were only there to listen as though were he to make his own voice audible he would violate the sanctity of the place his thoughts were serious enough but he could not pitch his voice so as to suit the tone in which she addressed him  we were always friends were we not said she we were always good friends charley do you remember how you were to build a palace for me in the dear old island out there you were always so kind so good to me  charley said he remembered it allthey were happy days the happiest days he said that he had ever known  and you used to love me charley  used said he do you think i do not love you now  i am sure you do and charley i love you also that it is that i want to tell you i love you so well that i cannot go away from this world in peace without wishing you farewell charley if you love me you will think of me when i am gone and then for my sake you will be steady  here were all her old words over againyou will be steady wont you charley i know you will be steady now how much must she have thought of him how often must his career have caused her misery and pain how laden must that innocent bosom have been with anxiety on his account he had promised her then that he would reform but he had broken his promise he now promised her again but how could he hope that she would believe him  you know how ill i am dont you you know that i am dying charley  charley of course declared that he still hoped that she would recover  if i thought so said she i should not say what i am now saying but i feel that i may tell the truth dear charley dearest charley i love you with all my hearti do not know how it came so i believe i have always loved you since i first knew you i used to think it was because you saved my life but i know it was not that i was so glad it was you that came to me in the water and not harry so that i know i loved you before that  dear katie you have not loved me or thought of me more than i have loved and thought of you  ah charley she said smiling in her sad sweet wayi dont think you know how a girl can love you have so many things to think of so much to amuse you up in london you dont know what it is to think of one person for days and days and nights and nights together that is the way i have thought of you i dont think there can be any harm she continued in loving a person as i have loved you indeed how could i help it i did not love you on purpose but i think i should be wrong to die without telling you when i am dead charley will you think of this and trytry to give up your bad ways when i tell you that i love you so dearly and ask you on my deathbed i think you will do this  charley went down on his knees and bowing his head before her and before his god he made the promise he made it and we may so far anticipate the approaching end of our story as to declare that the promise he then made was faithfully kept  katie katie my own katie my own own own katieoh katie you must not die you must not leave me oh katie i have so dearly loved you oh katie i do so dearly love you if you knew all if you could know all you would believe me  at this moment mrs woodward knocked at the door and charley rose from his knees not quite yet mamma said katie as mrs woodward opened the door not quite yet in five minutes mamma you may come mrs woodward not knowing how to refuse again went away  charley i never gave you anything but once and you returned it to me did you not  yes said he the pursei put it in your box because  and then he remembered that he could not say why he had returned it without breaking in a manner that confidence which mrs woodward had put in him  i understand it all you must not think i am angry with you i know how good you were about it but charley you may have it back now here it is and putting her hand under the pillow she took it out carefully folded up in new tissue paper there charley you must never part with it again as long as there are two threads of it together but i know you never will and charley you must never talk of it to anybody but to your wife and you must tell her all about it  he took the purse and put it to his lips and then pressed it to his heart no said he i will never part with it again i think i can promise that and now dearest goodbye said she dearest dearest charley goodbye perhaps we shall know each other in heaven kiss me charley before you go so he stooped down over her and pressed his lips to hers  charley leaving the room found mrs woodward at the other end of the passage standing at the door of her own dressingroom you are to go to her now he said goodbye and without further speech to any of them he hurried out of the house  none but mrs woodward had seen him but she saw that the tears were streaming down his cheeks as he passed her and she expressed no surprise that he had left the cottage without going through the formality of making his adieux  and then he walked up to town as norman once had done after a parting interview with her whom he had loved it might be difficult to say which at the moment suffered the bitterest grief    chapter xliii  millbank   the immediate neighbourhood of millbank penitentiary is not one which we should for its own sake choose for our residence either on account of its natural beauty or the excellence of its habitations that it is a salubrious locality must be presumed from the fact that it has been selected for the site of the institution in question but salubrity though doubtless a great recommendation would hardly reconcile us to the extremely dull and one might almost say ugly aspect which this district bears  to this district however ugly as it is we must ask our readers to accompany us while we pay a short visit to poor gertrude it was certainly a sad change from her comfortable nursery and elegant drawingroom near hyde park gertrude had hitherto never lived in an ugly house surbiton cottage and albany place were the only two homes that she remembered and neither of them was such as to give her much fitting preparation for the melancholy shelter which she found at no 5 paradise row millbank  but gertrude did not think much of this when she changed her residence early one morning leaning on charleys arm she had trudged down across the park through westminster and on to the close vicinity of the prison and here they sought for and obtained such accommodation as she thought fitting to her present situation charley had begged her to get into a cab and when she refused that had implored her to indulge in the luxury of an omnibus but gertrudes mind was now set upon economy she would come back she said in an omnibus when the day would be hotter and she would be alone but she was very well able to walk the distance once  she procured for seven shillings a week a sittingroom and bedroom from whence she could see the gloomy prison walls and also a trucklebed for the young girl whom she was to bring with her as her maid this was a little hampton maiden whom she had brought from the country to act as fag and deputy to her grand nurse but the grand nurse was now gone and the fag was promoted to the various offices of nurse ladysmaid and parlour servant the rest of the household in albany place had already dispersed with the discreet view of bettering their situations  everything in the house was given up to pay what alaric owed independently of his dreadful liability to madame jaquêtanàpe he could not have been said to be in debt but still like most other men who live as he had done when his career was thus brought to a sudden close it was found that there were many people looking for money there were little bills as the owners said of them which had been forgotten of course on account of their insignificance but which being so very little might now be paid equally of course without any trouble it is astonishing how easy it is to accumulate three or four hundred pounds worth of little bills when one lives before the world in a good house and in visible possession of a good income  at the moment of alarics conviction there was but a slender stock of money forthcoming for these little bills the necessary expense of his trialand it had been by no means triflinghe had of course been obliged to pay his salary had been suspended and all the money that he could lay his hands on had been given up towards making restitution towards the dreadful sum of £20000 that had been his ruin the bills however did not come in till after his trial and then there was but little left but the furniture  as the new trustees employed on behalf of madame jaquêtanàpe and mr figgs were well aware that they had much more to expect from the generosity of tudors friends than from any legal seizure of his property they did not interfere in the disposal of the chairs and tables but not on that account did gertrude conceive herself entitled to make any use on her own behalf of such money as might come into her hands the bills should be paid and then every farthing that could be collected should be given towards lessening the deficiency six thousand pounds had already been made up by the joint efforts of norman and captain cuttwater undy scotts acknowledgement for the other four thousand had been offered but the new trustees declined to accept it as of any value whatsoever they were equally incredulous as to the bridge shares which from that day to this have never held up their heads even to the modest height of half a crown a share  gertrudes efforts to make the most of everything had been unceasing when her husband was sentenced she had in her possession a new dress and some finery for her baby which were not yet paid for these she took back with her own hand offering to the milliners her own trinkets by way of compensation for their loss when the day for removal came she took with her nothing that she imagined could be sold she would have left the grander part of her own wardrobe if the auctioneers would have undertaken to sell it some few things books and trifling household articles which she thought were dear to alaric she packed up and such were sent to hampton on the day of her departure she dressed herself in a plain dark gown one that was almost mourning and then with her baby in her lap and her young maid beside her and charley fronting her in the cab she started for her new home  i had almost said that her pride had left her such an assertion would be a gross libel on her no she was perhaps prouder than ever as she left her old home there was a humility in her cheap dress in her large straw bonnet coming far over her face in her dark gloves and little simple collar nay there was a humility in her altered voice and somewhat chastened mien but the spirit of the woman was wholly unbroken she had even a pride in her very position in her close and dear tie with the convicted prisoner she was his for better and for worse she would now show him what was her idea of the vow she had made to the men who came to ticket and number the furniture to the tradesmens messengers who called for money to the various workmen with whom the house was then invaded she was humble enough but had mrs val come across her with pity or the miss neverbends with their sententious twaddlings she would have been prouder than ever fallen indeed she had had no fall nor had he he was still a man with a greater aggregate of good in him than falls to the average lot of mortals who would dare to tell her that he had fallen twas thus that her pride was still strong within her and as it supported her through this misery who can blame her for it  she was allowed into the prison twice a week on tuesdays and fridays she was permitted to spend one hour with her husband and to take her child with her it is hardly necessary to say that she was punctual to the appointed times this however occupied but a short period even of those lookedfor days and in spite of her pride and her constant needle the weary six months went from her all too slowly  nor did they pass with swifter foot within the prison alaric was allowed the use of books and pens and paper but even with these he found a day in prison to be almost an unendurable eternity this was the real punishment of his guilt it was not that he could not eat well and lie soft or enjoy the comforts which had always surrounded him but that the day would not pass away the slowness of the lagging hours nearly drove him mad he made a thousand resolutions as to reading writing and employment for his mind he attempted to learn whole pages by rote and to fatigue himself to rest by exercise of his memory but his memory would not work his mind would continue idle he was impotent over his own faculties oh if he could only sleep while these horrid weeks were passing over him  all hope of regaining his situation had of course passed from him all hope of employment in england emigration must now be his lot and hers also and the lot of that young one that was already born to them and of that other one who was alas now coming to the world whose fate it would be first to see the light under the walls of its fathers prisonyes they must emigratebut there was nothing so very terrible in that alaric felt that even his utter poverty would be no misfortune if only his captivity were over povertyhow could any man be poor who had liberty to roam the world  we all of us acknowledge that the educated man who breaks the laws is justly liable to a heavier punishment than he who has been born in ignorance and bred as it were in the lap of sin but we hardly realize how much greater is the punishment which when he be punished the educated man is forced to undergo confinement to the man whose mind has never been lifted above vacancy is simply remission from labour confinement with labour is simply the enforcement of that which has hitherto been his daily lot but what must a prison be to him whose intellect has received the polish of the worlds poetry who has known what it is to feed more than the belly to require other aliment than bread and meat  and then what does the poor criminal lose his all it will be said and the rich can lose no more but this is not so no man loses his all by any sentence which a human judge can inflict no man so loses anything approaching to his all however much he may have lost before but the one man has too often had no selfrespect to risk the other has stood high in his own esteem has held his head proudly before the world has aspired to walk in some way after the fashion of a god alaric had so aspired and how must he have felt during those prison days of what nature must his thoughts have been when they turned to gertrude and his child his sin had indeed been heavy and heavy was the penalty which he suffered when they had been thus living for about three months gertrudes second child was born mrs woodward was with her at the time and she had suffered but little except that for three weeks she was unable to see her husband then in the teeth of all counsel and in opposition to all medical warning she could resist no longer and carried the newborn stranger to his father  poor little wretch said alaric as he stooped to kiss him  wretch said gertrude looking up to him with a smile upon her facehe is no wretch he is a sturdy little man that shall yet live to make your heart dance with joy  mrs woodward came often to see her she did not stay for there was no bed in which she could have slept but the train put her down at vauxhall and she had but to pass the bridge and she was close to gertrudes lodgings and now the six months had nearly gone by when by appointment she brought norman with her at this time he had given up his clerkship at the weights and measures and was about to go to normansgrove for the remainder of the winter both alaric and norman had shown a great distaste to meet each other but harrys heart softened towards gertrude her conduct during her husbands troubles had been so excellent that he could not but forgive her the injuries which he fancied he owed to her  everything was now prepared for their departure they were to sail on the very day after alarics liberation so as to save him from the misery of meeting those who might know him and now harry came with mrs woodward to bid farewell probably for ever on this side the grave to her whom he had once looked on as his own how different were their lots now harry was mr norman of normansgrove immediately about to take his place as the squire of his parish to sit among brother magistrates to decide about roads and poachers parish rates and other allabsorbing topics to be a rural magistrate and fill a place among perhaps the most fortunate of the worlds inhabitants gertrude was the wife of a convicted felon who was about to come forth from his prison in utter poverty a man who in such a catalogue as the world makes of its inhabitants would be ranked among the very lowest  and did gertrude even now regret her choice no not for a moment she still felt certain in her heart of hearts that she had loved the one who was the most worthy of a womans love we cannot probably all agree in her opinion but we will agree in this at least that she was now right to hold such opinion had normansgrove stretched from one boundary of the county to the other it would have weighed as nothing had harrys virtues been as bright as burnished goldand indeed they had been brightthey would have weighed as nothing a nobler stamp of manhood was on her husbandso at least gertrude feltand manhood is the one virtue which in a womans breast outweighs all others  they had not met since the evening on which gertrude had declared to him that she never could love him and norman as he got out of the cab with mrs woodward at no 5 paradise row millbank felt his heart beat within him almost as strongly as he had done when he was about to propose to her he followed mrs woodward into the dingy little house and immediately found himself in gertrudes presence  i should exaggerate the fact were i to say that he would not have known her but had he met her elsewhere met her where he did not expect to meet her he would have looked at her more than once before he felt assured that he was looking at gertrude woodward it was not that she had grown pale or worn or haggard though indeed her face had on it that weighty look of endurance which care will always give it was not that she had lost her beauty and become unattractive in his eyes but that the whole nature of her mien and form the very trick of her gait was changed her eye was as bright as ever but it was steady composed and resolved her lips were set and compressed and there was no playfulness round her mouth her hair was still smooth and bright but it was more brushed off from her temples than it had been of yore and was partly covered by a bit of black lace which we presume we must call a cap here and there too through it normans quick eye detected a few grey hairs she was stouter too than she had been or else she seemed to be so from the changes in her dress her step fell heavier on the floor than it used to do and her voice was quicker and more decisive in its tones when she spoke to her mother she did so as one sister might do to another and indeed mrs woodward seemed to exercise over her very little of the authority of a parent the truth was that gertrude had altogether ceased to be a girl had altogether become a woman linda with whom norman at once compared her though but one year younger was still a child in comparison with her elder sister happy happy linda  gertrude had certainly proved herself to be an excellent wife but perhaps she might have made herself more pleasing to others if she had not so entirely thrown off from herself all traces of juvenility could she in this respect have taken a lesson from her mother she would have been a wiser woman we have said that she consorted with mrs woodward as though they had been sisters but one might have said that gertrude took on herself the manners of the elder sister it is true that she had hard duties to perform a stern world to overcome an uphill fight before her with poverty distress and almost nay absolutely with degradation it was well for her and alaric that she could face it all with the true courage of an honest woman but yet those who had known her in her radiant early beauty could not but regret that the young freshness of early years should all have been laid aside so soon  linda at any rate far exceeds her in beauty was normans first thought as he stood for a moment to look at herand then linda too is so much more feminine twas thus that harry norman consoled himself in the first moment of his first interview with alarics wife and he was right in his thoughts the world would now have called linda the more lovely of the two and certainly the more feminine in the ladylike sense of the word if however devotion be feminine and truth to one selected lifes companion if motherly care be so and an indomitable sense of the duties due to ones own household then gertrude was not deficient in feminine character  you find me greatly altered harry do you not said she taking his hand frankly and perceiving immediately the effect which she had made upon him i am a steady old matron am i notwith a bairn on each side of me and she pointed to her baby in the cradle and to her other boy sitting on his grandmothers knee  harry said he did find her altered it was her dress he said and the cap on her head  yes harry and some care and trouble too to you you know to a friend such as you are i must own that care and trouble do tell upon one not thank god that i have more than i can bear not that i have not blessings for which i cannot but be too thankful  and so these are your boys gertrude  yes said she cheerfully these are the little men that in the good times coming will be managing vast kingdoms and giving orders to this wornout old island of yours alley my boy sing your new song about the good and happy land but alley who had got hold of his grandmothers watch and was staring with all his eyes at the stranger did not seem much inclined to be musical at the present moment  and this is charleys godson continued gertrude taking up the baby dear charley he has been such a comfort to me  i have heard all about you daily from him said harry  i know you haveand he is daily talking of you harry and so he should do so we all should do what a glorious change this is for him is it not harry  charley by this time had torn himself away from mr snape and the navvies and transferred the whole of his official zeal and energies to the weights and measures the manner and reason of this must however be explained in a subsequent chapter  yes said harry he has certainly got into a better office  and he will do well there  i am sure he will it was impossible he should do well at that other place no man could do so he is quite an altered man now the only fault i find with him is that he is so full of his heroes and heroines  so he is harry he is always asking me what he is to do with some forlorn lady or gentleman oh smother her i said the other day well said he with a melancholy gravity ill try it but i fear it wont answer poor charley what a friend you have been to him harry  a friend said mrs woodward who was still true to her adoration of norman indeed he has been a frienda friend to us all who is there like him  gertrude could have found it in her heart to go back to the subject of old days and tell her mother that there was somebody much better even than harry norman but the present was hardly a time for such an assertion of her own peculiar opinion  yes harry she said we have all much too much to thank you for i have to thank you on his account  oh no said he ungraciously there is nothing to thank me fornot on his account your mother and captain cuttwater and then he stopped himself what he meant was that he had sacrificed his little fortunefor at the time his elder brother had still been livingnot to rescue or in attempting to rescue his old friend from misfortunenot at least because that man had been his friend but because he was the husband of gertrude woodward and of mrs woodwards daughter could he have laid bare his heart he would have declared that alaric tudor owed him nothing that he had never forgiven never could forgive the wrongs he had received from him but that he had forgiven alarics wife and that having done so in the tenderness of his heart he had been ready to give up all that he possessed for her protection he would have spared gertrude what pain he could but he would not lie and speak of alaric tudor with affection  but there is harry there is said gertrude muchtoo much greatly too much it is that now weighs me down more than anything oh harry how are we to pay to you all this money  it is with mrs woodward said he coldly and captain cuttwater not with me that you should speak of that mr tudor owes me nothing  oh harry harry said she do not call him mr tudorpray pray now that we are goingnow that we shall never wound your sight again do not call him mr tudor  he has done wrong i do not deny it but which of us is there that has not  it was not on that account said he i could forgive all that  gertrude understood him and her cheeks and brow became tinged with red it was not from shame nor yet wholly from a sense of anger but mingled feelings filled her heart feelings which she could in nowise explain if you have forgiven him thatshe would have said had she thought it right to speak out her mindif you have forgiven him that then there is nothing left for further forgiveness  gertrude had twice a better knowledge of the world than he had twice a quicker perception of how things were going and should be made to go she saw that it was useless to refer further to her husband norman had come there at her request to say adieu to her that she and he who had been friends since she was a child might see each other before they were separated for ever by half a world and that they might part in love and charity she would be his sisterinlaw he would be son to her mother husband to her linda he had been though he now denied it her husbands staunchest friend in his extremity and it would have added greatly to the bitterness of her departure had she been forced to go without speaking to him one kindly word the opportunity was given to her and she would not utterly mar its sweetness by insisting on his injustice to her husband  they all remained silent for a while during which gertrude fondled her baby and norman produced before the elder boy some present that he had brought for him  now alley said mrs woodward youre a made man wont that do beautifully to play with on board the big ship  and so harry you have given up official life altogether said gertrude  yes said hethe last day of the last year saw my finale at the weights and measures i did not live longofficiallyto enjoy my promotion i almost wish myself back again  youll go in on melting days like the retired tallowchandler said gertrude but joking apart i wish you joy on your freedom from thraldom a government office in england is thraldom if a man were to give his work only it would be well all men who have to live by labour must do that but a man has to give himself as well as his work to sacrifice his individuality to become body and soul a part of a lumbering old machine  this hardly came well from gertrude seeing that alaric at any rate had never been required to sacrifice any of his individuality but she was determined to hate all the antecedents of his life as though those antecedents and not the laxity of his own principles had brought about his ruin she was prepared to live entirely for the future and to look back on her london life as bad tasteless and demoralizing england to her was no longer a glorious country for englands laws had made a felon of her husband she would go to a new land new hopes new ideas new freedom new work new life and new ambition excelsior there was no longer an excelsior left for talent and perseverance in this effete country she and hers would soon find room for their energies in a younger land and as she went she could not but pity those whom she left behind her reasoning was hardly logical but perhaps it was not unfortunate  for myself said norman not quite following all thisi always liked the civil service and now i leave it with a sort of regret i am quite glad that charley has my old desk it will keep up a sort of tie between me and the place  what does linda say about it mamma  linda and i are both of harrys way of thinking said mrs woodward because normansgrove is such a distance  distance repeated gertrude with something of sorrow but more of scorn in her tone distance mamma why you can get to her between breakfast and dinner think where melbourne is mamma  it has nearly broken my heart to think of it said mrs woodward  and you will still have linda mamma and our darling katie and harry and dear charley if the idea of distance should frighten anyone it is me but nothing shall frighten me while i have my husband and children harry you must not let mamma be too often alone when some other knight shall have come and taken away katie  we will take her to normansgrove for good and all if she will let us said harry  and now the time came for them to part harry was to say goodbye to her and then to see her no more early on the following morning gertrude was to go to hampton and see katie for the last time to see katie for the last time and the cottage and the shining river and all the wellknown objects among which she had passed her life to mrs woodward to linda and katie all this was subject of inexpressible melancholy but with gertrude every feeling of romance seemed to have been absorbed by the realities of life she would of course go to katie and give her a farewell embrace since katie was still too weak to come to her she would say farewell to uncle bat to whom she and alaric owed so much she would doubtless shed a tear or two and feel some emotion at parting even from the inanimate associations of her youth but all this would now impress no lasting sorrow on her  she was eager to be off eager for her new career eager that he should stand on a soil where he could once more face his fellowcreatures without shame she panted to put thousands of leagues of ocean between him and his disgrace  on the following morning gertrude was to go to hampton for two hours and then to return to millbank with her mother and sister for whose accommodation a bed had been hired in the neighbourhood on that evening alaric would be released from his prison and then before daybreak on the following day they were to take their way to the faroff docks and place themselves on board the vessel which was to carry them to their distant home  god bless you gertrude said norman whose eyes were not dry  god almighty bless you harry you and lindaand make you happy if linda does not write constantly very constantly you must do it for her we have delayed the happiness of your marriage harryyou must forgive us that as well as all our other trespasses i fear linda will never forgive that  you wont find her unmerciful on that score said he dear gertrude goodbye  she put up her face to him and he kissed her for the first time in his life he bade me give you his love said she in her last whisper i must you know do his bidding  normans heart palpitated so that he could hardly compose his voice for his last answer but even then he would not be untrue to his inexorable obstinacy he could not send his love to a man he did not love tell him said he that he has my sincerest wishes for success wherever he may be and gertrude i need hardly say but he could get no further  and so they parted    chapter xliv  the criminal population is disposed of   before we put alaric on board the ship which is to take him away from the land in which he might have run so exalted a career we must say one word as to the fate and fortunes of his old friend undy scott this gentleman has not been represented in our pages as an amiable or highminded person he has indeed been the bad spirit of the tale the siva of our mythology the devil that has led our hero into temptation the incarnation of evil which it is always necessary that the novelist should have personified in one of his characters to enable him to bring about his misfortunes his tragedies and various requisite catastrophes scott had his varney and suchlike dickens his bill sykes and suchlike all of whom are properly disposed of before the end of those volumes in which are described their respective careers  i have ventured to introduce to my readers as my devil mr undy scott mp for the tillietudlem district burghs and i also feel myself bound to dispose of him though of him i regret i cannot make so decent an end as was done with sir richard varney and bill sykes  he deserves however as severe a fate as either of those heroes with the former we will not attempt to compare him as the vices and devilry of the days of queen elizabeth are in no way similar to those in which we indulge but with bill sykes we may contrast him as they flourished in the same era and had their points of similitude as well as their points of difference  they were both apparently born to prey on their own species they both resolutely adhered to a fixed rule that they would in nowise earn their bread and to a rule equally fixed that though they would earn no bread they would consume much they were both of them blessed with a total absence of sensibility and an utter disregard to the pain of others and had no other use for a heart than that of a machine for maintaining the circulation of the blood it is but little to say that neither of them ever acted on principle on a knowledge that is of right and wrong and a selection of the right in their studies of the science of evil they had progressed much further than this and had taught themselves to believe that that which other men called virtue was on its own account to be regarded as mawkish insipid and useless for such purposes as the acquisition of money or pleasure whereas vice was on its own account to be preferred as offering the only road to those things which they were desirous of possessing  so far there was a great resemblance between bill sykes and mr scott but then came the points of difference which must give to the latter a great preeminence in the eyes of that master whom they had both so worthily served bill could not boast the merit of selecting the course which he had run he had served the devil having had as it were no choice in the matter he was born and bred and educated an evildoer and could hardly have deserted from the colours of his great captain without some spiritual interposition to enable him to do so to undy a warmer reward must surely be due he had been placed fairly on the worlds surface with power to choose between good and bad and had deliberately taken the latter to him had at any rate been explained the theory of meum and tuum and he had resolved that he liked tuum better than meum he had learnt that there is a god ruling over us and a devil hankering after us and had made up his mind that he would belong to the latter bread and water would have come to him naturally without any villany on his part aye and meat and milk and wine and oil the fat things of the world but he elected to be a villain he liked to do the devils biddingsurely he was the better servant surely he shall have the richer reward  and yet poor bill sykes for whom here i would willingly say a word or two could i by so saying mitigate the wrath against him is always held as the more detestable scoundrel lady you now know them both is it not the fact that knowing him as you do you could spend a pleasant hour enough with mr scott sitting next to him at dinner whereas your blood would creep within you your hair would stand on end your voice would stick in your throat if you were suddenly told that bill sykes was in your presence  poor bill i have a sort of love for him as he walks about wretched with that dog of his though i know that it is necessary to hang him yes bill i your friend cannot gainsay that must acknowledge that hard as the case may be you must be hung hung out of the way of further mischief my spoons my wifes throat my childrens brains demand that you bill and polecats and suchlike must be squelched when we can come across you seeing that you make yourself so universally disagreeable it is your ordained nature to be disagreeable you plead silently i know it i admit the hardship of your case but still my bill selfpreservation is the first law of nature you must be hung but while hanging you i admit that you are more sinned against than sinning there is another bill another who will surely take account of this in some way though it is not for me to tell you how  yes i hang bill sykes with soft regret but with what a savage joy with what exultation of heart with what alacrity of eager soul with what aptitude of mind to the deed would i hang my friend undy scott the member of parliament for the tillietudlem burghs if i could but get at his throat for such a purpose hang him aye as high as haman in this there would be no regret no vacillation of purpose no doubt as to the propriety of the sacrifice no feeling that i was so treating him not for his own desert but for my advantage  we hang men i believe with this object only that we should deter others from crime but in hanging bill we shall hardly deter his brother bill sykes must look to crime for his bread seeing that he has been so educated seeing that we have not yet taught him another trade  but if i could hang undy scott i think i should deter some others the figure of undy swinging from a gibbet at the broad end of lombard street would have an effect ah my fingers itch to be at the rope  fate however and the laws are averse to gibbet him in one sense would have been my privilege had i drunk deeper from that castalian rill whose dark waters are tinged with the gall of poetic indignation but as in other sense i may not hang him i will tell how he was driven from his club and how he ceased to number himself among the legislators of his country  undy scott among his other good qualities possessed an enormous quantity of that which schoolboys in these days call cheek he was not easily browbeaten and was generally prepared to browbeat others mr chaffanbrass certainly did get the better of him but then mr chaffanbrass was on his own dunghill could undy scott have had mr chaffanbrass down at the clubs there would have been perhaps another tale to tell  give me the cock that can crow in any yard such cocks however we know are scarce undy scott as he left the old bailey was aware that he had cut a sorry figure and felt that he must immediately do something to put himself right again at any rate before his portion of the world he must perform some exploit uncommonly cheeky in order to cover his late discomfiture to get the better of mr chaffanbrass at the old bailey had been beyond him but he might yet do something at the clubs to set aside the unanimous verdict which had been given against him in the city nay he must do something unless he was prepared to go to the wall utterly and at once  going to the wall with undy would mean absolute ruin he lived but on the cheekiness of his gait and habits he had become member of parliament government official railway director and club aristocrat merely by dint of cheek he had now received a great blow he had stood before a crowd and been annihilated by the better cheek of mr chaffanbrass and therefore it behoved him at once to do something when the perfume of the rose grows stale the flower is at once thrown aside and carried off as foul refuse it behoved undy to see that his perfume was maintained in its purity or he too would be carried off  the club to which undy more especially belonged was called the downing and of this alaric was also a member having been introduced into it by his friend here had alaric spent by far too many of the hours of his married life and had become well known and popular at the time of his conviction the summer was far advanced it was then august but parliament was still sitting and there were sufficient club men remaining in london to create a daily gathering at the downing  on the day following that on which the verdict was found undy convened a special committee of the club in order that he might submit to it a proposition which he thought it indispensable should come from him so at least he declared the committee did assemble and when undy met it he saw among the faces before him not a few with whom he would willingly have dispensed however he had come there to exercise his cheek no one there should cow him the wig of mr chaffanbrass was at any rate absent  and so he submitted his proposition i need not trouble my readers with the neat little speech in which it was made undy was true to himself and the speech was neat the proposition was this that as he had unfortunately been the means of introducing mr alaric tudor to the club he considered it to be his duty to suggest that the name of that gentleman should be struck off the books he then expressed his unmitigated disgust at the crime of which tudor had been found guilty uttered some nice little platitudes in the cause of virtue and expressed a hope that he might so far refer to a personal matter as to say that his fathers family would take care that the lady whose fortune had been the subject of the trial should not lose one penny through the dishonesty of her trustee  oh undy as high as haman if i could as high as haman and if not in lombard street then on that open ground where waterloo place bisects pall mall so that all the clubs might see thee  he would advert he said to one other matter though perhaps his doing so was unnecessary it was probably known to them all that he had been a witness at the late trial an iniquitous attempt had been made by the prisoners counsel to connect his name with the prisoners guilt they all too well knew the latitude allowed to lawyers in the criminal courts to pay much attention to this had he undy scott in any way infringed the laws of his country he was there to answer for it but he would go further than this and declare that if any member of that club doubted his probity in the matter he was perfectly willing to submit to such member documents which would c c  he finished his speech and an awful silence reigned around him no enthusiastic ardour welcomed the wellloved undy back to his club and comforted him after the rough usage of the unpolished chaffanbrass no ten or twenty combined voices expressed by their clamorous negation of the lastproposed process that their undy was above reproach the eyes around looked into him with no friendly alacrity undy undy more cheek still still more cheek or you are surely lost  if said he in a wellassumed indignant tone of injured innocence there be any in the club who do suspect me of anything unbecoming a gentleman in this affair i am willing to retire from it till the matter shall have been investigated but in such case i demand that the investigation be immediate  oh undy undy the supply of cheek is not bad it is all but unlimited but yet it suffices thee not can there be positions in this modern west end world of mine thought undy to himself in which cheek unbounded cheek will not suffice oh undy they are rare but still there are such and this unfortunately for thee seemeth to be one of them  and then got up a discreet old baronet one who moveth not often in the affairs around him but who when he moveth stirreth many waters a man of broad acres and a quiet wellassured fame which has grown to him without his seeking it as barnacles grow to the stout keel when it has been long aswimming him of all men would undy have wished to see unconcerned with these matters  not in many words nor eloquent did sir thomas speak he felt it his duty he said to second the proposal made by mr scott for removing mr tudor from amongst them he had watched this trial with some care and he pitied mr tudor from the bottom of his heart he would not have thought that he could have felt so strong a sympathy for a man convicted of dishonesty but mr tudor had been convicted and he must incur the penalties of his fault one of these penalties must undoubtedly be his banishment from this club he therefore seconded mr scotts proposal  he then stood silent for a moment having finished that task but yet he did not sit down why oh why does he not sit down why o undy does he thus stand looking at the surface of the table on which he is leaning  and now he said he had another proposition to make and that was that mr undecimus scott should also be expelled from the club and having so spoken in a voice of unusual energy he then sat down  and now undy you may as well pack up and be off without further fuss to boulogne ostend or some such idle elysium with such moneyscrapings as you may be able to collect together no importunity will avail thee anything against the judges and jurymen who are now trying thee one word from that silent old baronet was worse to thee than all that mr chaffanbrass could say come pack up and begone  but he was still a member of parliament the parliament however was about to be dissolved and of course it would be useless for him to stand again he like mr mbuffer had had his spell of it and he recognized the necessity of vanishing he at first thought that his life as a legislator might be allowed to come to a natural end that he might die as it were in his bed without suffering the acute pain of applying for the chiltern hundreds in this however he found himself wrong the injured honour of all the tillietudlemites rose against him with one indignant shout and a rumour a horrid rumour of a severer fate met his ears he applied at once for the now coveted sinecureand was refused her majesty could not consent to entrust to him the duties of the situation in question and in lieu thereof the house expelled him by its unanimous voice  and now indeed it was time for him to pack and begone he was now liable to the vulgarest persecution from the vulgar herd his very tailor and bootmaker would beleaguer him and coarse unwashed bailiffs take him by the collar yes now indeed it was time to be off  and off he was he paid one fleeting visit to my lord at cauldkail castle collecting what little he might another to his honourable wife adding some slender increase to his little budget and then he was off whither it is needless to sayto hamburg perhaps or to ems or the richer tables of homburg how he flourished for a while with ambiguous success how he talked to the young english tourists of what he had done when in parliament especially for the rights of married women how he poked his honourable card in every ones way and lugged lord gaberlunzie into all conversations how his face became pimply and his wardrobe seedy and how at last his wretched life will ooze out from him in some dark corner like the filthy juice of a decayed fungus which makes hideous the hidden wall on which it bursts all this is unnecessary more particularly to describe he is probably still living and those who desire his acquaintance will find him creeping round some gambling table and trying to look as though he had in his pocket ample means to secure those hoards of money which men are so listlessly raking about from our view he has now vanished  it was a bitter february morning when two cabs stood packing themselves at no 5 paradise row millbank it was hardly yet six oclock and paradise row was dark as erebus that solitary gaslight sticking out from the wall of the prison only made darkness visible the tallow candles which were brought in and out with every article that was stuffed under a seat or into a corner would get themselves blown out and the sleet which was falling fast made the wicks wet so that they could with difficulty be relighted  but at last the cabs were packed with luggage and into one got gertrude with her husband her baby and her mother and into the other charley handed linda then alley and lastly the youthful maiden who humbly begged his pardon as she stepped up to the vehicle and then having given due directions to the driver he not without difficulty squeezed himself into the remaining space  such journeys as these are always made at a slow pace cabmen know very well who must go fast and who may go slow women with children going on board an emigrant vessel at six oclock on a february morning may be taken very slowly and very slowly gertrude and her party were taken time had beennay it was but the other daywhen alarics impatient soul would have spurned at such a pace as this but now he sat tranquil enough his wife held one of his hands and the other he pressed against his eyes as though shading them from the light light there was none but he had not yet learnt to face mrs woodward even in the darkness  he had come out of the prison on the day before and had spent an evening with her it is needless to say that no one had upbraided him that no one had hinted that his backslidings had caused all this present misery had brought them all to that wretched cabin and would on the morrow separate perhaps for ever a mother and a child who loved each other so dearly no one spoke to him of this perhaps no one thought of it he however did so think of it that he could not hold his head up before them  he was ill gertrude said his long confinement had prostrated him but the sea air would revive him in a day or two and then she made herself busy and got the tea for them and strove not wholly in vain to drive dull care away  but slowly as the cabs went in spite of charleys vocal execrations they did get to the docks in time who indeed was ever too late at the docks who that ever went there had not to linger linger linger till every shred of patience was clean worn out they got to the docks in time and got on board that fastsailing clipperbuilt neverbeaten alwayshealthy ship the flash of lightning 5600 tons a 1 why we have often wondered are ships designated as a 1 seeing that all ships are of that class where is the excellence seeing that all share it of course the flash of lightning was a 1 the author has for years been looking out and has not yet found a ship advertised as a 2 or even as b 1 what is this catalogue of comparative excellence of which there is but one visible number  the world we think makes a great mistake on the subject of saying or acting farewell the word or deed should partake of the suddenness of electricity but we all drawl through it at a snails pace we are supposed to tear ourselves from our friends but tearing is a process which should be done quickly what is so wretched as lingering over a last kiss giving the hand for the third time saying over and over again goodbye john god bless you and mind you write who has not seen his dearest friends standing round the window of a railway carriage while the train would not start and has not longed to say to them stand not upon the order of your going but go at once and of all such farewells the ships farewell is the longest and the most dreary one sits on a damp bench snuffing up the odour of oil and ropes cudgelling ones brains to think what further word of increased tenderness can be spoken no tenderer word can be spoken one returns again and again to the weather to coats and cloaks perhaps even to sandwiches and the sherry flask all effect is thus destroyed and a trespass is made even on the domain of feeling  i remember a line of poetry learnt in my earliest youth and which i believe to have emanated from a sentimental frenchman a man of genius with whom my parents were acquainted it is as follows    are you gois you goneand i leftvera vell  now the whole business of a farewell is contained in that line when the moment comes let that be said let that be said and felt and then let the dear ones depart  mrs woodward and gertrudegod bless themhad never studied the subject they knew no better than to sit in the nasty cabin surrounded by boxes stewards porters children and abominations of every kind holding each others hands and pressing damp handkerchiefs to their eyes the delay the lingering upset even gertrude and brought her for a moment down to the usual level of leavetaking womanhood alaric the meanwhile stood leaning over the taffrail with charley as mute as the fishes beneath him  write to us the moment you get there said charley how often had the injunction been given and now we had better get offyoull be better when we are gone alariccharley had some sense of the truth about himand alaric take my word for it ill come and set the melbourne weights and measures to rights before longill come and weigh your gold for you  we had better be going now said charley looking down into the cabin they may let loose and be off any moment now  oh charley not yet not yet said linda clinging to her sister  youll have to go down to the nore if you stay thats all said charley  and then again began the kissing and the crying yes ye dear onesit is hard to partit is hard for the mother to see the child of her bosom torn from her for ever it is cruel that sisters should be severed it is a harsh sentence for the world to give that of such a separation as this these o ye loving hearts are the penalties of love those that are content to love must always be content to pay them  go mamma go said gertrude dearest best sweetest mothermy own own mother go linda darling linda give my kindest love to harrycharley you and harry will be good to mamma i know you will and mammaand then she whispered to her mother one last prayer in charleys favourshe may love him now indeed she may  alaric came to them at the last momentmrs woodward said he say that you forgive me  i do said she embracing himgod knows that i dobut alaric remember what a treasure you possess  and so they parted may god speed the wanderers    chapter xlv  the fate of the navvies   and now having dispatched alaric and his wife and bairns on their long journey we must go back for a while and tell how charley had been transformed from an impudent idle young navvy into a wellconducted zealous young weights  when alaric was convicted charley had as we all know belonged to the internal navigation when the six months sentence had expired charley was in full blow at the decorous office in whitehall and during the same period norman had resigned and taken on himself the new duties of a country squire the change which had been made had affected others than charley it had been produced by one of those farstretching worldmoving commotions which now and then occur sometimes twice or thrice in a generation and perhaps not again for half a century causing timid men to whisper in corners and the brave and highspirited to struggle with the struggling waves so that when the storm subsides they may be found floating on the surface a moral earthquake had been endured by a portion of the civil service of the country  the internal navigation hadno my prognostic reader it had not been reformed no new blood had been infused into it no attempt had been made to produce a better discipline by the appointment of a younger secretary there had been no carting away of decayed wood in the shape of mr snape or gathering of rank weeds in the form of mr corkscrew nothing of the kind had been attempted nothe disease had gone too far either for phlebotomy purging or cautery the internal navigation had ceased to exist its demise had been in this wiseit may be remembered that some time since mr oldeschole had mentioned in the hearing of mr snape that things were going wrong sir gregory hardlines had expressed an adverse opinion as to the internal navigation and worse ten times worse than that there had been an article in the times now we all know that if anything is ever done in any way towards improvement in these days the public press does it and we all know also of what the public press consists mr oldeschole knew this well and even mr snape had a glimmering idea of the truth when he read that article mr oldeschole felt that his days were numbered and mr snape when he heard of it began to calculate for the hundredth time to what highest amount of pension he might be adjudged to be entitled by a liberalminded treasury minute  mr oldeschole began to set his house in order hopelessly for any such effort the time was gone by it was too late for the office to be so done by and too late for mr oldeschole to do it he had no aptitude for new styles and modern improvements he could not understand sir gregorys code of rules and was dumbfounded by the civil service requisitions that were made upon him from time to time then came frequent calls for him to attend at sir gregorys office there a new broom had been brought in in the place of our poor friend alaric a broom which seemed determined to sweep all before it with an unmitigable energy mr oldeschole found that he could not stand at all before this young hercules seeing that his special stall was considered to be the foulest in the whole range of the augean stables he soon saw that the river was to be turned in on him and that he was to be officially obliterated in the flood  the civility of those wonderdoing demigodsthose magi of the civil service officewas most oppressive to him when he got to the board he was always treated with a deference which he knew was but a prelude to barbaric tortures they would ask him to sit down in a beautiful new leathern armchair as though he were really some great man and then examine him as they would a candidate for the custom house smiling always but looking at him as though they were determined to see through him  they asked him all manner of questions but there was one question which they put to him day after day for four days that nearly drove him mad it was always put by that horrid young lynxeyed new commissioner who sat there with his hair brushed high from off his forehead peering out of his capacious excellentlywashed shirtcollars a personification of conscious official zeal  and now mr oldeschole if you have had leisure to consider the question more fully perhaps you can define to us what is thehumhmthe usehmhmthe exact use of the internal navigation office  and then sir warwick would go on looking through his millstone as though now he really had a hope of seeing something and sir gregory would lean back in his chair and rubbing his hands slowly over each other like a great akinetos as he was wait leisurely for mr oldescholes answer or rather for his no answer  what a question was this to ask of a man who had spent all his life in the internal navigation office o reader should it chance that thou art a clergyman imagine what it would be to thee wert thou asked what is the exact use of the church of england and that too by some stubborn catechist whom thou wert bound to answer or if a lady happy in a husband and family say what would be thy feelings if demanded to define the exact use of matrimony use is it not all in all to thee  mr oldeschole felt a hearty inward conviction that his office had been of very great use in the first place had he not drawn from it a thousand a year for the last fiveandtwenty years had it not given maintenance and employment to many worthy men who might perhaps have found it difficult to obtain maintenance elsewhere had it not always been an office a public office of note and reputation with proper work assigned to it the use of itthe exact use of it mr oldeschole at last declared with some indignation in his tone that he had been there for forty years and knew well that the office was very useful but that he would not undertake to define its exact use thank you thank you mr oldescholethat will do i think said the very sprucelooking new gentleman out of his shirtcollars  in these days there was a kind of prescience at the internal navigation that something special was going to be done with them mr oldeschole said nothing openly but it may be presumed that he did whisper somewhat to those of the seniors around him in whom he most confided and then his frequent visits to whitehall were spoken of even by the most thoughtless of the navvies and the threatenings of the coming storm revealed themselves with more or less distinctness to every mind  at last the thundercloud broke and the bolt fell mr oldeschole was informed that the lords of the treasury had resolved on breaking up the establishment and providing for the duties in another way as the word duties passed sir gregorys lips a slight smile was seen to hover round the mouth of the new commissioner mr oldeschole would he was informed receive an official notification to this effect on the following morning and on the following morning accordingly a dispatch arrived of great length containing the resolution of my lords and putting an absolute extinguisher on the life of every navvy  how mr oldeschole with tears streaming down his cheeks communicated the tidings to the elder brethren and how the elder brethren with palpitating hearts and quivering voices repeated the tale to the listening juniors i cannot now describe the boldest spirits were then cowed the loudest miscreants were then silenced there were but few gibes but little jeering at the internal navigation on that day though charley who had already other hopes contrived to keep up his spirits the men stood about talking in clusters and old animosities were at an end the lamb sat down with the wolf and mr snape and dick scatterall became quite confidential  i knew it was going to happen said mr snape to him indeed mr oldeschole has been consulting us about it for some time but i must own i did not think it would be so sudden i must own that  if you knew it was coming said corkscrew why didnt you tell a chap  i was not at liberty said mr snape looking very wise  we shall all have liberty enough now said scatterall i wonder what theyll do with us eh charley  i believe they will send the worst of us to spike island or dartmoor prison said charley but mr snape no doubt has heard and can tell us  oh come charley it dont do to chaff now said a young navvy who was especially down in the mouth i wonder will they do anything for a fellow  i heard my uncle in parliament street say that when a chap has got any infested interest in a thing they cant turn him out said corkscrew and my uncle is a parliamentary agent  cant they though said scatterall it seems to me that they mean to at any rate there wasnt a word about pensions or anything of that sort was there mr snape  not a word said snape but those who are entitled to pensions cant be affected injuriously as far as i can see they must give me my whole salary i dont think they can do less  youre all serene then mr snape said charley youre in the right box looking at matters in that light mr snape i think you ought to stand something handsome in the shape of lunch come what do you say to chops and stout all round dick will go over and order it in a minute  i wish you wouldnt charley said the navvy who seemed to be most affected and who in his present humour could not endure a joke as mr snape did not seem to accede to charleys views the liberal proposition fell to the ground  care killed a cat said scatterall i shant break my heart about it i never liked the shopdid you charley  well i must say i think we have been very comfortable here under mr snape said charley but if mr snape is to go why the office certainly would be deuced dull without him  charley said the brokenhearted young navvy in a tone of reproach  sorrow however did not take away their appetite and as mr snape did not see fitting occasion for providing a banquet they clubbed together and among them managed to get a spread of beefsteaks and porter scatterall as requested went across the strand to order it at the cookshop while corkscrew and charley prepared the tables and now mind its the thing said dick who with intimate familiarity had penetrated into the eatinghouse kitchen not dry you know or too much done and lots of fat  and then as the generous viands renewed their strength and as the potent stout warmed their blood happier ideas came to them and they began to hope that the world was not all over well i shall try for the customs said the unhappy one after a deep pull at the pewter i shall try for the customs one does get such stunning feeds for tenpence at that place in thames street poor youth his ideas of earning his bread did not in their wildest flight spread beyond the public offices of the civil service  for a few days longer they hung about the old office doing nothinghow could men so circumstanced do anythingand waiting for their fate at last their fate was announced mr oldeschole retired with his full salary secretaries and suchlike always retire with full pay as it is necessary that dignity should be supported mr snape and the other seniors were pensioned with a careful respect to their years of service with which arrangement they all of them expressed themselves highly indignant and loudly threatened to bring the cruelty of their treatment before parliament by the aid of sundry members who were supposed to be on the look out for such work but as nothing further was ever heard of them it may be presumed that the members in question did not regard the case as one on which the government of the day was sufficiently vulnerable to make it worth their while to trouble themselves of the younger clerks two or three including the unhappy one were drafted into other offices some others received one or more years pay and then tore themselves away from the fascinations of london life among those was mr r scatterall who in after years will doubtless become a lawgiver in hongkong for to that colony has he betaken himself some few others more unfortunate than the rest among whom poor screwy was the most conspicuous were treated with a more absolute rigour and were sent upon the world portionless screwy had been constant in his devotion to pork chops and had persisted in spelling blue without the final e he was therefore declared unworthy of any further public confidence whatever he is now in his uncles office in parliament street and it is to be hoped that his peculiar talents may there be found useful  and so the internal navigation office came to an end and the dull dingy rooms were vacant ruthless men shovelled off as waste paper all the lock entries of which charley had once been so proud and the ponderous ledgers which mr snape had delighted to haul about were sent away into cimmerian darkness and probably to utter destruction and then the internal navigation was no more  among those who were drafted into other offices was charley whom propitious fate took to the weights and measures but it must not be imagined that chance took him there the weights and measures was an elysium the door of which was never casually open  charley at this time was a muchaltered man not that he had become a good clerk at his old officesuch a change one may say was impossible there were no good clerks at the internal navigation and charley had so long been among navvies the most knavish or navviest that any such transformation would have met with no credencebut out of his office he had become a muchaltered man as katie had said it was as though some one had come to him from the dead he could not go back to his old haunts he could not return like a dog to his vomit as long as he had that purse so near his heart as long as that voice sounded in his ear while the memory of that kiss lingered in his heart  he now told everything to gertrude all his debts all his love and all his despair there is no relief for sorrow like the sympathy of a friend if one can only find it but then the sympathy must be real mock sympathy always tells the truth against itself always fails to deceive he told everything to gertrude and by her counsel he told much to norman he could not speak to him true friend as he was of katie and her love there was that about the subject which made it too sacred for mans ears too full of tenderness to be spoken of without feminine tears it was only in the little parlour at paradise row when the evening had grown dark and gertrude was sitting with her baby in her arms that the boisterous young navvy could bring himself to speak of his love  during these months katies health had greatly improved and as she herself had gained in strength she had gradually begun to think that it was yet possible for her to live little was now said by her about charley and not much was said of him in her hearing but still she did learn how he had changed his office and with his office his mode of life she did hear of his literary efforts and of his kindness to gertrude and it would seem as though it were ordained that his moral life and her physical life were to gain strength together    chapter xlvi  mr nogos last question   but at this time charley was not idle the fate of crinoline and macassar has not yet been told nor has that of the two rival chieftains the baron of ballyporeen and sir anthony allanadale these heartrending tales appeared in due course bit by bit in the pages of the daily delight on every morning of the week sundays excepted a page and a half of charleys narrative was given to the expectant public and though i am not prepared to say that the public received the offering with any violent acclamations of applause that his name became suddenly that of a great unknown that literary cliques talked about him to the exclusion of other topics or that he rose famous one morning as byron did after the publication of the corsair nevertheless something was said in his praise the daily delight on the whole was rather belittled by its grander brethren of the press but a word or two was said here and there to exempt charleys fictions from the general poohpoohing with which the remainder of the publication was treated  success such as this even is dear to the mind of a young author and charley began to feel that he had done something the editor was proportionably civil to him and he was encouraged to commence a third historiette  we have polished off poison and petticoats pretty well said the editor what do you say to something political  charley had no objection in life  this divorce bill nowwe could have half a dozen married couples all separating getting rid of their ribs and buckling again helterskelter every man to somebody elses wife and the parish parson refusing to do the work just to show the immorality of the thing  charley said hed think about it  or the danubian principalities and the french alliancecould you manage now to lay your scene in constantinople  charley doubted whether he could  or perhaps india is the thing the cawnpore massacre would work up into any lengths you pleased you could get a file of the times you know for your facts  but while the editor was giving these various valuable hints as to the authors future subjects the author himself with base mind was thinking how much he should be paid for his past labours at last he ventured in the mildest manner to allude to the subject  payment said the editor  charley said that he had understood that there was to be some fixed scale of pay so much per sheet or something of that sort  undoubtedly there will said the editor and those who will have the courage and perseverance to work through with us till the publication has obtained that wide popularity which it is sure to achieve will doubtless be paidbe paid as no writers for any periodical in this metropolis have ever yet been paid but at present mr tudor you really must be aware that it is quite out of the question  charley had not the courage and perseverance to work through with the daily delight till it had achieved its promised popularity and consequently left its ranks like a dastard he consulted both gertrude and norman on the subject and on their advice set himself to work on his own bottom you may perhaps manage to fly alone said gertrude but you will find it very difficult to fly if you tie the whole weight of the daily delight under your wings so charley prepared himself for solitary soaring  while he was thus working the time arrived at which norman was to leave his office and it occurred to him that it might be possible that he should bequeath his vacancy to charley he went himself to sir gregory and explained not only his own circumstances and his former friendship with alaric tudor but also the relationship between alaric and charley he then learnt in the strictest confidence of course that the doom of the internal navigation had just been settled and that it would be necessary to place in other offices those young men who could in any way be regarded as worth their salt and after considerable manoeuvring had it so arranged that the neerdowell young navvy should recommence his official life under better auspices  nor did charley come in at the bottom of his office but was allowed by some inscrutable order of the great men who arranged those things to take a position in the weights and measures equal in seniority and standing to that which he had held at the navigation and much higher of course in pay there is an old saying which the unenlightened credit and which declares that that which is sauce for the goose is sauce also for the gander nothing put into a proverb since the days of solomon was ever more untrue that which is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander and especially is not so in official life poor screwy was the goose and certainly got the sauce best suited to him when he was turned adrift out of the civil service charley was the gander and fond as i am of him for his many excellent qualities i am fain to own that justice might fairly have demanded that he should be cooked after the same receipt but it suited certain potent personages to make a swan of him and therefore though it had long been an assured fact through the whole service that no man was ever known to enter the weights and measures without the strictest examination though the character of aspirants for that high office was always subjected to a rigid scrutiny though knowledge accomplishments industry morality outward decency inward zeal and all the cardinal virtues were absolutely requisite still charley was admitted without any examination or scrutiny whatever during the commotion consequent upon the earthquake above described  charley went to the weights some time during the recess in the process of the next session mr nogo gave notice that he meant to ask the government a question as to a gross act of injustice which had been perpetratedso at least the matter had been represented to himon the suppression of the internal navigation office  mr nogo did not at first find it very easy to get a fitting opportunity for asking his question he had to give notice and inquiries had to be made and the responsible people were away and various customary accidents happened so that it was late in june before the question was put mr nogo however persevered ruthlessly and after six months labour did deliver himself of an indignant and as his friends declared to him a very telling speech  it was reported at the time by the opposition newspapers and need not therefore be given here but the upshot was this two men bearing equal charactermr nogo would not say whether the characters of the gentlemen were good or bad he would only say equal characterssat in the same room at this now defunct office one was mr corkscrew and the other mr tudor one had no friends in the civil service but the other was more fortunate mr corkscrew had been sent upon the world a ruined blighted man without any compensation without any regard for his interests without any consideration for his past services or future prospects they would be told that the government had no further need of his labours and that they could not dare to saddle the country with a pension for so young a man but what had been done in the case of the other gentleman why he had been put into a valuable situation in the best government office in london had been placed over the heads of a dozen others who had been there before him c c c and then mr nogo ended with so vehement an attack on sir gregory and the government as connected with him that the dogs began to whet their teeth and prepare for a tug at the great badger  but circumstances were mischancy with mr nogo and all he said redounded only to the credit of our friend charley his black undoubtedly was black the merits of charley and mr corkscrew as public servants had been about equal but mr whip vigil turned the black into white in three minutes  as he got upon his legs smiling after the manner of his great exemplar he held in his hand a small note and a newspaper a comparison he said had been instituted between the merits of two gentlemen formerly in the employment of the crown one of them had been selected for further employment and the other rejected the honourable member for mile end had he regretted to say instituted this comparison they all knew what was the proverbial character of a comparison it was however ready made to his hands and there was nothing left for him mr whip vigil but to go on with it this however he would do in as light a manner as possible it had been thought that the one gentleman would not suit the public service and that the other would do so it was for him merely to defend this opinion he now held in his hand a letter written by the protégé of the honourable member for limehouse he would not read it cries of read read no he would not read it but the honourable member might if he wouldand could he himself was prepared to say that a gentleman who chose to express himself in such a style in his private notesthis note however was not private in the usual sensecould hardly be expected to command a proper supply of wholesome english such as the service of the crown demanded then mr vigil handed across to mr nogo poor screwys unfortunate letter about the pork chops as to the other gentleman whose name was now respectably known in the lighter walks of literature he would if permitted read the opinion expressed as to his style of language by a literary publication of the day and then the house would see whether or no the produce of the civil service field had not been properly winnowed whether the wheat had not been garnered and the chaff neglected and then the right honourable gentleman read some halfdozen lines highly eulogistic of charleys first solitary flight  poor mr nogo remained in silence feeling that his black had become white to all intents and purposes and the big badger sat by and grinned not deigning to notice the dogs around him thus it may be seen that that which is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander  early in the spring norman was married and then as had been before arranged charley once more went to surbiton cottage the marriage was a very quiet affair the feeling of disgrace which had fallen upon them all since the days of alarics trial had by no means worn itself away there were none of them yetno not one of the cottage circle from uncle bat down to the parlourmaidwho felt that they had a right to hold up their faces before the light of day as they had formerly done there was a cloud over their house visible perhaps with more or less distinctness to all eyes but which to themselves appeared black as night that evil which alaric had done to them was not to be undone in a few moons we are all of us responsible for our friends fathersinlaw for their sonsinlaw brothers for their sisters husbands for their wives parents for their children and children even for their parents we cannot wipe off from us as with a wet cloth the stains left by the fault of those who are near to us the inkspot will cling oh alaric alaric that thou thou who knewest all this that thou shouldest have done this thing they had forgiven his offence against them but they could not forget their own involuntary participation in his disgrace it was not for them now to shine forth to the world with fine gala doings and gay gaudy colours as they had done when gertrude had been married  but still there was happinessquiet staid happinessat the cottage mrs woodward could not but be happy to see linda married to harry norman her own favourite him whom she had selected in her heart for her soninlaw from out of all the world and now too she was beginning to be conscious that harry and linda were better suited for each other than he and gertrude would have been what would have been lindas fate how unendurable had she been alarics wife when alaric fell how would she have borne such a fall what could she have done poor lamb towards mending the broken thread or binding the bruised limbs what balm could she have poured into such wounds as those which fate had inflicted on gertrude and her household but at normansgrove with a steady old housekeeper at her back and her husband always by to give her courage linda would find the very place for which she was suited  and then mrs woodward had another source of joy of liveliest joy in katies mending looks she was at the wedding though hardly with her mothers approval  as she got better her old spirit returned to her and it became difficult to refuse her anything it was in vain that her mother talked of the cold church and easterly winds and the necessary lightness of a bridesmaids attire katie argued that the church was only two hundred yards off that she never suffered from the cold and that though dressed in light colours as became a bridesmaid she would if allowed to go wear over her white frock any amount of cloaks which her mother chose to impose on her of course she went and we will not say how beautiful she looked when she clung to linda in the vestryroom and all her mothers wrappings fell in disorder from her shoulders  so linda was married and carried off to normansgrove and katie remained with her mother and uncle bat  mamma we will never partwill we mamma said she as they comforted each other that evening after the normans were gone and when charley also had returned to london  when you go katie i think you must take me with you said her mother smiling through her tears but what will poor uncle bat do i fear you cant take him also  i will never go from you mamma  her mother knew what she meant charley had been there charley to whom she had declared her love when lying as she thought on her bed of deathcharley had been there again and had stood close to her and touched her hand and lookedoh how much handsomer he was than harry how much brighter than alariche had touched her hand and spoken to her one word of joy at her recovered health but that had been all there was a sort of compact katie knew that there should be no other tudor marriage charley was not now the scamp he had been but stillit was understood that her love was not to win its object  i will never go from you mamma  but mrs woodwards heart was not hard as the nether millstone she drew her daughter to her and as she pressed her to her bosom she whispered into her ears that she now hoped they might all be happy    chapter xlvii  conclusion   our tale and toils have now drawn nigh to an end our loves and our sorrows are over and we are soon to part company with the three clerks and their three wives their three wives why yes it need hardly be told in so many words to an habitual novelreader that charley did get his bride at last  nevertheless katie kept her promise to mrs woodward what promise did she ever make and not keep she kept her promise and did not go from her mother she married mr charles tudor of the weights and measures that distinguished master of modern fiction as the literary censor very civilly called him the other day and mr charles tudor became master of surbiton cottage  reader take one last leap with me and presume that two years have flown from us since the end of the last chapter or rather somewhat more than two years for we would have it high midsummer when we take our last farewell of surbiton cottage  but sundry changes had taken place at the cottage and of such a nature that were it not for the old names sake we should now find ourselves bound to call the place surbiton villa or surbiton hall or surbiton house it certainly had no longer any right to the title of a cottage for charley in anticipation of what lucina might do for him had added on sundry rooms a childrens room on the ground floor and a nursery above and a couple of additional bedrooms on the other side so that the house was now a comfortable abode for an increasing family  at the time of which we are now speaking lucina had not as yet done much for in truth charley had been married but little over twelve months but there appeared every reason to believe that the goddess would be propitious there was already one little rocking shrine up in that cosy temple opening out of katies bedroomwe beg her pardon we should have said mrs charles tudors bedroomone precious tabernacle in which was laid a little mandeity a young charley to whom was daily paid a multitude of very sincere devotions  how precious are all the belongings of a first baby how dear are the cradle the lacecaps the first coral all the little duds which are made with such punctilious care and anxious efforts of nicest needlework to encircle that small lump of pink humanity what care is taken that all shall be in order see that basket lined with crimson silk prepared to hold his various garments while the mother jealous of her nurse insists on tying every string with her own fingers and then how soon the change comes how different it is when there are ten of them and the tenth is allowed to inherit the wellworn wealth which the ninth a year ago had received from the eighth there is no crimson silk basket then i trow  jane jane where are my boots mary ive lost my trousers such sounds are heard shouted through the house from powerful lungs  why charley says the mother as her eldest hope rushes in to breakfast with dishevelled hair and dirty hands youve got no handkerchief on your neckwhat have you done with your handkerchief  no mamma it came off in the hayloft and i cant find it  papa says the lady wife turning to her lord who is reading his newspaper over his coffeepapa you really must speak to charley he will not mind me he was dressed quite nicely an hour ago and do see what a figure he has made himself  charley says papa not quite relishing this disturbance in the midst of a very interesting badgerbaitingcharley my boy if you dont mind your ps and qs you and i shall fall out mind that and he again goes on with his sport and mamma goes on with her teapot looking not exactly like patience on a monument  such are the joys which await you mr charles tudor but not to such have you as yet arrived as yet there is but the one little pink deity in the rocking shrine above but one at least of your own at the moment of which we are now speaking there were visitors at surbiton cottage and the new nursery was brought into full use mr and mrs norman of normansgrove were there with their two children and two maids and grandmamma woodward had her hands quite full in the family nursery line  it was a beautiful summer evening and the two young mothers were sitting with mrs woodward and uncle bat in the drawingroom waiting for their lords return from london as usual when they stayed late the two men were to dine at their club and come down to tea the nursemaids were walking on the lawn before the window with their charges and the three ladies were busily employed with some fairlywritten manuscript pages which they were cutting carefully into shape and arranging in particular form  now mamma said katie if you laugh once while you are reading it youll spoil it all  ill do the best i can my dear but im sure i shall break down you have made it so very abusive said mrs woodward  mamma i think ill take out that about official priggismhadnt i better linda  indeed i think you had im sure mamma would break down there said linda mamma im sure you would never get over the official priggism  i dont think i should my dear said mrs woodward  what is it you are all concocting said captain cuttwater some infernal mischief i know craving your pardons  if you tell uncle bat ill never forgive you said katie  oh you may trust me i never spoil sport if i cant make any but the fun ought to be very good for youve been a mortal long time about it  and then the two younger ladies again went on clipping and arranging their papers while mrs woodward renewed her protest that she would do her best as to reading their production while they were thus employed the postmans knock was heard and a letter was brought in from the faraway australian exiles the period at which these monthly missives arrived were moments of intense anxiety and the letter was seized upon with eager avidity it was from gertrude to her mother as all these letters were but in such a production they had a joint property and it was hardly possible to say who first mastered its contents  it will only be necessary here to give some extracts from the letter which was by no means a short one so much must be done in order that our readers may know something of the fate of those who perhaps may be called the hero and heroine of the tale the author does not so call them he professes to do his work without any such appendages to his storyheroism there may be and he hopes there ismore or less of it there should be in a true picture of most characters but heroes and heroines as so called are not commonly met with in our daily walks of life  before gertrudes letter had been disposed of norman and charley came in and it was therefore discussed in full conclave alarics path in the land of his banishment had not been over roses the upward struggle of men who have fallen from a high place once gained that second mounting of the ladder of life seldom is an easy path he and with him gertrude and his children had been called on to pay the full price of his backsliding his history had gone with him to the antipodes and though the knowledge of what he had done was not there so absolute a clog upon his efforts so overpowering a burden as it would have been in london still it was a burden and a heavy one  it had been well for gertrude that she had prepared herself to give up all her luxuries by her six months residence in that millbank paradise of luxuries for some time she had little enough in the good and happy land to which she had taught herself and her children to look forward that land of promise had not flowed with milk and honey when first she put her foot upon its soil its produce for her had been gall and bitter herbs for many a weary month after she first landed but her heart had never sunk within her she had never forgotten that he if he were to work well should have at least one cheerful companion by his side she had been true to him then as ever and yet it is so hard to be true to high principles in little things the heroism of the roman who for his countrys sake leapt his horse into a bottomless gulf was as nothing to that of a woman who can keep her temper through poverty and be cheerful in adversity  through poverty scorn and bad repute under the privations of a hard life separated from so many that she had loved and from everything that she had liked gertrude had still been true to her ideas of her marriage vow true also to her pure and single love she had entwined herself with him in sunny weather and when the storm came she did her best to shelter the battered stem to which she had trusted herself  by degrees things mended with them and in this letter which is now passing from eager hand to hand in katies drawingroom gertrude spoke with better hope of their future prospects  thank god we are once more all well she said and alarics spirits are higher than they were he has indeed had much to try them they think i believe in england that any kind of work here is sure to command a high price of this i am quite sure that in no employment in england are people so tasked as they are here alaric was four months in these mens countinghouse and i am sure another four months would have seen him in his grave though i knew not then what other provision might be made for us i implored him almost on my knees to give up that he was expected to be there for ten sometimes twelve hours a day and they thought he should always be kept going like a steamengine you know alaric never was afraid of work but that would have killed him and what was it for what did they give him for thatfor all his talent all his experience all his skill and he did give them all his salary was two pounds ten a week and then when he told them of all he was doing for them they had the baseness to remind him of dearest mother is not the world hard it was that that made me insist that he should leave them  alarics present path was by no means over roses this certainly was a change from those days on which he had sat one of a mighty trio at the civil service examination board striking terror into candidates by a scratch of his pen and making happy the desponding heart by his approving nod his ambition now was not to sit among the magnates of great britain and make his voice thunder through the columns of the times it ranged somewhat lower at this period and was confined for the present to a strong desire to see his wife and bairns sufficiently fed and not left absolutely without clothing he inquired little as to the feeling of the electors of strathbogy  and had he utterly forgotten the stirring motto of his early days did he ever mutter excelsior to himself as with weary steps he dragged himself home from that hated countinghouse ah he had fatally mistaken the meaning of the word which he had so often used there had been the error of his life excelsior when he took such a watchword for his use he should surely have taught himself the meaning of it  he had now learnt that lesson in a school somewhat of the sternest but as time wore kindly over him he did teach himself to accept the lesson with humility his spirit had been wellnigh broken as he was carried from that courthouse in the old bailey to his prison on the riverside and a broken spirit like a broken goblet can never again become whole but nature was a kind mother to him and did not permit him to be wholly crushed she still left within the plant the germ of life which enabled it again to spring up and vivify though sorely bruised by the heels of those who had ridden over it he still repeated to himself the old watchword though now in humbler tone and more bated breath and it may be presumed that he had now a clearer meaning of its import  but his present place continued gertrude is muchvery much more suited to him he is corresponding clerk in the first bank here and though his pay is nearly double what it was at the other place his hours of work are not so oppressive he goes at nine and gets away at fivethat is except on the arrival or dispatch of the english mails here was a place of bliss for a man who had been a commissioner attending at the office at such hours as best suited himself and having clerks at his beck to do all that he listed and yet as gertrude said this was a place of bliss to him it was a heaven as compared with that other hell  alley is such a noble boy said gertrude becoming almost joyous as she spoke of her own immediate cares he is most like katie i think of us all and yet he is very like his papa he goes to a dayschool now with his books slung over his back in a bag you never saw such a proud little fellow as he is and so manly charley is just like youoh so like it makes me so happy that he is he did not talk so early as alley but nevertheless he is more forward than the other children i see here the little monkeys they are neither of them the least like me but one can always see oneself and it dont matter if one does not  if ever there was a brick gertrude is one said norman  a brick said charleywhy you might cut her to pieces and build another kensington palace out of the slices i believe she is a brick  i wonder whether i shall ever see her again said mrs woodward not with dry eyes  oh yes mamma said katie she shall come home to us some day and we will endeavour to reward her for it all  dear katie who will not love you for such endeavour but indeed the reward for heroism cometh not here  there was much more in the letter but enough has been given for our purpose it will be seen that hope yet remained both for alaric and his wife and hope not without a reasonable base bad as he had been it had not been with him as with undy scott the devil had not contrived to put his whole claw upon him he had not divested himself of human affections and celestial hopes he had not reduced himself to the present level of a beast with the disadvantages of a soul and of an eternity as the other man had done he had not put himself beyond the pale of true brotherhood with his fellowmen we would have hanged undy had the law permitted us but now we will say farewell to the other hoping that he may yet achieve exaltation of another kind  and to thee gertrudehow shall we say farewell to thee excluded as thou art from that dear home where those who love thee so well are now so happy their only care remaining is now thy absence adversity has tried thee in its crucible and thou art found to be of virgin gold unalloyed hadst thou still been lapped in prosperity the true ring of thy sterling metal would never have been heard farewell to thee and may those young budding flowerets of thine break forth into golden fruit to gladden thy heart in coming days  the reading of gertrudes letter and the consequent discussion somewhat put off the execution of the little scheme which had been devised for that evenings amusement but nevertheless it was still broad daylight when mrs woodward consigned the precious document to her desk the drawingroom windows were still open and the bairns were still being fondled in the room it was the first week in july when the night almost loses her dominion and when those hours which she generally claims as her own become the pleasantest of the day  oh charley said katie at last we have great news for you too here is another review on the worlds last wonder  now the worlds last wonder was charleys third novel but he was still sensitive enough on the subject of reviews to look with much anxiety for what was said of him these notices were habitually sent down to him at hampton and his custom was to make his wife or her mother read them while he sat by in lordly ease in his armchair receiving homage when homage came to him and criticizing the critics when they were uncivil  have you said charley what is it why did you not show it me before  why we were talking of dear gertrude said katie and it is not so pleasant but that it will keep what paper do you think it is  what paper how on earth can i tellshow it me  no but do guess charley and then mamma will read itpray guess now  oh bother i cant guess the literary censor i supposei know they have turned against me  no its not that said linda guess again  the guardian angel said charley  nothat angel has not taken you under his wings as yet said katie  i know its not the times said charley for i have seen that  o no said katie seriously if it was anything of that sort we would not keep you in suspense  well ill be shot if i guess any morethere are such thousands of them  but there is only one daily delight said mrs woodward  nonsense said charley you dont mean to tell me that my dear old friend and fosterfather has fallen foul of memy old teacher and master if not spiritual pastor wellwellwell the ingratitude of the age i gave him my two beautiful stories the firstfruits of my vine all for love to think that he should now lay his treacherous axe to the root of the young tree well give it here  nomamma will read itwe want harry to hear it  o yeslet mrs woodward read it said harry i trust it is severe i know no man who wants a dragging over the coals more peremptorily than you do  thankee sir well grandmamma go on but if there be anything very bad give me a little notice for i am nervous  and then mrs woodward began to read linda sitting with katies baby in her arms and katie performing a similar office for her sister  the worlds last wonder by charles tudor esq  he begins with a lie said charley for i never called myself esquire  oh that was a mistake said katie forgetting herself  men of that kind shouldnt make such mistakes said charley when one fellow attempts to cut up another fellow he ought to take special care that he does it fairly  by the author of bathos  i didnt put that in said charley that was the publisher i only put charles tudor  dont be so touchy charley and let me go on said mrs woodward  well fire awayits good fun to you i dare say as the fly said to the spider  well charley at any rate we are not the spiders said linda katie said nothing but she could not help feeling that she must look rather spiderish  mr tudor has acquired some little reputation as a humorist but as is so often the case with those who make us laugh his very success will prove his ruin  then upon my word the daily delight is safe said charley it will never be ruined in that way  there is an elaborate jocosity about him a determined eternity of most industrious fun which gives us the idea of a boy who is being rewarded for having duly learnt by rote his daily lesson out of joe miller  now ill bet ten to one he has never read the book at allwell never mindgo on  the worlds last wonder is the description of a woman who kept a secret under certain temptations to reveal it which as mr tudor supposes might have moved any daughter of eve to break her faith  i havent supposed anything of the kind said charley  this secret which we shall not disclose as we would not wish to be thought less trustworthy than mr tudors wonderful woman  we shall find that he does disclose it of course that is the way with all of them  is presumed to permeate the whole three volumes  it is told at full length in the middle of the second said charley  and the effect upon the reader of course is that he has ceased to interest himself about it long before it is disclosed to him  the lady in question is engaged to be married to a gentleman a circumstance which in the pages of a novel is not calculated to attract much special attention she is engaged to be married but the gentleman who has the honour of being her intended sposo  intended sposo said charley expressing by his upturned lip a withering amount of scornhow well i know the fellows low attempts at wit thats the editor himselfthats my literary papa i know him as well as though i had seen him at it  katie and mrs woodward exchanged furtive glances but neither of them moved a muscle of her face  but the gentleman who has the honour of being her intended sposo continued mrs woodward  what the devils a sposo said uncle bat who was sitting in an armchair with a handkerchief over his head  why youre not a sposo uncle bat said linda but harry is and so is charley  oh i see said the captain its a bird with his wings clipped  but the gentleman who has the honour of being her intended sposo again read mrs woodward  now im sure im speaking by the card said charley when i say that there is not another man in london who could have written that line and who would have used so detestable a word i think i remember his using it in one of his lectures to me indeed im sure i do sposo i should like to tweak his nose oh  are you going to let me go on said mrs woodwardher intended sposocharley gave a kick with his foot and satisfied himself with thatis determined to have nothing to say to her in the matrimonial line till she has revealed to him this secret which he thinks concerns his own honour  there i knew hed tell it  he has not told it yet said norman  the lady however is obdurate wonderfully so of course seeing that she is the worlds last wonder and so the match is broken off but the secret is of such a nature that the ladys invincible objection to revealing it is bound up with the fact of her being a promised bride  i wonder he didnt say sposa said charley  i never thought of that said katie  mrs woodward and linda looked at her but charley did not and her blunder passed by unnoticed  now that she is free from her matrimonial bonds she is free also to tell the secret and indeed the welfare both of the gentleman and of the lady imperiously demands that it should be told should he marry her he is destined to learn it after his marriage should he not marry her he may hear it at any time she sends for him and tells him not the first of these facts by doing which all difficulty would have at once been put an end to  it is quite clear he has never read the story quite clear said charley  she tells him only the last viz that as they are now strangers he may know the secret but that when once known it will raise a barrier between them that no years no penance no sorrow on his part no tenderness on hers can ever break down she then asks himwill he hear the secret  she does not ask any such thing said charley the letter that contains it has been already sent to him she merely gives him an opportunity of returning it unopened  the gentleman who is not without a grain of obstinacy in his own composition and many grains of curiosity declares it to be impossible that he can go to the altar in ignorance of facts which he is bound to know and the lady who seems to be of an affectionate disposition falls in tenderness at his feet she is indeed in a very winning mood and quite inclined to use every means allowable to a lady for retaining her lover every means that is short of that specially feminine one of telling her secret  we will give an extract from this love scene partly for the sake of its grotesque absurdity  charley kicked out another foot as though he thought that the editor of the daily delight might perhaps be within reach  and partly because it gives a fair example of the manner in which mr tudor endeavours to be droll even in the midst of his most tender passages  leonora was at this time seated  oh skip the extract said charley i suppose there are three or four pages of it  it goes down to where leonora says that his fate and her own are in his hands  yes about three columns said charley thats an easy way of making an articleeh harry  aliter non fit amice liber said the classical norman  well skip the extract grandmamma  now did anyone ever before read such a mixture of the bombastic and the burlesque we are called upon to cry over every joke and for the life of us we cannot hold our sides when the catastrophes occur it is a salad in which the pungency of the vinegar has been wholly subdued by the oil and the fatness of the oil destroyed by the tartness of the vinegar  his old simile said charley he was always talking about literary salads  the gentleman of course gives way at the last minute continued mrs woodward the scene in which he sits with the unopened letter lying on his table before him has some merit but this probably arises from the fact that the letter is dumb and the gentleman equally so  dnation said charley whose patience could not stand such impudence at this  the gentleman who as we should have before said is the eldest son of a man of large reputed fortune  therei knew hed tell it  oh but he hasnt told it said norman  doesnt the word reputed tell it  the eldest son of a man of large reputed fortune does at last marry the heroine and then he discoversbut what he discovers those who feel any interest in the matter may learn from the book itself we must profess that we felt none  we will not say there is nothing in the work indicative of talent the heros valet jacob brush and the heroines ladysmaid jacintha pintail are both humorous and good in their way why it should be so we do not pretend to say but it certainly does appear to us that mr tudor is more at home in the servants hall than in the ladys boudoir  abominable scoundrel said charley  but what we must chiefly notice continued the article in the furtherance of those views by which we profess that we are governed  now i know we are to have something very grandiloquent and very false said charley  is this that no moral purpose can be served by the volumes before us the hero acts wrongly throughout but nevertheless he is rewarded at last there is no nemesis  no what said charley jumping up from his chair and looking over the table  no nemesis said mrs woodward speaking with only halfsustained voice and covering with her arms the document which she had been reading  charley looked sharply at his wife then at linda then at mrs woodward not one of them could keep her face he made a snatch at the patchedup manuscript and as he did so katie almost threw out of her arms the baby she was holding  take him harry take him said she handing over the child to his father and then gliding quick as thought through the furniture of the drawingroom she darted out upon the lawn to save herself from the coming storm  charley was quickly after her but as he made his exit one chair fell to the right of him and another to the left mrs woodward followed them and so did harry and linda each with a baby  and then captain cuttwater waking from his placid nap rubbed his eyes in wondering amazement  what the devil is all the row about said he but there was nobody to answer him
