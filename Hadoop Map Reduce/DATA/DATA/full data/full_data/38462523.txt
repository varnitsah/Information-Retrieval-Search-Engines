38462523	the lair of the white worm   to my friend bertha nicoll with affectionate esteem     chapter iadam salton arrives   adam salton sauntered into the empire club sydney and found awaiting him a letter from his granduncle  he had first heard from the old gentleman less than a year before when richard salton had claimed kinship stating that he had been unable to write earlier as he had found it very difficult to trace his grandnephews address  adam was delighted and replied cordially he had often heard his father speak of the older branch of the family with whom his people had long lost touch some interesting correspondence had ensued  adam eagerly opened the letter which had only just arrived and conveyed a cordial invitation to stop with his granduncle at lesser hill for as long a time as he could spare  indeed richard salton went on i am in hopes that you will make your permanent home here  you see my dear boy you and i are all that remain of our race and it is but fitting that you should succeed me when the time comes  in this year of grace 1860 i am close on eighty years of age and though we have been a longlived race the span of life cannot be prolonged beyond reasonable bounds  i am prepared to like you and to make your home with me as happy as you could wish  so do come at once on receipt of this and find the welcome i am waiting to give you  i send in case such may make matters easy for you a bankers draft for 200 pounds  come soon so that we may both of us enjoy many happy days together  if you are able to give me the pleasure of seeing you send me as soon as you can a letter telling me when to expect you  then when you arrive at plymouth or southampton or whatever port you are bound for wait on board and i will meet you at the earliest hour possible        old mr salton was delighted when adams reply arrived and sent a groom hotfoot to his crony sir nathaniel de salis to inform him that his grandnephew was due at southampton on the twelfth of june  mr salton gave instructions to have ready a carriage early on the important day to start for stafford where he would catch the 1140 am train  he would stay that night with his grandnephew either on the ship which would be a new experience for him or if his guest should prefer it at a hotel  in either case they would start in the early morning for home  he had given instructions to his bailiff to send the postillion carriage on to southampton to be ready for their journey home and to arrange for relays of his own horses to be sent on at once he intended that his grandnephew who had been all his life in australia should see something of rural england on the drive  he had plenty of young horses of his own breeding and breaking and could depend on a journey memorable to the young man  the luggage would be sent on by rail to stafford where one of his carts would meet it  mr salton during the journey to southampton often wondered if his grandnephew was as much excited as he was at the idea of meeting so near a relation for the first time and it was with an effort that he controlled himself  the endless railway lines and switches round the southampton docks fired his anxiety afresh  as the train drew up on the dockside he was getting his hand traps together when the carriage door was wrenched open and a young man jumped in  how are you uncle  i recognised you from the photo you sent me  i wanted to meet you as soon as i could but everything is so strange to me that i didnt quite know what to do  however here i am  i am glad to see you sir  i have been dreaming of this happiness for thousands of miles now i find that the reality beats all the dreaming  as he spoke the old man and the young one were heartily wringing each others hands  the meeting so auspiciously begun proceeded well  adam seeing that the old man was interested in the novelty of the ship suggested that he should stay the night on board and that he would himself be ready to start at any hour and go anywhere that the other suggested  this affectionate willingness to fall in with his own plans quite won the old mans heart  he warmly accepted the invitation and at once they became not only on terms of affectionate relationship but almost like old friends  the heart of the old man which had been empty for so long found a new delight  the young man found on landing in the old country a welcome and a surrounding in full harmony with all his dreams throughout his wanderings and solitude and the promise of a fresh and adventurous life  it was not long before the old man accepted him to full relationship by calling him by his christian name  after a long talk on affairs of interest they retired to the cabin which the elder was to share  richard salton put his hands affectionately on the boys shouldersthough adam was in his twentyseventh year he was a boy and always would be to his granduncle  i am so glad to find you as you are my dear boyjust such a young man as i had always hoped for as a son in the days when i still had such hopes  however that is all past  but thank god there is a new life to begin for both of us  to you must be the larger partbut there is still time for some of it to be shared in common  i have waited till we should have seen each other to enter upon the subject for i thought it better not to tie up your young life to my old one till we should have sufficient personal knowledge to justify such a venture  now i can so far as i am concerned enter into it freely since from the moment my eyes rested on you i saw my sonas he shall be god willingif he chooses such a course himself  indeed i do sirwith all my heart  thank you adam for that  the old mans eyes filled and his voice trembled  then after a long silence between them he went on when i heard you were coming i made my will  it was well that your interests should be protected from that moment on  here is the deedkeep it adam  all i have shall belong to you and if love and good wishes or the memory of them can make life sweeter yours shall be a happy one now my dear boy let us turn in  we start early in the morning and have a long drive before us  i hope you dont mind driving  i was going to have the old travelling carriage in which my grandfather your greatgranduncle went to court when william iv was king  it is all rightthey built well in those daysand it has been kept in perfect order  but i think i have done better i have sent the carriage in which i travel myself  the horses are of my own breeding and relays of them shall take us all the way  i hope you like horses  they have long been one of my greatest interests in life  i love them sir and i am happy to say i have many of my own  my father gave me a horse farm for myself when i was eighteen  i devoted myself to it and it has gone on  before i came away my steward gave me a memorandum that we have in my own place more than a thousand nearly all good  i am glad my boy  another link between us  just fancy what a delight it will be sir to see so much of englandand with you  thank you again my boy  i will tell you all about your future home and its surroundings as we go  we shall travel in oldfashioned state i tell you  my grandfather always drove fourinhand and so shall we  oh thanks sir thanks  may i take the ribbons sometimes  whenever you choose adam  the team is your own  every horse we use to day is to be your own  you are too generous uncle  not at all  only an old mans selfish pleasure  it is not every day that an heir to the old home comes back  andoh by the way    no we had better turn in nowi shall tell you the rest in the morning     chapter iithe caswalls of castra regis   mr salton had all his life been an early riser and necessarily an early waker  but early as he woke on the next morningand although there was an excuse for not prolonging sleep in the constant whirr and rattle of the donkey engine winches of the great shiphe met the eyes of adam fixed on him from his berth  his grandnephew had given him the sofa occupying the lower berth himself  the old man despite his great strength and normal activity was somewhat tired by his long journey of the day before and the prolonged and exciting interview which followed it  so he was glad to lie still and rest his body whilst his mind was actively exercised in taking in all he could of his strange surroundings adam too after the pastoral habit to which he had been bred woke with the dawn and was ready to enter on the experiences of the new day whenever it might suit his elder companion  it was little wonder then that so soon as each realised the others readiness they simultaneously jumped up and began to dress  the steward had by previous instructions early breakfast prepared and it was not long before they went down the gangway on shore in search of the carriage  they found mr saltons bailiff looking out for them on the dock and he brought them at once to where the carriage was waiting in the street richard salton pointed out with pride to his young companion the suitability of the vehicle for every need of travel  to it were harnessed four useful horses with a postillion to each pair  see said the old man proudly how it has all the luxuries of useful travelsilence and isolation as well as speed  there is nothing to obstruct the view of those travelling and no one to overhear what they may say  i have used that trap for a quarter of a century and i never saw one more suitable for travel  you shall test it shortly  we are going to drive through the heart of england and as we go ill tell you what i was speaking of last night  our route is to be by salisbury bath bristol cheltenham worcester stafford and so home  adam remained silent a few minutes during which he seemed all eyes for he perpetually ranged the whole circle of the horizon  has our journey today sir he asked any special relation to what you said last night that you wanted to tell me  not directly but indirectly everything  wont you tell me nowi see we cannot be overheardand if anything strikes you as we go along just run it in  i shall understand  so old salton spoke  to begin at the beginning adam  that lecture of yours on the romans in britain a report of which you posted to me set me thinkingin addition to telling me your tastes  i wrote to you at once and asked you to come home for it struck me that if you were fond of historical researchas seemed a factthis was exactly the place for you in addition to its being the home of your own forbears  if you could learn so much of the british romans so far away in new south wales where there cannot be even a tradition of them what might you not make of the same amount of study on the very spot  where we are going is in the real heart of the old kingdom of mercia where there are traces of all the various nationalities which made up the conglomerate which became britain  i rather gathered that you had some more definitemore personal reason for my hurrying  after all history can keepexcept in the making  quite right my boy  i had a reason such as you very wisely guessed  i was anxious for you to be here when a rather important phase of our local history occurred  what is that if i may ask sir  certainly  the principal landowner of our part of the county is on his way home and there will be a great homecoming which you may care to see  the fact is for more than a century the various owners in the succession here with the exception of a short time have lived abroad  how is that sir if i may ask  the great house and estate in our part of the world is castra regis the family seat of the caswall family  the last owner who lived here was edgar caswall grandfather of the man who is coming hereand he was the only one who stayed even a short time  this mans grandfather also named edgarthey keep the tradition of the family christian namequarrelled with his family and went to live abroad not keeping up any intercourse good or bad with his relatives although this particular edgar as i told you did visit his family estate yet his son was born and lived and died abroad while his grandson the latest inheritor was also born and lived abroad till he was over thirtyhis present age  this was the second line of absentees  the great estate of castra regis has had no knowledge of its owner for five generationscovering more than a hundred and twenty years  it has been well administered however and no tenant or other connected with it has had anything of which to complain  all the same there has been much natural anxiety to see the new owner and we are all excited about the event of his coming  even i am though i own my own estate which though adjacent is quite apart from castra regishere we are now in new ground for you  that is the spire of salisbury cathedral and when we leave that we shall be getting close to the old roman county and you will naturally want your eyes  so we shall shortly have to keep our minds on old mercia  however you need not be disappointed  my old friend sir nathaniel de salis who like myself is a freeholder near castra regishis estate doom tower is over the border of derbyshire on the peakis coming to stay with me for the festivities to welcome edgar caswall  he is just the sort of man you will like  he is devoted to history and is president of the mercian archaeological society  he knows more of our own part of the country with its history and its people than anyone else  i expect he will have arrived before us and we three can have a long chat after dinner  he is also our local geologist and natural historian  so you and he will have many interests in common  amongst other things he has a special knowledge of the peak and its caverns and knows all the old legends of prehistoric times  they spent the night at cheltenham and on the following morning resumed their journey to stafford  adams eyes were in constant employment and it was not till salton declared that they had now entered on the last stage of their journey that he referred to sir nathaniels coming  as the dusk was closing down they drove on to lesser hill mr saltons house  it was now too dark to see any details of their surroundings adam could just see that it was on the top of a hill not quite so high as that which was covered by the castle on whose tower flew the flag and which was all ablaze with moving lights manifestly used in the preparations for the festivities on the morrow  so adam deferred his curiosity till daylight  his granduncle was met at the door by a fine old man who greeted him warmly  i came over early as you wished  i suppose this is your grandnephewi am glad to meet you mr adam salton  i am nathaniel de salis and your uncle is one of my oldest friends  adam from the moment of their eyes meeting felt as if they were already friends  the meeting was a new note of welcome to those that had already sounded in his ears  the cordiality with which sir nathaniel and adam met made the imparting of information easy  sir nathaniel was a clever man of the world who had travelled much and within a certain area studied deeply  he was a brilliant conversationalist as was to be expected from a successful diplomatist even under unstimulating conditions  but he had been touched and to a certain extent fired by the younger mans evident admiration and willingness to learn from him  accordingly the conversation which began on the most friendly basis soon warmed to an interest above proof as the old man spoke of it next day to richard salton  he knew already that his old friend wanted his grandnephew to learn all he could of the subject in hand and so had during his journey from the peak put his thoughts in sequence for narration and explanation accordingly adam had only to listen and he must learn much that he wanted to know  when dinner was over and the servants had withdrawn leaving the three men at their wine sir nathaniel began  i gather from your uncleby the way i suppose we had better speak of you as uncle and nephew instead of going into exact relationship  in fact your uncle is so old and dear a friend that with your permission i shall drop formality with you altogether and speak of you and to you as adam as though you were his son  i should like answered the young man nothing better  the answer warmed the hearts of both the old men but with the usual avoidance of englishmen of emotional subjects personal to themselves they instinctively returned to the previous question  sir nathaniel took the lead  i understand adam that your uncle has posted you regarding the relationships of the caswall family  partly sir but i understood that i was to hear minuter details from youif you would be so good  i shall be delighted to tell you anything so far as my knowledge goes well the first caswall in our immediate record is an edgar head of the family and owner of the estate who came into his kingdom just about the time that george iii did  he had one son of about twentyfour  there was a violent quarrel between the two  no one of this generation has any idea of the cause but considering the family characteristics we may take it for granted that though it was deep and violent it was on the surface trivial  the result of the quarrel was that the son left the house without a reconciliation or without even telling his father where he was going  he never came back again  a few years after he died without having in the meantime exchanged a word or a letter with his father  he married abroad and left one son who seems to have been brought up in ignorance of all belonging to him  the gulf between them appears to have been unbridgable for in time this son married and in turn had a son but neither joy nor sorrow brought the sundered together  under such conditions no rapprochement was to be looked for and an utter indifference founded at best on ignorance took the place of family affectioneven on community of interests  it was only due to the watchfulness of the lawyers that the birth of this new heir was ever made known  he actually spent a few months in the ancestral home  after this the family interest merely rested on heirship of the estate as no other children have been born to any of the newer generations in the intervening years all hopes of heritage are now centred in the grandson of this man  now it will be well for you to bear in mind the prevailing characteristics of this race  these were well preserved and unchanging one and all they are the same cold selfish dominant reckless of consequences in pursuit of their own will  it was not that they did not keep faith though that was a matter which gave them little concern but that they took care to think beforehand of what they should do in order to gain their own ends  if they should make a mistake someone else should bear the burthen of it  this was so perpetually recurrent that it seemed to be a part of a fixed policy  it was no wonder that whatever changes took place they were always ensured in their own possessions they were absolutely cold and hard by nature  not one of themso far as we have any knowledgewas ever known to be touched by the softer sentiments to swerve from his purpose or hold his hand in obedience to the dictates of his heart  the pictures and effigies of them all show their adherence to the early roman type  their eyes were full their hair of raven blackness grew thick and close and curly  their figures were massive and typical of strength  the thick black hair growing low down on the neck told of vast physical strength and endurance  but the most remarkable characteristic is the eyes  black piercing almost unendurable they seem to contain in themselves a remarkable will power which there is no gainsaying  it is a power that is partly racial and partly individual a power impregnated with some mysterious quality partly hypnotic partly mesmeric which seems to take away from eyes that meet them all power of resistancenay all power of wishing to resist  with eyes like those set in that allcommanding face one would need to be strong indeed to think of resisting the inflexible will that lay behind  you may think adam that all this is imagination on my part especially as i have never seen any of them  so it is but imagination based on deep study  i have made use of all i know or can surmise logically regarding this strange race  with such strange compelling qualities is it any wonder that there is abroad an idea that in the race there is some demoniac possession which tends to a more definite belief that certain individuals have in the past sold themselves to the devil  but i think we had better go to bed now  we have a lot to get through tomorrow and i want you to have your brain clear and all your susceptibilities fresh  moreover i want you to come with me for an early walk during which we may notice whilst the matter is fresh in our minds the peculiar disposition of this placenot merely your granduncles estate but the lie of the country around it  there are many things on which we may seekand perhaps findenlightenment  the more we know at the start the more things which may come into our view will develop themselves     chapter iiidianas grove   curiosity took adam salton out of bed in the early morning but when he had dressed and gone downstairs he found that early as he was sir nathaniel was ahead of him  the old gentleman was quite prepared for a long walk and they started at once  sir nathaniel without speaking led the way to the east down the hill when they had descended and risen again they found themselves on the eastern brink of a steep hill  it was of lesser height than that on which the castle was situated but it was so placed that it commanded the various hills that crowned the ridge  all along the ridge the rock cropped out bare and bleak but broken in rough natural castellation the form of the ridge was a segment of a circle with the higher points inland to the west  in the centre rose the castle on the highest point of all  between the various rocky excrescences were groups of trees of various sizes and heights amongst some of which were what in the early morning light looked like ruins  thesewhatever they werewere of massive grey stone probably limestone rudely cutif indeed they were not shaped naturally  the fall of the ground was steep all along the ridge so steep that here and there both trees and rocks and buildings seemed to overhang the plain far below through which ran many streams  sir nathaniel stopped and looked around as though to lose nothing of the effect  the sun had climbed the eastern sky and was making all details clear  he pointed with a sweeping gesture as though calling adams attention to the extent of the view  having done so he covered the ground more slowly as though inviting attention to detail  adam was a willing and attentive pupil and followed his motions exactly missingor trying to missnothing  i have brought you here adam because it seems to me that this is the spot on which to begin our investigations  you have now in front of you almost the whole of the ancient kingdom of mercia  in fact we see the whole of it except that furthest part which is covered by the welsh marches and those parts which are hidden from where we stand by the high ground of the immediate west  we can seetheoreticallythe whole of the eastern bound of the kingdom which ran south from the humber to the wash  i want you to bear in mind the trend of the ground for some time sooner or later we shall do well to have it in our minds eye when we are considering the ancient traditions and superstitions and are trying to find the rationale of them  each legend each superstition which we receive will help in the understanding and possible elucidation of the others  and as all such have a local basis we can come closer to the truthor the probabilityby knowing the local conditions as we go along  it will help us to bring to our aid such geological truth as we may have between us  for instance the building materials used in various ages can afford their own lessons to understanding eyes  the very heights and shapes and materials of these hillsnay even of the wide plain that lies between us and the seahave in themselves the materials of enlightening books  for instance sir said adam venturing a question  well look at those hills which surround the main one where the site for the castle was wisely chosenon the highest ground  take the others there is something ostensible in each of them and in all probability something unseen and unproved but to be imagined also  for instance continued adam  let us take them seriatim  that to the east where the trees are lower downthat was once the location of a roman temple possibly founded on a preexisting druidical one  its name implies the former and the grove of ancient oaks suggests the latter  please explain  the old name translated means dianas grove  then the next one higher than it but just beyond it is called mercyin all probability a corruption or familiarisation of the word mercia with a roman pun included  we learn from early manuscripts that the place was called vilula misericordiae  it was originally a nunnery founded by queen bertha but done away with by king penda the reactionary to paganism after st augustine  then comes your uncles placelesser hill  though it is so close to the castle it is not connected with it  it is a freehold and so far as we know of equal age  it has always belonged to your family  then there only remains the castle  that is all but its history contains the histories of all the othersin fact the whole history of early england  sir nathaniel seeing the expectant look on adams face went on  the history of the castle has no beginning so far as we know  the furthest records or surmises or inferences simply accept it as existing some of theseguesses let us call themseem to show that there was some sort of structure there when the romans came therefore it must have been a place of importance in druid timesif indeed that was the beginning  naturally the romans accepted it as they did everything of the kind that was or might be useful  the change is shown or inferred in the name castra  it was the highest protected ground and so naturally became the most important of their camps  a study of the map will show you that it must have been a most important centre  it both protected the advances already made to the north and helped to dominate the sea coast  it sheltered the western marches beyond which lay savage walesand danger  it provided a means of getting to the severn round which lay the great roman roads then coming into existence and made possible the great waterway to the heart of englandthrough the severn and its tributaries  it brought the east and the west together by the swiftest and easiest ways known to those times  and finally it provided means of descent on london and all the expanse of country watered by the thames  with such a centre already known and organised we can easily see that each fresh wave of invasionthe angles the saxons the danes and the normansfound it a desirable possession and so ensured its upholding  in the earlier centuries it was merely a vantage ground  but when the victorious romans brought with them the heavy solid fortifications impregnable to the weapons of the time its commanding position alone ensured its adequate building and equipment  then it was that the fortified camp of the caesars developed into the castle of the king  as we are as yet ignorant of the names of the first kings of mercia no historian has been able to guess which of them made it his ultimate defence and i suppose we shall never know now  in process of time as the arts of war developed it increased in size and strength and although recorded details are lacking the history is written not merely in the stone of its building but is inferred in the changes of structure  then the sweeping changes which followed the norman conquest wiped out all lesser records than its own  today we must accept it as one of the earliest castles of the conquest probably not later than the time of henry i  roman and norman were both wise in their retention of places of approved strength or utility  so it was that these surrounding heights already established and to a certain extent proved were retained  indeed such characteristics as already pertained to them were preserved and today afford to us lessons regarding things which have themselves long since passed away  so much for the fortified heights but the hollows too have their own story  but how the time passes  we must hurry home or your uncle will wonder what has become of us  he started with long steps towards lesser hill and adam was soon furtively running in order to keep up with him     chapter ivthe lady arabella march   now there is no hurry but so soon as you are both ready we shall start mr salton said when breakfast had begun  i want to take you first to see a remarkable relic of mercia and then well go to liverpool through what is called the great vale of cheshire  you may be disappointed but take care not to prepare your mindthis to adamfor anything stupendous or heroic  you would not think the place a vale at all unless you were told so beforehand and had confidence in the veracity of the teller  we should get to the landing stage in time to meet the west african and catch mr caswall as he comes ashore  we want to do him honourand besides it will be more pleasant to have the introductions over before we go to his fete at the castle  the carriage was ready the same as had been used the previous day but there were different horsesmagnificent animals and keen for work breakfast was soon over and they shortly took their places  the postillions had their orders and were quickly on their way at an exhilarating pace  presently in obedience to mr saltons signal the carriage drew up opposite a great heap of stones by the wayside  here adam he said is something that you of all men should not pass by unnoticed  that heap of stones brings us at once to the dawn of the anglian kingdom  it was begun more than a thousand years agoin the latter part of the seventh centuryin memory of a murder  wulfere king of mercia nephew of penda here murdered his two sons for embracing christianity  as was the custom of the time each passerby added a stone to the memorial heap  penda represented heathen reaction after st augustines mission  sir nathaniel can tell you as much as you want about this and put you if you wish on the track of such accurate knowledge as there is  whilst they were looking at the heap of stones they noticed that another carriage had drawn up beside them and the passengerthere was only onewas regarding them curiously  the carriage was an old heavy travelling one with arms blazoned on it gorgeously  the men took off their hats as the occupant a lady addressed them  how do you do sir nathaniel  how do you do mr salton  i hope you have not met with any accident  look at me  as she spoke she pointed to where one of the heavy springs was broken across the broken metal showing bright  adam spoke up at once  oh that can soon be put right  soon  there is no one near who can mend a break like that  i can  you  she looked incredulously at the dapper young gentleman who spoke youwhy its a workmans job  all right i am a workmanthough that is not the only sort of work i do  i am an australian and as we have to move about fast we are all trained to farriery and such mechanics as come into traveli am quite at your service  i hardly know how to thank you for your kindness of which i gladly avail myself  i dont know what else i can do as i wish to meet mr caswall of castra regis who arrives home from africa today  it is a notable homecoming all the countryside want to do him honour  she looked at the old men and quickly made up her mind as to the identity of the stranger  you must be mr adam salton of lesser hill  i am lady arabella march of dianas grove  as she spoke she turned slightly to mr salton who took the hint and made a formal introduction  so soon as this was done adam took some tools from his uncles carriage and at once began work on the broken spring  he was an expert workman and the breach was soon made good  adam was gathering the tools which he had been usingwhich after the manner of all workmen had been scattered aboutwhen he noticed that several black snakes had crawled out from the heap of stones and were gathering round him  this naturally occupied his mind and he was not thinking of anything else when he noticed lady arabella who had opened the door of the carriage slip from it with a quick gliding motion  she was already among the snakes when he called out to warn her  but there seemed to be no need of warning  the snakes had turned and were wriggling back to the mound as quickly as they could  he laughed to himself behind his teeth as he whispered no need to fear there  they seem much more afraid of her than she of them  all the same he began to beat on the ground with a stick which was lying close to him with the instinct of one used to such vermin  in an instant he was alone beside the mound with lady arabella who appeared quite unconcerned at the incident  then he took a long look at her and her dress alone was sufficient to attract attention  she was clad in some kind of soft white stuff which clung close to her form showing to the full every movement of her sinuous figure  she wore a closefitting cap of some fine fur of dazzling white  coiled round her white throat was a large necklace of emeralds whose profusion of colour dazzled when the sun shone on them  her voice was peculiar very low and sweet and so soft that the dominant note was of sibilation  her hands too were peculiarlong flexible white with a strange movement as of waving gently to and fro  she appeared quite at ease and after thanking adam said that if any of his uncles party were going to liverpool she would be most happy to join forces  whilst you are staying here mr salton you must look on the grounds of dianas grove as your own so that you may come and go just as you do in lesser hill  there are some fine views and not a few natural curiosities which are sure to interest you if you are a student of natural historyspecially of an earlier kind when the world was younger  the heartiness with which she spoke and the warmth of her wordsnot of her manner which was cold and distantmade him suspicious  in the meantime both his uncle and sir nathaniel had thanked her for the invitationof which however they said they were unable to avail themselves  adam had a suspicion that though she answered regretfully she was in reality relieved  when he had got into the carriage with the two old men and they had driven off he was not surprised when sir nathaniel spoke  i could not but feel that she was glad to be rid of us  she can play her game better alone  what is her game asked adam unthinkingly  all the county knows it my boy  caswall is a very rich man  her husband was rich when she married himor seemed to be  when he committed suicide it was found that he had nothing left and the estate was mortgaged up to the hilt  her only hope is in a rich marriage  i suppose i need not draw any conclusion you can do that as well as i can  adam remained silent nearly all the time they were travelling through the alleged vale of cheshire  he thought much during that journey and came to several conclusions though his lips were unmoved  one of these conclusions was that he would be very careful about paying any attention to lady arabella  he was himself a rich man how rich not even his uncle had the least idea and would have been surprised had he known  the remainder of the journey was uneventful and upon arrival at liverpool they went aboard the west african which had just come to the landingstage  there his uncle introduced himself to mr caswall and followed this up by introducing sir nathaniel and then adam  the new comer received them graciously and said what a pleasure it was to be coming home after so long an absence of his family from their old seat adam was pleased at the warmth of the reception but he could not avoid a feeling of repugnance at the mans face  he was trying hard to overcome this when a diversion was caused by the arrival of lady arabella  the diversion was welcome to all the two saltons and sir nathaniel were shocked at caswalls faceso hard so ruthless so selfish so dominant god help any was the common thought who is under the domination of such a man  presently his african servant approached him and at once their thoughts changed to a larger toleration  caswall looked indeed a savagebut a cultured savage  in him were traces of the softening civilisation of agesof some of the higher instincts and education of man no matter how rudimentary these might be  but the face of oolanga as his master called him was unreformed unsoftened savage and inherent in it were all the hideous possibilities of a lost devilridden child of the forest and the swampthe lowest of all created things that could be regarded as in some form ostensibly human  lady arabella and oolanga arrived almost simultaneously and adam was surprised to notice what effect their appearance had on each other  the woman seemed as if she would notcould notcondescend to exhibit any concern or interest in such a creature  on the other hand the negros bearing was such as in itself to justify her pride  he treated her not merely as a slave treats his master but as a worshipper would treat a deity  he knelt before her with his hands out stretched and his forehead in the dust  so long as she remained he did not move it was only when she went over to caswall that he relaxed his attitude of devotion and stood by respectfully  adam spoke to his own man davenport who was standing by having arrived with the bailiff of lesser hill who had followed mr salton in a pony trap  as he spoke he pointed to an attentive ships steward and presently the two men were conversing  i think we ought to be moving mr salton said to adam  i have some things to do in liverpool and i am sure that both mr caswall and lady arabella would like to get under weigh for castra regis  i too sir would like to do something replied adam  i want to find out where ross the animal merchant livesi want to take a small animal home with me if you dont mind  he is only a little thing and will be no trouble  of course not my boy  what kind of animal is it that you want  a mongoose  a mongoose  what on earth do you want it for  to kill snakes  good  the old man remembered the mound of stones  no explanation was needed  when ross heard what was wanted he asked  do you want something special or will an ordinary mongoose do  well of course i want a good one  but i see no need for anything special  it is for ordinary use  i can let you have a choice of ordinary ones  i only asked because i have in stock a very special one which i got lately from nepaul  he has a record of his own  he killed a king cobra that had been seen in the rajahs garden  but i dont suppose we have any snakes of the kind in this cold climatei daresay an ordinary one will do  when adam got back to the carriage carefully carrying the box with the mongoose sir nathaniel said hullo what have you got there  a mongoose  what for  to kill snakes  sir nathaniel laughed  i heard lady arabellas invitation to you to come to dianas grove  well what on earth has that got to do with it  nothing directly that i know of  but we shall see  adam waited and the old man went on have you by any chance heard the other name which was given long ago to that place  no sir  it was calledlook here this subject wants a lot of talking over suppose we wait till we are alone and have lots of time before us  all right sir  adam was filled with curiosity but he thought it better not to hurry matters  all would come in good time  then the three men returned home leaving mr caswall to spend the night in liverpool  the following day the lesser hill party set out for castra regis and for the time adam thought no more of dianas grove or of what mysteries it had containedor might still contain  the guests were crowding in and special places were marked for important people  adam seeing so many persons of varied degree looked round for lady arabella but could not locate her  it was only when he saw the old fashioned travelling carriage approach and heard the sound of cheering which went with it that he realised that edgar caswall had arrived then on looking more closely he saw that lady arabella dressed as he had seen her last was seated beside him  when the carriage drew up at the great flight of steps the host jumped down and gave her his hand  it was evident to all that she was the chief guest at the festivities  it was not long before the seats on the dais were filled while the tenants and guests of lesser importance had occupied all the coigns of vantage not reserved  the order of the day had been carefully arranged by a committee  there were some speeches happily neither many nor long and then festivities were suspended till the time for feasting arrived  in the interval caswall walked among his guests speaking to all in a friendly manner and expressing a general welcome  the other guests came down from the dais and followed his example so there was unceremonious meeting and greeting between gentle and simple  adam salton naturally followed with his eyes all that went on within their scope taking note of all who seemed to afford any interest  he was young and a man and a stranger from a far distance so on all these accounts he naturally took stock rather of the women than of the men and of these those who were young and attractive  there were lots of pretty girls among the crowd and adam who was a handsome young man and well set up got his full share of admiring glances  these did not concern him much and he remained unmoved until there came along a group of three by their dress and bearing of the farmer class  one was a sturdy old man the other two were goodlooking girls one of a little over twenty the other not quite so old  so soon as adams eyes met those of the younger girl who stood nearest to him some sort of electricity flashedthat divine spark which begins by recognition and ends in obedience  men call it love  both his companions noticed how much adam was taken by the pretty girl and spoke of her to him in a way which made his heart warm to them  did you notice that party that passed  the old man is michael watford one of the tenants of mr caswall  he occupies mercy farm which sir nathaniel pointed out to you today  the girls are his granddaughters the elder lilla being the only child of his elder son who died when she was less than a year old  his wife died on the same day  she is a good girlas good as she is pretty  the other is her first cousin the daughter of watfords second son  he went for a soldier when he was just over twenty and was drafted abroad  he was not a good correspondent though he was a good enough son  a few letters came and then his father heard from the colonel of his regiment that he had been killed by dacoits in burmah  he heard from the same source that his boy had been married to a burmese and that there was a daughter only a year old  watford had the child brought home and she grew up beside lilla  the only thing that they heard of her birth was that her name was mimi  the two children adored each other and do to this day  strange how different they are  lilla all fair like the old saxon stock from which she is sprung mimi showing a trace of her mothers race  lilla is as gentle as a dove but mimis black eyes can glow whenever she is upset  the only thing that upsets her is when anything happens to injure or threaten or annoy lilla  then her eyes glow as do the eyes of a bird when her young are menaced     chapter vthe white worm   mr salton introduced adam to mr watford and his granddaughters and they all moved on together  of course neighbours in the position of the watfords knew all about adam salton his relationship circumstances and prospects  so it would have been strange indeed if both girls did not dream of possibilities of the future  in agricultural england eligible men of any class are rare  this particular man was specially eligible for he did not belong to a class in which barriers of caste were strong so when it began to be noticed that he walked beside mimi watford and seemed to desire her society all their friends endeavoured to give the promising affair a helping hand  when the gongs sounded for the banquet he went with her into the tent where her grandfather had seats  mr salton and sir nathaniel noticed that the young man did not come to claim his appointed place at the dais table but they understood and made no remark or indeed did not seem to notice his absence  lady arabella sat as before at edgar caswalls right hand  she was certainly a striking and unusual woman and to all it seemed fitting from her rank and personal qualities that she should be the chosen partner of the heir on his first appearance  of course nothing was said openly by those of her own class who were present but words were not necessary when so much could be expressed by nods and smiles  it seemed to be an accepted thing that at last there was to be a mistress of castra regis and that she was present amongst them  there were not lacking some who whilst admitting all her charm and beauty placed her in the second rank lilla watford being marked as first  there was sufficient divergence of type as well as of individual beauty to allow of fair comment lady arabella represented the aristocratic type and lilla that of the commonalty  when the dusk began to thicken mr salton and sir nathaniel walked homethe trap had been sent away early in the dayleaving adam to follow in his own time  he came in earlier than was expected and seemed upset about something  neither of the elders made any comment  they all lit cigarettes and as dinnertime was close at hand went to their rooms to get ready  adam had evidently been thinking in the interval  he joined the others in the drawingroom looking ruffled and impatienta condition of things seen for the first time  the others with the patienceor the experienceof age trusted to time to unfold and explain things  they had not long to wait  after sitting down and standing up several times adam suddenly burst out  that fellow seems to think he owns the earth  cant he let people alone  he seems to think that he has only to throw his handkerchief to any woman and be her master  this outburst was in itself enlightening  only thwarted affection in some guise could produce this feeling in an amiable young man  sir nathaniel as an old diplomatist had a way of understanding as if by foreknowledge the true inwardness of things and asked suddenly but in a matteroffact indifferent voice  was he after lilla  yes and the fellow didnt lose any time either  almost as soon as they met he began to butter her up and tell her how beautiful she was  why before he left her side he had asked himself to tea tomorrow at mercy farm  stupid ass  he might see that the girl isnt his sort  i never saw anything like it  it was just like a hawk and a pigeon  as he spoke sir nathaniel turned and looked at mr saltona keen look which implied a full understanding  tell us all about it adam  there are still a few minutes before dinner and we shall all have better appetites when we have come to some conclusion on this matter  there is nothing to tell sir that is the worst of it  i am bound to say that there was not a word said that a human being could object to  he was very civil and all that was properjust what a landlord might be to a tenants daughter    yetyetwell i dont know how it was but it made my blood boil  how did the hawk and the pigeon come in  sir nathaniels voice was soft and soothing nothing of contradiction or overdone curiosity in ita tone eminently suited to win confidence  i can hardly explain  i can only say that he looked like a hawk and she like a doveand now that i think of it that is what they each did look like and do look like in their normal condition  that is so came the soft voice of sir nathaniel  adam went on  perhaps that early roman look of his set me off  but i wanted to protect her she seemed in danger  she seems in danger in a way from all you young men  i couldnt help noticing the way that even you lookedas if you wished to absorb her  i hope both you young men will keep your heads cool put in mr salton you know adam it wont do to have any quarrel between you especially so soon after his homecoming and your arrival here  we must think of the feelings and happiness of our neighbours mustnt we  i hope so sir  i assure you that whatever may happen or even threaten i shall obey your wishes in this as in all things  hush whispered sir nathaniel who heard the servants in the passage bringing dinner  after dinner over the walnuts and the wine sir nathaniel returned to the subject of the local legends  it will perhaps be a less dangerous topic for us to discuss than more recent ones  all right sir said adam heartily  i think you may depend on me now with regard to any topic  i can even discuss mr caswall  indeed i may meet him tomorrow  he is going as i said to call at mercy farm at three oclockbut i have an appointment at two  i notice said mr salton that you do not lose any time  the two old men once more looked at each other steadily  then lest the mood of his listener should change with delay sir nathaniel began at once  i dont propose to tell you all the legends of mercia or even to make a selection of them  it will be better i think for our purpose if we consider a few factsrecorded or unrecordedabout this neighbourhood  i think we might begin with dianas grove  it has roots in the different epochs of our history and each has its special crop of legend  the druid and the roman are too far off for matters of detail but it seems to me the saxon and the angles are near enough to yield material for legendary lore  we find that this particular place had another name besides dianas grove  this was manifestly of roman origin or of grecian accepted as roman  the other is more pregnant of adventure and romance than the roman name  in mercian tongue it was the lair of the white worm  this needs a word of explanation at the beginning  in the dawn of the language the word worm had a somewhat different meaning from that in use today  it was an adaptation of the anglosaxon wyrm meaning a dragon or snake or from the gothic waurms a serpent or the icelandic ormur or the german wurm  we gather that it conveyed originally an idea of size and power not as now in the diminutive of both these meanings  here legendary history helps us  we have the wellknown legend of the worm well of lambton castle and that of the laidly worm of spindleston heugh near bamborough  in both these legends the worm was a monster of vast size and powera veritable dragon or serpent such as legend attributes to vast fens or quags where there was illimitable room for expansion  a glance at a geological map will show that whatever truth there may have been of the actuality of such monsters in the early geologic periods at least there was plenty of possibility  in england there were originally vast plains where the plentiful supply of water could gather  the streams were deep and slow and there were holes of abysmal depth where any kind and size of antediluvian monster could find a habitat  in places which now we can see from our windows were mudholes a hundred or more feet deep  who can tell us when the age of the monsters which flourished in slime came to an end  there must have been places and conditions which made for greater longevity greater size greater strength than was usual  such overlappings may have come down even to our earlier centuries  nay are there not now creatures of a vastness of bulk regarded by the generality of men as impossible  even in our own day there are seen the traces of animals if not the animals themselves of stupendous sizeveritable survivals from earlier ages preserved by some special qualities in their habitats  i remember meeting a distinguished man in india who had the reputation of being a great shikaree who told me that the greatest temptation he had ever had in his life was to shoot a giant snake which he had come across in the terai of upper india  he was on a tigershooting expedition and as his elephant was crossing a nullah it squealed  he looked down from his howdah and saw that the elephant had stepped across the body of a snake which was dragging itself through the jungle  so far as i could see he said it must have been eighty or one hundred feet in length  fully forty or fifty feet was on each side of the track and though the weight which it dragged had thinned it it was as thick round as a mans body  i suppose you know that when you are after tiger it is a point of honour not to shoot at anything else as life may depend on it  i could easily have spined this monster but i felt that i must notso with regret i had to let it go  just imagine such a monster anywhere in this country and at once we could get a sort of idea of the worms which possibly did frequent the great morasses which spread round the mouths of many of the great european rivers  i havent the least doubt sir that there may have been such monsters as you have spoken of still existing at a much later period than is generally accepted replied adam  also if there were such things that this was the very place for them  i have tried to think over the matter since you pointed out the configuration of the ground  but it seems to me that there is a hiatus somewhere  are there not mechanical difficulties  in what way  well our antique monster must have been mighty heavy and the distances he had to travel were long and the ways difficult  from where we are now sitting down to the level of the mudholes is a distance of several hundred feeti am leaving out of consideration altogether any lateral distance  is it possible that there was a way by which a monster could travel up and down and yet no chance recorder have ever seen him  of course we have the legends but is not some more exact evidence necessary in a scientific investigation  my dear adam all you say is perfectly right and were we starting on such an investigation we could not do better than follow your reasoning but my dear boy you must remember that all this took place thousands of years ago  you must remember too that all records of the kind that would help us are lacking  also that the places to be considered were desert so far as human habitation or population are considered  in the vast desolation of such a place as complied with the necessary conditions there must have been such profusion of natural growth as would bar the progress of men formed as we are  the lair of such a monster would not have been disturbed for hundredsor thousandsof years  moreover these creatures must have occupied places quite inaccessible to man  a snake who could make himself comfortable in a quagmire a hundred feet deep would be protected on the outskirts by such stupendous morasses as now no longer exist or which if they exist anywhere at all can be on very few places on the earths surface  far be it from me to say that in more elemental times such things could not have been  the condition belongs to the geologic agethe great birth and growth of the world when natural forces ran riot when the struggle for existence was so savage that no vitality which was not founded in a gigantic form could have even a possibility of survival  that such a time existed we have evidences in geology but there only we can never expect proofs such as this age demands  we can only imagine or surmise such thingsor such conditions and such forces as overcame them     chapter vihawk and pigeon   at breakfasttime next morning sir nathaniel and mr salton were seated when adam came hurriedly into the room  any news asked his uncle mechanically  four  four what asked sir nathaniel  snakes said adam helping himself to a grilled kidney  four snakes  i dont understand  mongoose said adam and then added explanatorily i was out with the mongoose just after three  four snakes in one morning  why i didnt know there were so many on the browthe local name for the western cliff  i hope that wasnt the consequence of our talk of last night  it was sir  but not directly  but god bless my soul you didnt expect to get a snake like the lambton worm did you  why a mongoose to tackle a monster like thatif there were onewould have to be bigger than a haystack  these were ordinary snakes about as big as a walkingstick  well its pleasant to be rid of them big or little  that is a good mongoose i am sure hell clear out all such vermin round here said mr salton  adam went quietly on with his breakfast  killing a few snakes in a morning was no new experience to him  he left the room the moment breakfast was finished and went to the study that his uncle had arranged for him  both sir nathaniel and mr salton took it that he wanted to be by himself so as to avoid any questioning or talk of the visit that he was to make that afternoon  they saw nothing further of him till about halfanhour before dinnertime  then he came quietly into the smoking room where mr salton and sir nathaniel were sitting together ready dressed  i suppose there is no use waiting  we had better get it over at once remarked adam  his uncle thinking to make things easier for him said get what over  there was a sign of shyness about him at this  he stammered a little at first but his voice became more even as he went on  my visit to mercy farm  mr salton waited eagerly  the old diplomatist simply smiled  i suppose you both know that i was much interested yesterday in the watfords  there was no denial or fending off the question  both the old men smiled acquiescence  adam went on i meant you to see itboth of you  you uncle because you are my uncle and the nearest of my own kin and moreover you couldnt have been more kind to me or made me more welcome if you had been my own father  mr salton said nothing  he simply held out his hand and the other took it and held it for a few seconds  and you sir because you have shown me something of the same affection which in my wildest dreams of home i had no right to expect he stopped for an instant much moved  sir nathaniel answered softly laying his hand on the youths shoulder  you are right my boy quite right  that is the proper way to look at it  and i may tell you that we old men who have no children of our own feel our hearts growing warm when we hear words like those  then adam hurried on speaking with a rush as if he wanted to come to the crucial point  mr watford had not come in but lilla and mimi were at home and they made me feel very welcome  they have all a great regard for my uncle  i am glad of that any way for i like them allmuch  we were having tea when mr caswall came to the door attended by the negro  lilla opened the door herself  the window of the livingroom at the farm is a large one and from within you cannot help seeing anyone coming  mr caswall said he had ventured to call as he wished to make the acquaintance of all his tenants in a less formal way and more individually than had been possible to him on the previous day  the girls made him welcomethey are very sweet girls those sir someone will be very happy some day therewith either of them  and that man may be you adam said mr salton heartily  a sad look came over the young mans eyes and the fire his uncle had seen there died out  likewise the timbre left his voice making it sound lonely  such might crown my life  but that happiness i fear is not for meor not without pain and loss and woe  well its early days yet cried sir nathaniel heartily  the young man turned on him his eyes which had now grown excessively sad  yesterdaya few hours agothat remark would have given me new hopenew courage but since then i have learned too much  the old man skilled in the human heart did not attempt to argue in such a matter  too early to give in my boy  i am not of a givingin kind replied the young man earnestly  but after all it is wise to realise a truth  and when a man though he is young feels as i doas i have felt ever since yesterday when i first saw mimis eyeshis heart jumps  he does not need to learn things  he knows  there was silence in the room during which the twilight stole on imperceptibly  it was adam who again broke the silence  do you know uncle if we have any second sight in our family  no not that i ever heard about  why  because he answered slowly i have a conviction which seems to answer all the conditions of second sight  and then asked the old man much perturbed  and then the usual inevitable  what in the hebrides and other places where the sight is a culta beliefis called the doomthe court from which there is no appeal  i have often heard of second sightwe have many western scots in australia but i have realised more of its true inwardness in an instant of this afternoon than i did in the whole of my life previouslya granite wall stretching up to the very heavens so high and so dark that the eye of god himself cannot see beyond  well if the doom must come it must  that is all  the voice of sir nathaniel broke in smooth and sweet and grave  can there not be a fight for it  there can for most things  for most things yes but for the doom no  what a man can do i shall do  there will bemust bea fight  when and where and how i know not but a fight there will be  but after all what is a man in such a case  adam there are three of us  salton looked at his old friend as he spoke and that old friends eyes blazed  ay three of us he said and his voice rang  there was again a pause and sir nathaniel endeavoured to get back to less emotional and more neutral ground  tell us of the rest of the meeting  remember we are all pledged to this  it is a fight a loutrance and we can afford to throw away or forgo no chance  we shall throw away or lose nothing that we can help  we fight to win and the stake is a lifeperhaps more than onewe shall see  then he went on in a conversational tone such as he had used when he spoke of the coming to the farm of edgar caswall when mr caswall came in the negro went a short distance away and there remained  it gave me the idea that he expected to be called and intended to remain in sight or within hail  then mimi got another cup and made fresh tea and we all went on together  was there anything uncommonwere you all quite friendly asked sir nathaniel quietly  quite friendly  there was nothing that i could notice out of the commonexcept he went on with a slight hardening of the voice except that he kept his eyes fixed on lilla in a way which was quite intolerable to any man who might hold her dear  now in what way did he look asked sir nathaniel  there was nothing in itself offensive but no one could help noticing it  you did  miss watford herself who was the victim and mr caswall who was the offender are out of range as witnesses  was there anyone else who noticed  mimi did  her face flamed with anger as she saw the look  what kind of look was it  overardent or too admiring or what  was it the look of a lover or one who fain would be  you understand  yes sir i quite understand  anything of that sort i should of course notice  it would be part of my preparation for keeping my selfcontrolto which i am pledged  if it were not amatory was it threatening  where was the offence  adam smiled kindly at the old man  it was not amatory  even if it was such was to be expected  i should be the last man in the world to object since i am myself an offender in that respect  moreover not only have i been taught to fight fair but by nature i believe i am just  i would be as tolerant of and as liberal to a rival as i should expect him to be to me  no the look i mean was nothing of that kind  and so long as it did not lack proper respect i should not of my own part condescend to notice it  did you ever study the eyes of a hound  at rest  no when he is following his instincts  or better still adam went on the eyes of a bird of prey when he is following his instincts  not when he is swooping but merely when he is watching his quarry  no said sir nathaniel i dont know that i ever did  why may i ask  that was the look  certainly not amatory or anything of that kindyet it was it struck me more dangerous if not so deadly as an actual threatening  again there was a silence which sir nathaniel broke as he stood up  i think it would be well if we all thought over this by ourselves  then we can renew the subject     chapter viioolanga   mr salton had an appointment for six oclock at liverpool  when he had driven off sir nathaniel took adam by the arm  may i come with you for a while to your study  i want to speak to you privately without your uncle knowing about it or even what the subject is  you dont mind do you  it is not idle curiosity  no no  it is on the subject to which we are all committed  is it necessary to keep my uncle in the dark about it  he might be offended  it is not necessary but it is advisable  it is for his sake that i asked  my friend is an old man and it might concern him undulyeven alarm him  i promise you there shall be nothing that could cause him anxiety in our silence or at which he could take umbrage  go on sir said adam simply  you see your uncle is now an old man  i know it for we were boys together  he has led an uneventful and somewhat selfcontained life so that any such condition of things as has now arisen is apt to perplex him from its very strangeness  in fact any new matter is trying to old people  it has its own disturbances and its own anxieties and neither of these things are good for lives that should be restful  your uncle is a strong man with a very happy and placid nature  given health and ordinary conditions of life there is no reason why he should not live to be a hundred  you and i therefore who both love him though in different ways should make it our business to protect him from all disturbing influences  i am sure you will agree with me that any labour to this end would be well spent  all right my boy  i see your answer in your eyes so we need say no more of that  and now here his voice changed tell me all that took place at that interview  there are strange things in front of ushow strange we cannot at present even guess  doubtless some of the difficult things to understand which lie behind the veil will in time be shown to us to see and to understand  in the meantime all we can do is to work patiently fearlessly and unselfishly to an end that we think is right  you had got so far as where lilla opened the door to mr caswall and the negro  you also observed that mimi was disturbed in her mind at the way mr caswall looked at her cousin  certainlythough disturbed is a poor way of expressing her objection  can you remember well enough to describe caswalls eyes and how lilla looked and what mimi said and did  also oolanga caswalls west african servant  ill do what i can sir  all the time mr caswall was staring he kept his eyes fixed and motionlessbut not as if he was in a trance  his forehead was wrinkled up as it is when one is trying to see through or into something  at the best of times his face has not a gentle expression but when it was screwed up like that it was almost diabolical  it frightened poor lilla so that she trembled and after a bit got so pale that i thought she had fainted  however she held up and tried to stare back but in a feeble kind of way  then mimi came close and held her hand  that braced her up andstill never ceasing her return stareshe got colour again and seemed more like herself  did he stare too  more than ever  the weaker lilla seemed the stronger he became just as if he were feeding on her strength  all at once she turned round threw up her hands and fell down in a faint  i could not see what else happened just then for mimi had thrown herself on her knees beside her and hid her from me  then there was something like a black shadow between us and there was the nigger looking more like a malignant devil than ever  i am not usually a patient man and the sight of that ugly devil is enough to make ones blood boil  when he saw my face he seemed to realise dangerimmediate dangerand slunk out of the room as noiselessly as if he had been blown out  i learned one thing howeverhe is an enemy if ever a man had one  that still leaves us three to two put in sir nathaniel  then caswall slunk out much as the nigger had done  when he had gone lilla recovered at once  now said sir nathaniel anxious to restore peace have you found out anything yet regarding the negro  i am anxious to be posted regarding him  i fear there will be or may be grave trouble with him  yes sir ive heard a good deal about himof course it is not official but hearsay must guide us at first  you know my man davenportprivate secretary confidential man of business and general factotum  he is devoted to me and has my full confidence  i asked him to stay on board the west african and have a good look round and find out what he could about mr caswall  naturally he was struck with the aboriginal savage  he found one of the ships stewards who had been on the regular voyages to south africa  he knew oolanga and had made a study of him  he is a man who gets on well with niggers and they open their hearts to him  it seems that this oolanga is quite a great person in the nigger world of the african west coast  he has the two things which men of his own colour respect he can make them afraid and he is lavish with money  i dont know whose moneybut that does not matter they are always ready to trumpet his greatness  evil greatness it isbut neither does that matter  briefly this is his history  he was originally a witchfinderabout as low an occupation as exists amongst aboriginal savages  then he got up in the world and became an obiman which gives an opportunity to wealth via blackmail  finally he reached the highest honour in hellish service  he became a user of voodoo which seems to be a service of the utmost baseness and cruelty  i was told some of his deeds of cruelty which are simply sickening  they made me long for an opportunity of helping to drive him back to hell  you might think to look at him that you could measure in some way the extent of his vileness but it would be a vain hope  monsters such as he is belong to an earlier and more rudimentary stage of barbarism  he is in his way a clever fellowfor a nigger but is none the less dangerous or the less hateful for that  the men in the ship told me that he was a collector some of them had seen his collections  such collections  all that was potent for evil in bird or beast or even in fish  beaks that could break and rend and tearall the birds represented were of a predatory kind  even the fishes are those which are born to destroy to wound to torture  the collection i assure you was an object lesson in human malignity  this being has enough evil in his face to frighten even a strong man  it is little wonder that the sight of it put that poor girl into a dead faint  nothing more could be done at the moment so they separated  adam was up in the early morning and took a smart walk round the brow  as he was passing dianas grove he looked in on the short avenue of trees and noticed the snakes killed on the previous morning by the mongoose they all lay in a row straight and rigid as if they had been placed by hands  their skins seemed damp and sticky and they were covered all over with ants and other insects  they looked loathsome so after a glance he passed on  a little later when his steps took him naturally enough past the entrance to mercy farm he was passed by the negro moving quickly under the trees wherever there was shadow  laid across one extended arm looking like dirty towels across a rail he had the horridlooking snakes  he did not seem to see adam  no one was to be seen at mercy except a few workmen in the farmyard so after waiting on the chance of seeing mimi adam began to go slowly home  once more he was passed on the way  this time it was by lady arabella walking hurriedly and so furiously angry that she did not recognise him even to the extent of acknowledging his bow  when adam got back to lesser hill he went to the coachhouse where the box with the mongoose was kept and took it with him intending to finish at the mound of stone what he had begun the previous morning with regard to the extermination  he found that the snakes were even more easily attacked than on the previous day no less than six were killed in the first halfhour  as no more appeared he took it for granted that the mornings work was over and went towards home  the mongoose had by this time become accustomed to him and was willing to let himself be handled freely  adam lifted him up and put him on his shoulder and walked on presently he saw a lady advancing towards him and recognised lady arabella  hitherto the mongoose had been quiet like a playful affectionate kitten but when the two got close adam was horrified to see the mongoose in a state of the wildest fury with every hair standing on end jump from his shoulder and run towards lady arabella  it looked so furious and so intent on attack that he called a warning  look outlook out  the animal is furious and means to attack  lady arabella looked more than ever disdainful and was passing on the mongoose jumped at her in a furious attack  adam rushed forward with his stick the only weapon he had  but just as he got within striking distance the lady drew out a revolver and shot the animal breaking his backbone  not satisfied with this she poured shot after shot into him till the magazine was exhausted  there was no coolness or hauteur about her now she seemed more furious even than the animal her face transformed with hate and as determined to kill as he had appeared to be  adam not knowing exactly what to do lifted his hat in apology and hurried on to lesser hill     chapter viiisurvivals   at breakfast sir nathaniel noticed that adam was put out about something but he said nothing  the lesson of silence is better remembered in age than in youth  when they were both in the study where sir nathaniel followed him adam at once began to tell his companion of what had happened  sir nathaniel looked graver and graver as the narration proceeded and when adam had stopped he remained silent for several minutes before speaking  this is very grave  i have not formed any opinion yet but it seems to me at first impression that this is worse than anything i had expected  why sir said adam  is the killing of a mongooseno matter by whomso serious a thing as all that  his companion smoked on quietly for quite another few minutes before he spoke  when i have properly thought it over i may moderate my opinion but in the meantime it seems to me that there is something dreadful behind all thissomething that may affect all our livesthat may mean the issue of life or death to any of us  adam sat up quickly  do tell me sir what is in your mindif of course you have no objection or do not think it better to withhold it  i have no objection adamin fact if i had i should have to overcome it  i fear there can be no more reserved thoughts between us  indeed sir that sounds serious worse than serious  adam i greatly fear that the time has come for usfor you and me at all eventsto speak out plainly to one another  does not there seem something very mysterious about this  i have thought so sir all along  the only difficulty one has is what one is to think and where to begin  let us begin with what you have told me  first take the conduct of the mongoose  he was quiet even friendly and affectionate with you  he only attacked the snakes which is after all his business in life  that is so  then we must try to find some reason why he attacked lady arabella  may it not be that a mongoose may have merely the instinct to attack that nature does not allow or provide him with the fine reasoning powers to discriminate who he is to attack  of course that may be so  but on the other hand should we not satisfy ourselves why he does wish to attack anything  if for centuries this particular animal is known to attack only one kind of other animal are we not justified in assuming that when one of them attacks a hitherto unclassed animal he recognises in that animal some quality which it has in common with the hereditary enemy  that is a good argument sir adam went on but a dangerous one  if we followed it out it would lead us to believe that lady arabella is a snake  we must be sure before going to such an end that there is no point as yet unconsidered which would account for the unknown thing which puzzles us  in what way  well suppose the instinct works on some physical basisfor instance smell  if there were anything in recent juxtaposition to the attacked which would carry the scent surely that would supply the missing cause  of course adam spoke with conviction  now from what you tell me the negro had just come from the direction of dianas grove carrying the dead snakes which the mongoose had killed the previous morning  might not the scent have been carried that way  of course it might and probably was  i never thought of that  is there any possible way of guessing approximately how long a scent will remain  you see this is a natural scent and may derive from a place where it has been effective for thousands of years  then does a scent of any kind carry with it any form or quality of another kind either good or evil  i ask you because one ancient name of the house lived in by the lady who was attacked by the mongoose was the lair of the white worm  if any of these things be so our difficulties have multiplied indefinitely  they may even change in kind  we may get into moral entanglements before we know it we may be in the midst of a struggle between good and evil  sir nathaniel smiled gravely  with regard to the first questionso far as i know there are no fixed periods for which a scent may be activei think we may take it that that period does not run into thousands of years  as to whether any moral change accompanies a physical one i can only say that i have met no proof of the fact  at the same time we must remember that good and evil are terms so wide as to take in the whole scheme of creation and all that is implied by them and by their mutual action and reaction generally i would say that in the scheme of a first cause anything is possible  so long as the inherent forces or tendencies of any one thing are veiled from us we must expect mystery  there is one other question on which i should like to ask your opinion suppose that there are any permanent forces appertaining to the past what we may call survivals do these belong to good as well as to evil for instance if the scent of the primaeval monster can so remain in proportion to the original strength can the same be true of things of good import  sir nathaniel thought for a while before he answered  we must be careful not to confuse the physical and the moral  i can see that already you have switched on the moral entirely so perhaps we had better follow it up first  on the side of the moral we have certain justification for belief in the utterances of revealed religion  for instance the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much is altogether for good  we have nothing of a similar kind on the side of evil  but if we accept this dictum we need have no more fear of mysteries these become thenceforth merely obstacles  adam suddenly changed to another phase of the subject  and now sir may i turn for a few minutes to purely practical things or rather to matters of historical fact  sir nathaniel bowed acquiescence  we have already spoken of the history so far as it is known of some of the places round uscastra regis dianas grove and the lair of the white worm  i would like to ask if there is anything not necessarily of evil import about any of the places  which asked sir nathaniel shrewdly  well for instance this house and mercy farm  here we turn said sir nathaniel to the other side the light side of things  let us take mercy farm first  when augustine was sent by pope gregory to christianise england in the time of the romans he was received and protected by ethelbert king of kent whose wife daughter of charibert king of paris was a christian and did much for augustine she founded a nunnery in memory of columba which was named sedes misericordioe the house of mercy and as the region was mercian the two names became involved  as columba is the latin for dove the dove became a sort of signification of the nunnery  she seized on the idea and made the newlyfounded nunnery a house of doves  someone sent her a freshlydiscovered dove a sort of carrier but which had in the white feathers of its head and neck the form of a religious cowl  the nunnery flourished for more than a century when in the time of penda who was the reactionary of heathendom it fell into decay  in the meantime the doves protected by religious feeling had increased mightily and were known in all catholic communities  when king offa ruled in mercia about a hundred and fifty years later he restored christianity and under its protection the nunnery of st columba was restored and its doves flourished again  in process of time this religious house again fell into desuetude but before it disappeared it had achieved a great name for good works and in especial for the piety of its members  if deeds and prayers and hopes and earnest thinking leave anywhere any moral effect mercy farm and all around it have almost the right to be considered holy ground  thank you sir said adam earnestly and was silent  sir nathaniel understood  after lunch that day adam casually asked sir nathaniel to come for a walk with him  the keenwitted old diplomatist guessed that there must be some motive behind the suggestion and he at once agreed  as soon as they were free from observation adam began  i am afraid sir that there is more going on in this neighbourhood than most people imagine  i was out this morning and on the edge of the small wood i came upon the body of a child by the roadside  at first i thought she was dead and while examining her i noticed on her neck some marks that looked like those of teeth  some wild dog perhaps put in sir nathaniel  possibly sir though i think notbut listen to the rest of my news  i glanced around and to my surprise i noticed something white moving among the trees  i placed the child down carefully and followed but i could not find any further traces  so i returned to the child and resumed my examination and to my delight i discovered that she was still alive  i chafed her hands and gradually she revived but to my disappointment she remembered nothingexcept that something had crept up quietly from behind and had gripped her round the throat  then apparently she fainted  gripped her round the throat  then it cannot have been a dog  no sir that is my difficulty and explains why i brought you out here where we cannot possibly be overheard  you have noticed of course the peculiar sinuous way in which lady arabella moveswell i feel certain that the white thing that i saw in the wood was the mistress of dianas grove  good god boy be careful what you say  yes sir i fully realise the gravity of my accusation but i feel convinced that the marks on the childs throat were humanand made by a woman  adams companion remained silent for some time deep in thought  adam my boy he said at last this matter appears to me to be far more serious even than you think  it forces me to break confidence with my old friend your unclebut in order to spare him i must do so  for some time now things have been happening in this district that have been worrying him dreadfullyseveral people have disappeared without leaving the slightest trace a dead child was found by the roadside with no visible or ascertainable cause of deathsheep and other animals have been found in the fields bleeding from open wounds  there have been other mattersmany of them apparently trivial in themselves  some sinister influence has been at work and i admit that i have suspected lady arabellathat is why i questioned you so closely about the mongoose and its strange attack upon lady arabella  you will think it strange that i should suspect the mistress of dianas grove a beautiful woman of aristocratic birth  let me explainthe family seat is near my own place doom tower and at one time i knew the family well  when still a young girl lady arabella wandered into a small wood near her home and did not return  she was found unconscious and in a high feverthe doctor said that she had received a poisonous bite and the girl being at a delicate and critical age the result was seriousso much so that she was not expected to recover  a great london physician came down but could do nothingindeed he said that the girl would not survive the night  all hope had been abandoned when to everyones surprise lady arabella made a sudden and startling recovery  within a couple of days she was going about as usual  but to the horror of her people she developed a terrible craving for cruelty maiming and injuring birds and small animalseven killing them  this was put down to a nervous disturbance due to her age and it was hoped that her marriage to captain march would put this right  however it was not a happy marriage and eventually her husband was found shot through the head  i have always suspected suicide though no pistol was found near the body  he may have discovered somethinggod knows whatso possibly lady arabella may herself have killed him  putting together many small matters that have come to my knowledge i have come to the conclusion that the foul white worm obtained control of her body just as her soul was leaving its earthly tenementthat would explain the sudden revival of energy the strange and inexplicable craving for maiming and killing as well as many other matters with which i need not trouble you now adam  as i said just now god alone knows what poor captain march discoveredit must have been something too ghastly for human endurance if my theory is correct that the once beautiful human body of lady arabella is under the control of this ghastly white worm  adam nodded  but what can we do sirit seems a most difficult problem  we can do nothing my boythat is the important part of it  it would be impossible to take actionall we can do is to keep careful watch especially as regards lady arabella and be ready to act promptly and decisively if the opportunity occurs  adam agreed and the two men returned to lesser hill     chapter ixsmelling death   adam salton though he talked little did not let the grass grow under his feet in any matter which he had undertaken or in which he was interested  he had agreed with sir nathaniel that they should not do anything with regard to the mystery of lady arabellas fear of the mongoose but he steadily pursued his course in being prepared to act whenever the opportunity might come  he was in his own mind perpetually casting about for information or clues which might lead to possible lines of action  baffled by the killing of the mongoose he looked around for another line to follow  he was fascinated by the idea of there being a mysterious link between the woman and the animal but he was already preparing a second string to his bow  his new idea was to use the faculties of oolanga so far as he could in the service of discovery his first move was to send davenport to liverpool to try to find the steward of the west african who had told him about oolanga and if possible secure any further information and then try to induce by bribery or other means the nigger to come to the brow  so soon as he himself could have speech of the voodooman he would be able to learn from him something useful  davenport was successful in his missions for he had to get another mongoose and he was able to tell adam that he had seen the steward who told him much that he wanted to know and had also arranged for oolanga to come to lesser hill the following day  at this point adam saw his way sufficiently clear to admit davenport to some extent into his confidence  he had come to the conclusion that it would be bettercertainly at firstnot himself to appear in the matter with which davenport was fully competent to deal  it would be time for himself to take a personal part when matters had advanced a little further  if what the nigger said was in any wise true the man had a rare gift which might be useful in the quest they were after  he could as it were smell death  if any one was dead if any one had died or if a place had been used in connection with death he seemed to know the broad fact by intuition  adam made up his mind that to test this faculty with regard to several places would be his first task  naturally he was anxious and the time passed slowly  the only comfort was the arrival the next morning of a strong packing case locked from ross the key being in the custody of davenport  in the case were two smaller boxes both locked  one of them contained a mongoose to replace that killed by lady arabella the other was the special mongoose which had already killed the kingcobra in nepaul  when both the animals had been safely put under lock and key he felt that he might breathe more freely  no one was allowed to know the secret of their existence in the house except himself and davenport  he arranged that davenport should take oolanga round the neighbourhood for a walk stopping at each of the places which he designated  having gone all along the brow he was to return the same way and induce him to touch on the same subjects in talking with adam who was to meet them as if by chance at the farthest partthat beyond mercy farm  the incidents of the day proved much as adam expected  at mercy farm at dianas grove at castra regis and a few other spots the negro stopped and opening his wide nostrils as if to sniff boldly said that he smelled death  it was not always in the same form  at mercy farm he said there were many small deaths  at dianas grove his bearing was different  there was a distinct sense of enjoyment about him especially when he spoke of many great deaths  here too he sniffed in a strange way like a bloodhound at check and looked puzzled  he said no word in either praise or disparagement but in the centre of the grove where hidden amongst ancient oak stumps was a block of granite slightly hollowed on the top he bent low and placed his forehead on the ground this was the only place where he showed distinct reverence  at the castle though he spoke of much death he showed no sign of respect  there was evidently something about dianas grove which both interested and baffled him  before leaving he moved all over the place unsatisfied and in one spot close to the edge of the brow where there was a deep hollow he appeared to be afraid  after returning several times to this place he suddenly turned and ran in a panic of fear to the higher ground crossing as he did so the outcropping rock  then he seemed to breathe more freely and recovered some of his jaunty impudence  all this seemed to satisfy adams expectations  he went back to lesser hill with a serene and settled calm upon him  sir nathaniel followed him into his study  by the way i forgot to ask you details about one thing  when that extraordinary staring episode of mr caswall went on how did lilla take ithow did she bear herself  she looked frightened and trembled just as i have seen a pigeon with a hawk or a bird with a serpent  thanks  it is just as i expected  there have been circumstances in the caswall family which lead one to believe that they have had from the earliest times some extraordinary mesmeric or hypnotic faculty  indeed a skilled eye could read so much in their physiognomy  that shot of yours whether by instinct or intention of the hawk and the pigeon was peculiarly apposite  i think we may settle on that as a fixed trait to be accepted throughout our investigation  when dusk had fallen adam took the new mongoosenot the one from nepauland carrying the box slung over his shoulder strolled towards dianas grove  close to the gateway he met lady arabella clad as usual in tightly fitting white which showed off her slim figure  to his intense astonishment the mongoose allowed her to pet him take him up in her arms and fondle him  as she was going in his direction they walked on together  round the roadway between the entrances of dianas grove and lesser hill were many trees with not much foliage except at the top  in the dusk this place was shadowy and the view was hampered by the clustering trunks  in the uncertain tremulous light which fell through the tree tops it was hard to distinguish anything clearly and at last somehow he lost sight of her altogether and turned back on his track to find her  presently he came across her close to her own gate  she was leaning over the paling of split oak branches which formed the paling of the avenue  he could not see the mongoose so he asked her where it had gone  he slipt out of my arms while i was petting him she answered and disappeared under the hedges  they found him at a place where the avenue widened so as to let carriages pass each other  the little creature seemed quite changed  he had been ebulliently active now he was dull and spiritlessseemed to be dazed he allowed himself to be lifted by either of the pair but when he was alone with lady arabella he kept looking round him in a strange way as though trying to escape  when they had come out on the roadway adam held the mongoose tight to him and lifting his hat to his companion moved quickly towards lesser hill he and lady arabella lost sight of each other in the thickening gloom  when adam got home he put the mongoose in his box and locked the door of the room  the other mongoosethe one from nepaulwas safely locked in his own box but he lay quiet and did not stir  when he got to his study sir nathaniel came in shutting the door behind him  i have come he said while we have an opportunity of being alone to tell you something of the caswall family which i think will interest you there is or used to be a belief in this part of the world that the caswall family had some strange power of making the wills of other persons subservient to their own  there are many allusions to the subject in memoirs and other unimportant works but i only know of one where the subject is spoken of definitely  it is mercia and its worthies written by ezra toms more than a hundred years ago  the author goes into the question of the close association of the then edgar caswall with mesmer in paris  he speaks of caswall being a pupil and the fellow worker of mesmer and states that though when the latter left france he took away with him a vast quantity of philosophical and electric instruments he was never known to use them again  he once made it known to a friend that he had given them to his old pupil  the term he used was odd for it was bequeathed but no such bequest of mesmer was ever made known  at any rate the instruments were missing and never turned up  a servant came into the room to tell adam that there was some strange noise coming from the locked room into which he had gone when he came in he hurried off to the place at once sir nathaniel going with him  having locked the door behind them adam opened the packingcase where the boxes of the two mongooses were locked up  there was no sound from one of them but from the other a queer restless struggling  having opened both boxes he found that the noise was from the nepaul animal which however became quiet at once  in the other box the new mongoose lay dead with every appearance of having been strangled     chapter xthe kite   on the following day a little after four oclock adam set out for mercy  he was home just as the clocks were striking six  he was pale and upset but otherwise looked strong and alert  the old man summed up his appearance and manner thus braced up for battle  now said sir nathaniel and settled down to listen looking at adam steadily and listening attentively that he might miss nothingeven the inflection of a word  i found lilla and mimi at home  watford had been detained by business on the farm  miss watford received me as kindly as before mimi too seemed glad to see me  mr caswall came so soon after i arrived that he or someone on his behalf must have been watching for me  he was followed closely by the negro who was puffing hard as if he had been runningso it was probably he who watched  mr caswall was very cool and collected but there was a more than usually iron look about his face that i did not like  however we got on very well  he talked pleasantly on all sorts of questions  the nigger waited a while and then disappeared as on the other occasion  mr caswalls eyes were as usual fixed on lilla  true they seemed to be very deep and earnest but there was no offence in them  had it not been for the drawing down of the brows and the stern set of the jaws i should not at first have noticed anything  but the stare when presently it began increased in intensity  i could see that lilla began to suffer from nervousness as on the first occasion but she carried herself bravely  however the more nervous she grew the harder mr caswall stared  it was evident to me that he had come prepared for some sort of mesmeric or hypnotic battle  after a while he began to throw glances round him and then raised his hand without letting either lilla or mimi see the action  it was evidently intended to give some sign to the negro for he came in his usual stealthy way quietly in by the hall door which was open  then mr caswalls efforts at staring became intensified and poor lillas nervousness grew greater  mimi seeing that her cousin was distressed came close to her as if to comfort or strengthen her with the consciousness of her presence  this evidently made a difficulty for mr caswall for his efforts without appearing to get feebler seemed less effective  this continued for a little while to the gain of both lilla and mimi  then there was a diversion  without word or apology the door opened and lady arabella march entered the room  i had seen her coming through the great window  without a word she crossed the room and stood beside mr caswall  it really was very like a fight of a peculiar kind and the longer it was sustained the more earnestthe fiercerit grew that combination of forcesthe overlord the white woman and the black manwould have cost someprobably all of themtheir lives in the southern states of america  to us it was simply horrible  but all that you can understand  this time to go on in sporting phrase it was understood by all to be a fight to a finish and the mixed group did not slacken a moment or relax their efforts  on lilla the strain began to tell disastrously  she grew palea patchy pallor which meant that her nerves were out of order  she trembled like an aspen and though she struggled bravely i noticed that her legs would hardly support her  a dozen times she seemed about to collapse in a faint but each time on catching sight of mimis eyes she made a fresh struggle and pulled through  by now mr caswalls face had lost its appearance of passivity  his eyes glowed with a fiery light  he was still the old roman in inflexibility of purpose but grafted on to the roman was a new berserker fury  his companions in the baleful work seemed to have taken on something of his feeling  lady arabella looked like a soulless pitiless being not human unless it revived old legends of transformed human beings who had lost their humanity in some transformation or in the sweep of natural savagery  as for the negrowell i can only say that it was solely due to the selfrestraint which you impressed on me that i did not wipe him out as he stoodwithout warning without fair playwithout a single one of the graces of life and death  lilla was silent in the helpless concentration of deadly fear mimi was all resolve and selfforgetfulness so intent on the soulstruggle in which she was engaged that there was no possibility of any other thought  as for myself the bonds of will which held me inactive seemed like bands of steel which numbed all my faculties except sight and hearing  we seemed fixed in an impasse  something must happen though the power of guessing was inactive  as in a dream i saw mimis hand move restlessly as if groping for something  mechanically it touched that of lilla and in that instant she was transformed  it was as if youth and strength entered afresh into something already dead to sensibility and intention as if by inspiration she grasped the others band with a force which blenched the knuckles  her face suddenly flamed as if some divine light shone through it  her form expanded till it stood out majestically lifting her right hand she stepped forward towards caswall and with a bold sweep of her arm seemed to drive some strange force towards him again and again was the gesture repeated the man falling back from her at each movement  towards the door he retreated she following  there was a sound as of the cooing sob of doves which seemed to multiply and intensify with each second  the sound from the unseen source rose and rose as he retreated till finally it swelled out in a triumphant peal as she with a fierce sweep of her arm seemed to hurl something at her foe and he moving his hands blindly before his face appeared to be swept through the doorway and out into the open sunlight  all at once my own faculties were fully restored i could see and hear everything and be fully conscious of what was going on  even the figures of the baleful group were there though dimly seen as through a veila shadowy veil  i saw lilla sink down in a swoon and mimi throw up her arms in a gesture of triumph  as i saw her through the great window the sunshine flooded the landscape which however was momentarily becoming eclipsed by an onrush of a myriad birds  by the next morning daylight showed the actual danger which threatened from every part of the eastern counties reports were received concerning the enormous immigration of birds  experts were sendingon their own account on behalf of learned societies and through local and imperial governing bodiesreports dealing with the matter and suggesting remedies  the reports closer to home were even more disturbing  all day long it would seem that the birds were coming thicker from all quarters doubtless many were going as well as coming but the mass seemed never to get less  each bird seemed to sound some note of fear or anger or seeking and the whirring of wings never ceased nor lessened  the air was full of a muttered throb  no window or barrier could shut out the sound till the ears of any listener became dulled by the ceaseless murmur  so monotonous it was so cheerless so disheartening so melancholy that all longed but in vain for any variety no matter how terrible it might be  the second morning the reports from all the districts round were more alarming than ever  farmers began to dread the coming of winter as they saw the dwindling of the timely fruitfulness of the earth  and as yet it was only a warning of evil not the evil accomplished the ground began to look bare whenever some passing sound temporarily frightened the birds  edgar caswall tortured his brain for a long time unavailingly to think of some means of getting rid of what he as well as his neighbours had come to regard as a plague of birds  at last he recalled a circumstance which promised a solution of the difficulty  the experience was of some years ago in china far upcountry towards the headwaters of the yang tzekiang where the smaller tributaries spread out in a sort of natural irrigation scheme to supply the wilderness of paddyfields  it was at the time of the ripening rice and the myriads of birds which came to feed on the coming crop was a serious menace not only to the district but to the country at large  the farmers who were more or less afflicted with the same trouble every season knew how to deal with it they made a vast kite which they caused to be flown over the centre spot of the incursion  the kite was shaped like a great hawk and the moment it rose into the air the birds began to cower and seek protectionand then to disappear  so long as that kite was flying overhead the birds lay low and the crop was saved  accordingly caswall ordered his men to construct an immense kite adhering as well as they could to the lines of a hawk  then he and his men with a sufficiency of cord began to fly it high overhead  the experience of china was repeated  the moment the kite rose the birds hid or sought shelter  the following morning the kite was still flying high no bird was to be seen as far as the eye could reach from castra regis  but there followed in turn what proved even a worse evil  all the birds were cowed their sounds stopped neither song nor chirp was heardsilence seemed to have taken the place of the normal voices of bird life  but that was not all  the silence spread to all animals  the fear and restraint which brooded amongst the denizens of the air began to affect all life  not only did the birds cease song or chirp but the lowing of the cattle ceased in the fields and the varied sounds of life died away  in place of these things was only a soundless gloom more dreadful more disheartening more soulkilling than any concourse of sounds no matter how full of fear and dread  pious individuals put up constant prayers for relief from the intolerable solitude  after a little there were signs of universal depression which those who ran might read  one and all the faces of men and women seemed bereft of vitality of interest of thought and most of all of hope  men seemed to have lost the power of expression of their thoughts  the soundless air seemed to have the same effect as the universal darkness when men gnawed their tongues with pain  from this infliction of silence there was no relief  everything was affected gloom was the predominant note  joy appeared to have passed away as a factor of life and this creative impulse had nothing to take its place  that giant spot in high air was a plague of evil influence it seemed like a new misanthropic belief which had fallen on human beings carrying with it the negation of all hope  after a few days men began to grow desperate their very words as well as their senses seemed to be in chains  edgar caswall again tortured his brain to find any antidote or palliative of this greater evil than before  he would gladly have destroyed the kite or caused its flying to cease but the instant it was pulled down the birds rose up in even greater numbers all those who depended in any way on agriculture sent pitiful protests to castra regis  it was strange indeed what influence that weird kite seemed to exercise even human beings were affected by it as if both it and they were realities  as for the people at mercy farm it was like a taste of actual death  lilla felt it most  if she had been indeed a real dove with a real kite hanging over her in the air she could not have been more frightened or more affected by the terror this created  of course some of those already drawn into the vortex noticed the effect on individuals  those who were interested took care to compare their information  strangely enough as it seemed to the others the person who took the ghastly silence least to heart was the negro  by nature he was not sensitive to or afflicted by nerves  this alone would not have produced the seeming indifference so they set their minds to discover the real cause  adam came quickly to the conclusion that there was for him some compensation that the others did not share and he soon believed that that compensation was in one form or another the enjoyment of the sufferings of others  thus the black had a neverfailing source of amusement  lady arabellas cold nature rendered her immune to anything in the way of pain or trouble concerning others  edgar caswall was far too haughty a person and too stern of nature to concern himself about poor or helpless people much less the lower order of mere animals  mr watford mr salton and sir nathaniel were all concerned in the issue partly from kindness of heartfor none of them could see suffering even of wild birds unmovedand partly on account of their property which had to be protected or ruin would stare them in the face before long  lilla suffered acutely  as time went on her face became pinched and her eyes dull with watching and crying  mimi suffered too on account of her cousins suffering  but as she could do nothing she resolutely made up her mind to selfrestraint and patience  adams frequent visits comforted her     chapter ximesmers chest   after a couple of weeks had passed the kite seemed to give edgar caswall a new zest for life  he was never tired of looking at its movements  he had a comfortable armchair put out on the tower wherein he sat sometimes all day long watching as though the kite was a new toy and he a child lately come into possession of it  he did not seem to have lost interest in lilla for he still paid an occasional visit at mercy farm  indeed his feeling towards her whatever it had been at first had now so far changed that it had become a distinct affection of a purely animal kind  indeed it seemed as though the mans nature had become corrupted and that all the baser and more selfish and more reckless qualities had become more conspicuous  there was not so much sternness apparent in his nature because there was less selfrestraint  determination had become indifference  the visible change in edgar was that he grew morbid sad silent the neighbours thought he was going mad  he became absorbed in the kite and watched it not only by day but often all night long  it became an obsession to him  caswall took a personal interest in the keeping of the great kite flying he had a vast coil of cord efficient for the purpose which worked on a roller fixed on the parapet of the tower  there was a winch for the pulling in of the slack the outgoing line being controlled by a racket there was invariably one man at least day and night on the tower to attend to it  at such an elevation there was always a strong wind and at times the kite rose to an enormous height as well as travelling for great distances laterally  in fact the kite became in a short time one of the curiosities of castra regis and all around it  edgar began to attribute to it in his own mind almost human qualities  it became to him a separate entity with a mind and a soul of its own  being idle handed all day he began to apply to what he considered the service of the kite some of his spare time and found a new pleasurea new object in lifein the old schoolboy game of sending up runners to the kite the way this is done is to get round pieces of paper so cut that there is a hole in the centre through which the string of the kite passes  the natural action of the windpressure takes the paper along the string and so up to the kite itself no matter how high or how far it may have gone  in the early days of this amusement edgar caswall spent hours  hundreds of such messengers flew along the string until soon he bethought him of writing messages on these papers so that he could make known his ideas to the kite  it may be that his brain gave way under the opportunities given by his illusion of the entity of the toy and its power of separate thought  from sending messages he came to making direct speech to the kitewithout however ceasing to send the runners  doubtless the height of the tower seated as it was on the hilltop the rushing of the ceaseless wind the hypnotic effect of the lofty altitude of the speck in the sky at which he gazed and the rushing of the paper messengers up the string till sight of them was lost in distance all helped to further affect his brain undoubtedly giving way under the strain of beliefs and circumstances which were at once stimulating to the imagination occupative of his mind and absorbing  the next step of intellectual decline was to bring to bear on the main idea of the conscious identity of the kite all sorts of subjects which had imaginative force or tendency of their own  he had in castra regis a large collection of curious and interesting things formed in the past by his forebears of similar tastes to his own  there were all sorts of strange anthropological specimens both old and new which had been collected through various travels in strange places ancient egyptian relics from tombs and mummies curios from australia new zealand and the south seas idols and imagesfrom tartar ikons to ancient egyptian persian and indian objects of worship objects of death and torture of american indians and above all a vast collection of lethal weapons of every kind and from every placechinese high pinders double knives afghan doubleedged scimitars made to cut a body in two heavy knives from all the eastern countries ghost daggers from thibet the terrible kukri of the ghourka and other hill tribes of india assassins weapons from italy and spain even the knife which was formerly carried by the slavedrivers of the mississippi region  death and pain of every kind were fully represented in that gruesome collection  that it had a fascination for oolanga goes without saying  he was never tired of visiting the museum in the tower and spent endless hours in inspecting the exhibits till he was thoroughly familiar with every detail of all of them  he asked permission to clean and polish and sharpen thema favour which was readily granted  in addition to the above objects there were many things of a kind to awaken human fear stuffed serpents of the most objectionable and horrid kind giant insects from the tropics fearsome in every detail fishes and crustaceans covered with weird spikes dried octopuses of great size  other things too there were not less deadly though seemingly innocuousdried fungi traps intended for birds beasts fishes reptiles and insects machines which could produce pain of any kind and degree and the only mercy of which was the power of producing speedy death  caswall who had never before seen any of these things except those which he had collected himself found a constant amusement and interest in them  he studied them their uses their mechanismwhere there was suchand their places of origin until he had an ample and real knowledge of all concerning them  many were secret and intricate but he never rested till he found out all the secrets  when once he had become interested in strange objects and the way to use them he began to explore various likely places for similar finds  he began to inquire of his household where strange lumber was kept  several of the men spoke of old simon chester as one who knew everything in and about the house accordingly he sent for the old man who came at once  he was very old nearly ninety years of age and very infirm  he had been born in the castle and had served its succession of masterspresent or absentever since  when edgar began to question him on the subject regarding which he had sent for him old simon exhibited much perturbation  in fact he became so frightened that his master fully believing that he was concealing something ordered him to tell at once what remained unseen and where it was hidden away  face to face with discovery of his secret the old man in a pitiable state of concern spoke out even more fully than mr caswall had expected  indeed indeed sir everything is here in the tower that has ever been put away in my time exceptexcept here he began to shake and tremble itexcept the chest which mr edgarhe who was mr edgar when i first took servicebrought back from france after he had been with dr mesmer  the trunk has been kept in my room for safety but i shall send it down here now  what is in it asked edgar sharply  that i do not know  moreover it is a peculiar trunk without any visible means of opening  is there no lock  i suppose so sir but i do not know  there is no keyhole  send it here and then come to me yourself  the trunk a heavy one with steel bands round it but no lock or keyhole was carried in by two men  shortly afterwards old simon attended his master  when he came into the room mr caswall himself went and closed the door then he asked  how do you open it  i do not know sir  do you mean to say that you never opened it  most certainly i say so your honour  how could i  it was entrusted to me with the other things by my master  to open it would have been a breach of trust  caswall sneered  quite remarkable  leave it with me  close the door behind you staydid no one ever tell you about itsay anything regarding itmake any remark  old simon turned pale and put his trembling hands together  oh sir i entreat you not to touch it  that trunk probably contains secrets which dr mesmer told my master  told them to his ruin  how do you mean  what ruin  sir he it was who men said sold his soul to the evil one i had thought that that time and the evil of it had all passed away  that will do  go away but remain in your own room or within call  i may want you  the old man bowed deeply and went out trembling but without speaking a word     chapter xiithe chest opened   left alone in the turretroom edgar caswall carefully locked the door and hung a handkerchief over the keyhole  next he inspected the windows and saw that they were not overlooked from any angle of the main building  then he carefully examined the trunk going over it with a magnifying glass  he found it intact the steel bands were flawless the whole trunk was compact  after sitting opposite to it for some time and the shades of evening beginning to melt into darkness he gave up the task and went to his bedroom after locking the door of the turretroom behind him and taking away the key  he woke in the morning at daylight and resumed his patient but unavailing study of the metal trunk  this he continued during the whole day with the same resulthumiliating disappointment which overwrought his nerves and made his head ache  the result of the long strain was seen later in the afternoon when he sat locked within the turretroom before the still baffling trunk distrait listless and yet agitated sunk in a settled gloom  as the dusk was falling he told the steward to send him two men strong ones  these he ordered to take the trunk to his bedroom  in that room he then sat on into the night without pausing even to take any food  his mind was in a whirl a fever of excitement the result was that when late in the night he locked himself in his room his brain was full of odd fancies he was on the high road to mental disturbance  he lay down on his bed in the dark still brooding over the mystery of the closed trunk  gradually he yielded to the influences of silence and darkness  after lying there quietly for some time his mind became active again  but this time there were round him no disturbing influences his brain was active and able to work freely and to deal with memory  a thousand forgottenor only halfknownincidents fragments of conversations or theories long ago guessed at and long forgotten crowded on his mind  he seemed to hear again around him the legions of whirring wings to which he had been so lately accustomed  even to himself he knew that that was an effort of imagination founded on imperfect memory  but he was content that imagination should work for out of it might come some solution of the mystery which surrounded him  and in this frame of mind sleep made another and more successful essay  this time he enjoyed peaceful slumber restful alike to his wearied body and his overwrought brain  in his sleep he arose and as if in obedience to some influence beyond and greater than himself lifted the great trunk and set it on a strong table at one side of the room from which he had previously removed a quantity of books  to do this he had to use an amount of strength which was he knew far beyond him in his normal state  as it was it seemed easy enough everything yielded before his touch  then he became conscious that somehowhow he never could rememberthe chest was open he unlocked his door and taking the chest on his shoulder carried it up to the turretroom the door of which also he unlocked  even at the time he was amazed at his own strength and wondered whence it had come his mind lost in conjecture was too far off to realise more immediate things  he knew that the chest was enormously heavy  he seemed in a sort of vision which lit up the absolute blackness around to see the two sturdy servant men staggering under its great weight  he locked himself again in the turretroom and laid the opened chest on a table and in the darkness began to unpack it laying out the contents which were mainly of metal and glassgreat pieces in strange formson another table  he was conscious of being still asleep and of acting rather in obedience to some unseen and unknown command than in accordance with any reasonable plan to be followed by results which he understood  this phase completed he proceeded to arrange in order the component parts of some large instruments formed mostly of glass  his fingers seemed to have acquired a new and exquisite subtlety and even a volition of their own  then weariness of brain came upon him his head sank down on his breast and little by little everything became wrapped in gloom  he awoke in the early morning in his bedroom and looked around him now clearheaded in amazement  in its usual place on the strong table stood the great steelhooped chest without lock or key  but it was now locked he arose quietly and stole to the turretroom  there everything was as it had been on the previous evening  he looked out of the window where high in air flew as usual the giant kite  he unlocked the wicket gate of the turret stair and went out on the roof  close to him was the great coil of cord on its reel  it was humming in the morning breeze and when he touched the string it sent a quick thrill through hand and arm  there was no sign anywhere that there had been any disturbance or displacement of anything during the night  utterly bewildered he sat down in his room to think  now for the first time he felt that he was asleep and dreaming  presently he fell asleep again and slept for a long time  he awoke hungry and made a hearty meal  then towards evening having locked himself in he fell asleep again  when he woke he was in darkness and was quite at sea as to his whereabouts  he began feeling about the dark room and was recalled to the consequences of his position by the breaking of a large piece of glass  having obtained a light he discovered this to be a glass wheel part of an elaborate piece of mechanism which he must in his sleep have taken from the chest which was now opened  he had once again opened it whilst asleep but he had no recollection of the circumstances  caswall came to the conclusion that there had been some sort of dual action of his mind which might lead to some catastrophe or some discovery of his secret plans so he resolved to forgo for a while the pleasure of making discoveries regarding the chest  to this end he applied himself to quite another matteran investigation of the other treasures and rare objects in his collections  he went amongst them in simple idle curiosity his main object being to discover some strange item which he might use for experiment with the kite  he had already resolved to try some runners other than those made of paper  he had a vague idea that with such a force as the great kite straining at its leash this might be used to lift to the altitude of the kite itself heavier articles  his first experiment with articles of little but increasing weight was eminently successful  so he added by degrees more and more weight until he found out that the lifting power of the kite was considerable  he then determined to take a step further and send to the kite some of the articles which lay in the steelhooped chest  the last time he had opened it in sleep it had not been shut again and he had inserted a wedge so that he could open it at will  he made examination of the contents but came to the conclusion that the glass objects were unsuitable  they were too light for testing weight and they were so frail as to be dangerous to send to such a height  so he looked around for something more solid with which to experiment his eye caught sight of an object which at once attracted him  this was a small copy of one of the ancient egyptian godsthat of bes who represented the destructive power of nature  it was so bizarre and mysterious as to commend itself to his mad humour  in lifting it from the cabinet he was struck by its great weight in proportion to its size he made accurate examination of it by the aid of some instruments and came to the conclusion that it was carved from a lump of lodestone  he remembered that he had read somewhere of an ancient egyptian god cut from a similar substance and thinking it over he came to the conclusion that he must have read it in sir thomas browns popular errors a book of the seventeenth century  he got the book from the library and looked out the passage  a great example we have from the observation of our learned friend mr graves in an aegyptian idol cut out of loadstone and found among the mummies which still retains its attraction though probably taken out of the mine about two thousand years ago  the strangeness of the figure and its being so close akin to his own nature attracted him  he made from thin wood a large circular runner and in front of it placed the weighty god sending it up to the flying kite along the throbbing cord     chapter xiiioolangas hallucinations   during the last few days lady arabella had been getting exceedingly impatient  her debts always pressing were growing to an embarrassing amount  the only hope she had of comfort in life was a good marriage but the good marriage on which she had fixed her eye did not seem to move quickly enoughindeed it did not seem to move at allin the right direction  edgar caswall was not an ardent wooer  from the very first he seemed difficile but he had been keeping to his own room ever since his struggle with mimi watford  on that occasion lady arabella had shown him in an unmistakable way what her feelings were indeed she had made it known to him in a more overt way than pride should allow that she wished to help and support him  the moment when she had gone across the room to stand beside him in his mesmeric struggle had been the very limit of her voluntary action  it was quite bitter enough she felt that he did not come to her but now that she had made that advance she felt that any withdrawal on his part would to a woman of her class be nothing less than a flaming insult  had she not classed herself with his nigger servant an unreformed savage  had she not shown her preference for him at the festival of his homecoming  had she not    lady arabella was coldblooded and she was prepared to go through all that might be necessary of indifference and even insult to become chatelaine of castra regis  in the meantime she would show no hurryshe must wait  she might in an unostentatious way come to him again  she knew him now and could make a keen guess at his desires with regard to lilla watford  with that secret in her possession she could bring pressure to bear on caswall which would make it no easy matter for him to evade her the great difficulty was how to get near him  he was shut up within his castle and guarded by a defence of convention which she could not pass without danger of ill repute to herself  over this question she thought and thought for days and nights  at last she decided that the only way would be to go to him openly at castra regis  her rank and position would make such a thing possible if carefully done  she could explain matters afterwards if necessary  then when they were alone she would use her arts and her experience to make him commit himself  after all he was only a man with a mans dislike of difficult or awkward situations  she felt quite sufficient confidence in her own womanhood to carry her through any difficulty which might arise  from dianas grove she heard each day the luncheongong from castra regis sound and knew the hour when the servants would be in the back of the house  she would enter the house at that hour and pretending that she could not make anyone hear her would seek him in his own rooms  the tower was she knew away from all the usual sounds of the house and moreover she knew that the servants had strict orders not to interrupt him when he was in the turret chamber  she had found out partly by the aid of an operaglass and partly by judicious questioning that several times lately a heavy chest had been carried to and from his room and that it rested in the room each night  she was therefore confident that he had some important work on hand which would keep him busy for long spells  meanwhile another member of the household at castra regis had schemes which he thought were working to fruition  a man in the position of a servant has plenty of opportunity of watching his betters and forming opinions regarding them  oolanga was in his way a clever unscrupulous rogue and he felt that with things moving round him in this great household there should be opportunities of selfadvancement  being unscrupulous and stealthyand a savagehe looked to dishonest means  he saw plainly enough that lady arabella was making a dead set at his master and he was watchful of the slightest sign of anything which might enhance this knowledge  like the other men in the house he knew of the carrying to and fro of the great chest and had got it into his head that the care exercised in its porterage indicated that it was full of treasure  he was for ever lurking around the turretrooms on the chance of making some useful discovery  but he was as cautious as he was stealthy and took care that no one else watched him  it was thus that the negro became aware of lady arabellas venture into the house as she thought unseen  he took more care than ever since he was watching another that the positions were not reversed  more than ever he kept his eyes and ears open and his mouth shut  seeing lady arabella gliding up the stairs towards his masters room he took it for granted that she was there for no good and doubled his watching intentness and caution  oolanga was disappointed but he dared not exhibit any feeling lest it should betray that he was hiding  therefore he slunk downstairs again noiselessly and waited for a more favourable opportunity of furthering his plans  it must be borne in mind that he thought that the heavy trunk was full of valuables and that he believed that lady arabella had come to try to steal it  his purpose of using for his own advantage the combination of these two ideas was seen later in the day  oolanga secretly followed her home  he was an expert at this game and succeeded admirably on this occasion  he watched her enter the private gate of dianas grove and then taking a roundabout course and keeping out of her sight he at last overtook her in a thick part of the grove where no one could see the meeting  lady arabella was much surprised  she had not seen the negro for several days and had almost forgotten his existence  oolanga would have been startled had he known and been capable of understanding the real value placed on him his beauty his worthiness by other persons and compared it with the value in these matters in which he held himself  doubtless oolanga had his dreams like other men  in such cases he saw himself as a young sungod as beautiful as the eye of dusky or even white womanhood had ever dwelt upon  he would have been filled with all noble and captivating qualitiesor those regarded as such in west africa  women would have loved him and would have told him so in the overt and fervid manner usual in affairs of the heart in the shadowy depths of the forest of the gold coast  oolanga came close behind lady arabella and in a hushed voice suitable to the importance of his task and in deference to the respect he had for her and the place began to unfold the story of his love  lady arabella was not usually a humorous person but no man or woman of the white race could have checked the laughter which rose spontaneously to her lips  the circumstances were too grotesque the contrast too violent for subdued mirth  the man a debased specimen of one of the most primitive races of the earth and of an ugliness which was simply devilish the woman of high degree beautiful accomplished  she thought that her first moments consideration of the outrageit was nothing less in her eyeshad given her the full material for thought  but every instant after threw new and varied lights on the affront  her indignation was too great for passion only irony or satire would meet the situation  her cold cruel nature helped and she did not shrink to subject this ignorant savage to the merciless firelash of her scorn  oolanga was dimly conscious that he was being flouted but his anger was no less keen because of the measure of his ignorance  so he gave way to it as does a tortured beast  he ground his great teeth together raved stamped and swore in barbarous tongues and with barbarous imagery  even lady arabella felt that it was well she was within reach of help or he might have offered her brutal violenceeven have killed her  am i to understand she said with cold disdain so much more effective to wound than hot passion that you are offering me your love yourlove  for reply he nodded his head  the scorn of her voice in a sort of baleful hiss soundedand feltlike the lash of a whip  and you dared youa savagea slavethe basest thing in the world of vermin  take care  i dont value your worthless life more than i do that of a rat or a spider  dont let me ever see your hideous face here again or i shall rid the earth of you  as she was speaking she had taken out her revolver and was pointing it at him  in the immediate presence of death his impudence forsook him and he made a weak effort to justify himself  his speech was short consisting of single words  to lady arabella it sounded mere gibberish but it was in his own dialect and meant love marriage wife  from the intonation of the words she guessed with her womans quick intuition at their meaning but she quite failed to follow when becoming more pressing he continued to urge his suit in a mixture of the grossest animal passion and ridiculous threats  he warned her that he knew she had tried to steal his masters treasure and that he had caught her in the act  but if she would be his he would share the treasure with her and they could live in luxury in the african forests  but if she refused he would tell his master who would flog and torture her and then give her to the police who would kill her     chapter xivbattle renewed   the consequences of that meeting in the dusk of dianas grove were acute and farreaching and not only to the two engaged in it  from oolanga this might have been expected by anyone who knew the character of the tropical african savage  to such there are two passions that are inexhaustible and insatiablevanity and that which they are pleased to call love  oolanga left the grove with an absorbing hatred in his heart his lust and greed were afire while his vanity had been wounded to the core  lady arabellas icy nature was not so deeply stirred though she was in a seething passion  more than ever she was set upon bringing edgar caswall to her feet  the obstacles she had encountered the insults she had endured were only as fuel to the purpose of revenge which consumed her  as she sought her own rooms in dianas grove she went over the whole subject again and again always finding in the face of lilla watford a key to a problem which puzzled herthe problem of a way to turn caswalls powershis very existenceto aid her purpose  when in her boudoir she wrote a note taking so much trouble over it that she destroyed and rewrote till her dainty wastebasket was half full of torn sheets of notepaper  when quite satisfied she copied out the last sheet afresh and then carefully burned all the spoiled fragments  she put the copied note in an emblazoned envelope and directed it to edgar caswall at castra regis  this she sent off by one of her grooms  the letter ran     dear mr caswall     i want to have a chat with you on a subject in which i believe you    are interested  will you kindly call for me one day after lunchsay    at three or four oclock and we can walk a little way together  only    as far as mercy farm where i want to see lilla and mimi watford  we    can take a cup of tea at the farm  do not bring your african servant    with you as i am afraid his face frightens the girls  after all he    is not pretty is he  i have an idea you will be pleased with your    visit this time     yours sincerely     arabella march  at halfpast three next day edgar caswall called at dianas grove  lady arabella met him on the roadway outside the gate  she wished to take the servants into her confidence as little as possible  she turned when she saw him coming and walked beside him towards mercy farm keeping step with him as they walked  when they got near mercy she turned and looked around her expecting to see oolanga or some sign of him  he was however not visible  he had received from his master peremptory orders to keep out of sightan order for which the african scored a new offence up against her  they found lilla and mimi at home and seemingly glad to see them though both the girls were surprised at the visit coming so soon after the other  the proceedings were a repetition of the battle of souls of the former visit  on this occasion however edgar caswall had only the presence of lady arabella to support himoolanga being absent but mimi lacked the support of adam salton which had been of such effective service before this time the struggle for supremacy of will was longer and more determined  caswall felt that if he could not achieve supremacy he had better give up the idea so all his pride was enlisted against mimi  when they had been waiting for the door to be opened lady arabella believing in a sudden attack had said to him in a low voice which somehow carried conviction  this time you should win  mimi is after all only a woman  show her no mercy  that is weakness  fight her beat her trample on herkill her if need be  she stands in your way and i hate her  never take your eyes off her  never mind lillashe is afraid of you  you are already her master  mimi will try to make you look at her cousin  there lies defeat  let nothing take your attention from mimi and you will win  if she is overcoming you take my hand and hold it hard whilst you are looking into her eyes  if she is too strong for you i shall interfere ill make a diversion and under cover of it you must retire unbeaten even if not victorious  hush they are coming  the two girls came to the door together  strange sounds were coming up over the brow from the west  it was the rustling and crackling of the dry reeds and rushes from the low lands  the season had been an unusually dry one  also the strong east wind was helping forward enormous flocks of birds most of them pigeons with white cowls  not only were their wings whirring but their cooing was plainly audible from such a multitude of birds the mass of sound individually small assumed the volume of a storm  surprised at the influx of birds to which they had been strangers so long they all looked towards castra regis from whose high tower the great kite had been flying as usual  but even as they looked the cord broke and the great kite fell headlong in a series of sweeping dives  its own weight and the aerial force opposed to it which caused it to rise combined with the strong easterly breeze had been too much for the great length of cord holding it  somehow the mishap to the kite gave new hope to mimi  it was as though the side issues had been shorn away so that the main struggle was thenceforth on simpler lines  she had a feeling in her heart as though some religious chord had been newly touched  it may of course have been that with the renewal of the bird voices a fresh courage a fresh belief in the good issue of the struggle came too  in the misery of silence from which they had all suffered for so long any new train of thought was almost bound to be a boon  as the inrush of birds continued their wings beating against the crackling rushes lady arabella grew pale and almost fainted  what is that she asked suddenly  to mimi born and bred in siam the sound was strangely like an exaggeration of the sound produced by a snakecharmer  edgar caswall was the first to recover from the interruption of the falling kite  after a few minutes he seemed to have quite recovered his sang froid and was able to use his brains to the end which he had in view  mimi too quickly recovered herself but from a different cause with her it was a deep religious conviction that the struggle round her was of the powers of good and evil and that good was triumphing  the very appearance of the snowy birds with the cowls of saint columba heightened the impression  with this conviction strong upon her she continued the strange battle with fresh vigour  she seemed to tower over caswall and he to give back before her oncoming  once again her vigorous passes drove him to the door  he was just going out backward when lady arabella who had been gazing at him with fixed eyes caught his hand and tried to stop his movement  she was however unable to do any good and so holding hands they passed out together  as they did so the strange music which had so alarmed lady arabella suddenly stopped  instinctively they all looked towards the tower of castra regis and saw that the workmen had refixed the kite which had risen again and was beginning to float out to its former station  as they were looking the door opened and michael watford came into the room  by that time all had recovered their selfpossession and there was nothing out of the common to attract his attention  as he came in seeing inquiring looks all around him he said  the new influx of birds is only the annual migration of pigeons from africa  i am told that it will soon be over  the second victory of mimi watford made edgar caswall more moody than ever  he felt thrown back on himself and this added to his absorbing interest in the hope of a victory of his mesmeric powers became a deep and settled purpose of revenge  the chief object of his animosity was of course mimi whose will had overcome his but it was obscured in greater or lesser degree by all who had opposed him  lilla was next to mimi in his hatelilla the harmless tenderhearted sweetnatured girl whose heart was so full of love for all things that in it was no room for the passions of ordinary lifewhose nature resembled those doves of st columba whose colour she wore whose appearance she reflected  adam salton came nextafter a gap for against him caswall had no direct animosity  he regarded him as an interference a difficulty to be got rid of or destroyed  the young australian had been so discreet that the most he had against him was his knowledge of what had been  caswall did not understand him and to such a nature as his ignorance was a cause of alarm of dread  caswall resumed his habit of watching the great kite straining at its cord varying his vigils in this way by a further examination of the mysterious treasures of his house especially mesmers chest  he sat much on the roof of the tower brooding over his thwarted passion  the vast extent of his possessions visible to him at that altitude might one would have thought have restored some of his complacency  but the very extent of his ownership thus perpetually brought before him created a fresh sense of grievance  how was it he thought that with so much at command that others wished for he could not achieve the dearest wishes of his heart  in this state of intellectual and moral depravity he found a solace in the renewal of his experiments with the mechanical powers of the kite for a couple of weeks he did not see lady arabella who was always on the watch for a chance of meeting him neither did he see the watford girls who studiously kept out of his way  adam salton simply marked time keeping ready to deal with anything that might affect his friends  he called at the farm and heard from mimi of the last battle of wills but it had only one consequence  he got from ross several more mongooses including a second kingcobrakiller which he generally carried with him in its box whenever he walked out  mr caswalls experiments with the kite went on successfully  each day he tried the lifting of greater weight and it seemed almost as if the machine had a sentience of its own which was increasing with the obstacles placed before it  all this time the kite hung in the sky at an enormous height  the wind was steadily from the north so the trend of the kite was to the south  all day long runners of increasing magnitude were sent up  these were only of paper or thin cardboard or leather or other flexible materials  the great height at which the kite hung made a great concave curve in the string so that as the runners went up they made a flapping sound  if one laid a finger on the string the sound answered to the flapping of the runner in a sort of hollow intermittent murmur  edgar caswall who was now wholly obsessed by the kite and all belonging to it found a distinct resemblance between that intermittent rumble and the snakecharming music produced by the pigeons flying through the dry reeds  one day he made a discovery in mesmers chest which he thought he would utilise with regard to the runners  this was a great length of wire fine as human hair coiled round a finely made wheel which ran to a wondrous distance freely and as lightly  he tried this on runners and found it work admirably  whether the runner was alone or carried something much more weighty than itself it worked equally well  also it was strong enough and light enough to draw back the runner without undue strain  he tried this a good many times successfully but it was now growing dusk and he found some difficulty in keeping the runner in sight so he looked for something heavy enough to keep it still  he placed the egyptian image of bes on the fine wire which crossed the wooden ledge which protected it  then the darkness growing he went indoors and forgot all about it  he had a strange feeling of uneasiness that nightnot sleeplessness for he seemed conscious of being asleep  at daylight he rose and as usual looked out for the kite  he did not see it in its usual position in the sky so looked round the points of the compass  he was more than astonished when presently he saw the missing kite struggling as usual against the controlling cord  but it had gone to the further side of the tower and now hung and strained against the wind to the north  he thought it so strange that he determined to investigate the phenomenon and to say nothing about it in the meantime  in his many travels edgar caswall had been accustomed to use the sextant and was now an expert in the matter  by the aid of this and other instruments he was able to fix the position of the kite and the point over which it hung  he was startled to find that exactly under itso far as he could ascertainwas dianas grove  he had an inclination to take lady arabella into his confidence in the matter but he thought better of it and wisely refrained  for some reason which he did not try to explain to himself he was glad of his silence when on the following morning he found on looking out that the point over which the kite then hovered was mercy farm  when he had verified this with his instruments he sat before the window of the tower looking out and thinking  the new locality was more to his liking than the other but the why of it puzzled him all the same  he spent the rest of the day in the turretroom which he did not leave all day  it seemed to him that he was now drawn by forces which he could not controlof which indeed he had no knowledgein directions which he did not understand and which were without his own volition  in sheer helpless inability to think the problem out satisfactorily he called up a servant and told him to tell oolanga that he wanted to see him at once in the turretroom  the answer came back that the african had not been seen since the previous evening  caswall was now so irritable that even this small thing upset him  as he was distrait and wanted to talk to somebody he sent for simon chester who came at once breathless with hurrying and upset by the unexpected summons  caswall bade him sit down and when the old man was in a less uneasy frame of mind he again asked him if he had ever seen what was in mesmers chest or heard it spoken about  chester admitted that he had once in the time of the then mr edgar seen the chest open which knowing something of its history and guessing more so upset him that he had fainted  when he recovered the chest was closed  from that time the then mr edgar had never spoken about it again  when caswall asked him to describe what he had seen when the chest was open he got very agitated and despite all his efforts to remain calm he suddenly went off into a faint  caswall summoned servants who applied the usual remedies  still the old man did not recover  after the lapse of a considerable time the doctor who had been summoned made his appearance  a glance was sufficient for him to make up his mind still he knelt down by the old man and made a careful examination  then he rose to his feet and in a hushed voice said  i grieve to say sir that he has passed away     chapter xvon the track   those who had seen edgar caswall familiarly since his arrival and had already estimated his coldblooded nature at something of its true value were surprised that he took so to heart the death of old chester  the fact was that not one of them had guessed correctly at his character they thought naturally enough that the concern which he felt was that of a master for a faithful old servant of his family  they little thought that it was merely the selfish expression of his disappointment that he had thus lost the only remaining clue to an interesting piece of family historyone which was now and would be for ever wrapped in mystery  caswall knew enough about the life of his ancestor in paris to wish to know more fully and more thoroughly all that had been  the period covered by that ancestors life in paris was one inviting every form of curiosity  lady arabella who had her own game to play saw in the metier of sympathetic friend a series of meetings with the man she wanted to secure  she made the first use of the opportunity the day after old chesters death indeed as soon as the news had filtered in through the back door of dianas grove  at that meeting she played her part so well that even caswalls cold nature was impressed  oolanga was the only one who did not credit her with at least some sense of fine feeling in the matter  in emotional as in other matters oolanga was distinctly a utilitarian and as he could not understand anyone feeling grief except for his own suffering pain or for the loss of money he could not understand anyone simulating such an emotion except for show intended to deceive  he thought that she had come to castra regis again for the opportunity of stealing something and was determined that on this occasion the chance of pressing his advantage over her should not pass  he felt therefore that the occasion was one for extra carefulness in the watching of all that went on  ever since he had come to the conclusion that lady arabella was trying to steal the treasurechest he suspected nearly everyone of the same design and made it a point to watch all suspicious persons and places  as adam was engaged on his own researches regarding lady arabella it was only natural that there should be some crossing of each others tracks  this is what did actually happen  adam had gone for an early morning survey of the place in which he was interested taking with him the mongoose in its box  he arrived at the gate of dianas grove just as lady arabella was preparing to set out for castra regis on what she considered her mission of comfort  seeing adam from her window going through the shadows of the trees round the gate she thought that he must be engaged on some purpose similar to her own so quickly making her toilet she quietly left the house and taking advantage of every shadow and substance which could hide her followed him on his walk  oolanga the experienced tracker followed her but succeeded in hiding his movements better than she did  he saw that adam had on his shoulder a mysterious box which he took to contain something valuable  seeing that lady arabella was secretly following adam he was confirmed in this idea  his mindsuch as it waswas fixed on her trying to steal and he credited her at once with making use of this new opportunity  in his walk adam went into the grounds of castra regis and oolanga saw her follow him with great secrecy  he feared to go closer as now on both sides of him were enemies who might make discovery  when he realised that lady arabella was bound for the castle he devoted himself to following her with singleness of purpose  he therefore missed seeing that adam branched off the track and returned to the high road  that night edgar caswall had slept badly  the tragic occurrence of the day was on his mind and he kept waking and thinking of it  after an early breakfast he sat at the open window watching the kite and thinking of many things  from his room he could see all round the neighbourhood but the two places that interested him most were mercy farm and dianas grove  at first the movements about those spots were of a humble kindthose that belong to domestic service or agricultural needsthe opening of doors and windows the sweeping and brushing and generally the restoration of habitual order  from his high windowwhose height made it a screen from the observation of othershe saw the chain of watchers move into his own grounds and then presently break upadam salton going one way and lady arabella followed by the nigger another  then oolanga disappeared amongst the trees but caswall could see that he was still watching  lady arabella after looking around her slipped in by the open door and he could of course see her no longer  presently however he heard a light tap at his door then the door opened slowly and he could see the flash of lady arabellas white dress through the opening     chapter xvia visit of sympathy   caswall was genuinely surprised when he saw lady arabella though he need not have been after what had already occurred in the same way  the look of surprise on his face was so much greater than lady arabella had expectedthough she thought she was prepared to meet anything that might occurthat she stood still in sheer amazement  coldblooded as she was and ready for all social emergencies she was nonplussed how to go on she was plucky however and began to speak at once although she had not the slightest idea what she was going to say  i came to offer you my very warm sympathy with the grief you have so lately experienced  my grief  im afraid i must be very dull but i really do not understand  already she felt at a disadvantage and hesitated  i mean about the old man who died so suddenlyyour old    retainer  caswalls face relaxed something of its puzzled concentration  oh he was only a servant and he had overstayed his threescore and ten years by something like twenty years  he must have been ninety  still as an old servant      caswalls words were not so cold as their inflection  i never interfere with servants  he was kept on here merely because he had been so long on the premises  i suppose the steward thought it might make him unpopular if the old fellow had been dismissed  how on earth was she to proceed on such a task as hers if this was the utmost geniality she could expect  so she at once tried another tackthis time a personal one  i am sorry i disturbed you  i am really not unconventionalthough certainly no slave to convention  still there are limits    it is bad enough to intrude in this way and i do not know what you can say or think of the time selected for the intrusion  after all edgar caswall was a gentleman by custom and habit so he rose to the occasion  i can only say lady arabella that you are always welcome at any time you may deign to honour my house with your presence  she smiled at him sweetly  thank you so much  you do put one at ease  my breach of convention makes me glad rather than sorry  i feel that i can open my heart to you about anything  forthwith she proceeded to tell him about oolanga and his strange suspicions of her honesty  caswall laughed and made her explain all the details  his final comment was enlightening  let me give you a word of advice if you have the slightest fault to find with that infernal nigger shoot him at sight  a swelledheaded nigger with a bee in his bonnet is one of the worst difficulties in the world to deal with  so better make a clean job of it and wipe him out at once  but what about the law mr caswall  oh the law doesnt concern itself much about dead niggers  a few more or less do not matter  to my mind its rather a relief  im afraid of you was her only comment made with a sweet smile and in a soft voice  all right he said let us leave it at that  anyhow we shall be rid of one of them  i dont love niggers any more than you do she replied and i suppose one mustnt be too particular where that sort of cleaning up is concerned  then she changed in voice and manner and asked genially and now tell me am i forgiven  you are dear ladyif there is anything to forgive  as he spoke seeing that she had moved to go he came to the door with her and in the most natural way accompanied her downstairs  he passed through the hall with her and down the avenue  as he went back to the house she smiled to herself  well that is all right  i dont think the morning has been altogether thrown away  and she walked slowly back to dianas grove  adam salton followed the line of the brow and refreshed his memory as to the various localities  he got home to lesser hill just as sir nathaniel was beginning lunch  mr salton had gone to walsall to keep an early appointment so he was all alone  when the meal was overseeing in adams face that he had something to speak abouthe followed into the study and shut the door  when the two men had lighted their pipes sir nathaniel began  i have remembered an interesting fact about dianas grovethere is i have long understood some strange mystery about that house  it may be of some interest or it may be trivial in such a tangled skein as we are trying to unravel  please tell me all you know or suspect  to begin then of what sort is the mysteryphysical mental moral historical scientific occult any kind of hint will help me  quite right  i shall try to tell you what i think but i have not put my thoughts on the subject in sequence so you must forgive me if due order is not observed in my narration  i suppose you have seen the house at dianas grove  the outside of it but i have that in my minds eye and i can fit into my memory whatever you may mention  the house is very oldprobably the first house of some sort that stood there was in the time of the romans  this was probably renewedperhaps several times at later periods  the house stands or rather used to stand here when mercia was a kingdomi do not suppose that the basement can be later than the norman conquest  some years ago when i was president of the mercian archaeological society i went all over it very carefully  this was when it was purchased by captain march  the house had then been done up so as to be suitable for the bride  the basement is very strongalmost as strong and as heavy as if it had been intended as a fortress  there are a whole series of rooms deep underground  one of them in particular struck me  the room itself is of considerable size but the masonry is more than massive  in the middle of the room is a sunk well built up to floor level and evidently going deep underground  there is no windlass nor any trace of there ever having been anyno ropenothing  now we know that the romans had wells of immense depth from which the water was lifted by the old rag rope that at woodhull used to be nearly a thousand feet  here then we have simply an enormously deep wellhole  the door of the room was massive and was fastened with a lock nearly a foot square  it was evidently intended for some kind of protection to someone or something but no one in those days had ever heard of anyone having been allowed even to see the room  all this is a propos of a suggestion on my part that the wellhole was a way by which the white worm whatever it was went and came  at that time i would have had a search madeeven excavation if necessaryat my own expense but all suggestions were met with a prompt and explicit negative  so of course i took no further step in the matter  then it died out of recollectioneven of mine  do you remember sir asked adam what was the appearance of the room where the wellhole was  was there furniturein fact any sort of thing in the room  the only thing i remember was a sort of green lightvery clouded very dimwhich came up from the well  not a fixed light but intermittent and irregularquite unlike anything i had ever seen  do you remember how you got into the wellroom  was there a separate door from outside or was there any interior room or passage which opened into it  i think there must have been some room with a way into it  i remember going up some steep steps they must have been worn smooth by long use or something of the kind for i could hardly keep my feet as i went up  once i stumbled and nearly fell into the wellhole  was there anything strange about the placeany queer smell for instance  queer smellyes  like bilge or a rank swamp  it was distinctly nauseating when i came out i felt as if i had just been going to be sick  i shall try back on my visit and see if i can recall any more of what i saw or felt  then perhaps sir later in the day you will tell me anything you may chance to recollect  i shall be delighted adam  if your uncle has not returned by then ill join you in the study after dinner and we can resume this interesting chat     chapter xviithe mystery of the grove   that afternoon adam decided to do a little exploring  as he passed through the wood outside the gate of dianas grove he thought he saw the africans face for an instant  so he went deeper into the undergrowth and followed along parallel to the avenue to the house  he was glad that there was no workman or servant about for he did not care that any of lady arabellas people should find him wandering about her grounds taking advantage of the denseness of the trees he came close to the house and skirted round it  he was repaid for his trouble for on the far side of the house close to where the rocky frontage of the cliff fell away he saw oolanga crouched behind the irregular trunk of a great oak  the man was so intent on watching someone or something that he did not guard against being himself watched  this suited adam for he could thus make scrutiny at will  the thick wood though the trees were mostly of small girth threw a heavy shadow so that the steep declension in front of which grew the tree behind which the african lurked was almost in darkness  adam drew as close as he could and was amazed to see a patch of light on the ground before him when he realised what it was he was determined more than ever to follow on his quest  the nigger had a dark lantern in his hand and was throwing the light down the steep incline  the glare showed a series of stone steps which ended in a lowlying heavy iron door fixed against the side of the house  all the strange things he had heard from sir nathaniel and all those little and big which he had himself noticed crowded into his mind in a chaotic way  instinctively he took refuge behind a thick oak stem and set himself down to watch what might occur  after a short time it became apparent that the african was trying to find out what was behind the heavy door  there was no way of looking in for the door fitted tight into the massive stone slabs  the only opportunity for the entrance of light was through a small hole between the great stones above the door  this hole was too high up to look through from the ground level  oolanga having tried standing tiptoe on the highest point near and holding the lantern as high as he could threw the light round the edges of the door to see if he could find anywhere a hole or a flaw in the metal through which he could obtain a glimpse  foiled in this he brought from the shrubbery a plank which he leant against the top of the door and then climbed up with great dexterity  this did not bring him near enough to the windowhole to look in or even to throw the light of the lantern through it so he climbed down and carried the plank back to the place from which he had got it  then he concealed himself near the iron door and waited manifestly with the intent of remaining there till someone came near  presently lady arabella moving noiselessly through the shade approached the door  when he saw her close enough to touch it oolanga stepped forward from his concealment and spoke in a whisper which through the gloom sounded like a hiss  i want to see you missysoon and secret  what do you want  you know well missy i told you already  she turned on him with blazing eyes the green tint in them glowing like emeralds  come none of that  if there is anything sensible which you wish to say to me you can see me here just where we are at seven oclock  he made no reply in words but putting the backs of his hands together bent lower and lower till his forehead touched the earth  then he rose and went slowly away  adam salton from his hidingplace saw and wondered  in a few minutes he moved from his place and went home to lesser hill fully determined that seven oclock would find him in some hidden place behind dianas grove  at a little before seven adam stole softly out of the house and took the backway to the rear of dianas grove  the place seemed silent and deserted so he took the opportunity of concealing himself near the spot whence he had seen oolanga trying to investigate whatever was concealed behind the iron door  he waited perfectly still and at last saw a gleam of white passing soundlessly through the undergrowth  he was not surprised when he recognised the colour of lady arabellas dress  she came close and waited with her face to the iron door  from some place of concealment near at hand oolanga appeared and came close to her  adam noticed with surprised amusement that over his shoulder was the box with the mongoose  of course the african did not know that he was seen by anyone least of all by the man whose property he had with him  silentfooted as he was lady arabella heard him coming and turned to meet him  it was somewhat hard to see in the gloom for as usual he was all in black only his collar and cuffs showing white  lady arabella opened the conversation which ensued between the two  what do you want  to rob me or murder me  no to lub you  this frightened her a little and she tried to change the tone  is that a coffin you have with you  if so you are wasting your time it would not hold me  when a nigger suspects he is being laughed at all the ferocity of his nature comes to the front and this man was of the lowest kind  dis aint no coffin for nobody  dis box is for you  somefin you lub me give him to you  still anxious to keep off the subject of affection on which she believed him to have become crazed she made another effort to keep his mind elsewhere  is this why you want to see me  he nodded  then come round to the other door  but be quiet  i have no desire to be seen so close to my own house in conversation with aaa nigger like you  she had chosen the word deliberately  she wished to meet his passion with another kind  such would at all events help to keep him quiet  in the deep gloom she could not see the anger which suffused his face rolling eyeballs and grinding teeth are however sufficient signs of anger to be decipherable in the dark  she moved round the corner of the house to her right  oolanga was following her when she stopped him by raising her hand  no not that door she said that is not for niggers  the other door will do well enough for you  lady arabella took in her hand a small key which hung at the end of her watchchain and moved to a small door low down round the corner and a little downhill from the edge of the brow  oolanga in obedience to her gesture went back to the iron door  adam looked carefully at the mongoose box as the african went by and was glad to see that it was intact  unconsciously as he looked he fingered the key that was in his waistcoat pocket  when oolanga was out of sight adam hurried after lady arabella     chapter xviiiexit oolanga   the woman turned sharply as adam touched her shoulder  one moment whilst we are alone  you had better not trust that nigger he whispered  her answer was crisp and concise  i dont  forewarned is forearmed  tell me if you willit is for your own protection  why do you mistrust him  my friend you have no idea of that mans impudence  would you believe that he wants me to marry him  no said adam incredulously amused in spite of himself  yes and wanted to bribe me to do it by sharing a chest of treasureat least he thought it wasstolen from mr caswall  why do you distrust him mr salton  did you notice that box he had slung on his shoulder  that belongs to me  i left it in the gunroom when i went to lunch  he must have crept in and stolen it  doubtless he thinks that it too is full of treasure  he does  how on earth do you know asked adam  a little while ago he offered to give it to meanother bribe to accept him  faugh  i am ashamed to tell you such a thing  the beast  whilst they had been speaking she had opened the door a narrow iron one well hung for it opened easily and closed tightly without any creaking or sound of any kind  within all was dark but she entered as freely and with as little misgiving or restraint as if it had been broad daylight  for adam there was just sufficient green light from somewhere for him to see that there was a broad flight of heavy stone steps leading upward but lady arabella after shutting the door behind her when it closed tightly without a clang tripped up the steps lightly and swiftly for an instant all was dark but there came again the faint green light which enabled him to see the outlines of things  another iron door narrow like the first and fairly high led into another large room the walls of which were of massive stones so closely joined together as to exhibit only one smooth surface  this presented the appearance of having at one time been polished  on the far side also smooth like the walls was the reverse of a wide but not high iron door  here there was a little more light for the highup aperture over the door opened to the air  lady arabella took from her girdle another small key which she inserted in a keyhole in the centre of a massive lock  the great bolt seemed wonderfully hung for the moment the small key was turned the bolts of the great lock moved noiselessly and the iron doors swung open  on the stone steps outside stood oolanga with the mongoose box slung over his shoulder  lady arabella stood a little on one side and the african accepting the movement as an invitation entered in an obsequious way the moment however that he was inside he gave a quick look around him  much death herebig death  many deaths  good good  he sniffed round as if he was enjoying the scent  the matter and manner of his speech were so revolting that instinctively adams hand wandered to his revolver and with his finger on the trigger he rested satisfied that he was ready for any emergency  there was certainly opportunity for the niggers enjoyment for the open wellhole was almost under his nose sending up such a stench as almost made adam sick though lady arabella seemed not to mind it at all  it was like nothing that adam had ever met with  he compared it with all the noxious experiences he had ever hadthe drainage of war hospitals of slaughterhouses the refuse of dissecting rooms  none of these was like it though it had something of them all with added the sourness of chemical waste and the poisonous effluvium of the bilge of a water logged ship whereon a multitude of rats had been drowned  then quite unexpectedly the negro noticed the presence of a third personadam salton  he pulled out a pistol and shot at him happily missing  adam was himself usually a quick shot but this time his mind had been on something else and he was not ready  however he was quick to carry out an intention and he was not a coward  in another moment both men were in grips  beside them was the dark wellhole with that horrid effluvium stealing up from its mysterious depths  adam and oolanga both had pistols lady arabella who had not one was probably the most ready of them all in the theory of shooting but that being impossible she made her effort in another way  gliding forward she tried to seize the african but he eluded her grasp just missing in doing so falling into the mysterious hole  as he swayed back to firm foothold he turned his own gun on her and shot  instinctively adam leaped at his assailant clutching at each other they tottered on the very brink  lady arabellas anger now fully awake was all for oolanga  she moved towards him with her hands extended and had just seized him when the catch of the locked boxdue to some movement from withinflew open and the kingcobrakiller flew at her with a venomous fury impossible to describe  as it seized her throat she caught hold of it and with a fury superior to its own tore it in two just as if it had been a sheet of paper  the strength used for such an act must have been terrific  in an instant it seemed to spout blood and entrails and was hurled into the wellhole  in another instant she had seized oolanga and with a swift rush had drawn him her white arms encircling him down with her into the gaping aperture  adam saw a medley of green and red lights blaze in a whirling circle and as it sank down into the well a pair of blazing green eyes became fixed sank lower and lower with frightful rapidity and disappeared throwing upward the green light which grew more and more vivid every moment  as the light sank into the noisome depths there came a shriek which chilled adams blooda prolonged agony of pain and terror which seemed to have no end  adam salton felt that he would never be able to free his mind from the memory of those dreadful moments  the gloom which surrounded that horrible charnel pit which seemed to go down to the very bowels of the earth conveyed from far down the sights and sounds of the nethermost hell  the ghastly fate of the african as he sank down to his terrible doom his black face growing grey with terror his white eyeballs now like veined bloodstone rolling in the helpless extremity of fear  the mysterious green light was in itself a milieu of horror  and through it all the awful cry came up from that fathomless pit whose entrance was flooded with spots of fresh blood  even the death of the fearless little snakekillerso fierce so frightful as if stained with a ferocity which told of no living force above earth but only of the devils of the pitwas only an incident  adam was in a state of intellectual tumult which had no parallel in his experience  he tried to rush away from the horrible place even the baleful green light thrown up through the gloomy wellshaft was dying away as its source sank deeper into the primeval ooze  the darkness was closing in on him in overwhelming densitydarkness in such a place and with such a memory of it  he made a wild rush forwardslipt on the steps in some sticky acrid smelling mass that felt and smelt like blood and falling forward felt his way into the inner room where the wellshaft was not  then he rubbed his eyes in sheer amazement  up the stone steps from the narrow door by which he had entered glided the whiteclad figure of lady arabella the only colour to be seen on her being bloodmarks on her face and hands and throat  otherwise she was calm and unruffled as when earlier she stood aside for him to pass in through the narrow iron door     chapter xixan enemy in the dark   adam salton went for a walk before returning to lesser hill he felt that it might be well not only to steady his nerves shaken by the horrible scene but to get his thoughts into some sort of order so as to be ready to enter on the matter with sir nathaniel  he was a little embarrassed as to telling his uncle for affairs had so vastly progressed beyond his original view that he felt a little doubtful as to what would be the old gentlemans attitude when he should hear of the strange events for the first time  mr salton would certainly not be satisfied at being treated as an outsider with regard to such things most of which had points of contact with the inmates of his own house  it was with an immense sense of relief that adam heard that his uncle had telegraphed to the housekeeper that he was detained by business at walsall where he would remain for the night and that he would be back in the morning in time for lunch  when adam got home after his walk he found sir nathaniel just going to bed  he did not say anything to him then of what had happened but contented himself with arranging that they would walk together in the early morning as he had much to say that would require serious attention  strangely enough he slept well and awoke at dawn with his mind clear and his nerves in their usual unshaken condition  the maid brought up with his early morning cup of tea a note which had been found in the letter box  it was from lady arabella and was evidently intended to put him on his guard as to what he should say about the previous evening  he read it over carefully several times before he was satisfied that he had taken in its full import     dear mr salton     i cannot go to bed until i have written to you so you must forgive    me if i disturb you and at an unseemly time  indeed you must also    forgive me if in trying to do what is right i err in saying too much    or too little  the fact is that i am quite upset and unnerved by all    that has happened in this terrible night  i find it difficult even to    write my hands shake so that they are not under control and i am    trembling all over with memory of the horrors we saw enacted before    our eyes  i am grieved beyond measure that i should be however    remotely a cause of this horror coming on you  forgive me if you    can and do not think too hardly of me  this i ask with confidence    for since we shared together the dangerthe very pangsof death i    feel that we should be to one another something more than mere    friends that i may lean on you and trust you assured that your    sympathy and pity are for me  you really must let me thank you for    the friendliness the help the confidence the real aid at a time of    deadly danger and deadly fear which you showed me  that awful mani    shall see him for ever in my dreams  his black malignant face will    shut out all memory of sunshine and happiness  i shall eternally see    his evil eyes as he threw himself into that wellhole in a vain effort    to escape from the consequences of his own misdoing  the more i think    of it the more apparent it seems to me that he had premeditated the    whole thingof course except his own horrible death     perhaps you have noticed a fur collar i occasionally wear  it is one    of my most valued treasuresan ermine collar studded with emeralds  i    had often seen the niggers eyes gleam covetously when he looked at    it  unhappily i wore it yesterday  that may have been the cause    that lured the poor man to his doom  on the very brink of the abyss    he tore the collar from my neckthat was the last i saw of him  when    he sank into the hole i was rushing to the iron door which i pulled    behind me  when i heard that soulsickening yell which marked his    disappearance in the chasm i was more glad than i can say that my    eyes were spared the pain and horror which my ears had to endure     when i tore myself out of the negros grasp as he sank into the well    hole i realised what freedom meant  freedom  freedom  not only    from that noisome prisonhouse which has now such a memory but from    the more noisome embrace of that hideous monster  whilst i live i    shall always thank you for my freedom  a woman must sometimes express    her gratitude otherwise it becomes too great to bear  i am not a    sentimental girl who merely likes to thank a man i am a woman who    knows all of bad as well as good that life can give  i have known    what it is to love and to lose  but you must not let me bring any    unhappiness into your life  i must live onas i have livedalone    and in addition bear with other woes the memory of this latest    insult and horror  in the meantime i must get away as quickly as    possible from dianas grove  in the morning i shall go up to town    where i shall remain for a weeki cannot stay longer as business    affairs demand my presence here  i think however that a week in the    rush of busy london surrounded with multitudes of commonplace people    will help to softeni cannot expect total obliterationthe terrible    images of the bygone night  when i can sleep easilywhich will be i    hope after a day or twoi shall be fit to return home and take up    again the burden which will i suppose always be with me     i shall be most happy to see you on my returnor earlier if my good    fortune sends you on any errand to london  i shall stay at the    mayfair hotel  in that busy spot we may forget some of the dangers    and horrors we have shared together  adieu and thank you again and    again for all your kindness and consideration to me     arabella marsh  adam was surprised by this effusive epistle but he determined to say nothing of it to sir nathaniel until he should have thought it well over when adam met sir nathaniel at breakfast he was glad that he had taken time to turn things over in his mind  the result had been that not only was he familiar with the facts in all their bearings but he had already so far differentiated them that he was able to arrange them in his own mind according to their values  breakfast had been a silent function so it did not interfere in any way with the process of thought  so soon as the door was closed sir nathaniel began  i see adam that something has occurred and that you have much to tell me  that is so sir  i suppose i had better begin by telling you all i knowall that has happened since i left you yesterday  accordingly adam gave him details of all that had happened during the previous evening  he confined himself rigidly to the narration of circumstances taking care not to colour events by any comment of his own or any opinion of the meaning of things which he did not fully understand  at first sir nathaniel seemed disposed to ask questions but shortly gave this up when he recognised that the narration was concise and selfexplanatory  thenceforth he contented himself with quick looks and glances easily interpreted or by some acquiescent motions of his hands when such could be convenient to emphasise his idea of the correctness of any inference  until adam ceased speaking having evidently come to an end of what he had to say with regard to this section of his story the elder man made no comment whatever  even when adam took from his pocket lady arabellas letter with the manifest intention of reading it he did not make any comment  finally when adam folded up the letter and put it in its envelope back in his pocket as an intimation that he had now quite finished the old diplomatist carefully made a few notes in his pocketbook  your narrative my dear adam is altogether admirable  i think i may now take it that we are both well versed in the actual facts and that our conference had better take the shape of a mutual exchange of ideas let us both ask questions as they may arise and i do not doubt that we shall arrive at some enlightening conclusions  will you kindly begin sir  i do not doubt that with your longer experience you will be able to dissipate some of the fog which envelops certain of the things which we have to consider  i hope so my dear boy  for a beginning then let me say that lady arabellas letter makes clear some things which she intendedand also some things which she did not intend  but before i begin to draw deductions let me ask you a few questions  adam are you heartwhole quite heartwhole in the matter of lady arabella  his companion answered at once each looking the other straight in the eyes during question and answer  lady arabella sir is a charming woman and i should have deemed it a privilege to meet herto talk to herevensince i am in the confessionalto flirt a little with her  but if you mean to ask if my affections are in any way engaged i can emphatically answer noas indeed you will understand when presently i give you the reason  apart from that there are the unpleasant details we discussed the other day  could youwould you mind giving me the reason now  it will help us to understand what is before us in the way of difficulty  certainly sir  my reason on which i can fully depend is that i love another woman  that clinches it  may i offer my good wishes and i hope my congratulations  i am proud of your good wishes sir and i thank you for them  but it is too soon for congratulationsthe lady does not even know my hopes yet  indeed i hardly knew them myself as definite till this moment  i take it then adam that at the right time i may be allowed to know who the lady is  adam laughed a low sweet laugh such as ripples from a happy heart  there need not be an hours a minutes delay  i shall be glad to share my secret with you sir  the lady sir whom i am so happy as to love and in whom my dreams of lifelong happiness are centred is mimi watford  then my dear adam i need not wait to offer congratulations  she is indeed a very charming young lady  i do not think i ever saw a girl who united in such perfection the qualities of strength of character and sweetness of disposition  with all my heart i congratulate you  then i may take it that my question as to your heartwholeness is answered in the affirmative  yes and now sir may i ask in turn why the question  certainly  i asked because it seems to me that we are coming to a point where my questions might be painful to you  it is not merely that i love mimi but i have reason to look on lady arabella as her enemy adam continued  her enemy  yes  a rank and unscrupulous enemy who is bent on her destruction  sir nathaniel went to the door looked outside it and returned locking it carefully behind him     chapter xxmetabolism   am i looking grave asked sir nathaniel inconsequently when he reentered the room  you certainly are sir  we little thought when first we met that we should be drawn into such a vortex  already we are mixed up in robbery and probably murder buta thousand times worse than all the crimes in the calendarin an affair of ghastly mystery which has no bottom and no endwith forces of the most unnerving kind which had their origin in an age when the world was different from the world which we know  we are going back to the origin of superstitionto an age when dragons tore each other in their slime we must fear nothingno conclusion however improbable almost impossible it may be  life and death is hanging on our judgment not only for ourselves but for others whom we love  remember i count on you as i hope you count on me  i do with all confidence  then said sir nathaniel let us think justly and boldly and fear nothing however terrifying it may seem  i suppose i am to take as exact in every detail your account of all the strange things which happened whilst you were in dianas grove  so far as i know yes  of course i may be mistaken in recollection of some detail or another but i am certain that in the main what i have said is correct  you feel sure that you saw lady arabella seize the negro round the neck and drag him down with her into the hole  absolutely certain sir otherwise i should have gone to her assistance  we have then an account of what happened from an eyewitness whom we trustthat is yourself  we have also another account written by lady arabella under her own hand  these two accounts do not agree  therefore we must take it that one of the two is lying  apparently sir  and that lady arabella is the liar  apparentlyas i am not  we must therefore try to find a reason for her lying  she has nothing to fear from oolanga who is dead  therefore the only reason which could actuate her would be to convince someone else that she was blameless this someone could not be you for you had the evidence of your own eyes  there was no one else present therefore it must have been an absent person  that seems beyond dispute sir  there is only one other person whose good opinion she could wish to keepedgar caswall  he is the only one who fills the bill  her lies point to other things besides the death of the african  she evidently wanted it to be accepted that his falling into the well was his own act i cannot suppose that she expected to convince you the eyewitness but if she wished later on to spread the story it was wise of her to try to get your acceptance of it  that is so  then there were other matters of untruth  that for instance of the ermine collar embroidered with emeralds  if an understandable reason be required for this it would be to draw attention away from the green lights which were seen in the room and especially in the wellhole  any unprejudiced person would accept the green lights to be the eyes of a great snake such as tradition pointed to living in the wellhole  in fine therefore lady arabella wanted the general belief to be that there was no snake of the kind in dianas grove  for my own part i dont believe in a partial liarthis art does not deal in veneer a liar is a liar right through  selfinterest may prompt falsity of the tongue but if one prove to be a liar nothing that he says can ever be believed this leads us to the conclusion that because she said or inferred that there was no snake we should look for oneand expect to find it too  now let me digress  i live and have for many years lived in derbyshire a county more celebrated for its caves than any other county in england  i have been through them all and am familiar with every turn of them as also with other great caves in kentucky in france in germany and a host of other placesin many of these are tremendously deep caves of narrow aperture which are valued by intrepid explorers who descend narrow gullets of abysmal depthand sometimes never return in many of the caverns in the peak i am convinced that some of the smaller passages were used in primeval times as the lairs of some of the great serpents of legend and tradition  it may have been that such caverns were formed in the usual geologic waybubbles or flaws in the earths crustwhich were later used by the monsters of the period of the young world  it may have been of course that some of them were worn originally by water but in time they all found a use when suitable for living monsters  this brings us to another point more difficult to accept and understand than any other requiring belief in a base not usually accepted or indeed entered onwhether such abnormal growths could have ever changed in their nature  some day the study of metabolism may progress so far as to enable us to accept structural changes proceeding from an intellectual or moral base  we may lean towards a belief that great animal strength may be a sound base for changes of all sorts  if this be so what could be a more fitting subject than primeval monsters whose strength was such as to allow a survival of thousands of years  we do not know yet if brain can increase and develop independently of other parts of the living structure  after all the mediaeval belief in the philosophers stone which could transmute metals has its counterpart in the accepted theory of metabolism which changes living tissue  in an age of investigation like our own when we are returning to science as the base of wondersalmost of miracleswe should be slow to refuse to accept facts however impossible they may seem to be  let us suppose a monster of the early days of the worlda dragon of the primeof vast age running into thousands of years to whom had been conveyed in some wayit matters nota brain just sufficient for the beginning of growth  suppose the monster to be of incalculable size and of a strength quite abnormala veritable incarnation of animal strength suppose this animal is allowed to remain in one place thus being removed from accidents of interrupted development might not would not this creature in process of timeages if necessaryhave that rudimentary intelligence developed  there is no impossibility in this it is only the natural process of evolution  in the beginning the instincts of animals are confined to alimentation selfprotection and the multiplication of their species  as time goes on and the needs of life become more complex power follows need  we have been long accustomed to consider growth as applied almost exclusively to size in its various aspects  but nature who has no doctrinaire ideas may equally apply it to concentration  a developing thing may expand in any given way or form  now it is a scientific law that increase implies gain and loss of various kinds what a thing gains in one direction it may lose in another  may it not be that mother nature may deliberately encourage decrease as well as increasethat it may be an axiom that what is gained in concentration is lost in size  take for instance monsters that tradition has accepted and localised such as the worm of lambton or that of spindleston heugh  if such a creature were by its own process of metabolism to change much of its bulk for intellectual growth we should at once arrive at a new class of creaturemore dangerous perhaps than the world has ever had any experience ofa force which can think which has no soul and no morals and therefore no acceptance of responsibility a snake would be a good illustration of this for it is coldblooded and therefore removed from the temptations which often weaken or restrict warmblooded creatures  if for instance the worm of lambtonif such ever existedwere guided to its own ends by an organised intelligence capable of expansion what form of creature could we imagine which would equal it in potentialities of evil  why such a being would devastate a whole country  now all these things require much thought and we want to apply the knowledge usefully and we should therefore be exact  would it not be well to resume the subject later in the day  i quite agree sir  i am in a whirl already and want to attend carefully to what you say so that i may try to digest it  both men seemed fresher and better for the easy and when they met in the afternoon each of them had something to contribute to the general stock of information  adam who was by nature of a more militant disposition than his elderly friend was glad to see that the conference at once assumed a practical trend  sir nathaniel recognised this and like an old diplomatist turned it to present use  tell me now adam what is the outcome in your own mind of our conversation  that the whole difficulty already assumes practical shape but with added dangers that at first i did not imagine  what is the practical shape and what are the added dangers  i am not disputing but only trying to clear my own ideas by the consideration of yours  so adam went on  in the past in the early days of the world there were monsters who were so vast that they could exist for thousands of years  some of them must have overlapped the christian era  they may have progressed intellectually in process of time  if they had in any way so progressed or even got the most rudimentary form of brain they would be the most dangerous things that ever were in the world  tradition says that one of these monsters lived in the marsh of the east and came up to a cave in dianas grove which was also called the lair of the white worm  such creatures may have grown down as well as up  they may have grown into or something like human beings  lady arabella march is of snake nature she has committed crimes to our knowledge  she retains something of the vast strength of her primal beingcan see in the darkhas the eyes of a snake  she used the nigger and then dragged him through the snakes hole down to the swamp she is intent on evil and hates some one we love  result      yes the result  first that mimi watford should be taken away at oncethen  yes  the monster must be destroyed  bravo  that is a true and fearless conclusion  at whatever cost it must be carried out  at once  soon at all events  that creatures very existence is a danger  her presence in this neighbourhood makes the danger immediate  as he spoke sir nathaniels mouth hardened and his eyebrows came down till they met  there was no doubting his concurrence in the resolution or his readiness to help in carrying it out  but he was an elderly man with much experience and knowledge of law and diplomacy  it seemed to him to be a stern duty to prevent anything irrevocable taking place till it had been thought out and all was ready  there were all sorts of legal cruxes to be thought out not only regarding the taking of life even of a monstrosity in human form but also of property  lady arabella be she woman or snake or devil owned the ground she moved in according to british law and the law is jealous and swift to avenge wrongs done within its ken  all such difficulties should bemust beavoided for mr saltons sake for adams own sake and most of all for mimi watfords sake  before he spoke again sir nathaniel had made up his mind that he must try to postpone decisive action until the circumstances on which they dependedwhich after all were only problematicalshould have been tested satisfactorily one way or another  when he did speak adam at first thought that his friend was wavering in his intention or funking the responsibility  however his respect for sir nathaniel was so great that he would not act or even come to a conclusion on a vital point without his sanction  he came close and whispered in his ear  we will prepare our plans to combat and destroy this horrible menace after we have cleared up some of the more baffling points  meanwhile we must wait for the nighti hear my uncles footsteps echoing down the hall  sir nathaniel nodded his approval     chapter xxigreen light   when old mr salton had retired for the night adam and sir nathaniel returned to the study  things went with great regularity at lesser hill so they knew that there would be no interruption to their talk  when their cigars were lighted sir nathaniel began  i hope adam that you do not think me either slack or changeable of purpose  i mean to go through this business to the bitter endwhatever it may be  be satisfied that my first care is and shall be the protection of mimi watford  to that i am pledged my dear boy we who are interested are all in the same danger  that semihuman monster out of the pit hates and means to destroy us allyou and me certainly and probably your uncle  i wanted especially to talk with you tonight for i cannot help thinking that the time is fast comingif it has not come alreadywhen we must take your uncle into our confidence  it was one thing when fancied evils threatened but now he is probably marked for death and it is only right that he should know all  i am with you sir  things have changed since we agreed to keep him out of the trouble  now we dare not consideration for his feelings might cost his life  it is a dutyand no light or pleasant one either  i have not a shadow of doubt that he will want to be one with us in this but remember we are his guests his name his honour have to be thought of as well as his safety  all shall be as you wish adam  and now as to what we are to do  we cannot murder lady arabella offhand  therefore we shall have to put things in order for the killing and in such a way that we cannot be taxed with a crime  it seems to me sir that we are in an exceedingly tight place  our first difficulty is to know where to begin  i never thought this fighting an antediluvian monster would be such a complicated job  this one is a woman with all a womans wit combined with the heartlessness of a cocotte  she has the strength and impregnability of a diplodocus we may be sure that in the fight that is before us there will be no semblance of fairplay  also that our unscrupulous opponent will not betray herself  that is sobut being feminine she will probably overreach herself now adam it strikes me that as we have to protect ourselves and others against feminine nature our strong game will be to play our masculine against her feminine  perhaps we had better sleep on it  she is a thing of the night and the night may give us some ideas  so they both turned in  adam knocked at sir nathaniels door in the grey of the morning and on being bidden came into the room  he had several letters in his hand sir nathaniel sat up in bed  well  i should like to read you a few letters but of course i shall not send them unless you approve  in factwith a smile and a blushthere are several things which i want to do but i hold my hand and my tongue till i have your approval  go on said the other kindly  tell me all and count at any rate on my sympathy and on my approval and help if i can see my way  accordingly adam proceeded  when i told you the conclusions at which i had arrived i put in the foreground that mimi watford should for the sake of her own safety be removedand that the monster which had wrought all the harm should be destroyed  yes that is so  to carry this into practice sir one preliminary is requiredunless harm of another kind is to be faced  mimi should have some protector whom all the world would recognise  the only form recognised by convention is marriage  sir nathaniel smiled in a fatherly way  to marry a husband is required  and that husband should be you  yes yes  and the marriage should be immediate and secretor at least not spoken of outside ourselves  would the young lady be agreeable to that proceeding  i do not know sir  then how are we to proceed  i suppose that weor one of usmust ask her  is this a sudden idea adam a sudden resolution  a sudden resolution sir but not a sudden idea  if she agrees all is well and good  the sequence is obvious  and it is to be kept a secret amongst ourselves  i want no secret sir except for mimis good  for myself i should like to shout it from the housetops  but we must be discreet untimely knowledge to our enemy might work incalculable harm  and how would you suggest adam that we could combine the momentous question with secrecy  adam grew red and moved uneasily  someone must ask heras soon as possible  and that someone  i thought that you sir would be so good  god bless my soul  this is a new kind of duty to take onat my time of life  adam i hope you know that you can count on me to help in any way i can  i have already counted on you sir when i ventured to make such a suggestion  i can only ask he added that you will be more than ever kind to meto usand look on the painful duty as a voluntary act of grace prompted by kindness and affection  painful duty  yes said adam boldly  painful to you though to me it would be all joyful  it is a strange job for an early morning  well we all live and learn i suppose the sooner i go the better  you had better write a line for me to take with me  for you see this is to be a somewhat unusual transaction and it may be embarrassing to the lady even to myself  so we ought to have some sort of warrant something to show that we have been mindful of her feelings  it will not do to take acquiescence for grantedalthough we act for her good  sir nathaniel you are a true friend i am sure that both mimi and i shall be grateful to you for all our liveshowever long they may be  so the two talked it over and agreed as to points to be borne in mind by the ambassador  it was striking ten when sir nathaniel left the house adam seeing him quietly off  as the young man followed him with wistful eyesalmost jealous of the privilege which his kind deed was about to bring himhe felt that his own heart was in his friends breast  the memory of that morning was like a dream to all those concerned in it sir nathaniel had a confused recollection of detail and sequence though the main facts stood out in his memory boldly and clearly  adam saltons recollection was of an illimitable wait filled with anxiety hope and chagrin all dominated by a sense of the slow passage of time and accompanied by vague fears  mimi could not for a long time think at all or recollect anything except that adam loved her and was saving her from a terrible danger  when she had time to think later on she wondered when she had any ignorance of the fact that adam loved her and that she loved him with all her heart  everything every recollection however small every feeling seemed to fit into those elemental facts as though they had all been moulded together  the main and crowning recollection was her saying goodbye to sir nathaniel and entrusting to him loving messages straight from her heart to adam salton and of his bearing whenwith an impulse which she could not checkshe put her lips to his and kissed him  later when she was alone and had time to think it was a passing grief to her that she would have to be silent for a time to lilla on the happy events of that strange mission  she had of course agreed to keep all secret until adam should give her leave to speak  the advice and assistance of sir nathaniel was a great help to adam in carrying out his idea of marrying mimi watford without publicity  he went with him to london and with his influence the young man obtained the license of the archbishop of canterbury for a private marriage  sir nathaniel then persuaded old mr salton to allow his nephew to spend a few weeks with him at doom tower and it was here that mimi became adams wife  but that was only the first step in their plans before going further however adam took his bride off to the isle of man  he wished to place a stretch of sea between mimi and the white worm while things matured  on their return sir nathaniel met them and drove them at once to doom taking care to avoid any one that he knew on the journey  sir nathaniel had taken care to have the doors and windows shut and lockedall but the door used for their entry  the shutters were up and the blinds down  moreover heavy curtains were drawn across the windows when adam commented on this sir nathaniel said in a whisper  wait till we are alone and ill tell you why this is done in the meantime not a word or a sign  you will approve when we have had a talk together  they said no more on the subject till after dinner when they were ensconced in sir nathaniels study which was on the top storey  doom tower was a lofty structure situated on an eminence high up in the peak the top commanded a wide prospect ranging from the hills above the ribble to the near side of the brow which marked the northern bound of ancient mercia  it was of the early norman period less than a century younger than castra regis  the windows of the study were barred and locked and heavy dark curtains closed them in  when this was done not a gleam of light from the tower could be seen from outside  when they were alone sir nathaniel explained that he had taken his old friend mr salton into full confidence and that in future all would work together  it is important for you to be extremely careful  in spite of the fact that our marriage was kept secret as also your temporary absence both are known  how  to whom  how i know not but i am beginning to have an idea  to her asked adam in momentary consternation  sir nathaniel shivered perceptibly  the white wormyes  adam noticed that from now on his friend never spoke of lady arabella otherwise except when he wished to divert the suspicion of others  sir nathaniel switched off the electric light and when the room was pitch dark he came to adam took him by the hand and led him to a seat set in the southern window  then he softly drew back a piece of the curtain and motioned his companion to look out  adam did so and immediately shrank back as though his eyes had opened on pressing danger  his companion set his mind at rest by saying in a low voice  it is all right you may speak but speak low  there is no danger hereat present  adam leaned forward taking care however not to press his face against the glass  what he saw would not under ordinary circumstances have caused concern to anybody  with his special knowledge it was appallingthough the night was now so dark that in reality there was little to be seen  on the western side of the tower stood a grove of old trees of forest dimensions  they were not grouped closely but stood a little apart from each other producing the effect of a row widely planted  over the tops of them was seen a green light something like the danger signal at a railwaycrossing  it seemed at first quite still but presently when adams eye became accustomed to it he could see that it moved as if trembling  this at once recalled to adams mind the light quivering above the wellhole in the darkness of that inner room at dianas grove oolangas awful shriek and the hideous black face now grown grey with terror disappearing into the impenetrable gloom of the mysterious orifice  instinctively he laid his hand on his revolver and stood up ready to protect his wife  then seeing that nothing happened and that the light and all outside the tower remained the same he softly pulled the curtain over the window  sir nathaniel switched on the light again and in its comforting glow they began to talk freely     chapter xxiiat close quarters   she has diabolical cunning said sir nathaniel  ever since you left she has ranged along the brow and wherever you were accustomed to frequent  i have not heard whence the knowledge of your movements came to her nor have i been able to learn any data whereon to found an opinion  she seems to have heard both of your marriage and your absence but i gather by inference that she does not actually know where you and mimi are or of your return  so soon as the dusk fails she goes out on her rounds and before dawn covers the whole ground round the brow and away up into the heart of the peak  the white worm in her own proper shape certainly has great facilities for the business on which she is now engaged  she can look into windows of any ordinary kind  happily this house is beyond her reach if she wishesas she manifestly doesto remain unrecognised  but even at this height it is wise to show no lights lest she might learn something of our presence or absence  would it not be well sir if one of us could see this monster in her real shape at close quarters  i am willing to run the riskfor i take it there would be no slight risk in the doing  i dont suppose anyone of our time has seen her close and lived to tell the tale  sir nathaniel held up an expostulatory hand  good god lad what are you suggesting  think of your wife and all that is at stake  it is of mimi that i thinkfor her sake that i am willing to risk whatever is to be risked  adams young bride was proud of her man but she blanched at the thought of the ghastly white worm  adam saw this and at once reassured her  so long as her ladyship does not know whereabout i am i shall have as much safety as remains to us bear in mind my darling that we cannot be too careful  sir nathaniel realised that adam was right the white worm had no supernatural powers and could not harm them until she discovered their hiding place  it was agreed therefore that the two men should go together  when the two men slipped out by the back door of the house they walked cautiously along the avenue which trended towards the west  everything was pitch darkso dark that at times they had to feel their way by the palings and treetrunks  they could still see seemingly far in front of them and high up the baleful light which at the height and distance seemed like a faint line  as they were now on the level of the ground the light seemed infinitely higher than it had from the top of the tower at the sight adams heart fell the danger of the desperate enterprise which he had undertaken burst upon him  but this feeling was shortly followed by another which restored him to himselfa fierce loathing and a desire to kill such as he had never experienced before  they went on for some distance on a level road fairly wide from which the green light was visible  here sir nathaniel spoke softly placing his lips to adams ear for safety  we know nothing whatever of this creatures power of hearing or smelling though i presume that both are of no great strength  as to seeing we may presume the opposite but in any case we must try to keep in the shade behind the treetrunks  the slightest error would be fatal to us  adam only nodded in case there should be any chance of the monster seeing the movement  after a time that seemed interminable they emerged from the circling wood  it was like coming out into sunlight by comparison with the misty blackness which had been around them  there was light enough to see by though not sufficient to distinguish things at a distance  adams eyes sought the green light in the sky  it was still in about the same place but its surroundings were more visible  it was now at the summit of what seemed to be a long white pole near the top of which were two pendant white masses like rudimentary arms or fins  the green light strangely enough did not seem lessened by the surrounding starlight but had a clearer effect and a deeper green  whilst they were carefully regarding thisadam with the aid of an operaglasstheir nostrils were assailed by a horrid stench something like that which rose from the wellhole in dianas grove  by degrees as their eyes got the right focus they saw an immense towering mass that seemed snowy white  it was tall and thin  the lower part was hidden by the trees which lay between but they could follow the tall white shaft and the duplicate green lights which topped it  as they looked there was a movementthe shaft seemed to bend and the line of green light descended amongst the trees  they could see the green light twinkle as it passed between the obstructing branches  seeing where the head of the monster was the two men ventured a little further forward and saw that the hidden mass at the base of the shaft was composed of vast coils of the great serpents body forming a base from which the upright mass rose  as they looked this lower mass moved the glistening folds catching the moonlight and they could see that the monsters progress was along the ground  it was coming towards them at a swift pace so they turned and ran taking care to make as little noise as possible either by their footfalls or by disturbing the undergrowth close to them  they did not stop or pause till they saw before them the high dark tower of doom     chapter xxiiiin the enemys house   sir nathaniel was in the library next morning after breakfast when adam came to him carrying a letter  her ladyship doesnt lose any time  she has begun work already  sir nathaniel who was writing at a table near the window looked up  what is it said he  adam held out the letter he was carrying  it was in a blazoned envelope  ha said sir nathaniel from the white worm  i expected something of the kind  but said adam how could she have known we were here  she didnt know last night  i dont think we need trouble about that adam  there is so much we do not understand  this is only another mystery  suffice it that she does knowperhaps it is all the better and safer for us  how is that asked adam with a puzzled look  general process of reasoning my boy and the experience of some years in the diplomatic world  this creature is a monster without heart or consideration for anything or anyone  she is not nearly so dangerous in the open as when she has the dark to protect her  besides we know by our own experience of her movements that for some reason she shuns publicity  in spite of her vast bulk and abnormal strength she is afraid to attack openly  after all she is only a snake and with a snakes nature which is to keep low and squirm and proceed by stealth and cunning  she will never attack when she can run away although she knows well that running away would probably be fatal to her  what is the letter about  sir nathaniels voice was calm and selfpossessed  when he was engaged in any struggle of wits he was all diplomatist  she asks mimi and me to tea this afternoon at dianas grove and hopes that you also will favour her  sir nathaniel smiled  please ask mrs salton to accept for us all  she means some deadly mischief  surelysurely it would be wiser not  it is an old trick that we learn early in diplomacy adamto fight on ground of your own choice  it is true that she suggested the place on this occasion but by accepting it we make it ours  moreover she will not be able to understand our reason for doing so and her own bad conscienceif she has any bad or goodand her own fears and doubts will play our game for us  no my dear boy let us accept by all means  adam said nothing but silently held out his hand which his companion shook no words were necessary  when it was getting near teatime mimi asked sir nathaniel how they were going  we must make a point of going in state  we want all possible publicity  mimi looked at him inquiringly  certainly my dear in the present circumstances publicity is a part of safety  do not be surprised if whilst we are at dianas grove occasional messages come for youfor all or any of us  i see said mrs salton  you are taking no chances  none my dear  all i have learned at foreign courts and amongst civilised and uncivilised people is going to be utilised within the next couple of hours  sir nathaniels voice was full of seriousness and it brought to mimi in a convincing way the awful gravity of the occasion  in due course they set out in a carriage drawn by a fine pair of horses who soon devoured the few miles of their journey  before they came to the gate sir nathaniel turned to mimi  i have arranged with adam certain signals which may be necessary if certain eventualities occur  these need be nothing to do with you directly  but bear in mind that if i ask you or adam to do anything do not lose a second in the doing of it  we must try to pass off such moments with an appearance of unconcern  in all probability nothing requiring such care will occur  the white worm will not try force though she has so much of it to spare  whatever she may attempt today of harm to any of us will be in the way of secret plot  some other time she may try force butif i am able to judge such a thingnot today the messengers who may ask for any of us will not be witnesses only they may help to stave off danger  seeing query in her face he went on of what kind the danger may be i know not and cannot guess  it will doubtless be some ordinary circumstance but none the less dangerous on that account  here we are at the gate  now be careful in all matters however small  to keep your head is half the battle  there were a number of men in livery in the hall when they arrived  the doors of the drawingroom were thrown open and lady arabella came forth and offered them cordial welcome  this having been got over lady arabella led them into another room where tea was served  adam was acutely watchful and suspicious of everything and saw on the far side of this room a panelled iron door of the same colour and configuration as the outer door of the room where was the wellhole wherein oolanga had disappeared  something in the sight alarmed him and he quietly stood near the door  he made no movement even of his eyes but he could see that sir nathaniel was watching him intently and he fancied with approval  they all sat near the table spread for tea adam still near the door lady arabella fanned herself complaining of heat and told one of the footmen to throw all the outer doors open  tea was in progress when mimi suddenly started up with a look of fright on her face at the same moment the men became cognisant of a thick smoke which began to spread through the rooma smoke which made those who experienced it gasp and choke  the footmen began to edge uneasily towards the inner door  denser and denser grew the smoke and more acrid its smell  mimi towards whom the draught from the open door wafted the smoke rose up choking and ran to the inner door which she threw open to its fullest extent disclosing on the outside a curtain of thin silk fixed to the doorposts  the draught from the open door swayed the thin silk towards her and in her fright she tore down the curtain which enveloped her from head to foot  then she ran through the still open door heedless of the fact that she could not see where she was going adam followed by sir nathaniel rushed forward and joined heradam catching his wife by the arm and holding her tight  it was well that he did so for just before her lay the black orifice of the wellhole which of course she could not see with the silk curtain round her head the floor was extremely slippery something like thick oil had been spilled where she had to pass and close to the edge of the hole her feet shot from under her and she stumbled forward towards the wellhole  when adam saw mimi slip he flung himself backward still holding her his weight told and he dragged her up from the hole and they fell together on the floor outside the zone of slipperiness  in a moment he had raised her up and together they rushed out through the open door into the sunlight sir nathaniel close behind them  they were all pale except the old diplomatist who looked both calm and cool  it sustained and cheered adam and his wife to see him thus master of himself  both managed to follow his example to the wonderment of the footmen who saw the three who had just escaped a terrible danger walking together gaily as under the guiding pressure of sir nathaniels hand they turned to re enter the house  lady arabella whose face had blanched to a deadly white now resumed her ministrations at the teaboard as though nothing unusual had happened the slopbasin was full of halfburned brown paper over which tea had been poured  sir nathaniel had been narrowly observing his hostess and took the first opportunity afforded him of whispering to adam  the real attack is to comeshe is too quiet  when i give my hand to your wife to lead her out come with usand caution her to hurry  dont lose a second even if you have to make a scene  hsssh  then they resumed their places close to the table and the servants in obedience to lady arabellas order brought in fresh tea  thence on that teaparty seemed to adam whose faculties were at their utmost intensity like a terrible dream  as for poor mimi she was so overwrought both with present and future fear and with horror at the danger she had escaped that her faculties were numb  however she was braced up for a trial and she felt assured that whatever might come she would be able to go through with it  sir nathaniel seemed just as usualsuave dignified and thoughtfulperfect master of himself  to her husband it was evident that mimi was ill at ease  the way she kept turning her head to look around her the quick coming and going of the colour of her face her hurried breathing alternating with periods of suspicious calm were evidences of mental perturbation  to her the attitude of lady arabella seemed compounded of social sweetness and personal consideration  it would be hard to imagine more thoughtful and tender kindness towards an honoured guest  when tea was over and the servants had come to clear away the cups lady arabella putting her arm round mimis waist strolled with her into an adjoining room where she collected a number of photographs which were scattered about and sitting down beside her guest began to show them to her  while she was doing this the servants closed all the doors of the suite of rooms as well as that which opened from the room outsidethat of the wellhole into the avenue  suddenly without any seeming cause the light in the room began to grow dim  sir nathaniel who was sitting close to mimi rose to his feet and crying quick caught hold of her hand and began to drag her from the room  adam caught her other hand and between them they drew her through the outer door which the servants were beginning to close  it was difficult at first to find the way the darkness was so great but to their relief when adam whistled shrilly the carriage and horses which had been waiting in the angle of the avenue dashed up  her husband and sir nathaniel liftedalmost threwmimi into the carriage  the postillion plied whip and spur and the vehicle rocking with its speed swept through the gate and tore up the road  behind them was a hubbubservants rushing about orders being shouted out doors shutting and somewhere seemingly far back in the house a strange noise  every nerve of the horses was strained as they dashed recklessly along the road  the two men held mimi between them the arms of both of them round her as though protectingly as they went there was a sudden rise in the ground but the horses breathing heavily dashed up it at racing speed not slackening their pace when the hill fell away again leaving them to hurry along the downgrade  it would be foolish to say that neither adam nor mimi had any fear in returning to doom tower  mimi felt it more keenly than her husband whose nerves were harder and who was more inured to danger  still she bore up bravely and as usual the effort was helpful to her  when once she was in the study in the top of the turret she almost forgot the terrors which lay outside in the dark  she did not attempt to peep out of the window but adam didand saw nothing  the moonlight showed all the surrounding country but nowhere was to be observed that tremulous line of green light  the peaceful night had a good effect on them all danger being unseen seemed far off  at times it was hard to realise that it had ever been with courage restored adam rose early and walked along the brow seeing no change in the signs of life in castra regis  what he did see to his wonder and concern on his returning homeward was lady arabella in her tightfitting white dress and ermine collar but without her emeralds she was emerging from the gate of dianas grove and walking towards the castle  pondering on this and trying to find some meaning in it occupied his thoughts till he joined mimi and sir nathaniel at breakfast they began the meal in silence  what had been had been and was known to them all  moreover it was not a pleasant topic  a fillip was given to the conversation when adam told of his seeing lady arabella on her way to castra regis  they each had something to say of her and of what her wishes or intentions were towards edgar caswall mimi spoke bitterly of her in every aspect  she had not forgottenand never wouldnever couldthe occasion when to harm lilla the woman had consorted even with the nigger  as a social matter she was disgusted with her for following up the rich landownerthrowing herself at his head so shamelessly was how she expressed it  she was interested to know that the great kite still flew from caswalls tower  but beyond such matters she did not try to go  the only comment she made was of strongly expressed surprise at her ladyships cheek in ignoring her own criminal acts and her impudence in taking it for granted that others had overlooked them also     chapter xxiva startling proposition   the more mimi thought over the late events the more puzzled she was what did it all meanwhat could it mean except that there was an error of fact somewhere  could it be possible that some of themall of them had been mistaken that there had been no white worm at all  on either side of her was a belief impossible of reception  not to believe in what seemed apparent was to destroy the very foundations of belief    yet in old days there had been monsters on the earth and certainly some people had believed in just such mysterious changes of identity  it was all very strange  just fancy how any strangersay a doctorwould regard her if she were to tell him that she had been to a teaparty with an antediluvian monster and that they had been waited on by uptodate menservants  adam had returned exhilarated by his walk and more settled in his mind than he had been for some time  like mimi he had gone through the phase of doubt and inability to believe in the reality of things though it had not affected him to the same extent  the idea however that his wife was suffering illeffects from her terrible ordeal braced him up  he remained with her for a time then he sought sir nathaniel in order to talk over the matter with him  he knew that the calm common sense and selfreliance of the old man as well as his experience would be helpful to them all  sir nathaniel had come to the conclusion that for some reason which he did not understand lady arabella had changed her plans and for the present at all events was pacific  he was inclined to attribute her changed demeanour to the fact that her influence over edgar caswall was so far increased as to justify a more fixed belief in his submission to her charms  as a matter of fact she had seen caswall that morning when she visited castra regis and they had had a long talk together during which the possibility of their union had been discussed  caswall without being enthusiastic on the subject had been courteous and attentive as she had walked back to dianas grove she almost congratulated herself on her new settlement in life  that the idea was becoming fixed in her mind was shown by a letter which she wrote later in the day to adam salton and sent to him by hand  it ran as follows     dear mr salton     i wonder if you would kindly advise and if possible help me in a    matter of business  i have been for some time trying to make up my    mind to sell dianas grove i have put off and put off the doing of it    till now  the place is my own property and no one has to be    consulted with regard to what i may wish to do about it  it was    bought by my late husband captain adolphus ranger march who had    another residence the crest appleby  he acquired all rights of all    kinds including mining and sporting  when he died he left his whole    property to me  i shall feel leaving this place which has become    endeared to me by many sacred memories and affectionsthe    recollection of many happy days of my young married life and the more    than happy memories of the man i loved and who loved me so much  i    should be willing to sell the place for any fair priceso long of    course as the purchaser was one i liked and of whom i approved  may    i say that you yourself would be the ideal person  but i dare not    hope for so much  it strikes me however that among your australian    friends may be someone who wishes to make a settlement in the old    country and would care to fix the spot in one of the most historic    regions in england full of romance and legend and with a    neverending vista of historical interestan estate which though    small is in perfect condition and with illimitable possibilities of    development and many doubtfulor unsettledrights which have    existed before the time of the romans or even celts who were the    original possessors  in addition the house has been kept up to the    dernier cri  immediate possession can be arranged  my lawyers can    provide you or whoever you may suggest with all business and    historical details  a word from you of acceptance or refusal is all    that is necessary and we can leave details to be thrashed out by our    agents  forgive me wont you for troubling you in the matter and    believe me yours very sincerely     arabella march  adam read this over several times and then his mind being made up he went to mimi and asked if she had any objection  she answeredafter a shudderthat she was in this as in all things willing to do whatever he might wish  dearest i am willing that you should judge what is best for us  be quite free to act as you see your duty and as your inclination calls  we are in the hands of god and he has hitherto guided us and will do so to his own end  from his wifes room adam salton went straight to the study in the tower where he knew sir nathaniel would be at that hour  the old man was alone so when he had entered in obedience to the come in which answered his query he closed the door and sat down beside him  do you think sir that it would be well for me to buy dianas grove  god bless my soul said the old man startled why on earth would you want to do that  well i have vowed to destroy that white worm and my being able to do whatever i may choose with the lair would facilitate matters and avoid complications  sir nathaniel hesitated longer than usual before speaking  he was thinking deeply  yes adam there is much common sense in your suggestion though it startled me at first  i think that for all reasons you would do well to buy the property and to have the conveyance settled at once  if you want more money than is immediately convenient let me know so that i may be your banker  thank you sir most heartily but i have more money at immediate call than i shall want  i am glad you approve  the property is historic and as time goes on it will increase in value moreover i may tell you something which indeed is only a surmise but which if i am right will add great value to the place  adam listened has it ever struck you why the old name the lair of the white worm was given  we know that there was a snake which in early days was called a worm but why white  i really dont know sir i never thought of it  i simply took it for granted  so did i at firstlong ago  but later i puzzled my brain for a reason  and what was the reason sir  simply and solely because the snake or worm was white  we are near the county of stafford where the great industry of chinaburning was originated and grew  stafford owes much of its wealth to the large deposits of the rare china clay found in it from time to time  these deposits become in time pretty well exhausted but for centuries stafford adventurers looked for the special clay as ohio and pennsylvania farmers and explorers looked for oil  anyone owning real estate on which china clay can be discovered strikes a sort of gold mine  yes and then  the young man looked puzzled  the original worm socalled from which the name of the place came had to find a direct way down to the marshes and the mudholes  now the clay is easily penetrable and the original hole probably pierced a bed of china clay  when once the way was made it would become a sort of highway for the worm  but as much movement was necessary to ascend such a great height some of the clay would become attached to its rough skin by attrition  the downway must have been easy work but the ascent was different and when the monster came to view in the upper world it would be fresh from contact with the white clay  hence the name which has no cryptic significance but only fact  now if that surmise be trueand i do not see why notthere must be a deposit of valuable claypossibly of immense depth  adams comment pleased the old gentleman  i have it in my bones sir that you have struckor rather reasoned outa great truth  sir nathaniel went on cheerfully  when the world of commerce wakes up to the value of your find it will be as well that your title to ownership has been perfectly secured  if anyone ever deserved such a gain it is you  with his friends aid adam secured the property without loss of time then he went to see his uncle and told him about it  mr salton was delighted to find his young relative already constructively the owner of so fine an estateone which gave him an important status in the county he made many anxious enquiries about mimi and the doings of the white worm but adam reassured him  the next morning when adam went to his host in the smokingroom sir nathaniel asked him how he purposed to proceed with regard to keeping his vow  it is a difficult matter which you have undertaken  to destroy such a monster is something like one of the labours of hercules in that not only its size and weight and power of using them in littleknown ways are against you but the occult side is alone an unsurpassable difficulty the worm is already master of all the elements except fireand i do not see how fire can be used for the attack  it has only to sink into the earth in its usual way and you could not overtake it if you had the resources of the biggest coalmine in existence  but i daresay you have mapped out some plan in your mind he added courteously  i have sir  but of course it may not stand the test of practice  may i know the idea  well sir this was my argument at the time of the chartist trouble an idea spread amongst financial circles that an attack was going to be made on the bank of england  accordingly the directors of that institution consulted many persons who were supposed to know what steps should be taken and it was finally decided that the best protection against firewhich is what was fearedwas not water but sand  to carry the scheme into practice great store of fine seasandthe kind that blows about and is used to fill hourglasseswas provided throughout the building especially at the points liable to attack from which it could be brought into use  i propose to provide at dianas grove as soon as it comes into my possession an enormous amount of such sand and shall take an early occasion of pouring it into the wellhole which it will in time choke thus lady arabella in her guise of the white worm will find herself cut off from her refuge  the hole is a narrow one and is some hundreds of feet deep  the weight of the sand this can contain would not in itself be sufficient to obstruct but the friction of such a body working up against it would be tremendous  one moment  what use would the sand be for destruction  none directly but it would hold the struggling body in place till the rest of my scheme came into practice  and what is the rest  as the sand is being poured into the wellhole quantities of dynamite can also be thrown in  good  but how would the dynamite explodefor of course that is what you intend  would not some sort of wire or fuse he required for each parcel of dynamite  adam smiled  not in these days sir  that was proved in new york  a thousand pounds of dynamite in sealed canisters was placed about some workings  at the last a charge of gunpowder was fired and the concussion exploded the dynamite  it was most successful  those who were nonexperts in high explosives expected that every pane of glass in new york would be shattered  but in reality the explosive did no harm outside the area intended although sixteen acres of rock had been mined and only the supporting walls and pillars had been left intact  the whole of the rocks were shattered  sir nathaniel nodded approval  that seems a good plana very excellent one  but if it has to tear down so many feet of precipice it may wreck the whole neighbourhood  and free it for ever from a monster added adam as he left the room to find his wife     chapter xxvthe last battle   lady arabella had instructed her solicitors to hurry on with the conveyance of dianas grove so no time was lost in letting adam salton have formal possession of the estate  after his interview with sir nathaniel he had taken steps to begin putting his plan into action  in order to accumulate the necessary amount of fine seasand he ordered the steward to prepare for an elaborate system of topdressing all the grounds  a great heap of the sand brought from bays on the welsh coast began to grow at the back of the grove  no one seemed to suspect that it was there for any purpose other than what had been given out  lady arabella who alone could have guessed was now so absorbed in her matrimonial pursuit of edgar caswall that she had neither time nor inclination for thought extraneous to this  she had not yet moved from the house though she had formally handed over the estate  adam put up a rough corrugatediron shed behind the grove in which he stored his explosives  all being ready for his great attempt whenever the time should come he was now content to wait and in order to pass the time interested himself in other thingseven in caswalls great kite which still flew from the high tower of castra regis  the mound of fine sand grew to proportions so vast as to puzzle the bailiffs and farmers round the brow  the hour of the intended cataclysm was approaching apace  adam wishedbut in vainfor an opportunity which would appear to be natural of visiting caswall in the turret of castra regis  at last one morning he met lady arabella moving towards the castle so he took his courage a deux mains and asked to be allowed to accompany her  she was glad for her own purposes to comply with his wishes  so together they entered and found their way to the turretroom  caswall was much surprised to see adam come to his house but lent himself to the task of seeming to be pleased  he played the host so well as to deceive even adam  they all went out on the turret roof where he explained to his guests the mechanism for raising and lowering the kite taking also the opportunity of testing the movements of the multitudes of birds how they answered almost instantaneously to the lowering or raising of the kite  as lady arabella walked home with adam from castra regis she asked him if she might make a request  permission having been accorded she explained that before she finally left dianas grove where she had lived so long she had a desire to know the depth of the wellhole  adam was really happy to meet her wishes not from any sentiment but because he wished to give some valid and ostensible reason for examining the passage of the worm which would obviate any suspicion resulting from his being on the premises  he brought from london a kelvin sounding apparatus with a sufficient length of pianowire for testing any probable depth the wire passed easily over the running wheel and when this was once fixed over the hole he was satisfied to wait till the most advantageous time for his final experiment        in the meantime affairs had been going quietly at mercy farm  lilla of course felt lonely in the absence of her cousin but the even tenor of life went on for her as for others  after the first shock of parting was over things went back to their accustomed routine  in one respect however there was a marked difference  so long as home conditions had remained unchanged lilla was content to put ambition far from her and to settle down to the life which had been hers as long as she could remember  but mimis marriage set her thinking naturally she came to the conclusion that she too might have a mate  there was not for her much choicethere was little movement in the matrimonial direction at the farmhouse  she did not approve of the personality of edgar caswall and his struggle with mimi had frightened her but he was unmistakably an excellent parti much better than she could have any right to expect this weighs much with a woman and more particularly one of her class so on the whole she was content to let things take their course and to abide by the issue  as time went on she had reason to believe that things did not point to happiness  she could not shut her eyes to certain disturbing facts amongst which were the existence of lady arabella and her growing intimacy with edgar caswall as well as his own cold and haughty nature so little in accord with the ardour which is the foundation of a young maids dreams of happiness  how things would of necessity alter if she were to marry she was afraid to think  all told the prospect was not happy for her and she had a secret longing that something might occur to upset the order of things as at present arranged  when lilla received a note from edgar caswall asking if he might come to tea on the following afternoon her heart sank within her  if it was only for her fathers sake she must not refuse him or show any disinclination which he might construe into incivility  she missed mimi more than she could say or even dared to think  hitherto she had always looked to her cousin for sympathy for understanding for loyal support now she and all these things and a thousand othersgentle assuring supportingwere gone  and instead there was a horrible aching void  for the whole afternoon and evening and for the following forenoon poor lillas loneliness grew to be a positive agony  for the first time she began to realise the sense of her loss as though all the previous suffering had been merely a preparation  everything she looked at everything she remembered or thought of became laden with poignant memory  then on the top of all was a new sense of dread  the reaction from the sense of security which had surrounded her all her life to a neverquieted apprehension was at times almost more than she could bear it so filled her with fear that she had a haunting feeling that she would as soon die as live  however whatever might be her own feelings duty had to be done and as she had been brought up to consider duty first she braced herself to go through to the very best of her ability what was before her  still the severe and prolonged struggle for selfcontrol told upon lilla  she looked as she felt ill and weak  she was really in a nerveless and prostrate condition with black circles round her eyes pale even to her lips and with an instinctive trembling which she was quite unable to repress  it was for her a sad mischance that mimi was away for her love would have seen through all obscuring causes and have brought to light the girls unhappy condition of health  lilla was utterly unable to do anything to escape from the ordeal before her but her cousin with the experience of her former struggles with mr caswall and of the condition in which these left her would have taken stepseven peremptory ones if necessaryto prevent a repetition  edgar arrived punctually to the time appointed by herself  when lilla through the great window saw him approaching the house her condition of nervous upset was pitiable  she braced herself up however and managed to get through the interview in its preliminary stages without any perceptible change in her normal appearance and bearing  it had been to her an added terror that the black shadow of oolanga whom she dreaded would follow hard on his master  a load was lifted from her mind when he did not make his usual stealthy approach  she had also feared though in lesser degree lest lady arabella should be present to make trouble for her as before  with a womans natural forethought in a difficult position she had provided the furnishing of the teatable as a subtle indication of the social difference between her and her guest  she had chosen the implements of service as well as all the provender set forth of the humblest kind  instead of arranging the silver teapot and china cups she had set out an earthen teapot such as was in common use in the farm kitchen  the same idea was carried out in the cups and saucers of thick homely delft and in the creamjug of similar kind  the bread was of simple wholemeal homebaked  the butter was good since she had made it herself while the preserves and honey came from her own garden  her face beamed with satisfaction when the guest eyed the appointments with a supercilious glance  it was a shock to the poor girl herself for she enjoyed offering to a guest the little hospitalities possible to her but that had to be sacrificed with other pleasures  caswalls face was more set and ironclad than everhis piercing eyes seemed from the very beginning to look her through and through  her heart quailed when she thought of what would followof what would be the end when this was only the beginning  as some protection though it could be only of a sentimental kind she brought from her own room the photographs of mimi of her grandfather and of adam salton whom by now she had grown to look on with reliance as a brother whom she could trust  she kept the pictures near her heart to which her hand naturally strayed when her feelings of constraint distrust or fear became so poignant as to interfere with the calm which she felt was necessary to help her through her ordeal  at first edgar caswall was courteous and polite even thoughtful but after a little while when he found her resistance to his domination grow he abandoned all forms of selfcontrol and appeared in the same dominance as he had previously shown  she was prepared however for this both by her former experience and the natural fighting instinct within her  by this means as the minutes went on both developed the power and preserved the equality in which they had begun  without warning the psychic battle between the two individualities began afresh  this time both the positive and negative causes were all in favour of the man  the woman was alone and in bad spirits unsupported nothing at all was in her favour except the memory of the two victorious contests whereas the man though unaided as before by either lady arabella or oolanga was in full strength well rested and in flourishing circumstances  it was not therefore to be wondered at that his native dominance of character had full opportunity of asserting itself  he began his preliminary stare with a conscious sense of power and as it appeared to have immediate effect on the girl he felt an ever growing conviction of ultimate victory  after a little lillas resolution began to flag  she felt that the contest was unequalthat she was unable to put forth her best efforts as she was an unselfish person she could not fight so well in her own battle as in that of someone whom she loved and to whom she was devoted edgar saw the relaxing of the muscles of face and brow and the almost collapse of the heavy eyelids which seemed tumbling downward in sleep lilla made gallant efforts to brace her dwindling powers but for a time unsuccessfully  at length there came an interruption which seemed like a powerful stimulant  through the wide window she saw lady arabella enter the plain gateway of the farm and advance towards the hall door she was clad as usual in tightfitting white which accentuated her thin sinuous figure  the sight did for lilla what no voluntary effort could have done  her eyes flashed and in an instant she felt as though a new life had suddenly developed within her  lady arabellas entry in her usual unconcerned haughty supercilious way heightened the effect so that when the two stood close to each other battle was joined  mr caswall too took new courage from her coming and all his masterfulness and power came back to him  his looks intensified had more obvious effect than had been noticeable that day  lilla seemed at last overcome by his dominance  her face became red and paleviolently red and ghastly paleby rapid turns  her strength seemed gone  her knees collapsed and she was actually sinking on the floor when to her surprise and joy mimi came into the room running hurriedly and breathing heavily  lilla rushed to her and the two clasped hands  with that a new sense of power greater than lilla had ever seen in her seemed to quicken her cousin  her hand swept the air in front of edgar caswall seeming to drive him backward more and more by each movement till at last he seemed to be actually hurled through the door which mimis entrance had left open and fell at full length on the gravel path without  then came the final and complete collapse of lilla who without a sound sank down on the floor     chapter xxviface to face   mimi was greatly distressed when she saw her cousin lying prone  she had a few times in her life seen lilla on the verge of fainting but never senseless and now she was frightened  she threw herself on her knees beside lilla and tried by rubbing her hands and other measures commonly known to restore her  but all her efforts were unavailing  lilla still lay white and senseless  in fact each moment she looked worse her breast that had been heaving with the stress became still and the pallor of her face grew like marble  at these succeeding changes mimis fright grew till it altogether mastered her  she succeeded in controlling herself only to the extent that she did not scream  lady arabella had followed caswall when he had recovered sufficiently to get up and walkthough stumblinglyin the direction of castra regis when mimi was quite alone with lilla and the need for effort had ceased she felt weak and trembled  in her own mind she attributed it to a sudden change in the weatherit was momentarily becoming apparent that a storm was coming on  she raised lillas head and laid it on her warm young breast but all in vain  the cold of the white features thrilled through her and she utterly collapsed when it was borne in on her that lilla had passed away  the dusk gradually deepened and the shades of evening closed in but mimi did not seem to notice or to care  she sat on the floor with her arms round the body of the girl whom she loved  darker and blacker grew the sky as the coming storm and the closing night joined forces  still she sat onalonetearlessunable to think  mimi did not know how long she sat there  though it seemed to her that ages had passed it could not have been more than halfanhour  she suddenly came to herself and was surprised to find that her grandfather had not returned  for a while she lay quiet thinking of the immediate past  lillas hand was still in hers and to her surprise it was still warm  somehow this helped her consciousness and without any special act of will she stood up  she lit a lamp and looked at her cousin  there was no doubt that lilla was dead but when the lamplight fell on her eyes they seemed to look at mimi with intentwith meaning  in this state of dark isolation a new resolution came to her and grew and grew until it became a fixed definite purpose  she would face caswall and call him to account for his murder of lillathat was what she called it to herself  she would also take stepsshe knew not what or howto avenge the part taken by lady arabella  in this frame of mind she lit all the lamps in the room got water and linen from her room and set about the decent ordering of lillas body this took some time but when it was finished she put on her hat and cloak put out the lights and set out quietly for castra regis  as mimi drew near the castle she saw no lights except those in and around the tower room  the lights showed her that mr caswall was there so she entered by the hall door which as usual was open and felt her way in the darkness up the staircase to the lobby of the room  the door was ajar and the light from within showed brilliantly through the opening  she saw edgar caswall walking restlessly to and fro in the room with his hands clasped behind his back  she opened the door without knocking and walked right into the room  as she entered he ceased walking and stared at her in surprise  she made no remark no comment but continued the fixed look which he had seen on her entrance  for a time silence reigned and the two stood looking fixedly at each other  mimi was the first to speak  you murderer  lilla is dead  dead  good god  when did she die  she died this afternoon just after you left her  are you sure  yesand so are youor you ought to be  you killed her  i killed her  be careful what you say  as god sees us it is true and you know it  you came to mercy farm on purpose to break herif you could  and the accomplice of your guilt lady arabella march came for the same purpose  be careful woman he said hotly  do not use such names in that way or you shall suffer for it  i am suffering for ithave suffered for itshall suffer for it  not for speaking the truth as i have done but because you two with devilish malignity did my darling to death  it is you and your accomplice who have to dread punishment not i  take care he said again  oh i am not afraid of you or your accomplice she answered spiritedly i am content to stand by every word i have said every act i have done moreover i believe in gods justice  i fear not the grinding of his mills if necessary i shall set the wheels in motion myself  but you dont care for god or believe in him  your god is your great kite which cows the birds of a whole district  but be sure that his hand when it rises always falls at the appointed time  it may be that your name is being called even at this very moment at the great assize  repent while there is still time  happy you if you may be allowed to enter those mighty halls in the company of the puresouled angel whose voice has only to whisper one word of justice and you disappear for ever into everlasting torment  the sudden death of lilla caused consternation among mimis friends and wellwishers  such a tragedy was totally unexpected as adam and sir nathaniel had been expecting the white worms vengeance to fall upon themselves  adam leaving his wife free to follow her own desires with regard to lilla and her grandfather busied himself with filling the wellhole with the fine sand prepared for the purpose taking care to have lowered at stated intervals quantities of the store of dynamite so as to be ready for the final explosion  he had under his immediate supervision a corps of workmen and was assisted by sir nathaniel who had come over for the purpose and all were now staying at lesser hill  mr salton too showed much interest in the job and was constantly coming in and out nothing escaping his observation  since her marriage to adam and their coming to stay at doom tower mimi had been fettered by fear of the horrible monster at dianas grove  but now she dreaded it no longer  she accepted the fact of its assuming at will the form of lady arabella  she had still to tax and upbraid her for her part in the unhappiness which had been wrought on lilla and for her share in causing her death  one evening when mimi entered her own room she went to the window and threw an eager look round the whole circle of sight  a single glance satisfied her that the white worm in propria persona was not visible so she sat down in the windowseat and enjoyed the pleasure of a full view from which she had been so long cut off  the maid who waited on her had told her that mr salton had not yet returned home so she felt free to enjoy the luxury of peace and quiet  as she looked out of the window she saw something thin and white move along the avenue  she thought she recognised the figure of lady arabella and instinctively drew back behind the curtain  when she had ascertained by peeping out several times that the lady had not seen her she watched more carefully all her instinctive hatred flooding back at the sight of her  lady arabella was moving swiftly and stealthily looking back and around her at intervals as if she feared to be followed  this gave mimi an idea that she was up to no good so she determined to seize the occasion for watching her in more detail  hastily putting on a dark cloak and hat she ran downstairs and out into the avenue  lady arabella had moved but the sheen of her white dress was still to be seen among the young oaks around the gateway  keeping in shadow mimi followed taking care not to come so close as to awake the others suspicion and watched her quarry pass along the road in the direction of castra regis  she followed on steadily through the gloom of the trees depending on the glint of the white dress to keep her right  the wood began to thicken and presently when the road widened and the trees grew farther back she lost sight of any indication of her whereabouts  under the present conditions it was impossible for her to do any more so after waiting for a while still hidden in the shadow to see if she could catch another glimpse of the white frock she determined to go on slowly towards castra regis and trust to the chapter of accidents to pick up the trail again she went on slowly taking advantage of every obstacle and shadow to keep herself concealed  at last she entered on the grounds of the castle at a spot from which the windows of the turret were dimly visible without having seen again any sign of lady arabella  meanwhile during most of the time that mimi salton had been moving warily along in the gloom she was in reality being followed by lady arabella who had caught sight of her leaving the house and had never again lost touch with her  it was a case of the hunter being hunted  for a time mimis many turnings with the natural obstacles that were perpetually intervening caused lady arabella some trouble but when she was close to castra regis there was no more possibility of concealment and the strange double following went swiftly on  when she saw mimi close to the hall door of castra regis and ascending the steps she followed  when mimi entered the dark hall and felt her way up the staircase still as she believed following lady arabella the latter kept on her way  when they reached the lobby of the turret rooms mimi believed that the object of her search was ahead of her  edgar caswall sat in the gloom of the great room occasionally stirred to curiosity when the drifting clouds allowed a little light to fall from the stormswept sky  but nothing really interested him now  since he had heard of lillas death the gloom of his remorse emphasised by mimis upbraiding had made more hopeless his cruel selfish saturnine nature  he heard no sound for his normal faculties seemed benumbed  mimi when she came to the door which stood ajar gave a light tap  so light was it that it did not reach caswalls ears  then taking her courage in both hands she boldly pushed the door and entered  as she did so her heart sank for now she was face to face with a difficulty which had not in her state of mental perturbation occurred to her     chapter xxviion the turret roof   the storm which was coming was already making itself manifest not only in the wide scope of nature but in the hearts and natures of human beings  electrical disturbance in the sky and the air is reproduced in animals of all kinds and particularly in the highest type of them allthe most receptivethe most electrical  so it was with edgar caswall despite his selfish nature and coldness of blood  so it was with mimi salton despite her unselfish unchanging devotion for those she loved  so it was even with lady arabella who under the instincts of a primeval serpent carried the evervarying wishes and customs of womanhood which is always oldand always new  edgar after he had turned his eyes on mimi resumed his apathetic position and sullen silence  mimi quietly took a seat a little way apart whence she could look on the progress of the coming storm and study its appearance throughout the whole visible circle of the neighbourhood  she was in brighter and better spirits than she had been for many days past  lady arabella tried to efface herself behind the now open door  without the clouds grew thicker and blacker as the stormcentre came closer  as yet the forces from whose linking the lightning springs were held apart and the silence of nature proclaimed the calm before the storm  caswall felt the effect of the gathering electric force  a sort of wild exultation grew upon him such as he had sometimes felt just before the breaking of a tropical storm  as he became conscious of this he raised his head and caught sight of mimi  he was in the grip of an emotion greater than himself in the mood in which he was he felt the need upon him of doing some desperate deed  he was now absolutely reckless and as mimi was associated with him in the memory which drove him on he wished that she too should be engaged in this enterprise  he had no knowledge of the proximity of lady arabella and thought that he was far removed from all he knew and whose interests he sharedalone with the wild elements which were being lashed to fury and with the woman who had struggled with him and vanquished him and on whom he would shower the full measure of his hate  the fact was that edgar caswall was if not mad close to the borderline  madness in its first stagemonomaniais a lack of proportion  so long as this is general it is not always noticeable for the uninspired onlooker is without the necessary means of comparison  but in monomania the errant faculty protrudes itself in a way that may not be denied  it puts aside obscures or takes the place of something elsejust as the head of a pin placed before the centre of the iris will block out the whole scope of vision  the most usual form of monomania has commonly the same beginning as that from which edgar caswall sufferedan overlarge idea of selfimportance  alienists who study the matter exactly probably know more of human vanity and its effects than do ordinary men  caswalls mental disturbance was not hard to identify  every asylum is full of such casesmen and women who naturally selfish and egotistical so appraise to themselves their own importance that every other circumstance in life becomes subservient to it  the disease supplies in itself the material for selfmagnification when the decadence attacks a nature naturally proud and selfish and vain and lacking both the aptitude and habit of selfrestraint the development of the disease is more swift and ranges to farther limits it is such persons who become inbued with the idea that they have the attributes of the almightyeven that they themselves are the almighty  mimi had a suspicionor rather perhaps an intuitionof the true state of things when she heard him speak and at the same time noticed the abnormal flush on his face and his rolling eyes  there was a certain want of fixedness of purpose which she had certainly not noticed beforea quick spasmodic utterance which belongs rather to the insane than to those of intellectual equilibrium  she was a little frightened not only by his thoughts but by his staccato way of expressing them  caswall moved to the door leading to the turret stair by which the roof was reached and spoke in a peremptory way whose tone alone made her feel defiant  come  i want you  she instinctively drew backshe was not accustomed to such words more especially to such a tone  her answer was indicative of a new contest  why should i go  what for  he did not at once replyanother indication of his overwhelming egotism she repeated her questions habit reasserted itself and he spoke without thinking the words which were in his heart  i want you if you will be so good to come with me to the turret roof i am much interested in certain experiments with the kite which would be if not a pleasure at least a novel experience to you  you would see something not easily seen otherwise  i will come she answered simply edgar moved in the direction of the stair she following close behind him  she did not like to be left alone at such a height in such a place in the darkness with a storm about to break  of himself she had no fear all that had been seemed to have passed away with her two victories over him in the struggle of wills  moreover the more recent apprehensionthat of his madnesshad also ceased  in the conversation of the last few minutes he seemed so rational so clear so unaggressive that she no longer saw reason for doubt  so satisfied was she that even when he put out a hand to guide her to the steep narrow stairway she took it without thought in the most conventional way  lady arabella crouching in the lobby behind the door heard every word that had been said and formed her own opinion of it  it seemed evident to her that there had been some rapprochement between the two who had so lately been hostile to each other and that made her furiously angry mimi was interfering with her plans  she had made certain of her capture of edgar caswall and she could not tolerate even the lightest and most contemptuous fancy on his part which might divert him from the main issue  when she became aware that he wished mimi to come with him to the roof and that she had acquiesced her rage got beyond bounds  she became oblivious to any danger there might be in a visit to such an exposed place at such a time and to all lesser considerations and made up her mind to forestall them  she stealthily and noiselessly crept through the wicket and ascending the stair stepped out on the roof  it was bitterly cold for the fierce gusts of the storm which swept round the turret drove in through every unimpeded way whistling at the sharp corners and singing round the trembling flagstaff  the kitestring and the wire which controlled the runners made a concourse of weird sounds which somehow perhaps from the violence which surrounded them acting on their length resolved themselves into some kind of harmonya fitting accompaniment to the tragedy which seemed about to begin  mimis heart beat heavily  just before leaving the turretchamber she had a shock which she could not shake off  the lights of the room had momentarily revealed to her as they passed out edgars face concentrated as it was whenever he intended to use his mesmeric power now the black eyebrows made a thick line across his face under which his eyes shone and glittered ominously  mimi recognised the danger and assumed the defiant attitude that had twice already served her so well she had a fear that the circumstances and the place were against her and she wanted to be forearmed  the sky was now somewhat lighter than it had been  either there was lightning afar off whose reflections were carried by the rolling clouds or else the gathered force though not yet breaking into lightning had an incipient power of light  it seemed to affect both the man and the woman  edgar seemed altogether under its influence  his spirits were boisterous his mind exalted  he was now at his worst madder than he had been earlier in the night  mimi trying to keep as far from him as possible moved across the stone floor of the turret roof and found a niche which concealed her  it was not far from lady arabellas place of hiding  edgar left thus alone on the centre of the turret roof found himself altogether his own master in a way which tended to increase his madness he knew that mimi was close at hand though he had lost sight of her  he spoke loudly and the sound of his own voice though it was carried from him on the sweeping wind as fast as the words were spoken seemed to exalt him still more  even the raging of the elements round him appeared to add to his exaltation  to him it seemed that these manifestations were obedient to his own will  he had reached the sublime of his madness he was now in his own mind actually the almighty and whatever might happen would be the direct carrying out of his own commands  as he could not see mimi nor fix whereabout she was he shouted loudly  come to me  you shall see now what you are despising what you are warring against  all that you see is minethe darkness as well as the light  i tell you that i am greater than any other who is or was or shall be  when the master of evil took christ up on a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the earth he was doing what he thought no other could do  he was wronghe forgot me  i shall send you light up to the very ramparts of heaven  a light so great that it shall dissipate those black clouds that are rushing up and piling around us look  look  at the very touch of my hand that light springs into being and mounts upand upand up  he made his way whilst he was speaking to the corner of the turret whence flew the giant kite and from which the runners ascended  mimi looked on appalled and afraid to speak lest she should precipitate some calamity  within the niche lady arabella cowered in a paroxysm of fear  edgar took up a small wooden box through a hole in which the wire of the runner ran  this evidently set some machinery in motion for a sound as of whirring came  from one side of the box floated what looked like a piece of stiff ribbon which snapped and crackled as the wind took it for a few seconds mimi saw it as it rushed along the sagging line to the kite  when close to it there was a loud crack and a sudden light appeared to issue from every chink in the box  then a quick flame flashed along the snapping ribbon which glowed with an intense lighta light so great that the whole of the countryside around stood out against the background of black driving clouds  for a few seconds the light remained then suddenly disappeared in the blackness around  it was simply a magnesium light which had been fired by the mechanism within the box and carried up to the kite  edgar was in a state of tumultuous excitement shouting and yelling at the top of his voice and dancing about like a lunatic  this was more than lady arabellas curious dual nature could standthe ghoulish element in her rose triumphant and she abandoned all idea of marriage with edgar caswall gloating fiendishly over the thought of revenge  she must lure him to the white worms holebut how  she glanced around and quickly made up her mind  the mans whole thoughts were absorbed by his wonderful kite which he was showing off in order to fascinate her imaginary rival mimi  on the instant she glided through the darkness to the wheel whereon the string of the kite was wound  with deft fingers she unshipped this took it with her reeling out the wire as she went thus keeping in a way in touch with the kite  then she glided swiftly to the wicket through which she passed locking the gate behind her as she went  down the turret stair she ran quickly letting the wire run from the wheel which she carried carefully and passing out of the hall door hurried down the avenue with all her speed  she soon reached her own gate ran down the avenue and with her key opened the iron door leading to the wellhole  she felt well satisfied with herself  all her plans were maturing or had already matured  the master of castra regis was within her grasp the woman whose interference she had feared lilla watford was dead truly all was well and she felt that she might pause a while and rest she tore off her clothes with feverish fingers and in full enjoyment of her natural freedom stretched her slim figure in animal delight  then she lay down on the sofato await her victim  edgar caswalls life blood would more than satisfy her for some time to come     chapter xxviiithe breaking of the storm   when lady arabella had crept away in her usual noiseless fashion the two others remained for a while in their places on the turret roof caswall because he had nothing to say mimi because she had much to say and wished to put her thoughts in order  for quite a whilewhich seemed interminablesilence reigned between them  at last mimi made a beginningshe had made up her mind how to act  mr caswall she said loudly so as to make sure of being heard through the blustering of the wind and the perpetual cracking of the electricity  caswall said something in reply but his words were carried away on the storm  however one of her objects was effected she knew now exactly whereabout on the roof he was  so she moved close to the spot before she spoke again raising her voice almost to a shout  the wicket is shut  please to open it  i cant get out  as she spoke she was quietly fingering a revolver which adam had given to her in case of emergency and which now lay in her breast  she felt that she was caged like a rat in a trap but did not mean to be taken at a disadvantage whatever happened  caswall also felt trapped and all the brute in him rose to the emergency  in a voice which was raucous and brutalmuch like that which is heard when a wife is being beaten by her husband in a slumhe hissed out his syllables cutting through the roaring of the storm  you came of your own accordwithout permission or even asking it  now you can stay or go as you choose  but you must manage it for yourself ill have nothing to do with it  her answer was spoken with dangerous suavity  i am going  blame yourself if you do not like the time and manner of it  i daresay adammy husbandwill have a word to say to you about it  let him say and be damned to him and to you too  ill show you a light  you shant be able to say that you could not see what you were doing  as he spoke he was lighting another piece of the magnesium ribbon which made a blinding glare in which everything was plainly discernible down to the smallest detail  this exactly suited mimi  she took accurate note of the wicket and its fastening before the glare had died away  she took her revolver out and fired into the lock which was shivered on the instant the pieces flying round in all directions but happily without causing hurt to anyone  then she pushed the wicket open and ran down the narrow stair and so to the hall door  opening this also she ran down the avenue never lessening her speed till she stood outside the door of lesser hill  the door was opened at once on her ringing  is mr adam salton in she asked  he has just come in a few minutes ago  he has gone up to the study replied a servant  she ran upstairs at once and joined him  he seemed relieved when he saw her but scrutinised her face keenly  he saw that she had been in some concern so led her over to the sofa in the window and sat down beside her  now dear tell me all about it he said  she rushed breathlessly through all the details of her adventure on the turret roof  adam listened attentively helping her all he could and not embarrassing her by any questioning  his thoughtful silence was a great help to her for it allowed her to collect and organise her thoughts  i must go and see caswall tomorrow to hear what he has to say on the subject  but dear for my sake dont have any quarrel with mr caswall  i have had too much trial and pain lately to wish it increased by any anxiety regarding you  you shall not dearif i can help itplease god he said solemnly and he kissed her  then in order to keep her interested so that she might forget the fears and anxieties that had disturbed her he began to talk over the details of her adventure making shrewd comments which attracted and held her attention  presently inter alia he said  thats a dangerous game caswall is up to  it seems to me that that young manthough he doesnt appear to know itis riding for a fall  how dear  i dont understand  kite flying on a night like this from a place like the tower of castra regis is to say the least of it dangerous  it is not merely courting death or other accident from lightning but it is bringing the lightning into where he lives  every cloud that is blowing up hereand they all make for the highest pointis bound to develop into a flash of lightning  that kite is up in the air and is bound to attract the lightning  its cord makes a road for it on which to travel to earth when it does come it will strike the top of the tower with a weight a hundred times greater than a whole park of artillery and will knock castra regis into pieces  where it will go after that no one can tell if there should be any metal by which it can travel such will not only point the road but be the road itself  would it be dangerous to be out in the open air when such a thing is taking place she asked  no little woman  it would be the safest possible placeso long as one was not in the line of the electric current  then do let us go outside  i dont want to run into any foolish dangeror far more to ask you to do so  but surely if the open is safest that is the place for us  without another word she put on again the cloak she had thrown off and a small tightfitting cap  adam too put on his cap and after seeing that his revolver was all right gave her his hand and they left the house together  i think the best thing we can do will be to go round all the places which are mixed up in this affair  all right dear i am ready  but if you dont mind we might go first to mercy  i am anxious about grandfather and we might see thatas yet at all eventsnothing has happened there  so they went on the highhung road along the top of the brow  the wind here was of great force and made a strange booming noise as it swept high overhead though not the sound of cracking and tearing as it passed through the woods of high slender trees which grew on either side of the road  mimi could hardly keep her feet  she was not afraid but the force to which she was opposed gave her a good excuse to hold on to her husband extra tight  at mercy there was no one upat least all the lights were out  but to mimi accustomed to the nightly routine of the house there were manifest signs that all was well except in the little room on the first floor where the blinds were down  mimi could not bear to look at that to think of it  adam understood her pain for he had been keenly interested in poor lilla  he bent over and kissed her and then took her hand and held it hard  thus they passed on together returning to the high road towards castra regis  at the gate of castra regis they were extra careful  when drawing near adam stumbled upon the wire that lady arabella had left trailing on the ground  adam drew his breath at this and spoke in a low earnest whisper  i dont want to frighten you mimi dear but wherever that wire is there is danger  danger  how  that is the track where the lightning will go at any moment even now whilst we are speaking and searching a fearful force may be loosed upon us  run on dear you know the way to where the avenue joins the highroad  if you see any sign of the wire keep away from it for gods sake  i shall join you at the gateway  are you going to follow that wire alone  yes dear  one is sufficient for that work  i shall not lose a moment till i am with you  adam when i came with you into the open my main wish was that we should be together if anything serious happened  you wouldnt deny me that right would you dear  no dear not that or any right  thank god that my wife has such a wish  come we will go together  we are in the hands of god  if he wishes we shall be together at the end whenever or wherever that may be  they picked up the trail of the wire on the steps and followed it down the avenue taking care not to touch it with their feet  it was easy enough to follow for the wire if not bright was selfcoloured and showed clearly  they followed it out of the gateway and into the avenue of dianas grove  here a new gravity clouded adams face though mimi saw no cause for fresh concern  this was easily enough explained  adam knew of the explosive works in progress regarding the wellhole but the matter had been kept from his wife  as they stood near the house adam asked mimi to return to the road ostensibly to watch the course of the wire telling her that there might be a branch wire leading somewhere else  she was to search the undergrowth and if she found it was to warn him by the australian native cooee  whilst they were standing together there came a blinding flash of lightning which lit up for several seconds the whole area of earth and sky  it was only the first note of the celestial prelude for it was followed in quick succession by numerous flashes whilst the crash and roll of thunder seemed continuous  adam appalled drew his wife to him and held her close  as far as he could estimate by the interval between lightning and thunderclap the heart of the storm was still some distance off so he felt no present concern for their safety  still it was apparent that the course of the storm was moving swiftly in their direction  the lightning flashes came faster and faster and closer together the thunderroll was almost continuous not stopping for a momenta new crash beginning before the old one had ceased  adam kept looking up in the direction where the kite strained and struggled at its detaining cord but of course the dull evening light prevented any distinct scrutiny  at length there came a flash so appallingly bright that in its glare nature seemed to be standing still  so long did it last that there was time to distinguish its configuration  it seemed like a mighty tree inverted pendent from the sky  the whole country around within the angle of vision was lit up till it seemed to glow  then a broad ribbon of fire seemed to drop on to the tower of castra regis just as the thunder crashed  by the glare adam could see the tower shake and tremble and finally fall to pieces like a house of cards  the passing of the lightning left the sky again dark but a blue flame fell downward from the tower and with inconceivable rapidity running along the ground in the direction of dianas grove reached the dark silent house which in the instant burst into flame at a hundred different points  at the same moment there rose from the house a rending crashing sound of woodwork broken or thrown about mixed with a quick scream so appalling that adam stout of heart as he undoubtedly was felt his blood turn into ice  instinctively despite the danger and their consciousness of it husband and wife took hands and listened trembling  something was going on close to them mysterious terrible deadly  the shrieks continued though less sharp in sound as though muffled  in the midst of them was a terrific explosion seemingly from deep in the earth  the flames from castra regis and from dianas grove made all around almost as light as day and now that the lightning had ceased to flash their eyes unblinded were able to judge both perspective and detail the heat of the burning house caused the iron doors to warp and collapse seemingly of their own accord they fell open and exposed the interior the saltons could now look through to the room beyond where the well hole yawned a deep narrow circular chasm  from this the agonised shrieks were rising growing ever more terrible with each second that passed  but it was not only the heartrending sound that almost paralysed poor mimi with terror  what she saw was sufficient to fill her with evil dreams for the remainder of her life  the whole place looked as if a sea of blood had been beating against it  each of the explosions from below had thrown out from the wellhole as if it had been the mouth of a cannon a mass of fine sand mixed with blood and a horrible repulsive slime in which were great red masses of rent and torn flesh and fat  as the explosions kept on more and more of this repulsive mass was shot up the great bulk of it falling back again  many of the awful fragments were of something which had lately been alive  they quivered and trembled and writhed as though they were still in torment a supposition to which the unending scream gave a horrible credence  at moments some mountainous mass of flesh surged up through the narrow orifice as though forced by a measureless power through an opening infinitely smaller than itself  some of these fragments were partially covered with white skin as of a human being and othersthe largest and most numerouswith scaled skin as of a gigantic lizard or serpent  once in a sort of lull or pause the seething contents of the hole rose after the manner of a bubbling spring and adam saw part of the thin form of lady arabella forced up to the top amid a mass of blood and slime and what looked as if it had been the entrails of a monster torn into shreds  several times some masses of enormous bulk were forced up through the wellhole with inconceivable violence and suddenly expanding as they came into larger space disclosed sections of the white worm which adam and sir nathaniel had seen looking over the trees with its enormous eyes of emeraldgreen flickering like great lamps in a gale  at last the explosive power which was not yet exhausted evidently reached the main store of dynamite which had been lowered into the worm hole  the result was appalling  the ground for far around quivered and opened in long deep chasms whose edges shook and fell in throwing up clouds of sand which fell back and hissed amongst the rising water  the heavily built house shook to its foundations  great stones were thrown up as from a volcano some of them great masses of hard stone squared and grooved with implements wrought by human hands breaking up and splitting in mid air as though riven by some infernal power  trees near the houseand therefore presumably in some way above the hole which sent up clouds of dust and steam and fine sand mingled and which carried an appalling stench which sickened the spectatorswere torn up by the roots and hurled into the air  by now flames were bursting violently from all over the ruins so dangerously that adam caught up his wife in his arms and ran with her from the proximity of the flames  then almost as quickly as it had begun the whole cataclysm ceased though a deepdown rumbling continued intermittently for some time  then silence brooded over allsilence so complete that it seemed in itself a sentient thingsilence which seemed like incarnate darkness and conveyed the same idea to all who came within its radius  to the young people who had suffered the long horror of that awful night it brought reliefrelief from the presence or the fear of all that was horriblerelief which seemed perfected when the red rays of sunrise shot up over the far eastern sea bringing a promise of a new order of things with the coming day        his bed saw little of adam salton for the remainder of that night  he and mimi walked hand in hand in the brightening dawn round by the brow to castra regis and on to lesser hill  they did so deliberately in an attempt to think as little as possible of the terrible experiences of the night  the morning was bright and cheerful as a morning sometimes is after a devastating storm  the clouds of which there were plenty in evidence brought no lingering idea of gloom  all nature was bright and joyous being in striking contrast to the scenes of wreck and devastation the effects of obliterating fire and lasting ruin  the only evidence of the once stately pile of castra regis and its inhabitants was a shapeless huddle of shattered architecture dimly seen as the keen breeze swept aside the cloud of acrid smoke which marked the site of the once lordly castle  as for dianas grove they looked in vain for a sign which had a suggestion of permanence  the oak trees of the grove were still to be seensome of thememerging from a haze of smoke the great trunks solid and erect as ever but the larger branches broken and twisted and rent with bark stripped and chipped and the smaller branches broken and dishevelled looking from the constant stress and threshing of the storm  of the house as such there was even at the short distance from which they looked no trace  adam resolutely turned his back on the devastation and hurried on  mimi was not only upset and shocked in many ways but she was physically dog tired and falling asleep on her feet adam took her to her room and made her undress and get into bed taking care that the room was well lighted both by sunshine and lamps  the only obstruction was from a silk curtain drawn across the window to keep out the glare  he sat beside her holding her hand well knowing that the comfort of his presence was the best restorative for her  he stayed with her till sleep had overmastered her wearied body  then he went softly away  he found his uncle and sir nathaniel in the study having an early cup of tea amplified to the dimensions of a possible breakfast  adam explained that he had not told his wife that he was going over the horrible places again lest it should frighten her for the rest and sleep in ignorance would help her and make a gap of peacefulness between the horrors  sir nathaniel agreed  we know my boy he said that the unfortunate lady arabella is dead and that the foul carcase of the worm has been torn to piecespray god that its evil soul will never more escape from the nethermost hell  they visited dianas grove first not only because it was nearer but also because it was the place where most description was required and adam felt that he could tell his story best on the spot  the absolute destruction of the place and everything in it seen in the broad daylight was almost inconceivable  to sir nathaniel it was as a story of horror full and complete  but to adam it was as it were only on the fringes he knew what was still to be seen when his friends had got over the knowledge of externals  as yet they had only seen the outside of the houseor rather where the outside of the house once had been  the great horror lay within  however ageand the experience of agecounts  a strange almost elemental change in the aspect had taken place in the time which had elapsed since the dawn  it would almost seem as if nature herself had tried to obliterate the evil signs of what had occurred true the utter ruin of the house was made even more manifest in the searching daylight but the more appalling destruction which lay beneath was not visible  the rent torn and dislocated stonework looked worse than before the upheaved foundations the piledup fragments of masonry the fissures in the torn earthall were at the worst  the worms hole was still evident a round fissure seemingly leading down into the very bowels of the earth  but all the horrid mass of blood and slime of torn evilsmelling flesh and the sickening remnants of violent death were gone  either some of the later explosions had thrown up from the deep quantities of water which though foul and corrupt itself had still some cleansing power left or else the writhing mass which stirred from far below had helped to drag down and obliterate the items of horror  a grey dust partly of fine sand partly of the waste of the falling ruin covered everything and though ghastly itself helped to mask something still worse  after a few minutes of watching it became apparent to the three men that the turmoil far below had not yet ceased  at short irregular intervals the hellbroth in the hole seemed as if boiling up  it rose and fell again and turned over showing in fresh form much of the nauseous detail which had been visible earlier  the worst parts were the great masses of the flesh of the monstrous worm in all its red and sickening aspect such fragments had been bad enough before but now they were infinitely worse  corruption comes with startling rapidity to beings whose destruction has been due wholly or in part to lightningthe whole mass seemed to have become all at once corrupt  the whole surface of the fragments once alive was covered with insects worms and vermin of all kinds  the sight was horrible enough but with the awful smell added was simply unbearable  the worms hole appeared to breathe forth death in its most repulsive forms  the friends with one impulse moved to the top of the brow where a fresh breeze from the sea was blowing up  at the top of the brow beneath them as they looked down they saw a shining mass of white which looked strangely out of place amongst such wreckage as they had been viewing  it appeared so strange that adam suggested trying to find a way down so that they might see it more closely  we need not go down i know what it is sir nathaniel said  the explosions of last night have blown off the outside of the cliffsthat which we see is the vast bed of china clay through which the worm originally found its way down to its lair  i can catch the glint of the water of the deep quags far down below  well her ladyship didnt deserve such a funeralor such a monument        the horrors of the last few hours had played such havoc with mimis nerves that a change of scene was imperativeif a permanent breakdown was to be avoided  i think said old mr salton it is quite time you young people departed for that honeymoon of yours  there was a twinkle in his eye as he spoke  mimis soft shy glance at her stalwart husband was sufficient answer
