31669500	mosses from an old manse                        by nathaniel hawthorne                          earths holocaust    once upon a timebut whether in the time past or time to come is a matter of little or no momentthis wide world had become so overburdened with an accumulation of wornout trumpery that the inhabitants determined to rid themselves of it by a general bonfire the site fixed upon at the representation of the insurance companies and as being as central a spot as any other on the globe was one of the broadest prairies of the west where no human habitation would be endangered by the flames and where a vast assemblage of spectators might commodiously admire the show  having a taste for sights of this kind and imagining likewise that the illumination of the bonfire might reveal some profundity of moral truth heretofore hidden in mist or darkness i made it convenient to journey thither and be present  at my arrival although the heap of condemned rubbish was as yet comparatively small the torch had already been applied  amid that boundless plain in the dusk of the evening like a far off star alone in the firmament there was merely visible one tremulous gleam whence none could have anticipated so fierce a blaze as was destined to ensue  with every moment however there came foottravellers women holding up their aprons men on horseback wheelbarrows lumbering baggagewagons and other vehicles great and small and from far and near laden with articles that were judged fit for nothing but to be burned  what materials have been used to kindle the flame inquired i of a bystander for i was desirous of knowing the whole process of the affair from beginning to end  the person whom i addressed was a grave man fifty years old or thereabout who had evidently come thither as a lookeron  he struck me immediately as having weighed for himself the true value of life and its circumstances and therefore as feeling little personal interest in whatever judgment the world might form of them before answering my question he looked me in the face by the kindling light of the fire  o some very dry combustibles replied he and extremely suitable to the purposeno other in fact than yesterdays newspapers last months magazines and last years withered leaves  here now comes some antiquated trash that will take fire like a handful of shavings  as he spoke some roughlooking men advanced to the verge of the bonfire and threw in as it appeared all the rubbish of the heralds officethe blazonry of coat armor the crests and devices of illustrious families pedigrees that extended back like lines of light into the mist of the dark ages together with stars garters and embroidered collars each of which as paltry a bawble as it might appear to the uninstructed eye had once possessed vast significance and was still in truth reckoned among the most precious of moral or material facts by the worshippers of the gorgeous past  mingled with this confused heap which was tossed into the flames by armfuls at once were innumerable badges of knighthood comprising those of all the european sovereignties and napoleons decoration of the legion of honor the ribbons of which were entangled with those of the ancient order of st louis  there too were the medals of our own society of cincinnati by means of which as history tells us an order of hereditary knights came near being constituted out of the king quellers of the revolution  and besides there were the patents of nobility of german counts and barons spanish grandees and english peers from the wormeaten instruments signed by william the conqueror down to the brannew parchment of the latest lord who has received his honors from the fair hand of victoria  at sight of the dense volumes of smoke mingled with vivid jets of flame that gushed and eddied forth from this immense pile of earthly distinctions the multitude of plebeian spectators set up a joyous shout and clapped their hands with an emphasis that made the welkin echo  that was their moment of triumph achieved after long ages over creatures of the same clay and the same spiritual infirmities who had dared to assume the privileges due only to heavens better workmanship  but now there rushed towards the blazing heap a grayhaired man of stately presence wearing a coat from the breast of which a star or other badge of rank seemed to have been forcibly wrenched away he had not the tokens of intellectual power in his face but still there was the demeanor the habitual and almost native dignity of one who had been born to the idea of his own social superiority and had never felt it questioned till that moment  people cried he gazing at the ruin of what was dearest to his eyes with grief and wonder but nevertheless with a degree of statelinesspeople what have you done  this fire is consuming all that marked your advance from barbarism or that could have prevented your relapse thither  we the men of the privileged orders were those who kept alive from age to age the old chivalrous spirit the gentle and generous thought the higher the purer the more refined and delicate life  with the nobles too you cast off the poet the painter the sculptorall the beautiful arts for we were their patrons and created the atmosphere in which they flourish  in abolishing the majestic distinctions of rank society loses not only its grace but its steadfastness  more he would doubtless have spoken but here there arose an outcry sportive contemptuous and indignant that altogether drowned the appeal of the fallen nobleman insomuch that casting one look of despair at his own halfburned pedigree he shrunk back into the crowd glad to shelter himself under his newfound insignificance  let him thank his stars that we have not flung him into the same fire shouted a rude figure spurning the embers with his foot and henceforth let no man dare to show a piece of musty parchment as his warrant for lording it over his fellows  if he have strength of arm well and good it is one species of superiority  if he have wit wisdom courage force of character let these attributes do for him what they may but from this day forward no mortal must hope for place and consideration by reckoning up the mouldy bones of his ancestors that nonsense is done away  and in good time remarked the grave observer by my side in a low voice however if no worse nonsense comes in its place but at all events this species of nonsense has fairly lived out its life  there was little space to muse or moralize over the embers of this timehonored rubbish for before it was half burned out there came another multitude from beyond the sea bearing the purple robes of royalty and the crowns globes and sceptres of emperors and kings all these had been condemned as useless bawbles playthings at best fit only for the infancy of the world or rods to govern and chastise it in its nonage but with which universal manhood at its fullgrown stature could no longer brook to be insulted  into such contempt had these regal insignia now fallen that the gilded crown and tinselled robes of the player king from drury lane theatre had been thrown in among the rest doubtless as a mockery of his brother monarchs on the great stage of the world  it was a strange sight to discern the crown jewels of england glowing and flashing in the midst of the fire  some of them had been delivered down from the time of the saxon princes others were purchased with vast revenues or perchance ravished from the dead brows of the native potentates of hindustan and the whole now blazed with a dazzling lustre as if a star had fallen in that spot and been shattered into fragments the splendor of the ruined monarchy had no reflection save in those inestimable precious stones  but enough on this subject  it were but tedious to describe how the emperor of austrias mantle was converted to tinder and how the posts and pillars of the french throne became a heap of coals which it was impossible to distinguish from those of any other wood  let me add however that i noticed one of the exiled poles stirring up the bonfire with the czar of russias sceptre which he afterwards flung into the flames  the smell of singed garments is quite intolerable here observed my new acquaintance as the breeze enveloped us in the smoke of a royal wardrobe  let us get to windward and see what they are doing on the other side of the bonfire  we accordingly passed around and were just in time to witness the arrival of a vast procession of washingtoniansas the votaries of temperance call themselves nowadaysaccompanied by thousands of the irish disciples of father mathew with that great apostle at their head  they brought a rich contribution to the bonfire being nothing less than all the hogsheads and barrels of liquor in the world which they rolled before them across the prairie  now my children cried father mathew when they reached the verge of the fire one shove more and the work is done  and now let us stand off and see satan deal with his own liquor  accordingly having placed their wooden vessels within reach of the flames the procession stood off at a safe distance and soon beheld them burst into a blaze that reached the clouds and threatened to set the sky itself on fire  and well it might for here was the whole worlds stock of spirituous liquors which instead of kindling a frenzied light in the eyes of individual topers as of yore soared upwards with a bewildering gleam that startled all mankind  it was the aggregate of that fierce fire which would otherwise have scorched the hearts of millions meantime numberless bottles of precious wine were flung into the blaze which lapped up the contents as if it loved them and grew like other drunkards the merrier and fiercer for what it quaffed  never again will the insatiable thirst of the firefiend be so pampered  here were the treasures of famous bon vivantsliquors that had been tossed on ocean and mellowed in the sun and hoarded long in the recesses of the earththe pale the gold the ruddy juice of whatever vineyards were most delicatethe entire vintage of tokayall mingling in one stream with the vile fluids of the common pot house and contributing to heighten the selfsame blaze  and while it rose in a gigantic spire that seemed to wave against the arch of the firmament and combine itself with the light of stars the multitude gave a shout as if the broad earth were exulting in its deliverance from the curse of ages  but the joy was not universal  many deemed that human life would be gloomier than ever when that brief illumination should sink down while the reformers were at work i overheard muttered expostulations from several respectable gentlemen with red noses and wearing gouty shoes and a ragged worthy whose face looked like a hearth where the fire is burned out now expressed his discontent more openly and boldly  what is this world good for said the last toper now that we can never be jolly any more  what is to comfort the poor man in sorrow and perplexity  how is he to keep his heart warm against the cold winds of this cheerless earth  and what do you propose to give him in exchange for the solace that you take away  how are old friends to sit together by the fireside without a cheerful glass between them  a plague upon your reformation  it is a sad world a cold world a selfish world a low world not worth an honest fellows living in now that good fellowship is gone forever  this harangue excited great mirth among the bystanders but preposterous as was the sentiment i could not help commiserating the forlorn condition of the last toper whose boon companions had dwindled away from his side leaving the poor fellow without a soul to countenance him in sipping his liquor nor indeed any liquor to sip  not that this was quite the true state of the case for i had observed him at a critical moment filch a bottle of fourthproof brandy that fell beside the bonfire and hide it in his pocket  the spirituous and fermented liquors being thus disposed of the zeal of the reformers next induced them to replenish the fire with all the boxes of tea and bags of coffee in the world  and now came the planters of virginia bringing their crops of tobacco  these being cast upon the heap of inutility aggregated it to the size of a mountain and incensed the atmosphere with such potent fragrance that methought we should never draw pure breath again  the present sacrifice seemed to startle the lovers of the weed more than any that they had hitherto witnessed  well theyve put my pipe out said an old gentleman flinging it into the flames in a pet  what is this world coming to everything rich and racyall the spice of lifeis to be condemned as useless now that they have kindled the bonfire if these nonsensical reformers would fling themselves into it all would be well enough  be patient responded a stanch conservative it will come to that in the end  they will first fling us in and finally themselves  from the general and systematic measures of reform i now turn to consider the individual contributions to this memorable bonfire in many instances these were of a very amusing character  one poor fellow threw in his empty purse and another a bundle of counterfeit or insolvable banknotes  fashionable ladies threw in their last seasons bonnets together with heaps of ribbons yellow lace and much other halfworn milliners ware all of which proved even more evanescent in the fire than it had been in the fashion  a multitude of lovers of both sexesdiscarded maids or bachelors and couples mutually weary of one anothertossed in bundles of perfumed letters and enamored sonnets a hack politician being deprived of bread by the loss of office threw in his teeth which happened to be false ones  the rev sydney smithhaving voyaged across the atlantic for that sole purposecame up to the bonfire with a bitter grin and threw in certain repudiated bonds fortified though they were with the broad seal of a sovereign state  a little boy of five years old in the premature manliness of the present epoch threw in his playthings a college graduate his diploma an apothecary ruined by the spread of homeopathy his whole stock of drugs and medicines a physician his library a parson his old sermons and a fine gentleman of the old school his code of manners which he had formerly written down for the benefit of the next generation  a widow resolving on a second marriage slyly threw in her dead husbands miniature  a young man jilted by his mistress would willingly have flung his own desperate heart into the flames but could find no means to wrench it out of his bosom  an american author whose works were neglected by the public threw his pen and paper into the bonfire and betook himself to some less discouraging occupation  it somewhat startled me to overhear a number of ladies highly respectable in appearance proposing to fling their gowns and petticoats into the flames and assume the garb together with the manners duties offices and responsibilities of the opposite sex  what favor was accorded to this scheme i am unable to say my attention being suddenly drawn to a poor deceived and halfdelirious girl who exclaiming that she was the most worthless thing alive or dead attempted to cast herself into the fire amid all that wrecked and broken trumpery of the world  a good man however ran to her rescue  patience my poor girl  said he as he drew her back from the fierce embrace of the destroying angel  be patient and abide heavens will  so long as you possess a living soul all may be restored to its first freshness  these things of matter and creations of human fantasy are fit for nothing but to be burned when once they have had their day but your day is eternity  yes said the wretched girl whose frenzy seemed now to have sunk down into deep despondency yes and the sunshine is blotted out of it  it was now rumored among the spectators that all the weapons and munitions of war were to be thrown into the bonfire with the exception of the worlds stock of gunpowder which as the safest mode of disposing of it had already been drowned in the sea this intelligence seemed to awaken great diversity of opinion the hopeful philanthropist esteemed it a token that the millennium was already come while persons of another stamp in whose view mankind was a breed of bulldogs prophesied that all the old stoutness fervor nobleness generosity and magnanimity of the race would disappearthese qualities as they affirmed requiring blood for their nourishment  they comforted themselves however in the belief that the proposed abolition of war was impracticable for any length of time together  be that as it might numberless great guns whose thunder had long been the voice of battlethe artillery of the armada the battering trains of marlborough and the adverse cannon of napoleon and wellingtonwere trundled into the midst of the fire  by the continual addition of dry combustibles it had now waxed so intense that neither brass nor iron could withstand it it was wonderful to behold how these terrible instruments of slaughter melted away like playthings of wax  then the armies of the earth wheeled around the mighty furnace with their military music playing triumphant marchesand flung in their muskets and swords  the standardbearers likewise cast one look upward at their banners all tattered with shotholes and inscribed with the names of victorious fields and giving them a last flourish on the breeze they lowered them into the flame which snatched them upward in its rush towards the clouds  this ceremony being over the world was left without a single weapon in its hands except possibly a few old kings arms and rusty swords and other trophies of the revolution in some of our state armories  and now the drums were beaten and the trumpets brayed all together as a prelude to the proclamation of universal and eternal peace and the announcement that glory was no longer to be won by blood but that it would henceforth be the contention of the human race to work out the greatest mutual good and that beneficence in the future annals of the earth would claim the praise of valor the blessed tidings were accordingly promulgated and caused infinite rejoicings among those who had stood aghast at the horror and absurdity of war  but i saw a grim smile pass over the seared visage of a stately old commanderby his warworn figure and rich military dress he might have been one of napoleons famous marshalswho with the rest of the worlds soldiery had just flung away the sword that had been familiar to his right hand for half a century  ay ay grumbled he  let them proclaim what they please but in the end we shall find that all this foolery has only made more work for the armorers and cannonfounders  why sir exclaimed i in astonishment do you imagine that the human race will ever so far return on the steps of its past madness as to weld another sword or cast another cannon  there will be no need observed with a sneer one who neither felt benevolence nor had faith in it  when cain wished to slay his brother he was at no loss for a weapon  we shall see replied the veteran commander  if i am mistaken so much the better but in my opinion without pretending to philosophize about the matter the necessity of war lies far deeper than these honest gentlemen suppose  what is there a field for all the petty disputes of individuals and shall there be no great law court for the settlement of national difficulties  the battlefield is the only court where such suits can be tried  you forget general rejoined i that in this advanced stage of civilization reason and philanthropy combined will constitute just such a tribunal as is requisite  ah i had forgotten that indeed said the old warrior as he limped away  the fire was now to be replenished with materials that had hitherto been considered of even greater importance to the wellbeing of society than the warlike munitions which we had already seen consumed  a body of reformers had travelled all over the earth in quest of the machinery by which the different nations were accustomed to inflict the punishment of death  a shudder passed through the multitude as these ghastly emblems were dragged forward even the flames seemed at first to shrink away displaying the shape and murderous contrivance of each in a full blaze of light which of itself was sufficient to convince mankind of the long and deadly error of human law  those old implements of cruelty those horrible monsters of mechanism those inventions which it seemed to demand something worse than mans natural heart to contrive and which had lurked in the dusky nooks of ancient prisons the subject of terrorstricken legendwere now brought forth to view  headsmens axes with the rust of noble and royal blood upon them and a vast collection of halters that had choked the breath of plebeian victims were thrown in together  a shout greeted the arrival of the guillotine which was thrust forward on the same wheels that had borne it from one to another of the bloodstained streets of paris but the loudest roar of applause went up telling the distant sky of the triumph of the earths redemption when the gallows made its appearance  an illlooking fellow however rushed forward and putting himself in the path of the reformers bellowed hoarsely and fought with brute fury to stay their progress  it was little matter of surprise perhaps that the executioner should thus do his best to vindicate and uphold the machinery by which he himself had his livelihood and worthier individuals their death but it deserved special note that men of a far different sphereeven of that consecrated class in whose guardianship the world is apt to trust its benevolencewere found to take the hangmans view of the question  stay my brethren cried one of them  you are misled by a false philanthropy you know not what you do  the gallows is a heavenordained instrument  bear it back then reverently and set it up in its old place else the world will fall to speedy ruin and desolation  onward onward shouted a leader in the reform  into the flames with the accursed instrument of mans bloody policy  how can human law inculcate benevolence and love while it persists in setting up the gallows as its chief symbol  one heave more good friends and the world will be redeemed from its greatest error  a thousand hands that nevertheless loathed the touch now lent their assistance and thrust the ominous burden far far into the centre of the raging furnace  there its fatal and abhorred image was beheld first black then a red coal then ashes  that was well done exclaimed i  yes it was well done replied but with less enthusiasm than i expected the thoughtful observer who was still at my sidewell done if the world be good enough for the measure  death however is an idea that cannot easily be dispensed with in any condition between the primal innocence and that other purity and perfection which perchance we are destined to attain after travelling round the full circle but at all events it is well that the experiment should now be tried  too cold too cold impatiently exclaimed the young and ardent leader in this triumph  let the heart have its voice here as well as the intellect  and as for ripeness and as for progress let mankind always do the highest kindest noblest thing that at any given period it has attained the perception of and surely that thing cannot be wrong nor wrongly timed  i know not whether it were the excitement of the scene or whether the good people around the bonfire were really growing more enlightened every instant but they now proceeded to measures in the full length of which i was hardly prepared to keep them company for instance some threw their marriage certificates into the flames and declared themselves candidates for a higher holier and more comprehensive union than that which had subsisted from the birth of time under the form of the connubial tie  others hastened to the vaults of banks and to the coffers of the richall of which were opened to the first comer on this fated occasionand brought entire bales of papermoney to enliven the blaze and tons of coin to be melted down by its intensity  henceforth they said universal benevolence uncoined and exhaustless was to be the golden currency of the world  at this intelligence the bankers and speculators in the stocks grew pale and a pickpocket who had reaped a rich harvest among the crowd fell down in a deadly fainting fit  a few men of business burned their daybooks and ledgers the notes and obligations of their creditors and all other evidences of debts due to themselves while perhaps a somewhat larger number satisfied their zeal for reform with the sacrifice of any uncomfortable recollection of their own indebtment  there was then a cry that the period was arrived when the titledeeds of landed property should be given to the flames and the whole soil of the earth revert to the public from whom it had been wrongfully abstracted and most unequally distributed among individuals another party demanded that all written constitutions set forms of government legislative acts statutebooks and everything else on which human invention had endeavored to stamp its arbitrary laws should at once be destroyed leaving the consummated world as free as the man first created  whether any ultimate action was taken with regard to these propositions is beyond my knowledge for just then some matters were in progress that concerned my sympathies more nearly  see see  what heaps of books and pamphlets cried a fellow who did not seem to be a lover of literature  now we shall have a glorious blaze  thats just the thing said a modern philosopher  now we shall get rid of the weight of dead mens thought which has hitherto pressed so heavily on the living intellect that it has been incompetent to any effectual selfexertion  well done my lads into the fire with them  now you are enlightening the world indeed  but what is to become of the trade cried a frantic bookseller  o by all means let them accompany their merchandise coolly observed an author  it will be a noble funeralpile  the truth was that the human race had now reached a stage of progress so far beyond what the wisest and wittiest men of former ages had ever dreamed of that it would have been a manifest absurdity to allow the earth to be any longer encumbered with their poor achievements in the literary line  accordingly a thorough and searching investigation had swept the booksellers shops hawkers stands public and private libraries and even the little bookshelf by the country fireside and had brought the worlds entire mass of printed paper bound or in sheets to swell the already mountain bulk of our illustrious bonfire thick heavy folios containing the labors of lexicographers commentators and encyclopedists were flung in and falling among the embers with a leaden thump smouldered away to ashes like rotten wood  the small richly gilt french tomes of the last age with the hundred volumes of voltaire among them went off in a brilliant shower of sparkles and little jets of flame while the current literature of the same nation burned red and blue and threw an infernal light over the visages of the spectators converting them all to the aspect of partycolored fiends  a collection of german stories emitted a scent of brimstone  the english standard authors made excellent fuel generally exhibiting the properties of sound oak logs  miltons works in particular sent up a powerful blaze gradually reddening into a coal which promised to endure longer than almost any other material of the pile  from shakespeare there gushed a flame of such marvellous splendor that men shaded their eyes as against the suns meridian glory nor even when the works of his own elucidators were flung upon him did he cease to flash forth a dazzling radiance from beneath the ponderous heap  it is my belief that he is still blazing as fervidly as ever  could a poet but light a lamp at that glorious flame remarked i he might then consume the midnight oil to some good purpose  that is the very thing which modern poets have been too apt to do or at least to attempt answered a critic  the chief benefit to be expected from this conflagration of past literature undoubtedly is that writers will henceforth be compelled to light their lamps at the sun or stars  if they can reach so high said i but that task requires a giant who may afterwards distribute the light among inferior men it is not every one that can steal the fire from heaven like prometheus but when once he had done the deed a thousand hearths were kindled by it  it amazed me much to observe how indefinite was the proportion between the physical mass of any given author and the property of brilliant and longcontinued combustion  for instance there was not a quarto volume of the last centurynor indeed of the presentthat could compete in that particular with a childs little giltcovered book containing mother gooses melodies the life and death of tom thumb outlasted the biography of marlborough  an epic indeed a dozen of them was converted to white ashes before the single sheet of an old ballad was half consumed  in more than one case too when volumes of applauded verse proved incapable of anything better than a stifling smoke an unregarded ditty of some nameless bardperchance in the corner of a newspapersoared up among the stars with a flame as brilliant as their own  speaking of the properties of flame methought shelleys poetry emitted a purer light than almost any other productions of his day contrasting beautifully with the fitful and lurid gleams and gushes of black vapor that flashed and eddied from the volumes of lord byron  as for tom moore some of his songs diffused an odor like a burning pastil  i felt particular interest in watching the combustion of american authors and scrupulously noted by my watch the precise number of moments that changed most of them from shabbily printed books to indistinguishable ashes  it would be invidious however if not perilous to betray these awful secrets so that i shall content myself with observing that it was not invariably the writer most frequent in the public mouth that made the most splendid appearance in the bonfire  i especially remember that a great deal of excellent inflammability was exhibited in a thin volume of poems by ellery channing although to speak the truth there were certain portions that hissed and spluttered in a very disagreeable fashion a curious phenomenon occurred in reference to several writers native as well as foreign  their books though of highly respectable figure instead of bursting into a blaze or even smouldering out their substance in smoke suddenly melted away in a manner that proved them to be ice  if it be no lack of modesty to mention my own works it must here be confessed that i looked for them with fatherly interest but in vain  too probably they were changed to vapor by the first action of the heat at best i can only hope that in their quiet way they contributed a glimmering spark or two to the splendor of the evening  alas and woe is me thus bemoaned himself a heavylooking gentleman in green spectacles  the world is utterly ruined and there is nothing to live for any longer  the business of my life is snatched from me  not a volume to be had for love or money  this remarked the sedate observer beside me is a bookwormone of those men who are born to gnaw dead thoughts  his clothes you see are covered with the dust of libraries  he has no inward fountain of ideas and in good earnest now that the old stock is abolished i do not see what is to become of the poor fellow  have you no word of comfort for him  my dear sir said i to the desperate bookworm is not nature better than a book  is not the human heart deeper than any system of philosophy  is not life replete with more instruction than past observers have found it possible to write down in maxims  be of good cheer  the great book of time is still spread wide open before us and if we read it aright it will be to us a volume of eternal truth  o my books my books my precious printed books reiterated the forlorn bookworm  my only reality was a bound volume and now they will not leave me even a shadowy pamphlet  in fact the last remnant of the literature of all the ages was now descending upon the blazing heap in the shape of a cloud of pamphlets from the press of the new world  these likewise were consumed in the twinkling of an eye leaving the earth for the first time since the days of cadmus free from the plague of lettersan enviable field for the authors of the next generation  well and does anything remain to be done inquired i somewhat anxiously  unless we set fire to the earth itself and then leap boldly off into infinite space i know not that we can carry reform to any farther point  you are vastly mistaken my good friend said the observer believe me the fire will not be allowed to settle down without the addition of fuel that will startle many persons who have lent a willing hand thus far  nevertheless there appeared to be a relaxation of effort for a little time during which probably the leaders of the movement were considering what should be done next  in the interval a philosopher threw his theory into the flamesa sacrifice which by those who knew how to estimate it was pronounced the most remarkable that had yet been made  the combustion however was by no means brilliant  some indefatigable people scorning to take a moments ease now employed themselves in collecting all the withered leaves and fallen boughs of the forest and thereby recruited the bonfire to a greater height than ever  but this was mere byplay  here comes the fresh fuel that i spoke of said my companion  to my astonishment the persons who now advanced into the vacant space around the mountain fire bore surplices and other priestly garments mitres crosiers and a confusion of popish and protestant emblems with which it seemed their purpose to consummate the great act of faith  crosses from the spires of old cathedrals were cast upon the heap with as little remorse as if the reverence of centuries passing in long array beneath the lofty towers had not looked up to them as the holiest of symbols  the font in which infants were consecrated to god the sacramental vessels whence piety received the hallowed draught were given to the same destruction perhaps it most nearly touched my heart to see among these devoted relics fragments of the humble communiontables and undecorated pulpits which i recognized as having been torn from the meetinghouses of new england  those simple edifices might have been permitted to retain all of sacred embellishment that their puritan founders had bestowed even though the mighty structure of st  peters had sent its spoils to the fire of this terrible sacrifice  yet i felt that these were but the externals of religion and might most safely be relinquished by spirits that best knew their deep significance  all is well said i cheerfully  the woodpaths shall be the aisles of our cathedral the firmament itself shall be its ceiling what needs an earthly roof between the deity and his worshippers our faith can well afford to lose all the drapery that even the holiest men have thrown around it and be only the more sublime in its simplicity  true said my companion but will they pause here  the doubt implied in his question was well founded  in the general destruction of books already described a holy volume that stood apart from the catalogue of human literature and yet in one sense was at its head had been spared  but the titan of innovationangel or fiend double in his nature and capable of deeds befitting both charactersat first shaking down only the old and rotten shapes of things had now as it appeared laid his terrible hand upon the main pillars which supported the whole edifice of our moral and spiritual state  the inhabitants of the earth had grown too enlightened to define their faith within a form of words or to limit the spiritual by any analogy to our material existence truths which the heavens trembled at were now but a fable of the worlds infancy  therefore as the final sacrifice of human error what else remained to be thrown upon the embers of that awful pile except the book which though a celestial revelation to past ages was but a voice from a lower sphere as regarded the present race of man  it was done  upon the blazing heap of falsehood and wornout truththings that the earth had never needed or had ceased to need or had grown childishly weary offell the ponderous church bible the great old volume that had lain so long on the cushion of the pulpit and whence the pastors solemn voice had given holy utterance on so many a sabbath day  there likewise fell the family bible which the longburied patriarch had read to his childrenin prosperity or sorrow by the fireside and in the summer shade of treesand had bequeathed downward as the heirloom of generations there fell the bosom bible the little volume that had been the souls friend of some sorely tried child of dust who thence took courage whether his trial were for life or death steadfastly confronting both in the strong assurance of immortality  all these were flung into the fierce and riotous blaze and then a mighty wind came roaring across the plain with a desolate howl as if it were the angry lamentation of the earth for the loss of heavens sunshine and it shook the gigantic pyramid of flame and scattered the cinders of halfconsumed abominations around upon the spectators  this is terrible said i feeling that my check grew pale and seeing a like change in the visages about me  be of good courage yet answered the man with whom i had so often spoken  he continued to gaze steadily at the spectacle with a singular calmness as if it concerned him merely as an observer be of good courage nor yet exult too much for there is far less both of good and evil in the effect of this bonfire than the world might be willing to believe  how can that be exclaimed i impatiently  has it not consumed everything  has it not swallowed up or melted down every human or divine appendage of our mortal state that had substance enough to be acted on by fire  will there be anything left us tomorrow morning better or worse than a heap of embers and ashes  assuredly there will said my grave friend  come hither tomorrow morning or whenever the combustible portion of the pile shall be quite burned out and you will find among the ashes everything really valuable that you have seen cast into the flames trust me the world of tomorrow will again enrich itself with the gold and diamonds which have been cast off by the world of today not a truth is destroyed nor buried so deep among the ashes but it will be raked up at last  this was a strange assurance  yet i felt inclined to credit it the more especially as i beheld among the wallowing flames a copy of the holy scriptures the pages of which instead of being blackened into tinder only assumed a more dazzling whiteness as the fingermarks of human imperfection were purified away certain marginal notes and commentaries it is true yielded to the intensity of the fiery test but without detriment to the smallest syllable that had flamed from the pen of inspiration  yes there is the proof of what you say answered i turning to the observer but if only what is evil can feel the action of the fire then surely the conflagration has been of inestimable utility  yet if i understand aright you intimate a doubt whether the worlds expectation of benefit would be realized by it  listen to the talk of these worthies said he pointing to a group in front of the blazing pile possibly they may teach you something useful without intending it  the persons whom he indicated consisted of that brutal and most earthy figure who had stood forth so furiously in defence of the gallowsthe hangman in shorttogether with the last thief and the last murderer all three of whom were clustered about the last toper  the latter was liberally passing the brandy bottle which he had rescued from the general destruction of wines and spirits  this little convivial party seemed at the lowest pitch of despondency as considering that the purified world must needs be utterly unlike the sphere that they had hitherto known and therefore but a strange and desolate abode for gentlemen of their kidney  the best counsel for all of us is remarked the hangman that as soon as we have finished the last drop of liquor i help you my three friends to a comfortable end upon the nearest tree and then hang myself on the same bough  this is no world for us any longer  poh poh my good fellows said a darkcomplexioned personage who now joined the grouphis complexion was indeed fearfully dark and his eyes glowed with a redder light than that of the bonfire be not so cast down my dear friends you shall see good days yet there is one thing that these wiseacres have forgotten to throw into the fire and without which all the rest of the conflagration is just nothing at all yes though they had burned the earth itself to a cinder  and what may that be eagerly demanded the last murderer  what but the human heart itself said the darkvisaged stranger with a portentous grin  and unless they hit upon some method of purifying that foul cavern forth from it will reissue all the shapes of wrong and miserythe same old shapes or worse oneswhich they have taken such a vast deal of trouble to consume to ashes  i have stood by this livelong night and laughed in my sleeve at the whole business  o take my word for it it will be the old world yet  this brief conversation supplied me with a theme for lengthened thought  how sad a truth if true it were that mans agelong endeavor for perfection had served only to render him the mockery of the evil principle from the fatal circumstance of an error at the very root of the matter  the heart the heart there was the little yet boundless sphere wherein existed the original wrong of which the crime and misery of this outward world were merely types  purify that inward sphere and the many shapes of evil that haunt the outward and which now seem almost our only realities will turn to shadowy phantoms and vanish of their own accord but if we go no deeper than the intellect and strive with merely that feeble instrument to discern and rectify what is wrong our whole accomplishment will be a dream so unsubstantial that it matters little whether the bonfire which i have so faithfully described were what we choose to call a real event and a flame that would scorch the finger or only a phosphoric radiance and a parable of my own brain
