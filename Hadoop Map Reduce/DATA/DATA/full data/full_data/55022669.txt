want very much to set down my thoughts and my experiences of life i want to do so now that i have come to middle age and now that my attitudes are all defined and my personal drama worked out i feel that the toil of writing and reconsideration may help to clear and fix many things that remain a little uncertain in my thoughts because they have never been fully stated and i want to discover any lurking inconsistencies and unsuspected gaps and i have a story i have lived through things that have searched me i want to tell that story as well as i can while i am still a clearheaded and active man and while many details that may presently become blurred and altered are still rawly fresh in my mind and to one person in particular do i wish to think i am writing and that is to you my only son i want to write my story not indeed to the child you are now but to the man you are going to be you are half my blood and temperamentally altogether mine a day will come when you will realize this and want to know how life has gone with me and then it may be altogether too late for me to answer your enquiries i may have become inaccessible as old people are sometimes inaccessible and so i think of leaving this book for youat any rate i shall write it as if i meant to leave it for you afterwards i can consider whether i will indeed leave it  the idea of writing such a book as this came to me first as i sat by the dead body of your grandfathermy father it was because i wanted so greatly such a book from him that i am now writing this he died you must know only a few months ago and i went to his house to bury him and settle all his affairs  at one time he had been my greatest friend he had never indeed talked to me about himself or his youth but he had always showed an extraordinary sympathy and helpfulness for me in all the confusion and perplexities into which i fell this did not last to the end of his life i was the child of his middle years and suddenly in a year or less the curtains of age and infirmity fell between us there came an illness an operation and he rose from it ailing suffering dwarfed and altogether changed of all the dark shadows upon life i think that change through illness and organic decay in the thoughts and spirits of those who are dear and close to us is the most evil and distressing and inexplicable suddenly he was a changeling a being querulous and pitiful needing indulgence and sacrifices  in a little while a new state of affairs was established i ceased to consider him as a man to whom one told things of whom one could expect help or advice we all ceased to consider him at all in that way we humored him put pleasant things before him concealed whatever was disagreeable a poor old man he was indeed in those concluding years weakly rebellious against the firm kindliness of my cousin his housekeeper and nurse he who had once been so alert was now at times astonishingly apathetic at times an impish malice i had never known in him before gleamed in little acts and speeches his talk rambled and for the most part was concerned with small longforgotten contentions it was indistinct and difficult to follow because of a recent loss of teeth and he craved for brandy to restore even for a moment the sense of strength and wellbeing that ebbed and ebbed away from him so that when i came to look at his dead face at last it was with something like amazement i perceived him grave and beautifulmore grave and beautiful than he had been even in the fullness of life  all the estrangement of the final years was wiped in an instant from my mind as i looked upon his face there came back a rush of memories of kind strong patient human aspects of his fatherhood and i remembered as every son must remembereven you my dear will some day remember because it is in the very nature of sonshipinsubordinations struggles ingratitudes great benefits taken unthankfully slights and disregards it was not remorse i felt nor repentance but a tremendous regret that so things had happened and that life should be so why is it i thought that when a son has come to manhood he cannot take his father for a friend i had a curious sense of unprecedented communion as i stood beside him now i felt that he understood my thoughts his face seemed to answer with an expression of still and sympathetic patience  i was sensible of amazing gaps we had never talked together of love never of religion  all sorts of things that a man of twentyeight would not dream of hiding from a coeval he had hidden from me for some days i had to remain in his house i had to go through his papers handle all those intimate personal things that accumulate around a human being year by yearletters yellowing scraps of newspaper tokens relics kept accidental vestiges significant litter i learnt many things i had never dreamt of at times i doubted whether i was not prying whether i ought not to risk the loss of those necessary legal facts i sought and burn these papers unread there were love letters and many such touching things  my memories of him did not change because of these new lights but they became wonderfully illuminated i realized him as a young man i began to see him as a boy i found a little halfbound botanical book with stenciltinted illustrations a goodconduct prize my father had won at his preparatory school a rolledup sheet of paper carbonized and dry and brittle revealed itself as a piece of specimen writing stiff with boyish effort decorated in ambitious and faltering flourishes and still betraying the pencil rulings his rubber should have erased already your writing is better than that and i found a daguerreotype portrait of him in knickerbockers against a photographers stile his face then was not unlike yours i stood with that in my hand at the little bureau in his bedroom and looked at his dead face  the flatly painted portrait of his father my grandfather hanging there in the stillness above the coffin looking out on the world he had left with steady humorous blue eyes that followed one about the roomthat too was revivified touched into reality and participation by this and that became a living presence at a conference of lives things of his were there also in that lifes accumulation  there we were three strattons together and down in the diningroom were steel engravings to take us back two generations further and we had all lived full lives suffered attempted signified i had a glimpse of the long successions of mankind what a huge inaccessible lumberroom of thought and experience we amounted to i thought how much we are how little we transmit each one of us was but a variation an experiment upon the stratton theme all that i had now under my hands was but the merest hints and vestiges moving and surprising indeed but casual and fragmentary of those obliterated repetitions man is a creature becoming articulate and why should those men have left so much of the tale untoldto be lost and forgotten why must we all repeat things done and come again very bitterly to wisdom our fathers have achieved before us my grandfather there should have left me something better than the still enigma of his watching face all my life so far has gone in learning very painfully what many men have learnt before me i have spent the greater part of forty years in finding a sort of purpose for the uncertain and declining decades that remain is it not time the generations drew together and helped one another cannot we begin now to make a better use of the experiences of life so that our sons may not waste themselves so much cannot we gather into books that men may read in an hour or so the gist of these confused and multitudinous realities of the individual career surely the time is coming for that when a new private literature will exist and fathers and mothers behind their rôles of rulers protectors and supporters will prepare frank and intimate records of their thought and their feeling told as one tells things to equals without authority or reserves or discretions so that they being dead their children may rediscover them as contemporaries and friends  that desire for selfexpression is indeed already almost an instinct with many of us man is disposed to create a traditional wisdom for me this book i contemplate is a need i am just a year and a half from a bitter tragedy and the loss of a friend as dear as life to me it is very constantly in my mind she opened her mind to me as few people open their minds to anyone in a way little stephen she died for you and i am so placed that i have no one to talk to quite freely about her the one other person to whom i talk i cannot talk to about her it is strange seeing how we love and trust one another but so it is you will understand that the better as this story unfolds for eight long years before the crisis that culminated in her tragic death i never saw her yet quite apart from the shock and distresses of that time it has left me extraordinarily lonely and desolate  and there was a kind of dreadful splendor in that last act of hers which has taken a great hold upon my imagination it has interwoven with everything else in my mind it bears now upon every question i cannot get away from it while it is thus pent from utterance perhaps having written this to you i may never show it you or leave it for you to see but yet i must write it of all conceivable persons you when you have grown to manhood are the most likely to understand   § 2  you did not come to see your dead grandfather nor did you know very much about the funeral nowadays we do not bring the sweet egotisms the vivid beautiful personal intensities of childhood into the cold vast presence of death i would as soon my dear have sent your busy little limbs toiling up the matterhorn i have put by a photograph of my father for you as he lay in that last stillness of his that you will see at a properer time  your mother and i wore black only at his funeral and came back colored again into your colored world and in a very little while your interest in this event that had taken us away for a time turned to other more assimilable things but there happened a little incident that laid hold upon me you forgot it perhaps in a week or less but i shall never forget it and this incident it was that gathered up the fruits of those moments beside my fathers body and set me to write this book it had the effect of a little bright light held up against the vague dark immensities of thought and feeling that filled my mind because of my fathers death  now that i come to set it down i see that it is altogether trivial and i cannot explain how it is that it is to me so piercingly significant i had to whip you your respect for the admirable and patient mademoiselle potin the protectress and companion of your public expeditions did in some slight crisis suddenly fail you in the extreme publicity of kensington gardens in the presence of your two little sisters before a startled world you expressed an opinion of her in two languages and a loud voice that was not only very unjust but extremely offensive and improper it reflected upon her intelligence and goodness it impeached her personal appearance it was the kind of outcry no little gentleman should ever permit himself however deeply he may be aggrieved you then so far as i was able to disentangle the evidence assaulted her violently hurled a stone at her and fled her company you came home alone by a route chosen by yourself flushed and wrathful braving the dangers of kensington high street this after my stern and deliberate edict that upon pain of corporal punishment respect and obedience must be paid to mademoiselle potin the logic of the position was relentless  but where your behavior was remarkable where the affair begins to touch my imagination was that you yourself presently put the whole business before me alone in the schoolroom you seem to have come to some realization of the extraordinary dreadfulness of your behavior such moments happen in the lives of all small boys they happened to me times enough to my dead father to that grandfather of the portrait which is now in my study to his father and his and so on through long series of strattons back to inarticulate shockhaired little sinners slinking fearfully away from the awful wrath the bellowings and limitless violence of the hairy old man of the herd the bottom goes out of your heart then you are full of a conviction of sin so far you did but carry on the experience of the race but to ask audience of me to come and look me in the eye to say you wanted my advice on a pressing matter that i think marks almost a new phase in the long developing history of father and son and your account of the fracas struck me as quite reasonably frank and honest i didnt seem able you observed not to go on being badder and badder  we discussed the difficulties of our situation and you passed sentence upon yourself i saw to it that the outraged dignity of mademoiselle potin was mocked by no mere formality of infliction you did your best to be stoical i remember but at last you yelped and wept then justice being done you rearranged your costume the situation was a little difficult until you still sobbing and buttoningyou are really a shocking bad hand at buttonsand looking a very small tender ruffled rueful thing indeed strolled towards my study window the pear tree is out next door you remarked without a trace of animosity and sobbing as one might hiccough  i suppose there are moments in the lives of all grown men when they come near to weeping aloud in some secret place within myself i must have been a wild river of tears i answered however with the same admirable detachment from the smarting past that you had achieved that my study window was particularly adapted to the appreciation of our neighbors pear tree because of its height from the ground we fell into a conversation about blossom and the setting of fruit kneeling together upon my windowseat and looking up into the pear tree against the sky and then down through its black branches into the gardens all quickening with spring we were on so friendly a footing when presently mademoiselle potin returned and placed her dignity or her resignation in my hands that i doubt if she believed a word of all my assurances until the unmistakable confirmation of your evening bath then as i understood it she was extremely remorseful to you and indignant against my violence  but when i knelt with you little urchin upon my windowseat it came to me as a thing almost intolerably desirable that some day you should become my real and understanding friend i loved you profoundly i wanted to stretch forward into time and speak to you man myself to the man you are yet to be it seemed to me that between us there must needs be peculiar subtleties of sympathy and i remembered that by the time you were a man fully grown and emerging from the passionately tumultuous openings of manhood capable of forgiving me all my blundering parentage capable of perceiving all the justifying fine intention of my illconceived disciplines and misdirections i might be either an old man shriveling again to an inexplicable egotism or dead i saw myself as i had seen my fatherfirst enfeebled and then inaccessibly tranquil when presently you had gone from my study i went to my writingdesk and drew a paper pad towards me and sat thinking and making idle marks upon it with my pen i wanted to exceed the limits of those frozen silences that must come at last between us write a book that should lie in your world like a seed and at last as your own being ripened flower into living understanding by your side  this book which before had been only an idea for a book competing against many other ideas and the demands of that toilsome work for peace and understanding to which i have devoted the daily energies of my life had become i felt an imperative necessity between us   § 3  and then there happened one of those crises of dread and apprehension and pain that are like a ploughing of the heart it was brought home to me that you might die even before the first pages of this book of yours were written you became feverish complained of that queer pain you had felt twice before and for the third time you were ill with appendicitis your mother and i came and regarded your touzled head and flushed little face on the pillow as you slept uneasily and decided that we must take no more risks with you so soon as your temperature had fallen again we set about the business of an operation  we told each other that nowadays these operations were as safe as going to sleep in your bed but we knew better our own doctor had lost his son that we said was different but we knew well enough in our hearts that you were going very near to the edge of death nearer than you had ever been since first you came clucking into the world  the operation was done at home a capable faircomplexioned nurse took possession of us and my study because it has the best light was transfigured into an admirable operatingroom all its furnishings were sent away every cloth and curtain and the walls and floor were covered with white sterilized sheets the high little mechanical table they erected before the window seemed to me like an altar on which i had to offer up my son there were basins of disinfectants and towels conveniently about the operator came took out his array of scalpels and forceps and little sponges from the black bag he carried put them ready for his hand and then covered them from your sight with a white cloth and i brought you down in my arms wrapped in a blanket from your bedroom to the anæsthetist you were beautifully trustful and submissive and unafraid i stood by you until the chloroform had done its work and then left you there lest my presence should in the slightest degree embarrass the surgeon the anæsthetic had taken all the color out of your face and you looked pinched and shrunken and greenish and very small and pitiful i went into the drawingroom and stood there with your mother and made conversation i cannot recall what we said i think it was about the moorland to which we were going for your convalescence indeed we were but the ghosts of ourselves all our substance seemed listening listening to the little sounds that came to us from the study  then after long ages there was a going to and fro of feet a bump the opening of a door and our own doctor came into the room rubbing his hands together and doing nothing to conceal his profound relief admirable he said altogether successful i went up to you and saw a tumbled little person in the bed still heavily insensible and moaning slightly by the table were bloody towels and in a shallow glass tray was a small object like a damaged piece of earthworm not a bit too soon said the surgeon holding this up in his forceps for my inspection its on the very verge of perforation i affected a detached and scientific interest but the prevailing impression in my mind was that this was a fragment from very nearly the centre of your being  he took it away with him i know not whither perhaps it is now in spirits in a specimen jar an example to all medical students of what to avoid in an appendix perhaps it was stained and frozen and microtomized into transparent sections as they do such things and mounted on glass slips and distributed about the world for curious histologists to wreak their eyes upon for a time you lay uneasily still and then woke up to pain even then you got a fresh purchase on my heart it has always been our custom to discourage weeping and outcries and you did not forget your training i shant mind so much dadda you remarked to me if i may yelp so for a day by special concession you yelped and then the sting of those fresh wounds departed  within a fortnight so quickly does an aseptic wound heal up again you were running about in the sun and i had come back as one comes back to a thing forgotten to the first beginnings of this chapter on my desk but for a time i could not go on working at it because of the fear i had felt and it is only now in june in this house in france to which we have come for the summer with you more flagrantly healthy than i have ever known you before that my heart creeps out of its hole again and i can go on with my story     chapter the second  boyhood   § 1  i was a harbury boy as my father and grandfather were before me and as you are presently to be i went to harbury at the age of fourteen until then i was educated at home first by a governess and then by my fathers curate mr siddons who went from us to st philips in hampstead and succeeding marvellously there is now bishop of exminster my father became rector of burnmore when i was nine my mother had been dead four years and my second cousin jane stratton was already his housekeeper my father held the living until his resignation when i was nearly thirty so that all the most impressionable years of my life centre upon the burnmore rectory and the easy spaciousness of burnmore park my boyhood and adolescence alternated between the ivied redbrick and ancient traditions of harbury and afterwards christchurch and that still untroubled countryside  i was never a town dweller until i married and we took our present house in holland park i went into london at last as one goes into an arena it cramps me and wearies me and at times nearly overwhelms me but there it is that the life of men centres and my work lies but every summer we do as we have done this year and go to some house in the country near to forests or moorland or suchlike open and uncultivated country where one may have the refreshment of freedom among natural and unhurried things this year we are in a walled garden upon the seine about four miles above château galliard and with the forest reaching up to the paddock beyond the orchard close  you will understand better when i have told you my story why i saw burnmore for the last time when i was oneandtwenty and why my memories of it shine so crystalline clear i have a thousand vivid miniatures of it in my mind and all of them are beautiful to me so that i could quite easily write a whole book of landscapes from the park alone i can still recall quite vividly the warm beautysoaked sensation of going out into the morning sunshine of the park with my lunch in a little green swiss tin under my arm and the vast interminable day all before me the gigantic divinely unconditional day that only boyhood knows and the park so great and various that it was more than two hours going for me to reach its eastern fences i was only a little older then than you are now sometimes i went right up through the woods to the house to companion with philip and guy christian and their sisteri loved her then and one day i was to love her with all my heartbut in those boyish times i liked most to go alone  my memories of the park are all under blue sky and sunshine with just a thunderstorm or so on wet days and cold days i was kept to closer limits and it seems to me now rather an intellectual conviction than a positive memory that save for a few pineclad patches in the extreme southeast its soil was all thick clay that meant for me only beautiful green marshes a number of vividly interesting meres upon the course of its stream and a wealth of gigantic oaks the meres lay at various levels and the hand of lady ladislaw had assisted nature in their enrichment with lilies and water plants there were places of sedge and scented rush amidst which were sapphire mists of forgetmenot for long stretches skirmishing commandoes of yellow iris and wide wastes of floating waterlilies the gardens passed insensibly into the park and beyond the house were broad stretches of grass sunlit barred with the deepgreen shadows of great trees and animated with groups and lines of fallow deer near the house was an italianate garden with balustradings and statuary and a great wealth of roses and flowering shrubs  then there were bracken wildernesses in which the does lurked with the young fawns and a hollow shallow and wide with the turf greatly attacked by rabbits and exceptionally threadbare where a stricken oak lightningstripped spread out its ghastly arms above contorted rotting branches and the mysterious skeletons of i should think five several deer in the eveningtime the woods behind this place of bonesthey were woods of straightgrowing rather crowded trees and standing as it were a little aloofbecame even under the warmest sunset grey and coldand as if they waited  and in the distant corner where the sand was rose suddenly a steep little hill surmounted by a wild and splendid group of pines through which one looked across a vale of cornfields at an ancient town that became strange and magical as the sun went down so that i was held gazing at it and afterwards had to flee the twilight across the windy spaces and under the dim and darkling trees it is only now in the distant retrospect that i identify that faroff city of wonder and luminous mist with the commonplace little town through whose narrow streets we drove to the railway station but of course that is what it must have been  there are persons to be found mixed up in those childish memorieslady ladislaw tall and gracious in dresses of floating blue or grey or thin subtly folding flowering stuffs philip and his sister guy the old butler a multitude of fainter figures long become nameless and featureless they are far less vivid in my memory than the fine solitudes of the park itselfand the dreams i had there  i wonder if you dream as i dreamt i wonder whether indeed i dreamt as now i think i did have i in these latter years given form and substance and a name to things as vague in themselves as the urgencies of instinct did i really go into those woods and waving green places as one keeps a tryst expectant of a fellowship more free and delicate and delightful than any i knew did i know in those days of nymphs and dryads and fauns and all those happy soulless beings with which the desire of mans heart has animated the wilderness once certainly i crawled slowly through the tall bracken and at last lay still for an interminable while convinced that so i should see those shadows populous with fairies with green little people how patiently i lay but the stems creaked and stirred and my heart would keep on beating like a drum in my throat  it is incredible that once a furry whispering halfhuman creature with bright brown eyes came and for a time played with me near where the tall ferns foam in a broad torrent from between the big chestnuts down to the upper mere that must have been real dreaming and yet now with all my sanities and scepticisms i could half believe it real   § 2  you become reserved perhaps not exceptionally so but as all children become reserved already you understand that your heart is very preciously your own you keep it from me and everyone so much so so justifiably so that when by virtue of our kindred and all that we have in common i get sudden glimpses right into your depths there mixes with the swift spasm of love i feel a dreadlest you should catch me as it were spying into you and that one of us i know not which should feel ashamed  every child passes into this secret stage it closes in from its first frankness it carries off the growing jewel of its consciousness to hide from all mankind i think i can see why this should be so but i cannot tell why in so many cases no jewel is given back again at last alight ripened wonderful glowing with the deep fires of experience i think that is what ought to happen it is what does happen now with true poets and true artists someday i think it will be the life of all normal human souls but usually it does not seem to happen at all children pass out of a stageopen beautiful exquisitely simpleinto silences and discretions beneath an imposed and artificial life and they are lost out of the finished careful watchful restrained and limited man or woman no child emerges again  i remember very distinctly how i myself came by imperceptible increments of reservation to withdraw those early delicacies of judgments those original and personal standards and appreciations from sight and expression i can recall specific moments when i perceive now that my little childish figure stood as it were obstinately and with a sense of novelty in a doorway denying the self within  it was partly i think a simple instinct that drew that curtain of silences and concealments it was much more a realization that i had no power of lucidity to save the words and deeds i sought to make expressive from complete misunderstanding but most of all it was the perception that i was under training and compulsion for ends that were all askew and irrelevant to the trend of my imaginations the quality of my dreams there was around me something unfriendly to this inner worldsomething very ready to pass from unfriendliness to acute hostility and if indeed i succeeded in giving anything of my inner self to others it was only as people put it to give myself away  my nurses my governess my tutor my father the servants about me seemed all bent upon imposing an artificial personality upon me only in a very limited sense did they want me what they wanted was something that could be made out of me by extensive suppressions and additions they ignored the fact that i had been born with a shape of my own they were resolved i should be pressed into a mould and cast  it was not that they wanted outer conformity to certain needs and standardsthat i think would be a reasonable thing enough to demandbut they wanted me to subdue my most private thoughts to their ideals my nurses and my governesses would rate me for my very feelings would clamor for gratitude and reproach me bitterly for betraying that i did not at some particular momentlove  only yesterday i heard mademoiselle potin doing that very same thing to you it is that you do not care master steve it is that you do not care you do not want to care  they went too far in that invasion of my personal life but i perceive quite clearly the present need for most of the process of moulding and subjugation that children must undergo human society is a new thing upon the earth an invention of the last ten thousand years man is a creature as yet not freely and instinctively gregarious in his more primordial state he must have been an animal of very small groups and limited associations an animal rather selfcentred and fierce and he is still but imperfectly adapted either morally or physically to the wider social life his crowding interactions force upon him he still learns speech and computation and civility and all the devices of this artificially extended and continually broadening tribal life with an extreme reluctance he has to be shaped in the interests of the species i admit to the newer conditions the growing social order must be protected from the keen edge of his still savage individuality and he must be trained in his own interests to save himself from the destruction of impossible revolts but how clumsily is the thing done how we are caught and jammed and pressed and crippled into citizenship how excessive and crushing is the suppression and how inadequate  every child feels that even if every child does not clearly know it every child presently begins to hide itself from the confused tyrannies of the social process from the searching inspections and injunctions and interferences of parent and priest and teacher  i have got to be so we all say deep down in ourselves and more or less distinctly according to the lucidities of our minds but in my heart i am this  and in the outcome we all try to seem at least to be so while an ineffectual rebel struggles passionately like a beast caught in a trap for ends altogether more deep and dangerous for the rose and the star and the wildfirefor beauty and beautiful things these we all know in our darkly vital recesses are the real needs of life the obediences imposed upon us by our crude necessities and jostling proximities mere incidentals on our way to those profounder purposes  and when i write thus of our selves i mean our bodies quite as much as our imaginations the two sides of us are covered up alike and put alike into disguises and unnatural shapes we are taught and forced to hide them for the same reasons from a fear of ourselves and a fear of the people about us the sense of beauty the sense of ones body the freedom of thought and of desire and the wonder of life are all interwoven strands i remember that in the park of burnmore one great craving i had was to take off my clothes there altogether and bathe in a clear place among loosestrife and meadowsweet and afterwards lie wet and naked upon the soft green turf with the sun shining upon me but i thought also that that was a very wicked and shameful craving to have and i never dared give way to it   § 3  as i think of myself and all these glowing secrecies and hidden fancies within walking along beside old siddons and half listening to his instructive discourse i see myself as though i was an image of all humanity under tuition for the social life  i write old siddons for so he seemed to me then in truth he was scarcely a dozen years older than i and the other day when i exchanged salutations with his gaitered presence in the haymarket on his way i suppose to the athenæum it struck me that he it is who is now the younger man but at burnmore he was eighteen inches or more above my head and all the way of school and university beyond me full of the world they had fitted him for and eager to impart its doctrines he went along in his tweeds that were studiously untidy a norfolk jacket of one clericallygreyish stuff and trousers of another somewhat lighter pattern in thick boots the collar of his calling and a broadminded hat bearing his face heavenward as he talked and not so much aware of me as appreciating the things he was saying and sometimes he was manifestly talking to himself and airing his outlook he carried a walkingstick a manly homely knobby donnish walkingstick  he forced the pace a little for his legs were long and he had acquired the habit of strenuous pedestrianism at oxford with all the other things he obliged me to go at a kind of skipping trot and he preferred the high roads towards wickenham for our walks because they were flatter and there was little traffic upon them in those days before the motor car and we could keep abreast and go on talking uninterruptedly that is to say he could  what talk it was  of all the virtues that the young should have he spoke of courage and how splendid it was to accustom oneself not even to feel fear of truth and difficult cases when one might conceivably injure others by telling the truth and so perhaps perhaps qualify the rigor of ones integrity but how one should never hesitate to injure ones own self in that matter then in another phase he talked of beliefand the disagreeableness of dissenters but here i remember there was a discussion i have forgotten how i put the thing but in some boyish phrasing or other i must have thrown out the idea that thought is free and beliefs uncontrollable what of conformity if the truth was that you doubted not if you make an effort i remember him saying not if you make an effort i have had my struggles but if you say firmly to yourself the church teaches this if you dismiss mere carping and say that  but suppose you cant i must have urged  you can if you will he said with a note near enthusiasm i have been through all that i did it i dismissed doubts i wouldnt listen i felt this wont do all this leads nowhere  and he it was told me the classic story of that presumptuous schoolboy who went to his head master and declared himself an atheist there were no dialectics but a prompt horsewhipping in after life said mr siddons with unctuous gratification he came to recognize that thrashing as the very best thing that had ever happened to him the kindest thing  yes urged the obstinate rebel within me butthe truth that fearless insistence on the truth  i could however find nothing effective to say aloud and siddons prevailed over me that story made my blood boil it filled me with an anticipatory hatred of and hostility to head masters and at the same time there was something in it brutally truer to the conditions of human association than any argument  i do not remember the various steps by which i came to be discussing doubts so early in my life i could not have been much more than thirteen when that conversation occurred i am i think perhaps exceptionally unconscious about myself i find i can recall the sayings and even the gestures of other people far more distinctly than the things i said and did myself even my dreams and imaginings are more active than my positive thoughts and proceedings but i was no doubt very much stimulated by the literature lying about my home and the gleans and echoes of controversies that played like summer lightning round and about the horizons of my world over my head and after i had gone to bed my father and siddons were talking my cousin was listening with strained apprehensions there was a new spirit in my fathers sermons it was the storm of huxleydarwin controversies that had at last reached burnmore i was an intelligent little listener an eager reader of anything that came to hand mr siddons had a disposition to fight his battles over again in his monologues to me and after all at thirteen one isnt a baby the small boy of the lower classes used in those days to start life for himself long before then  how dramatic a phase it was in the history of the human mind when science suddenly came into the vicarages into all the studies and quiet places that had been the fastnesses of conviction and our ideals and denied with all the power of evidence it had been accumulating for so long and so obscurely and inaggressively with fossils and strata with embryology and comparative anatomy the doctrine of the historical fall and all the current scheme of orthodoxy that was based on that what a quickening shock it must have been in countless thousands of educated lives and my father after a toughly honest resistance was won over to darwinism the idea of evolution got hold of him the idea that life itself was intolerant of vain repetitions and he had had to consider his position in the church to him as to innumerable other honest middleaged and comfortable men darwinism came as a dreadful invitation to go out into the wilderness over my head and just out of range of my ears he was debating that issue with siddons as a foil and my cousin as a horrified antagonist slowly he was developing his conception of compromise and meanwhile he wasnt going out into the wilderness at all but punctually to and fro along the edge of the lawn by the bed of hollyhocks and through the little green door in the garden wall and across the corner of the churchyard to the vestry and the perennial services and sacraments of the church  but he never talked to me privately of religion he left that for my cousin and mr siddons to do or not to do as they felt disposed and in those silences of his i may have found another confirmation of my growing feeling that religion was from one point of view a thing somehow remote and unreal claiming unjustifiable interventions in the detailed conduct of my life and from another a peculiar concern of my fathers and mr siddons to which they wentthrough the vestry changing into strange garments on the way   § 4  i do not want to leave the impression which my last section may have conveyed that at the age of thirteen or thereabouts i walked about with mr siddons discussing doubt in a candid and intelligent manner and maintaining theological positions that particular conversation you must imagine with mr siddons somewhat monologuing addressing himself not only to my present self but with an unaccustomed valiance to my absent father what i may have said or not said whether i did indeed dispute or merely and by a kind of accident implied objections i have altogether forgotten long ago  a boy far more than a man is mentally a discontinuous being the drifting chaos of his mind makes its experimental beginnings at a hundred different points and in a hundred different spirits and directions here he flashes into a concrete realization here into a conviction unconsciously incompatible here is something originally conceived here something uncritically accepted i know that i criticized mr siddons quite acutely and disbelieved in him i know also that i accepted all sorts of suggestions from him quite unhesitatingly and that i did my utmost to satisfy his standards and realize his ideals of me  like an outer casing to that primordial creature of senses and dreams which came to the surface in the solitudes of the park was my siddonsesque self a highminded and clean and brave english boy conscientiously loyal to queen and country athletic and a good sportsman and acutely alive to good and bad form mr siddons made me aware of my clothed self as a visible object i surveyed my garmented being in mirrors and was trained to feel the awfulness of various other small boys who appeared transitorily in the smaller park when lady ladislaw extended her wide hospitality to certain benevolent london associations their illfitting clothing their undisciplined outcries their slouching their bad throwing and defective aspirates were made matters for detestation in my plastic mind those things i was assured placed them outside the pale of any common humanity  very unfortunate and all that said mr siddons and uncommonly good of lady ladislaw to have them down but dirty little cads stephen dirty little cads so dont go near em if you can help it  they played an indecent sort of cricket with coats instead of a wicket  mr siddons was very grave about games and the strict ritual and proper apparatus for games he believed that waterloo was won by the indirect influence of public school cricketdisregarding many other contributory factors we did not play very much but we practised sedulously at a net in the paddock with the gardener and the doctors almost grownup sons i thought missing a possible catch was an impropriety i studiously maintained the correct attitude alert and elastic while i was fielding moreover i had a shameful secret that i did not really know where a ball ought to pitch i wasnt clear about it and i did not dare to ask also until i was nearly thirteen i couldnt bowl overarm such is the enduring force of early suggestion my dear son that i feel a faint twinge of shame as i set this down for your humiliated eyes but so it was may you be more precocious  then i was induced to believe that i really liked hunting and killing things in the depths of my being i was a gentle and primitive savage towards animals i believed they were as subtle and wise as myself and full of a magic of their own but mr siddons nevertheless got me out into the south warren where i had often watched the rabbits setting their silly cockeared sentinels and lolloping out to feed about sundown and beguiled me into shooting a furry little fellowcreaturei can still see its eyelid quiver as it diedand carrying it home in triumph on another occasion i remember i was worked up into a ferocious excitement about the rats in the old barn we went ratting just as though i was tom brown or harry east or any other of the beastly little models of cant and cruelty we english boys were trained to imitate it was great sport it was a tremendous spree the distracted movements the scampering and pawing of the little pink forefeet of one squawking little fugitive that i hit with a stick and then beat to a shapeless bag of fur haunted my dreams for years and then i saw the bowels of another still living victim that had been torn open by one of the terriers and abruptly i fled out into the yard and was violently sick the best of the fun was over so far as i was concerned  my cousin saved me from the uttermost shame of my failure by saying that i had been excited too soon after my dinner  and also i collected stamps and birds eggs  mr siddons hypnotized me into believing that i really wanted these things he gave me an eggcabinet for a birthday present and told me exemplary stories of the wonderful collections other boys had made my own natural disposition to watch nests and establish heaven knows what friendly intimacy with the birdsperhaps i dreamt their mother might let me help to feed the young onesgave place to a feverish artful hunting a clutch and then detestable process the blowing of the egg of course we were very humane we never took the nest but just frightened off the sitting bird and grabbed a warm egg or so and the poor perforated rather damaged little eggshells accumulated in the drawers against the wishedfor but never actually realized day of glory when we should meet another collector who wouldnt havesomething that we had so far as it was for anything and not mere imbecile imitativeness it was for that  and writing thus of eggs reminds me that i got into a row with mr siddons for cruelty  i discovered there was the nest of a little tit in a hole between two stones in the rock bank that bordered the lawn i found it out when i was sitting on the garden seat near by learning latin irregular verbs i saw the minute preposterous round birds going and coming and i found something so absurdly amiable and confiding about themthey sat balancing and oscillating on a standard rose and cheeped at me to go and then dived nestward and gave away their secret out of sheer impatiencethat i could not bring myself to explore further and kept the matter altogether secret from the enthusiasm of mr siddons and in a few days there were no more eggs and i could hear the hungry little nestlings making the minutest of fairy hullabaloos the very finest spun silk of sound a tremendous traffic in victual began and i was the trusted friend of the family  then one morning i was filled with amazement and anguish there was a rock torn down and lying in the path a paw had gone up to that little warm place across the gravel shreds of the nest and a wisp or so of down were scattered i could imagine the brief horrors of that night attack i started off picking up stones as i went to murder that sandy devil the stable cat i got her oncealas that i am still glad to think of itand just missed her as she flashed a ginger streak through the gate into the paddock  now steve now came mr siddons voice behind me  how can one explain things of that sort to a man like siddons i took my lecture on the utter caddishness of wanton cruelty in a black rebellious silence the affair and my own emotions were not only far beyond my powers of explanation but far beyond my power of understanding just then my soul was in shapeless and aimless revolt against something greater and higher and deeper and darker than siddons and his reproaches were no more than the chattering of a squirrel while a storm uproots great trees i wanted to kill the cat i wanted to kill whatever had made that cat   § 5  mr siddons it was who first planted the conception of life as a career in my mind  in those talks that did so much towards shaping me into the likeness of a modest reserved sporting seemly clean and brave patriotic and decently slangy young englishman he was constantly reverting to that view of existence he spoke of failures and successes talked of statesmen and administrators peerages and westminster abbey nelson he said was once a clergymans son like you  england has been made by the sons of the clergy  he talked of the things that led to failure and the things that had made men prominent and famous  discursiveness ruins a man i remember him saying choose your goal and press to it  never do anything needlessly odd its a sort of impertinence to all the endless leaders of the past who created our traditions do not commit yourself hastily to opinions but once you have done so stick to them the world would far rather have a firm man wrong than a weak man hesitatingly right stick to them  one has to remember i recall him meditating far over my head with his face upturned that institutions are more important than views very often one adopts a view only to express ones belief in an institution men can do with almost all sorts of views but only with certain institutions all this doubt doesnt touch a truth like that one does not refuse to live in a house because of the old symbols one finds upon the door if they are old symbols  out of such private contemplations he would descend suddenly upon me  what are you going to do with your life steve he would ask  there is no happiness in life without some form of service where do you mean to serve with your bent for science and natural history it wouldnt be difficult for you to get into the ics i doubt if youd do anything at the law its a rough game steve though the prizes are big big prizes the lawyers get ive known a man in the privy council under fortyand that without anything much in the way of a family but always one must concentrate the one thing england will not stand is a loafer a woolgatherer a man who goes about musing and halfawake its our energy were western its that has made us all we are  i knew whither that pointed never so far as i can remember did mr siddons criticize either myself or my father directly but i understood with the utmost clearness that he found my father indolent and hesitating and myself more than a little bit of a mollycoddle and in urgent need of pulling together   § 6  harbury went on with that process of suppressing encrusting hardening and bracingup which mr siddons had begun for a time i pulled myself together very thoroughly i am not ungrateful nor unfaithful to harbury in your turn you will go there you will have to live your life in this british world of ours and you must learn its language and manners acquire its reserves and develop the approved toughness and patterning of cuticle afterwards if you please you may quarrel with it but dont when the time comes quarrel with the present conditions of human association and think it is only with harbury you quarrel what man has become and may become beneath the masks and impositions of civilization in his intimate texture and in the depths of his being i begin now in my middle age to appreciate no longer is he an instinctive savage but a creature of almost incredible variability and wonderful new possibilities marvels undreamt of power still inconceivable an empire beyond the uttermost stars such is mans inheritance but for the present until we get a mastery of those vague and mighty intimations at once so perplexing and so reassuring if we are to live at all in the multitudinousness of human society we must submit to some scheme of clumsy compromises and conventions or otherand for us strattons the harbury system is the most convenient you will have to go to the old school  i went to rendles i just missed getting into college i was two places below the lowest successful boy i was maxtons fag to begin with and my chief chum was raymond who is your friend also and who comes so often to this house i preferred water to land boats to cricket because of that difficulty about pitch i have already mentioned but i was no great sportsman raymond and i shared a boat and spent most of the time we gave to it under the big trees near dartpool lock reading or talking we would pull up to sandy hall perhaps once a week i never rowed in any of the eights though i was urged to do so i swam fairly well and got my colors on the strength of my diving  on the whole i found harbury a satisfactory and amusing place i was neither bullied nor do i think i greatly bullied and of all that furtive and puerile lasciviousness of which one hears so many hints nowadaysexcitable people talk of it as though it was the most monstrous and singular of vices instead of a slightly debasing but almost unavoidable and very obvious result of heaping boys together under the inefficient control of a timid pretentious class of menof such uncleanness as i say scarcely more than a glimpse and a whisper and a vague tentative talk or so reached me little more will reach you for that kind of thing like the hells of swedenborg finds its own  i had already developed my growing instinct for observance to a very considerable extent under siddons and at harbury i remember myself and people remember me as an almost stiffly correct youth i was pretty good at most of the work and exceptionally so at history geology and the biological side of natural science i had to restrain my interest in these latter subjects lest i should appear to be a swat and a modernside swat at that i was early in the sixth and rather a favorite with old latimer he incited me to exercise what he called a wholesome influence on the younger boys and i succeeded in doing this fairly well without any gross interventions i implied rather than professed soundly orthodox views about things in general and i was extremely careful to tilt my straw hat forward over my nose so as just not to expose the crown of my head behind and to turn up my trousers with exactly that width of margin which the judgment of my fellowcreatures had decided was correct my socks were spirited without being vulgar and the ties i wore were tied with a studious avoidance of either slovenliness or priggish neatness i wrote two articles in the harburonian became something of a debater in the literacy and political conducted many long conversations with my senior contemporaries upon religion politics sport and social life and concealed my inmost thoughts from every human being indeed so effective had been the training of harbury and mr siddons that i think at that time i came very near concealing them from myself i could suppress wonder i could pass by beauty as if i did not see it almost i think i did not see it for a time and yet i remember it in those years tooa hundred beautiful things  harbury itself is a very beautiful place the country about it has all the charm of river scenery in a settled and ancient land and the great castle and piled town of wetmore cliffs of battlemented grey wall rising above a dense cluster of red roofs form the background to innumerable gracious prospects of great streamfed trees level meadows of buttercups sweeping curves of osier and rushrimmed river the playing fields and the sedgy lilyspangled levels of avonlea the college itself is mostly late tudor and stuart brickwork very ripe and mellow now but the great grey chapel with its glorious east window floats over the whole like a voice singing in the evening and the evening cloudscapes of harbury are a perpetual succession of glorious effects now serene now mysteriously threatening and profound now towering to incredible heights now revealing undreamtof distances of luminous color assuredly i must have delighted in all those aspects or why should i remember them so well but i recall i mean no confessed recognition of them no deliberate goingout of my spirit open and unashamed to such things  i suppose ones early adolescence is necessarily the period of maximum shyness in ones life even to raymond i attempted no extremities of confidence even to myself i tried to be the thing that was expected of me i professed a modest desire for temperate and tolerable achievement in life though deep in my lost depths i wanted passionately to excel i worked hard much harder than i allowed to appear and i said i did it for the credit of the school i affected a dignified loyalty to queen and country and church i pretended a stoical disdain for appetites and delights and all the arts though now and then a chance fragment of poetry would light me like a fire or a lovely picture stir unwonted urgencies though visions of delight haunted the shadows of my imagination and did not always fly when i regarded them but on the other hand i affected an interest in games that i was far from feeling of some boys i was violently jealous and this also i masked beneath a generous appreciation certain popularities i applauded while i doubted whatever my intimate motives i became less and less disposed to obey them until i had translated them into a plausible rendering of the accepted code if i could not so translate them i found it wise to control them when i wanted urgently one summer to wander by night over the hills towards kestering and lie upon heather and look up at the stars and wonder about them i cast about and at last hit upon the wellknown and approved sport of treacling for moths as a cloak for so strange an indulgence  i must have known even then what a mask and front i was because i knew quite well how things were with other people i listened politely and respected and understood the admirable explanations of my friends when some fellow got a scholarship unexpectedly and declared it was rotten bad luck on the other chap seeing the papers he had done and doubted whether he shouldnt resign i had an intuitive knowledge that he wouldnt resign and i do not remember any time in my career as the respectful listener to mr siddons aspirations for service and devotion when i did not perceive quite clearly his undeviating eye upon a bishopric he thought of gaiters though he talked of wings  how firmly the bonds of an old relationship can hold one i remember when a few years ago he reached that toiledfor goal i wrote in a tone of gratified surprise that in this blatant age such disinterested effort as his should receive even so belated a recognition yet what else was there for me to write we all have our siddonses with whom there are no alternatives but insincerity or a disproportionate destructiveness i am still largely siddonsized little son and so i fear you will have to be   § 7  the clue to all the perplexities of law and custom lies in this that human association is an artificiality we do not run together naturally and easily as grazing deer do or feeding starlings or a shoal of fish we are a sort of creature which is only resuming association after a long heredity of extreme separation we are beings strongly individualized we are dominated by that passion which is no more and no less than individuality in actionjealousy jealousy is a fierce insistence on ourselves an instinctive intolerance of our fellowcreatures ranging between an insatiable aggression as its buoyant phase and a savage defensiveness when it is touched by fear in our expansive moments we want to dominate and control everyone and destroy every unlikeness to ourselves in our recessive phases our homes are our castles and we want to be let alone  now all law all social order all custom is a patchup and a concession to this separating passion of selfinsistence it is an evasion of conflict and social death human society is as yet only a truce and not an alliance  when you understand that you will begin to understand a thousand perplexing things in legislation and social life you will understand the necessity of all those restrictions that are called conventionality and the inevitableness of the general hostility to singularity to be exceptional is to assert a difference to disregard the bankedup forces of jealousy and break the essential conditions of the social contract it invites either resentment or aggression so we all wear much the same clothing affect modesty use the same phrases respect one anothers rights and pretend a greater disinterestedness than we feel  you have to face this reality as you must face all reality this is the reality of laws and government this is the reality of customs and institutions a convention between jealousies this is reality just as the cats way with the nestlings was reality and the squealing rat one smashed in a paroxysm of cruelty and disgust in the barn  but it isnt the only reality equally real is the passionate revolt of my heart against cruelty and the deep fluctuating impulse not to pretend to set aside fear and jealousy to come nakedly out of the compromises and secretive methods of everyday living into the light into a wide impersonal love into a new way of living for mankind     chapter the third  intentions and the lady mary christian   § 1  i know that before the end of my harbury days i was already dreaming of a career of some great and conspicuous usefulness in the world that has always haunted my mind and haunts it now i may be cured perhaps of the large and showy anticipations of youth i may have learnt to drop the great and conspicuous but still i find it necessary to believe that i matter that i play a part no one else can play in a progress in a universal scheme moving towards triumphant ends  almost wholly i think i was dreaming of public service in those days the harbury tradition pointed steadfastly towards the state and all my world was bare of allurements to any other type of ambition success in art or literature did not appeal to us and a harbury boy would as soon think of being a great tinker as a great philosopher science we called stinks our three science masters were ex officio ridiculous and the practical laboratory a refuge for oddities but a good half of our fathers at least were peers or members of parliament and our sense of politics was close and keen history and particularly history as it came up through the eighteenth century to our own times supplied us with a gallery of intimate models our great uncles and grandfathers and ancestors at large figured abundantly in the story and furnished the pattern to which we cut our anticipations of life it was a season of imperialism the picturesque imperialism of the earlier kipling phase and we were all of us enthusiasts for the empire it was the empire of the white mans burthen in those days the sordid anticlimax of the tariff reform movement was still some years ahead of us it was easier for us at harbury to believe then than it has become since in our own racial and national and class supremacy we were the anglosaxons the elect of the earth leading the world in social organization in science and economic method in india and the east more particularly we were the apostles of evenhanded justice relentless veracity personal cleanliness and modern efficiency in a spirit of adventurous benevolence we were spreading those blessings over a reluctant and occasionally recalcitrant world of people for the most part colored our success in this had aroused the bitter envy and rivalry of various continental nations and particularly of france russia and germany but france had been diverted to north africa russia to eastern asia and germany was already the most considered antagonist in our path towards an empire over the world  this was the spacious and by no means ignoble project of the later nineties most of us harbury boys trained as i had been trained to be uncritical saw the national outlook in those terms we knew little or nothing until the fierce wranglings of the free traders and tariff reformers a few years later brought it home to us of the commercial financial and squalid side of our relations with the vast congeries of exploited new territories and subordinated and subjugated populations we knew nothing of the social conditions of the mass of people in our own country we were blankly ignorant of economics we knew nothing of that process of expropriation and the exploitation of labor which is giving the world the servile state the very phrase was twenty years ahead of us we believed that an englishman was a better thing in every way than any other sort of man that english literature science and philosophy were a shining and unapproachable light to all other peoples that our soldiers were better than all other soldiers and our sailors than all other sailors such civilization and enterprise as existed in germany for instance we regarded as a shadow an envious shadow following our own it was still generally believed in those days that german trade was concerned entirely with the dishonest imitation of our unapproachable english goods and as for the united states well the united states though blessed with a strain of english blood were nevertheless out of it marooned in a continent of their own andwe had to admit itcorrupt  given such ignorance you know it wasnt by any means ignoble to be patriotic to dream of this propagandist empire of ours spreading its great peace and culture its virtue and its amazing and unprecedented honestyits honestyround the world   § 2  when i look and try to recover those early intentions of mine i am astonished at the way in which i took them readymade from the world immediately about me in some way i seem to have stopped lookingif ever i had begun lookingat the heights and depths above and below that immediate life i seem to have regarded these profounder realities no more during this phase of concentration than a cow in a field regards the sky my fathers vestments the burnmore altar the harbury pulpit and mr siddons stood between me and the idea of god so that it needed years and much bitter disillusionment before i discovered my need of it and i was as wanting in subtlety as in depth we did no logic nor philosophy at harbury and at oxford it was not so much thought we came to deal with as a mistranslation and vulgarization of ancient and alien exercises in thinking there is no such effective serum against philosophy as the scholarly decoction of a dead philosopher the philosophical teaching of oxford at the end of the last century was not so much teaching as a protective inoculation the stuff was administered with a mysterious gilding of greek and reverence old hegels monstrous web was the ultimate modernity and plato that intellectual journalistartist that bright restless experimentalist in ideas was as it were the god of wisdom only a little less omniscient and on the whole more of a scholar and a gentleman than the god of fact  so i fell back upon the empire in my first attempts to unify my life i would serve the empire that should be my total significance there was a roman touch i perceive in this devotion just how or where i should serve the empire i had not as yet determined at times i thought of the civil service in my more ambitious moments i turned my thoughts to politics but it was doubtful whether my private expectations made the last a reasonable possibility  i would serve the empire   § 3  and all the while that the first attempts to consolidate to gather ones life together into a purpose and a plan of campaign are going on upon the field of the young mans life there come and go and come again in the sky above him the threatening clouds the ethereal cirrus the red dawns and glowing afternoons of that passion of love which is the source and renewal of being there are times when that solicitude matters no more than a springtime sky to a runner who wins towards the post there are times when its passionate urgency dominates every fact in his world   § 4  one must have children and love them passionately before one realizes the deep indignity of accident in life it is not that i mind so much when unexpected and disconcerting things happen to you or your sisters but that i mind before they happen my dreams and anticipations of your lives are all marred by my sense of the huge importance mere chance encounters and incalculable necessities will play in them and in friendship and still more here in this central business of love accident rules it seems to me almost altogether what personalities you will encounter in life and have for a chief interest in life is nearly as much a matter of chance as the drift of a grain of pollen in the pine forest and once the light hazard has blown it has blown never to drive again in other schoolrooms and nurseries in slum livingrooms perhaps or workhouse wards or palaces round the other side of the earth in canada or russia or china other little creatures are trying their small limbs clutching at things about them with infantile hands who someday will come into your life with a power and magic monstrous and irrational and irresistible they will break the limits of your concentrating self call you out to the service of beauty and the service of the race sound you to your highest and your lowest give you your chance to be godlike or filthy divine or utterly ignoble react together with you upon the very core and essence of your being these unknowns are the substance of your fate you will in extreme intimacy love them hate them serve them struggle with them and in that interaction the vital force in you and the substance of your days will be spent  and who they may chance to be and their peculiar quality and effect is haphazard utterly beyond designing  law and custom conspire with the natural circumstances of man to exaggerate every consequence of this accumulating accident and make it definite and fatal  i find it quite impossible now to recall the steps and stages by which this power of sex invaded my life it seems to me now that it began very much as a gale begins in catspaws upon the water and little rustlings among the leaves and then stillness and then a distant soughing again and a pause and then a wider and longer disturbance and so more and more with a gathering continuity until at last the stars were hidden the heavens were hidden all the heights and depths of life were obscured by stormy impulses and passionate desires i suppose that quite at the first there were simple curiosities no doubt they were vivid at the time but they have left scarcely a trace there were vague first intimations of a peculiar excitement i do remember more distinctly phases when there was a goingout from myself towards these things these interests and then a reaction of shame and concealment  and these memories were mixed up with others not sexual at all and particularly with the perception of beauty in things inanimate with lights seen at twilight and the tender mysteriousness of the dusk and the confused disturbing scents of flowers in the evening and the enigmatical serene animation of stars in the summer sky  i think perhaps that my boyhood was exceptionally free from vulgarizing influences in this direction there were few novels in my fathers house and i neither saw nor read any plays until i was near manhood so that i thought naturally about love and not rather artificially round and about love as so many imaginative young people are trained to do i fell in love once or twice while i was still quite a boy these earliest experiences rarely got beyond a sort of dumb awe a vague vast ineffectual desire for selfimmolation for a time i remember i worshipped lady ladislaw with all my being then i talked to a girl in a traini forget upon what journeybut i remember very vividly her quick color and a certain roguish smile i spread my adoration at her feet fresh and frank i wanted to write to her indeed i wanted to devote all my being to her i begged hard but there was someone called auntie who had to be considered an atropos for that thread of romance  then there was a photograph in my fathers study of the delphic sibyl from the sistine chapel that for a time held my heart andyes there was a girl in a tobacconists shop in the harbury high street drawn by an irresistible impulse i used to go and buy cigarettesand sometimes converse about the weather but afterwards in solitude i would meditate tremendous conversations and encounters with her the cigarettes increased the natural melancholy of my state and led to a reproof from old henson almost always i suppose there is that girl in the tobacconists shop  i believe if i made an effort i could disinter some dozens of such memories more and more faded until the marginal ones would be featureless and all but altogether effaced as i look back at it now i am struck by an absurd image it is as if a fish nibbled at this bait and then at that  given but the slightest aid from accidental circumstances and any of those slight attractions might have become a power to deflect all my life  the day of decision arrived when the lady mary christian came smiling out of the sunshine to me into the pavilion at burnmore with that the phase of stirrings and intimations was over for ever in my life all those other impressions went then to the dusty lumber room from which i now so slightingly disinter them   § 5  we five had all been playmates together there were lord maxton who was killed at paardeberg while i was in ladysmith he was my senior by nearly a year philip who is now earl ladislaw and who was about eighteen months younger than i mary my contemporary within eight days and guy whom we regarded as a baby and who was called apparently on account of some early linguistic efforts brugglesmith he did his best to avenge his juniority as time passed on by an enormous length of limb i had more imagination than maxton and was a good deal better read so that mary and i dominated most of the games of indians and warfare and exploration in which we passed our long days together when the christians were at burnmore and they usually spent three or four months in the year there i had a kind of standing invitation to be with them sometimes there would also be two christian cousins to swell our party and sometimes there would be a raid of the fawney children with a detestable governess who was perpetually vociferating reproaches but these latter were absentminded lax young persons and we did not greatly love them  it is curious how little i remember of marys childhood all that has happened between us since lies between that and my present self like some luminous impenetrable mist i know we liked each other that i was taller than she was and thought her legs unreasonably thin and that once when i knelt by accident on a dead stick she had brought into an indian camp we had made near the end of the west shrubbery she flew at me in a sudden fury smacked my face scratched me and had to be suppressed and was suppressed with extreme difficulty by the united manhood of us three elder boys then it was i noted first the blazing blueness of her eyes she was light and very plucky so that none of us cared to climb against her and she was as difficult to hold as an eel but all these traits and characteristics vanished when she was transformed  for what seems now a long space of time i had not seen her or any of the family except philip it was certainly a year or more probably two maxton was at a crammers and i think the others must have been in canada with lord ladislaw then came some sort of estrangement between him and his wife and she returned with mary and guy to burnmore and stayed there all through the summer  i was in a state of transition between the infinitely great and the infinitely little i had just ceased to be that noble and potent being that almost statesmanlike personage a sixth form boy at harbury and i was going to be an oxford undergraduate philip and i came down together by the same train from harbury i shared the burnmore dogcart and luggage cart and he dropped me at the rectory i was a longlimbed youngster of seventeen as tall as i am now and fair so fair that i was still boyishfaced while most of my contemporaries and philip who favored his father were at least smudgy with moustaches with the headmasters valediction and the grave elderbrotherliness of old henson and the shrill cheers of a little crowd of juniors still echoing in my head i very naturally came home in a mood of exalted gravity and i can still remember pacing up and down the oblong lawn behind the rockery and the figtree wall with my father talking of my outlook with all the tremendous savoir faire that was natural to my age and noting with a secret gratification that our shoulders were now on a level no doubt we were discussing oxford and all that i was to do at oxford i dont remember a word of our speech though i recall the exact tint of its color and the distinctive feeling of our measured equal paces in the sunshine  i must have gone up to burnmore house the following afternoon i went up alone and i was sent out through the little door at the end of the big gallery into the garden in those days lady ladislaw had made an indian pavilion under the tall trees at the east end of the house and here i found her with her cousin helena christian entertaining a mixture of people a carriageful from hampton end the two elder fawneys and a man in brown who had i think ridden over from chestoxter castle lady ladislaw welcomed me with ample graciousnessas though i was a personage the children she said were still at tennis and as she spoke i saw guy grown nearly beyond recognition and then a shining being in white very straight and graceful with a big soft hat and overshadowed eyes that smiled come out from the hurried endearments of the sunflakes under the shadows of the great chestnuts into the glow of summer light before the pavilion  steve arrived she cried and waved a welcoming racquet  i do not remember what i said to her or what else she said or what anyone said but i believe i could paint every detail of her effect i know that when she came out of the brightness into the shadow of the pavilion it was like a regal condescension and i know that she was wonderfully selfpossessed and helpful with her mothers hospitalities and that i marvelled i had never before perceived the subtler sweetness in the cadence of her voice i seem also to remember a severe internal struggle for my selfpossession and that i had to recall my exalted position in the sixth form to save myself from becoming tonguetied and abashed and awkward and utterly shamed  you see she had her hair up and very prettily dressed and those aggressive lean legs of hers had vanished and she was sheathed in muslin that showed her the most delicately slender and beautiful of young women and she seemed so radiantly sure of herself  after our first greeting i do not think i spoke to her or looked at her again throughout the meal i took things that she handed me with an appearance of supreme indifference was politely attentive to the elder miss fawney and engaged with lady ladislaw and the horsey little man in brown in a discussion of the possibility of mechanical vehicles upon the high road that was in the early nineties we were all of opinion that it was impossible to make a sufficiently light engine for the purpose afterwards mary confessed to me how she had been looking forward to our meeting and how snubbed i had made her feel  then a little later than this meeting in the pavilion though i am not clear now whether it was the same or some subsequent afternoon we are walking in the sunken garden and great clouds of purple clematis and some less lavish heliotropecolored creeper foam up against the ruddy stone balustrading just in front of us a fountain gushes out of a grotto of artificial stalagmite and bathes the pedestal of an absurd little statuette of the god of love we are talking almost easily she looks sideways at my face already with the quiet controlled watchfulness of a woman interested in a man she smiles and she talks of flowers and sunshine the canadian winterand with an abrupt transition of old times weve had together in the shrubbery and the wilderness of bracken out beyond she seems tremendously grownup and womanly to me i am talking my best and glad and in a manner scared at the thrill her newly discovered beauty gives me and keeping up my dignity and coherence with an effort my attention is constantly being distracted to note how prettily she moves to wonder why it is i never noticed the sweet fall the faint delightful whisper of a lisp in her voice before  we agree about the flowers and the sunshine and the canadian winterabout everything i think so often of those games we used to invent she declares so do i i say so do i and then with a sudden boldness once i broke a stick of yours a rotten stick you thought a sound one do you remember  then we laugh together and seem to approach across a painful unnecessary distance that has separated us it vanishes for ever i couldnt now she says smack your face like that stephen  that seems to me a brilliantly daring and delightful thing for her to say and jolly of her to use my christian name too i believe i scratched she adds  you never scratched i assert with warm conviction never  i did she insists and i deny you couldnt  were growing up she cries thats what has happened to us we shall never fight again with our hands and feet neveruntil death do us part  for better or worse i say with a sense of wit and enterprise beyond all human precedent  for richer or poorer she cries taking up my challenge with a lifting laugh in her voice  and then to make it all nothing again she exclaims at the white lilies that rise against masses of sweet bay along the further wall  how plainly i can recall it all how plainly and how brightly as we came up the broad steps at the further end towards the tennis lawn she turned suddenly upon me and with a novel assurance of command told me to stand still there she said with a hand out and seemed to survey me with her chin up and her white neck at the level of my eyes yes a whole step she estimated and more taller than i you will look down on me stephen now for all the rest of our days  i shall always stand i answered a step or so below you  no she said come up to the level a girl should be smaller than a man you are a man stephenalmost you must be near six feet heres guy with the box of balls  she flitted about the tennis court before me playing with philip against guy and myself she punished some opening condescensions with a wicked vigorand presently guy and i were straining every nerve to save the set she had a low close serve i remember that seemed perfectly straightforward and simple and was very difficult to return   § 6  all that golden summer on the threshold of my manhood was filled by mary i loved her with the love of a boy and a man either i was with mary or i was hoping and planning to be with mary or i was full of some vivid new impression of her or some enigmatical speech some pregnant nothing some glance or gesture engaged and perplexed my mind in those days i slept the profound sweet sleep of youth but whenever that deep flow broke towards the shallows as i sank into it at night and came out of it at morning i passed through dreams of mary to and from a world of waking thought of her  there must have been days of friendly intercourse when it seemed we talked nothings and wandered and meandered among subjects but always we had our eyes on one another and afterwards i would spend long hours in recalling and analyzing those nothings questioning their nothingness making out of things too submerged and impalpable for the rough drags of recollection promises and indications i would invent ingenious things to say things pushing out suddenly from nothingness to extreme significance i rehearsed a hundred declarations  it was easy for us to be very much together we were very free that summer and life was all leisure lady ladislaw was busied with her own concerns she sometimes went away for two or three days leaving no one but an attenuated governess with even the shadow of a claim to interfere with mary moreover she was used to seeing me with her children at burnmore we were still in her eyes no more than children and also perhaps she did not greatly mind if indeed we did a little fall in love together to her that may have seemed a very natural and slight and transitory possibility  one afternoon of warm shadows in the wood near the redlacquered chinese bridge we two were alone together and we fell silent i was trembling and full of a wild courage i can feel now the exquisite surmise the doubt of that moment our eyes met she looked up at me with an unwonted touch of fear in her expression and i laid my hands on her she did not recoil she stood mute with her lips pressed together looking at me steadfastly i can feel that moment now as a tremendous hesitation blank and yet full of light and life like a clear sky in the moment before dawn  she made a little move towards me impulsively with no word said we kissed   § 7  i would like very much to give you a portrait of mary as she was in those days every portrait i ever had of her i burnt in the sincerity of what was to have been our final separation and now i have nothing of her in my possession i suppose that in the files of old illustrated weeklies somewhere a score of portraits must be findable yet photographs have a queer quality of falsehood they have no movement and always there was a little movement about mary just as there is always a little scent about flowers she was slender and graceful so that she seemed taller than she was she had beautifully shaped arms and a brightness in her face it seemed to me always that there was light in her face more than the light that shone upon it her fair very slightly reddish hairit was warm like australian goldflowed with a sort of joyous bravery back from her low broad forehead the color under her delicate skin was bright and quick and her mouth always smiled faintly there was a peculiar charm for me about her mouth a whimsicality a sort of humorous resolve in the way in which the upper lip fell upon the lower and in a faint obliquity that increased with her quickening smile she spoke with a very clear delicate intonation that made one want to hear her speak again she often said faintly daring things and when she did she had that little catch in the breathof one who dares she did not talk hastily often before she spoke came a brief grave pause her eyes were brightly blue except when the spirit of mischief took her and then they became black and there was something about the upper and lower lids that made them not only the prettiest but the sweetest and kindliest eyes in the world and she moved with a quiet rapidity without any needless movements to do whatever she had a mind to do  but how impossible it is to convey the personal charm of a human being i catalogue these things and it is as if she moved about silently behind my stumbling enumeration and smiled at me still with her eyes a little darkened mocking me that phantom will never be gone from my mind it was all of these things and none of these things that made me hers as i have never been any other persons  we grew up together the girl of nineteen mingles in my memory with the woman of twentyfive  always we were equals or if anything she was the better of us two i never made love to her in the commoner sense of the word a sense in which the woman is conceived of as shy unawakened younger more plastic and the man as tempting creating responses persuading and compelling we made love to each other as youth should we were friends lit by a passion i think that is the best love if i could wish your future i would have you love someone neither older and stronger nor younger and weaker than yourself i would have you have neither a toy nor a devotion for the one makes the woman contemptible and the other the man there should be something almost sisterly between you love neither a goddess nor a captive woman but i would wish you a better fate in your love than chanced to me  mary was not only naturally far more quickminded more swiftly understanding than i but more widely educated mine was the stiff limited education of the english public school and university i could not speak and read and think french and german as she could for all that i had a pedantic knowledge of the older forms of those tongues and the classics and mathematics upon which i had spent the substance of my years were indeed of little use to me have never been of any real use to me they were ladders too clumsy to carry about and too short to reach anything my general ideas came from the newspapers and the reviews she on the other hand had read much had heard no end of good conversation the conversation of people who mattered had thought for herself and had picked the brains of her brothers her mother had let her read whatever books she liked partly because she believed that was the proper thing to do and partly because it was so much less trouble to be liberal in such things  we had the gravest conversations  i do not remember that we talked much of love though we were very much in love we kissed sometimes greatly daring we walked hand in hand once i took her in my arms and carried her over a swampy place beyond the killing wood and held her closely to me that was a great event between us but we were shy of one another shy even of very intimate words and a thousand daring and beautiful things i dreamt of saying to her went unsaid i do not remember any endearing names from that time but we jested and shared our humors shaped our developing ideas in quaint forms to amuse one another and talkedas young men talk together  we talked of religion i think she was the first person to thaw the private silences that had kept me bound in these matters even from myself for years i can still recall her face a little flushed and coming nearer to mine after avowals and comparisons but stephen she says if none of these things are really true why do they keep on telling them to us what is true what are we for what is everything for  i remember the awkwardness i felt at these indelicate thrusts into topics i had come to regard as forbidden  i suppose theres a sort of truth in them i said and then more siddonsesquely endless people wiser than we are  yes she said but that doesnt matter to us endless people wiser than we are have said one thing and endless people wiser than we are have said exactly the opposite its we who have to understandfor ourselves we dont understand stephen  i was forced to a choice between faith and denial but i parried with questions dont you i asked feel there is a god  she hesitated there is somethingsomething very beautiful she said and stopped as if her breath had gone that is all i know stephen  and i remember too that we talked endlessly about the things i was to do in the world i do not remember that we talked about the things she was to do by some sort of instinct and some sort of dexterity she evaded that from the very first she had reserves from me but my career and purpose became as it were the form in which we discussed all the purposes of life i became man in her imagination the protagonist of the world at first i displayed the modest worthy desire for respectable service that harbury had taught me but her clear sceptical little voice pierced and tore all those pretences to shreds do some decent public work i said or some such phrase  but is that all you want i hear her asking is that all you want  i lay prone upon the turf and dug up a root of grass with my penknife before i met you it was i said  and now  i want you  im nothing to want i want you to want all the world why shouldnt you  i think i must have talked of the greatness of serving the empire yes but splendidly she insisted not doing little things for other peoplewho arent doing anything at all i want you to conquer people and lead people when i see you stephen sometimesi almost wish i were a man in order to be able to do all the things that you are going to do  for you i said for you  i stretched out my hand for hers and my gesture went disregarded  she sat rather crouched together with her eyes gazing far away across the great spaces of the park  that is what women are for she said to make men see how splendid life can be to lift them upout of a sort of timid grubbiness she turned upon me suddenly stephen she said promise me whatever you become you promise and swear here and now never to be grey and grubby never to be humpy and snuffy never to be respectable and modest and dull and a little fat likelike everybody ever  i swear i said  by me  by you no book to kiss please give me your hand   § 8  all through that summer we saw much of each other i was up at the house perhaps every other day we young people were supposed to be all in a company together down by the tennis lawns but indeed we dispersed and came and went by a kind of tacit understanding guy and philip each with one of the fawney girls and i with mary i put all sorts of constructions upon the freedom i was given with her but i perceive now that we still seemed scarcely more than children to lady ladislaw and that the idea of our marriage was as inconceivable to her as if we had been brother and sister matrimonially i was as impossible as one of the stable boys all the money i could hope to earn for years to come would not have sufficed even to buy mary clothes but as yet we thought little of matters so remote glad in our wonderful new discovery of love and when at last i went off to oxford albeit the parting moved us to much tenderness and vows and embraces i had no suspicion that never more in all our lives would mary and i meet freely and gladly without restriction yet so it was from that day came restraints and difficulties the shadow of furtiveness fell between us our correspondence had to be concealed  i went to oxford as one goes into exile she to london i would post to her so that the letters reached landor house before lunch time when the sun of lady ladislaw came over the horizon but indeed as yet no one was watching her letters afterwards as she moved about she gave me other instructions and for the most part i wrote to her in envelopes addressed for her by one of the fawney girls who was under her spell and made no enquiry for what purpose these envelopes were needed  to me of course mary wrote without restraint all her letters to me were destroyed after our crisis but some of mine to her she kept for many years at last they came back to me so that i have them now and for all their occasional cheapness and crudity i do not find anything in them to be ashamed of they reflect they are chiefly concerned with that search for a career of fine service which was then the chief preoccupation of my mind the bias is all to a large imperialism but it is manifest that already the first ripples of a rising tide of criticism against the imperialist movement had reached and were exercising me in one letter i am explaining that imperialism is not a mere aggressiveness but the establishment of peace and order throughout half the world we may never withdraw i wrote with all the confidence of a foreign secretary from all these great territories of ours but we shall stay only to raise their peoples ultimately to an equal citizenship with ourselves and then in the same letter and if i do not devote myself to the empire what else is there that gives anything like the same opportunity of a purpose in life i find myself in another tolerantly disposed to accept socialism but manifestly hostile to the narrow mental habits of the socialists the large note of youth and in another i am clearly very proud and excited and a little mockmodest over the success of my first two speeches in the union  on the whole i like the rather boyish tremendously serious young man of those letters an egotist of course but what youth was ever anything else i may write that much freely now for by this time he is almost as much outside my personality as you or my father he is the young stratton one of a line i like his gravity if youth is not grave with all the great spectacle of life opening at its feet then surely no age need be grave i love and envy his simplicity and honesty his sham modesty and so forth are so translucent as scarcely to matter it is clear i was opening my heart to myself as i opened it to mary i wasnt acting to her i meant what i said and as i remember her answers she took much the same high tone with me though her style of writing was far lighter than mine more easy and witty and less continuous she flashed and flickered as for confessed lovemaking there is very littlei find at the end of one of my notes after the signature i love you i love you and she was even more restrained such little phrases as dear stevenagethat was one of her odd names for mei wish you were here or dear dear stevenage were epistolary events and i would reread the blessed wonderful outbreak a hundred times  our separation lengthened there was a queer detached unexpected meeting in london in december for some afternoon gathering i was shy and the more disconcerted because she was in winter town clothes that made her seem strange and changed then came the devastating intimation that all through the next summer the ladislaws were to be in scotland  i did my boyish utmost to get to scotland they were at lankart near invermoriston and the nearest thing i could contrive was to join a reading party in skye a reading party of older men who manifestly had no great desire for me for more than a year we never met at all and all sorts of new things happened to us both i perceived they happened to me but i did not think they happened to her of course we changed of course in a measure and relatively we forgot of course there were weeks when we never thought of each other at all then would come phases of hunger i remember a little note of hers oh stevenage it was scrawled perhaps next easter next easter was an aching desolation the blinds of burnmore house remained drawn the place was empty except for three old servants on boardwages the christians went instead to the canary isles following some occult impulse of lady ladislaws lord ladislaw spent the winter in italy  what an empty useless beauty the great park possessed during those seasons of intermission there were a score of places in it we had made our own  her letters to oxford would cease for weeks and suddenly revive and become frequent now and then would come a loveletter that seemed to shine like stars as i read it for the most part they were lowpitched friendly or humorous letters in a roundish girlish writing that was maturing into a squarely characteristic hand my letters to her too i suppose varied as greatly we began to be used to living so apart there were weeks of silence  yet always when i thought of my life as a whole mary ruled it with her alone i had talked of my possible work and purpose to her alone had i confessed to ambitions beyond such modest worthiness as a public school drills us to affect  then the whole sky of my life lit up again with a strange light of excitement and hope i had a note glad and serenely friendly to say they were to spend all the summer at burnmore  i remember how i handled and scrutinized that letter seeking for some intimation that our former intimacy was still alive we were to meet how should we meet how would she look at me what would she think of me   § 9  of course it was all different our first encounter in this new phase had a quality of extreme disillusionment the warm living creature who would whisper who would kiss with wonderful lips who would say strange daring things who had soft hair one might touch with a thrilling and worshipful hand who changed one at a word or a look into a god of pride became as if she had been no more than a dream a selfpossessed young aristocrat in white and brown glanced at me from amidst a group of brilliant people on the terrace nodded as it seemed quite carelessly in acknowledgment of my salutation and resumed her confident conversation with a tall stooping man no less a person than evesham the prime minister he was lunching at burnmore on his way across country to the rileys i heard that dear laugh of hers as ready and easy as when she laughed with me i had not heard it for nearly three yearsnor any sound that had its sweetness but mr evesham she was saying nowadays we dont believe that sort of thing  there are a lot of things still for you to believe says mr evesham beaming a lot of things ones capacity increases it grows with exercise justin will bear me out  beyond her stood an undersized brownclad middleaged man with a big head a dark face and expressive brown eyes fixed now in unrestrained admiration on marys laughing face this then was justin the incredibly rich and powerful whose comprehensive operations could make and break a thousand fortunes in a day he answered evesham carelessly with his gaze still on mary and in a voice too low for my straining ears there was some woman in the group also but she has left nothing upon my mind whatever except an effect of black and a very decorative green sunshade she greeted justins remark i remember with the little yelp of laughter that characterized that set i think too there was someone else in the group but i cannot clearly recall who  presently as i and philip made unreal conversation together i saw mary disengage herself and come towards us it was as if a princess came towards a beggar absurd are the changes of phase between women and men a year or so ago and all of us had been but the children together now here were i and philip mere youths still nobodies echoes and aspirations crude promises at the best and here was mary in full flower as glorious and central as the hampton court azaleas in spring  and this is stephen she said aglow with happy confidence  i made no memorable reply and there was a little pause thick with mute questionings  after lunch she said with her eye on mine i am going to measure against you on the steps id hopedwhen you werent lookingi might creep up  ive taken no advantage i said  youve kept your lead  justin had followed her towards us and now held out a hand to philip well philip my boy he said and defined our places philip made some introductory gesture with a word or so towards me justin glanced at me as one might glance at someones new dog gave an expressionless nod to my stiff movement of recognition and addressed himself at once to mary  lady mary he said ive wanted to tell you  i caught her quick eye for a moment and knew she had more to say to me but neither she nor i had the skill and alacrity to get that said  i wanted to tell you said justin ive found a little japanese whos done exactly what you wanted with that group of dwarf maples  she clearly didnt understand  but what did i want mr justin she asked  dont say that you forget cried justin oh dont tell me you forget you wanted a little exact copy of a japanese house ive had it done beneath the trees  and so youre back in burnmore mr stratton said lady ladislaw intervening between me and their duologue and i never knew how pleased mary was with this faithful realization of her passing and forgotten fancy my hostess greeted me warmly and pressed my hand smiled mechanically and looked over my shoulder all the while to mr evesham and her company generally and then came the deep uproar of a gong from the house and we were all moving in groups and couples luncheonward  justin walked with lady mary and she was i saw an inch taller than his squat solidity a tall lady in rosepink had taken possession of guy evesham and lady ladislaw made the two centres of a straggling group who were bandying recondite political allusions then came one or two couples and trios with nothing very much to say and active ears philip and i brought up the rear silently and in all humility even young guy had gone over our heads i was too full of a stupendous realization for any words of course during those years she had been doingno end of things and while i had been just drudging with lectures and books and theorizing about the empire and what i could do with it and taking exercise she had learnt it seemedthe world   § 10  lunch was in the great diningroom there was a big table and two smaller ones we sat down anyhow but the first comers had grouped themselves about lady ladislaw and evesham and justin and mary in a central orb and i had to drift perforce to one of the satellites i secured a seat whence i could get a glimpse ever and again over justins assiduous shoulders of a delicate profile and i found myself immediately engaged in answering the innumerable impossible questions of lady viping the widow of terrible old sir joshua that devastating divorce court judge who didnt believe in divorces his domestic confidences had i think corrupted her mind altogether she cared for nothing but evidence she was a rustling incessant sandy peering woman with a lorgnette and rapid confidential lisping undertones and she wanted to know who everybody was and how they were related this kept us turning towards the other tablesand when my information failed she would call upon sir godfrey klavier who was explaining rather testily on account of her interruptions to philip christian and a little lady in black and the elder fawney girl just why he didnt believe lady ladislaws new golf course would succeed there were two or three other casual people at our table one of the roden girls a young guardsman and i think some other man whom i dont clearly remember  and so thats the great mr justin rustled lady viping and stared across me  i saw evesham leaning rather over the table to point some remark at mary and noted her lips part to reply  what is the word insisted lady viping like a fly in my ear  i turned on her guiltily  whether its brachy said lady viping or whether its dollyi can never remember  i guessed she was talking of justins head ohbrachycephalic i said  i had lost marys answer  they say hes a woman hater said lady viping it hardly looks like it now does it  who i asked whatohjustin  the great financial cannibal suppose she turned him into a philanthropist stranger things have happened looknow the mans face is positively tender  i hated looking and i could not help but look it was as if this detestable old woman was dragging me down and down down far below all dignity to her own level of a peeping observer justin was saying something to mary in an undertone something that made her glance up swiftly and at me before she answered and there i was with my head side by side with those quivering dyed curls that flighty black bonnet that remorseless observant lorgnette i could have sworn aloud at the hopeless indignity of my pose  i saw mary color quickly before i looked away  charming isnt she said lady viping and i discovered those infernal glasses were for a moment honoring me they shut with a click ham said lady viping i told him no hamand now i rememberi like ham or rather i like spinach i forgot the spinach one has the ham for the spinachdont you think yestell him shes a perfect dresden ornament mr stratton shes adorable  lorgnette and search for fresh topics who is the dark lady with the slight moustachesitting there next to guy sir godfrey who is the dark lady no i dont mean mary fitton over there mrs roperstone ooh the mrs roperstone renewed lorgnette and click yesham with spinach a lot of spinach theres mr evesham laughing again hes greatly amused unusual for him to laugh twice at least aloud rustle and adjustment of lorgnette mr stratton dont you thinkexactly like a little shepherdess only i cant say i think mr justin is like a shepherd on the whole more like a large cloisonné jar now guy would do as a pair theyre beautiful pity theyre brother and sister curious how that boy manages to be big and yet delicate hm mixed mantel ornaments sir godfrey how old is mrs roperstone you never know on principle i think i shall make mr stratton guess what do you think mr stratton you never guess on principle well were all very high principled fresh exploratory movements of the lorgnette mr stratton tell me is that little peaked man near lady ladislaw mr roperstone i thought as much  all this chatter is mixed up in my mind with an unusual sense of hovering attentive menservants who seemed all of them to my heated imagination to be watching me and particularly one cleanshaven reddishhaired fullfaced young man lest i looked too much at the lady mary christian of course they were merely watching our plates and glasses but my nerves and temper were now in such a state that if my man went off to the buffet to get sir godfrey the pickled walnuts i fancied he went to report the progress of my infatuation and if a strange face appeared with the cider cup that this was a new observer come to mark the revelation of my behavior my food embarrassed me i found hidden meanings in the talk of the roden girl and her guardsman and an ironical discovery in sir godfreys eye  i felt indignant with mary i felt she disowned me and deserted me and repudiated me that she ought in some manner to have recognized me i gave her no credit for her speech to me before the lunch or her promise to measure against me again i blinded myself to all her frank friendliness i felt she ought not to notice justin ought not to answer him  clearly she liked those men to flatter her she liked it  i remember too so that i must have noted it and felt it then as a thing perceived for the first time the large dignity of the room the tall windows and splendid rich curtains the darkened hoppners upon the walls i noted too the quality and abundance of the table things and there were grapes and peaches strawberries cherries and green almonds piled lavishly above the waiting dessert plates with the golden knives and forks upon a table in the sunshine of the great bay the very sunshine filtered through the tall narrow panes from the great chestnut trees without seemed of a different quality from the common light of day  i felt like a poor relation i sympathized with anarchists we had come out of the park now finally both mary and iinto this  mr stratton i am sure agrees with me  for a time i had been marooned conversationally and lady viping had engaged sir godfrey evidently he was refractory and she was back at me  look at it now in profile she said and directed me once more to that unendurable grouping justin again  its a heavy face i said  its a powerful face i wouldnt care anyhow to be up against itas people say and the lorgnette shut with a click what is this peachesyes and give me some cream   i hovered long for that measuring i had been promised on the steps but either mary had forgotten or she deemed it wiser to forget   § 11  i took my leave of lady ladislaw when the departure of evesham broke the party into dispersing fragments i started down the drive towards the rectory and then vaulted the railings by the paddock and struck across beyond the mere i could not go home with the immense burthen of thought and new ideas and emotions that had come upon me i felt confused and shattered to incoherence by the new quality of marys atmosphere i turned my steps towards the wilder lonelier part of the park beyond the killing wood and lay down in a wide space of grass between two divergent thickets of bracken and remained there for a very long time  there it was in the park that for the first time i pitted myself against life upon a definite issue and prepared my first experience of defeat i will have her i said hammering at the turf with my fist i will i do not care if i give all my life  then i lay still and bit the sweetness out of joints of grass and presently thought and planned     chapter the fourth  the marriage of the lady mary christian   § 1  for three or four days i could get no word with mary i could not now come and go as i had been able to do in the days when we were still the children i could not work i could not rest i prowled as near as i could to burnmore house hoping for some glimpse of her waiting for the moment when i could decently present myself again at the house  when at last i called justin had gone and things had some flavor of the ancient time lady ladislaw received me with an airy intimacy all the careful responsibility of her luncheon party manner thrown aside and how goes cambridge she sang sailing through the great saloon towards me and i thought that for the occasion cambridge instead of oxford would serve sufficiently well youll find them all at tennis said lady ladislaw and waved me on to the gardens there i found all four of them and had to wait until their set was finished  mary i said at the first chance are we never to talk again  its all different she said  i am dying to talk to youas we used to talk  and istevenage but you see  next time i come i said i shall bring you a letter there is so much  no she said cant you get up in the morning very earlyfive or six no one is up until ever so late  id stay up all night  serve said maxton who was playing the two of us and had stopped i think to tighten a shoe  things conspired against any more intimacy for a time but we got our moment on the way to tea she glanced back at philip who was loosening the net and then forward to estimate the distance of maxton and guy theyre all three going she said after tuesday thenbefore six  wednesday  yes  suppose after all she threw out i cant come  fortunes of war  if i cant come one morning i may come another she spoke hastily and i perceived that guy and maxton had turned and were waiting for us  you know the old ice house  towards the gardens  yes on the further side dont come by the road come across by the end of the mere lie in the bracken until you see me coming ive not played tennis a dozen times this year not half a dozen  this last was for the boys  youve played twenty times at least since youve been here said guy with the simple bluntness of a brother im certain   § 2  to this day a dewy morning in late august brings back the thought of mary and those stolen meetings i have the minutest recollection of the misty bloom upon the turf and the ragged filmy carpet of gossamer on either hand of the warm wetness of every little blade and blossom and of the little scraps and seeds of grass upon my soaking and discolored boots our footsteps were dark green upon the dewgrey grass and i feel the same hungry freshness again at the thought of those stolen meetings presently came the sunrise blinding warming dewdispelling arrows of gold smiting through the tree stems a flood of light foaming over the bracken and gilding the under sides of the branches everything is different and distinctive in those opening hours everything has a different value from what it has by day all the little things upon the ground fallen branches tussocks woodpiles have a peculiar intensity and importance seem magnified because of the length of their shadows in the slanting rays and all the great trees seem lifted above the light and merged with the sky and at last a cool grey outline against the blaze and with a glancing iridescent halo about her comes mary flitting adventurous friendly wonderful  oh stevenage she cries to see you again  we each hold out both our hands and clasp and hesitate and rather shyly kiss  come she says we can talk for an hour its still not six and there is a fallen branch where we can sit and put our feet out of the wet oh its so good to be out of things againclean out of thingswith you look there is a stag watching us  youre glad to be with me i ask jealous of the very sunrise  i am always glad she says to be with you why dont we always get up at dawn stevenage every day of our lives  we go rustling through the grass to the prostrate timber she has chosen i can remember even the thin bracelet on the wrist of the hand that lifted her skirt i help her to clamber into a comfortable fork from which her feet can swing  such fragments as this are as bright as undimmed as if we had met this morning but then comes our conversation and that i find vague and irregularly obliterated but i think i must have urged her to say she loved me and beat about the bush of that declaration too fearful to put my hearts wish to the issue that she would promise to wait three years for meuntil i could prove it was not madness for her to marry me i have been thinking of it all night and every night since i have been here i said somehow i will do something in some wayi will get hold of things believe mewith all my strength  i was standing between the forking boughs and she was looking down upon me  stephen dear she said dear dear boy i have never wanted to kiss you so much in all my life dear come close to me  she bent her fresh young face down to mine her fingers were in my hair  my knight she whispered close to me my beautiful young knight  i whispered back and touched her dew fresh lips  and tell me what you would do to conquer the world for me she asked  i cannot remember now a word of all the vague threatenings against the sundering universe with which i replied her hand was on my shoulder as she listened  but i do know that even on this first morning she left me with a sense of beautiful unreality of having dipped for some precious moments into heroic gossamer all my world subjugation seemed already as evanescent as the morning haze and the vanishing dews as i stood a little hidden in the shadows of the killing wood and ready to plunge back at the first hint of an observer and watched her slender whiteness flit circumspectly towards the house   § 3  our next three or four meetings are not so clearly defined we did not meet every morning for fear that her early rising should seem too punctual to be no more than a chance impulse nor did we go to the same place but there stands out very clearly a conversation in a different mood we had met at the sham ruins at the far end of the great shrubbery a huge shattered corinthian portico of rather damaged stucco giving wide views of the hills towards alfridsham between its three erect pillars and affording a dry seat upon its fallen ones it was an overcast morning i remember probably the hour was earlier a kind of twilight clearness made the world seem strange and the bushes and trees between us and the house very heavy and still and dark and we were at cross purpose for now it was becoming clear to me that mary did not mean to marry me that she dreaded making any promise to me for the future that all the heroic common cause i wanted with her was quite alien to her dreams  but mary i said looking at her colorless delicate face dont you love me dont you want me  you know i love you stevenage she said you know  but if two people love one another they want to be always together they want to belong to each other  she looked at me with her face very intent upon her meaning stevenage she said after one of those steadfast pauses of hers i want to belong to myself  naturally i said with an air of disposing of an argument and then paused  why should one have to tie oneself always to one other human being she asked why must it be like that  i do not remember how i tried to meet this extraordinary idea one loves i may have said the subtle scepticisms of her mind went altogether beyond my habits of thinking it had never occurred to me that there was any other way of living except in these voluntary and involuntary mutual servitudes in which men and women live and die if you love me i urged if you love me i want nothing better in all my life but to love and serve and keep you and make you happy  she surveyed me and weighed my words against her own  i love meeting you she said i love your going because it means that afterwards you will come again i love thisthis slipping out to you but up there there is a room in the house that is my placememy own nobody follows me there i want to go on living stevenage just as i am living now i dont want to become someones certain possession to be just usual and familiar to anyone no not even to you  but if you love i cried  to you least of all dont you seei want to be wonderful to you stevenage more than to anyone i wanti want always to make your heart beat faster i want always to be coming to you with my own heart beating faster always and always i want it to be like that just as it has been on these mornings it has been beautifulaltogether beautiful  yes i said rather helplessly and struggled with great issues i had never faced before  it isnt i said how people live  it is how i want to live said mary  it isnt the way life goes  i want it to be why shouldnt it be why at any rate shouldnt it be for me   § 4  i made some desperate schemes to grow suddenly rich and powerful and i learnt for the first time my true economic value already my father and i had been discussing my prospects in life and he had been finding me vague and difficult i was full of large political intentions but so far i had made no definite plans for a living that would render my political ambitions possible it was becoming apparent to me that for a poor man in england the only possible route to political distinction is the bar and i was doing my best to reconcile myself to the years of waiting and practice that would have to precede my political début  my father disliked the law and i do not think it reconciled him to the idea of my being a barrister that afterwards i hoped to become a politician it isnt in our temperament stephen he said its a pushing bullying cramming base life i dont see you succeeding there and i dont see myself rejoicing even if you do succeed you have to shout and strattons dont shout you have to be smart and tricky and theres never been a smart and tricky stratton yet you have to snatch opportunities and get the better of the people and misrepresent the realities of every case you touch youre a paid misrepresenter they say youll get a fellowship stephen why not stay up and do some thinking for a year or so therell be enough to keep you write a little  the bar i said is only a means to an end  if you succeed  if i succeed one has to take the chances of life everywhere  and what is the end  constructive statesmanship  not in that way said my father pouring himself a second glass of port and turned over my highsounding phrase with a faint hint of distaste constructive statesmanship no once a barrister always a barrister youll only be a party politician vulgar men vulgar if you succeed that is  he criticized me but he did not oppose me and already in the beginning of the summer we had settled that i should be called to the bar  now suddenly i wanted to go back upon all these determinations i began to demand in the intellectual slang of the time more actuality and to amaze my father with talk about empire makers and the greatness of lord strathcona and cecil rhodes why i asked shouldnt i travel for a year in search of opportunity at oxford i had made acquaintance with a son of pramleys the big mexican and borneo man and to him i wrote apropos of a halfforgotten midnight talk in the rooms of some common friend he wrote back with the suggestion that i should go and talk to his father and i tore myself away from mary and went up to see that great exploiter of undeveloped possibilities and have one of the most illuminating and humiliating conversations in the world he was i remember a little palecomplexioned slowspeaking man with a humorous blue eye a faint just perceptible northern accent and a trick of keeping silent for a moment after you had finished speaking and he talked to me as one might talk to a child of eight who wanted to know how one could become a commanderinchief his son had evidently emphasized my union reputation and he would have been quite willing i perceived to give me employment if i had displayed the slightest intelligence or ability in any utilizable direction but quite dreadfully he sounded my equipment with me and showed me the emptiness of my stores  you want some way that gives you a chance of growing rich rapidly he said aye its not a bad idea but theres others you know have tried that game before ye  you dont want riches just for riches but for an end aye aye its the spending attracts ye youd not have me think youd the sin of avarice im clear on that about ye  well he explained its all one of three things we do you knowprospecting and forestalling andjust stealing and the only respectable way is prospecting youd prefer the respectable way i suppose i knew ye would well lets see what chances ye have  and he began to probe my practical knowledge it was like an unfit man stripping for a medical inspection did i know anything of oil of rubber of sugar of substances generally had i studied mineralogy or geology had i any ideas of industrial processes of technical chemistry of rare minerals of labor problems and the handling of alien labor of the economics of railway management or of camping out in dry thinly populated countries or again could i maybe speak spanish or italian or russian the little dons who career about oxford afoot and awheel wearing old gowns and mortarboards giggling over spooners latest and being tremendous characters in the intervals of concocting the rulingclass mind had turned my mind away from such matters altogether i had left that sort of thing to germans and eastend jews and young men from the uppergrade board schools of sheffield and birmingham i was made to realize appalling wildernesses of ignorance  you see said old pramley you dont seem to know anything whatever its a deeficulty itll stand in your way a little now though no doubt youd be quick at the uptakeafter all the education theyve given ye but it stands in your way if ye think of setting out to do something large and effective just immediately  moreover it came out i forget now how that i hadnt clearly grasped the difference between cumulative and noncumulative preference shares  i remember too how i dined alone that evening in a mood between frantic exasperation and utter abasement in the window of the mediated universities club of which i was a junior member under the undergraduate rule and i lay awake all night in one of the austere club bedrooms saying to old pramley a number of extremely able and penetrating things that had unhappily not occurred to me during the progress of our interview i didnt go back to burnmore for several days i had set my heart on achieving something on returning with some earnest of the great attack i was to make upon the separating great world between myself and mary i am far enough off now from that angry and passionate youngster to smile at the thought that my subjugation of things in general and high finance in particular took at last the form of proposing to go into the office of bean medhurst stockton and schnadhorst upon half commission terms i was awaiting my fathers reply to this startling new suggestion when i got a telegram from mary we are going to scotland unexpectedly come down and see me i went home instantly and told my father i had come to talk things over with him a note from mary lay upon the halltable as i came in and encountered my father i thought it better to come down to you i said with my glance roving to find that and then i met his eye it wasnt altogether an unkindly eye but i winced dishonestly  talking is better for all sorts of things said my father and wanted to know if the weather had been as hot in london as it had been in burnmore  marys note was in pencil scribbled hastily i was to wait after eleven that night near the great rose bushes behind the pavilion long before eleven i was there on a seat in a thick shadow looking across great lakes of moonlight towards the phantom statuary of the italianate garden and the dark laurels that partly masked the house i waited nearly an hour an hour of stillness and small creepings and cheepings and goings to and fro among the branches  in the bushes near by me a little green glowworm shared my vigil  and then wrapped about in a dark velvet cloak still in her white dinner dress with shining gleaming glancing stones about her dear throat warm and wonderful and glowing and daring mary came flitting out of the shadows to me  my dear she whispered panting and withdrawing a little from our first passionate embrace oh my dear how did i come twice before when i was a girl i got out this way by the corner of the conservatory and down the laundry wall you cant see from here but its easyeasy theres a tree that helps and now i have come that way to you you  oh love me my stephen love me dear love me as if we were never to love again am i beautiful my dear am i beautiful in the moonlight tell me  perhaps this is the night of our lives dear perhaps never again will you and i be happy  but the wonder dear the beauty isnt it still its as if nothing really stood solid and dry as if everything floated  everyone in all the world has gone to sleep tonight and left the world to us come come this way and peep at the house there stoopunder the branches see not a light is left and all its blinds are drawn and its eyes shut one window is open my little window stephen but that is in the shadow where that creeper makes everything black  along here a little further is nightstock nownow sniff stephen sniff the scent of it it lieslike a bank of scented air and stephen there look a stara star without a sound falling out of the blue its gone  there was her dear face close to mine soft under the soft moonlight and the breath of her sweet speech mingled with the scent of the nightstock  that was indeed the most beautiful night of my life a night of moonlight and cool fragrance and adventurous excitement we were transported out of this old world of dusty limitations it was as if for those hours the curse of man was lifted from our lives no one discovered us no evil thing came near us for a long time we lay close in one anothers arms upon a bank of thyme our heads were close together her eyelashes swept my cheek we spoke rarely and in soft whispers and our hearts were beating beating we were as solemn as great mountains and as innocent as sleeping children our kisses were kisses of moonlight and it seemed to me that nothing that had ever happened or could happen afterwards mattered against that happiness  it was nearly three when at last i came back into my fathers garden no one had missed me from my room and the house was all asleep but i could not get in because i had closed a latch behind me and so i stayed in the little arbor until day watching the day break upon long beaches of pale cloud over the hills towards alfridsham i slept at last with my head upon my arms upon the stone table until the noise of shooting bolts and doors being unlocked roused me to watch my chance and slip back again into the house and up the shuttered darkened staircase to my tranquil undisturbed bedroom   § 5  it was in the vein of something evasive in marys character that she let me hear first of her engagement to justin through the times away there in scotland she got i suppose new perspectives new ideas the glow of our immediate passion faded the thing must have been drawing in upon her for some time perhaps she had meant to tell me of it all that night when she had summoned me to burnmore looking back now i am the more persuaded that she did but the thing came to me in london with the effect of an immense treachery within a day or so of the newspapers announcement she had written me a long letter answering some argument of mine and saying nothing whatever of the people about her even then justin must have been asking her to marry him her mind must have been full of that question then came a storm of disappointment humiliation and anger with this realization i can still feel myself writing and destroying letters to her letters of satire of protest oddly enough i cannot recall the letter that at last i sent her but it is eloquent of the weak boyishness of my position that i sent it in our usual furtive manner accepted every precaution that confessed the impossibility of our relationship no she scribbled back you do not understand i cannot write i must talk to you  we had a secret meeting  with beatrice normandys connivance she managed to get away for the better part of the day and we spent a long morning in argument in the botanical gardensthat obvious solitudeand afterwards we lunched upon ham and ginger beer at a little openair restaurant near the broad walk and talked on until nearly four we were so young that i think we both felt beneath our very real and vivid emotions a gratifying sense of romantic resourcefulness in this prolonged discussion there is something ridiculously petty and imitative about youth something too naïvely noble and adventurous i can never determine if older people are less generous and imaginative or merely less absurd i still recall the autumnal melancholy of that queer neglectedlooking place in which i had never been before and which i have never revisiteda memory of walking along narrow garden paths beside queer leafchoked artificial channels of water under yellowtinted trees of rustic bridges going nowhere in particular and of a kind of brickwork ruined castle greatly decayed and ivygrown in which we sat for a long time looking out upon a lawn and a wide gravel path leading to a colossal frontage of conservatory  i must have been resentful and bitter in the beginning of that talk i do not remember that i had any command of the situation or did anything but protest throughout that day i was too full of the egotism of the young lover to mark marys moods and feelings it was only afterwards that i came to understand that she was not wilfully and deliberately following the course that was to separate us that she was taking it with hesitations and regrets yet she spoke plainly enough she spoke with a manifest sincerity of feeling and while i had neither the grasp nor the subtlety to get behind her mind i perceive now as i think things out that lady ladislaw had both watched and acted had determined her daughters ideas sown her mind with suggestions imposed upon her a conception of her situation that now dominated all her thoughts  dear stephen reiterated mary i love you i do clearly definitely deliberately love you havent i told you that havent i made that plain to you  but you are going to marry justin  stephen dear can i possibly marry you can i  why not why not make the adventure of life with me dare  she looked down on me she was sitting upon a parapet of the brickwork and i was below her she seemed to be weighing possibilities  why not i cried even now why not run away with me throw our two lives together do as lovers have dared to do since the beginning of things let us go somewhere together  but stephen she asked softly where  anywhere  she spoke as an elder might do to a child no tell me whereexactly where would it be where should we go how should we live tell me make me see it stephen  you are too cruel to me mary i said how can ion the spur of the momentarrange  but dear suppose it was somewhere very grimy and narrow somethinglike some of those back streets i came through to get here suppose it was some dreadful place and you had no money and we were both worried and miserable one gets ill in such places if i loved you stepheni mean if you and iif you and i were to be together i should want it to be in sunshine i should want it to be among beautiful forests and mountains somewhere very beautiful  why not  becausetoday i know there are no such places in the world for us stephen they are dreams  for three years now i said i have dreamed such dreams  oh i cried out stung by my own words but this is cowardice why should we submit to this old world why should we give upthings you have dreamed as well as i you said onceto hear my voicecalling in the morning let us take each other mary now now let us take each other andi still remember my impotent phraseafterwards count the cost  if i were a queen said mary but you see i am not a queen   so we talked in fragments and snatches of argument and all she said made me see more clearly the large hopelessness of my desire at least i urged do not marry justin now give me a chance give me three years mary three short years to work to do something  she knew so clearly now the quality of her own intentions  dear stephen she explained if i were to come away with you and marry you in just a little time i should cease to be your lover i should be your squaw i should have to share your worries and make your coffeeand disappoint you disappoint you and fail you in a hundred ways think should i be any good as a squaw how can one love when one knows the coffee isnt what it should be and one is giving ones lover indigestion and i dont want to be your squaw i dont want that at all it isnt how i feel for you i dont want to be your servant and your possession  but you will be justinssquaw you are going to marry him  that is all different stevenage between him and me there will be space air dignity endless servants  but i choked you he he will make love to you mary  you dont understand stephen  he will make love to you mary mary dont you understand these things weve never talked of them you will bear him children  no she said  but  no he promises stepheni am to own myself  buthe marries you  yes because hehe admires me he cannot live without me he loves my company he loves to be seen with me he wants me with him to enjoy all the things he has cant you understand stephen  but do you mean  our eyes met  stephen she said i swear  but he hopes  i dont care he has promised i have his promise i shall be free oh i shall be freefree he is a different man from you stephen he isnt so fierce he isnt so greedy  but it parts us  only from impossible things  it parts us  it does not even part us stevenage we shall see one another we shall talk to one another  i shall lose you  i shall keep you  but ido you expect me to be content with this  i will make you content oh stephen dear cant there be lovelove without this clutching this gripping this carrying off  you will be carried altogether out of my world  if i thought that stephen indeed i would not marry him  but i insisted we should be parted and parted in the end for ever and there i was the wiser of the two i knew the insatiable urgency within myself i knew that if i continued to meet mary i should continue to desire her until i possessed her altogether   § 6  i cannot reproduce with any greater exactness than this the quality and gist of our daylong conversation between us was a deep affection and instinctive attraction and our mental temperaments and our fundamental ideas were profoundly incompatible we were both still very young in quality we had scarcely begun to think ourselves out we were greatly swayed by the suggestion of our circumstances complex incoherent and formless emotions confused our minds but i see now that in us there struggled vast creative forces forces that through a long future in forms as yet undreamt of must needs mould the destiny of our race far more than mary i was accepting the conventions of our time it seemed to me not merely reasonable but necessary that because she loved me she should place her life in my youthful and inexpert keeping share my struggles and the real hardships they would have meant for her devote herself to my happiness bear me children be my inspiration in imaginative moments my squaw helper and possession through the whole twentyfour hours of every day and incidentally somehow rear whatever family we happened to produce and i was still amazed in the depths of my being that she did not reciprocate this simple and comprehensive intention i was ready enough i thought for equivalent sacrifices i was prepared to give my whole life subordinate all my ambitions to the effort to maintain our home if only i could have her have her for my own i was ready to pledge every hour i had still to live to that service it seemed mere perversity to me then that she should turn even such vows as that against me  but i dont want it stevenage she said i dont want it i want you to go on to the service of the empire i want to see you do great things do all the things weve talked about and written about dont you see how much better that is for you and for meand for the world and our lives i dont want you to become a horrible little specialist in feeding and keeping me  thenthen wait for me i cried  buti want to live myself i dont want to wait i want a great house i want a great position i want space and freedom i want to have clothesand be as splendid as your career is going to be i want to be a great and shining lady in your life i cant always live as i do now dependent on my mother whirled about by her movements living in her light why should i be just a hardup vestal virgin stephen in your honor you will not be able to marry me for years and years and yearsunless you neglect your work unless you throw away everything that is worth having between us in order just to get me  but i want you mary i cried drumming at the little green table with my fist i want you i want nothing else in all the world unless it has to do with you  youve got meas much as anyone will ever have me youll always have me always i will write to you talk to you watch you why are you so greedy stephen why are you so ignoble if i were to come now and marry you it wouldnt help you it would turn you intoa wifekeeper into the sort of uninteresting preoccupied man one sees running after and gloating over the woman hes boughtat the price of his money and his dignityand everything its not proper for a man to live so for a woman and her children its dwarfish its enslaving itsits indecent stephen id hate you so    § 7  we parted at last at a cabrank near a bridge over the canal at the western end of park village i remember that i made a last appeal to her as we walked towards it and that we loitered on the bridge careless of who might see us there in a final conflict of our wills before it is too late mary dear i said  she shook her head her white lips pressed together  but after the things that have happened that nightthe moonlight  its not fair she said for you to talk of that it isnt fair  but mary this is parting this indeed is parting  she answered never a word  then at least talk to me again for one time more  afterwards she said afterwards i will talk to you dont make things too hard for me stephen  if i could i would make this impossible itsits hateful  she turned to the kerb and for a second or so we stood there without speaking then i beckoned to a hansom  she told me beatrice normandys address  i helped her into the cab goodbye i said with a weak affectation of an everyday separation and i turned to the cabman with her instructions  then again we looked at one another the cabman waited all right sir he asked  go ahead i said and lifted my hat to the little white face within  i watched the cab until it vanished round the curve of the road then i turned about to a world that had become very large and empty and meaningless   § 8  i struggled feebly to arrest the course of events i wrote mary some violent and bitter letters i treated her as though she alone were responsible for my life and hers i said she had diverted my energies betrayed me ruined my life i hinted she was coldblooded mercenary shameless someday you with that quick temper of yours and your power of expression will understand that impulse to write to pour out a passionately unjust interpretation of some nearly intolerable situation and it is not the least of all the things i owe to mary that she understood my passion and forgave those letters and forgot them i tried twice to go and see her but i do not think i need tell you little son of these selfinflicted humiliations and degradations an angry man is none the less a pitiful man because he is injurious the hope that had held together all the project of my life was gone and all my thoughts and emotions lay scattered in confusion  you see my little son there are two sorts of love we use one name for very different things the love that a father bears his children that a mother feels that comes sometimes a strange brightness and tenderness that is half pain at the revelation of some touching aspect of one long known to one at the sight of a wife bent with fatigue and unsuspicious of ones presence at the wretchedness and perplexity of some wrongdoing brother or at an old servants unanticipated tears that is lovelike the love god must bear us that is the love we must spread from those of our marrow until it reaches out to all mankind that will some day reach out to all mankind but the love of a young man for a woman takes this quality only in rare moments of illumination and complete assurance my love for mary was a demand it was a wanton claim i scored the more deeply against her for every moment of happiness she gave me i see now that as i emerged from the first abjection of my admiration and began to feel assured of her affection i meant nothing by her but to possess her i did not want her to be happy as i want you to be happy even at the price of my life i wanted her i wanted her as barbarians want a hunted enemy alive or dead it was a flaming jealousy to have her mine that granted then i was prepared for all devotions  this is how men love women almost as exclusively and fiercely i think do women love men and the deepest question before humanity is just how far this jealous greed may be subdued to a more generous passion the fierce jealousy of men for women and women for men is the very heart of all our social jealousies the underlying tension of this crowded modern life that has grown out of the ampler simpler ancient life of men that is why we compete against one another so bitterly refuse association and generous cooperations keep the struggle for existence hard and bitter hamper and subordinate the women as they in their turn would if they could hamper and subordinate the menbecause each must thoroughly have his own  and i knew my own heart too well to have any faith in justin and his word he was taking what he could and his mind would never rest until some day he had all i had seen him only once but the heavy and resolute profile above his bent back and slender shoulders stuck in my memory  if he was cruel to mary i told her or broke his least promise to her i should kill him   § 9  my distress grew rather than diminished in the days immediately before her marriage and that day itself stands out by itself in my memory a day of wandering and passionate unrest my imagination tormented me with thoughts of justin as a perpetual privileged wooer  well welli will not tell you i will not write the ugly mockeries my imagination conjured up i was constantly on the verge of talking and cursing aloud to myself or striking aimlessly at nothing with clenched fists i was too stupid to leave london too disturbed for work or any distraction of my mind i wandered about the streets of london all day in the morning i came near going to the church and making some preposterous interruptions and i remember discovering three or four carriages adorned with white favors and a little waiting crowd outside that extinguisherspired place at the top of regent street and wondering for a moment or so at their common preoccupation and then understanding of course another marriage of all devilish institutions  what was i to do with my life now what was to become of my life i can still recall the sense of blank unanswerableness with which these questions dominated my mind and associated with it is an effect of myself as a small human being singular and apart wandering through a number of london landscapes at one time i was in a great grey smokerimmed autumnal space of park much cut up by railings and worn by cricket pitches far away from any idea of the thames and in the distance over the tops of trees i discovered perplexingly the clustering masts and spars of ships i have never seen that place since then the angel at islington is absurdly mixed up with the distresses of this day i attempted some great detour thence and found myself with a dumb irritation returning to the place from another direction i remember too a wide street over which passes a thundering railway bridge borne upon colossal rounded pillars of iron and carrying in white and blue some big advertisement i think of the daily telegraph near there i thought a crowd was gathered about the victim of some accident and thrusting myself among the people with a vague idea of help discovered a man selling a remedy for corns and somewhere about this north region i discovered i was faint with hunger and got some bread and cheese and beer in a gaudily decorated saloon bar with a sanded floor i resisted a monstrous impulse to stay in that place and drink myself into inactivity and stupefaction with beer  then for a long time i sat upon an iron seat near some flower beds in a kind of garden that had the headstones of graves arranged in a row against a yellow brick wall the place was flooded with the amber sunshine of a september afternoon i shared the seat with a nursemaid in charge of a perambulator and several scuffling uneasy children and i kept repeating to myself by now it is all over the thing is done  my sense of the enormity of london increased with the twilight and began to prevail a little against my intense personal wretchedness i remember wastes of building enterprise interminable vistas of wide dark streets with passing trams and here and there at strategic corners coruscating groups of shops and somewhere i came along a narrow street suddenly upon the distant prospect of a great monstrous absurd place on a steep hill against the last brightness of the evening sky a burlesque block of building with huge truncated pyramids at either corner that i have since learnt was the alexandra palace it was so queer and bulky that it arrested and held my attention struck on my memory with an almost dreamlike quality so that years afterwards i went to muswell hill to see if indeed there really was such a place on earth or whether i had had a waking nightmare during my wanderings  i wandered far that night very far some girl accosted me a thinfaced ruined child younger by a year or so than myself i remembered how i talked to her foolish rambling talk if you loved a man and he was poor youd wait i said youd stick to him youd not leave him just to get married to a richer man  we prowled talking for a time and sat upon a seat somewhere near the regents park canal i rather think i planned to rescue her from a fallen life but somehow we dropped that topic i know she kissed me i have a queer impression that it came into my head to marry her i put all my loose money in her hands at last and went away extraordinarily comforted by her i know not how leaving her no doubt wondering greatly  i did not go to bed that night at all nor to the office next morning i never showed myself in the office again instead i went straight down to my father and told him i wanted to go to the war forthwith i had an indistinct memory of a promise i had made mary to stay in england but i felt it was altogether unendurable that i should ever meet her again my father sat at table over the remains of his lunch and regarded me with astonishment with the beginnings of protest  i want to get away i said and to my own amazement and shame i burst into tears  my boy he gasped astonished and terrified youveyouve not donesome foolish thing  no i said already wiping the tears from my face nothing but i want to go away  you shall do as you please he said and sat for a moment regarding his only son with unfathomable eyes  then he got up with a manner altogether matteroffact came halfway round the table and mixed me a whisky and soda it wont be much of a war im told he said with the syphon in his hands breaking a silence i sometimes wishi had seen a bit of soldiering and this seems to be an almost unavoidable war now at any rate its unavoidable drink this and have a biscuit  he turned to the mantelshelf and filled his pipe with his broad back to me yes he said you youll be interested in the war i hope i hope youll have a good time there     chapter the fifth  the war in south africa   § 1  mary and i did not meet again for five years and for nearly all that time i remained in south africa i went from england a boy i came back seasoned into manhood they had been years of crowded experience rapid yet complicated growth disillusionment and thought responsibility had come to me i had seen death i had seen suffering and held the lives of men in my hands  of course one does not become a soldier on active service at once for the wishing and there was not at first that ready disposition on the part of the home military authorities which arose later to send out young enthusiasts i could ride and shoot fairly well and accordingly i decided to go on my own account to durbanfor it was manifest that things would begin in nataland there attach myself to some of the local volunteer corps that would certainly be raised this took me out of england at once a thing that fell in very well with my mood i would i was resolved begin life afresh i would force myself to think of nothing but the war i would never if i could help it think of mary again  the war had already begun when i reached durban the town was seething with the news of a great british victory at dundee we came into the port through rain and rough weather and passed a big white liner loaded up feverishly from steam tenders with wealthy refugees going englandward from two troopships against the wharves there was a great business of landing horsesthe horses of the dragoons and hussars from india i spent the best part of my first night in south africa in the streets looking in vain for a bedroom and was helped at last by a kindly rickshaw zulu to a shanty where i slept upon three chairs i remember i felt singularly unwanted  the next day i set about my volunteering by midday i had opened communications with that extremely untried and problematical body the imperial light horse and in three days more i was in the company of a mixed batch of men mostly australian volunteers on my way to a place i had never heard of before called ladysmith through a country of increasing picturesqueness and along a curious curving little line whose down traffic seemed always waiting in sidings and consisted of crowded little trains full of pitiful fugitives white brown and black stifled and starving they were all clamoring to buy food and drinkand none seemed forthcoming we shunted once to allow a southbound train to pass a peculiar train that sent everyone on to the line to seeprisoners of war there they were real live enemies rather glum looking out at us with faces very like our ownbut rather more unshaven they had come from the battle of elandslaagte  i had never been out of england before except for a little mountaineering in the french alps and one walking excursion in the black forest and the scenery of lower natal amazed me i had expected nothing nearly so tropical so rich and vivid there were little mozambique monkeys chattering in the thickset trees beside the line and a quantity of unfamiliar birds and gaudy flowers amidst the abundant deep greenery there were aloe and cactus hedges patches of unfamiliar cultivation upon the hills bunchy frondy growths that i learnt were bananas and plantains and there were barbaric insanitarylooking kaffir kraals which i supposed had vanished before our civilization there seemed an enormous quantity of kaffirs all along the lineand all of them men women and children were staring at the train the scenery grew finer and bolder and more bare and mountainous until at last we came out into the great basin in which lay this ladysmith it seemed a poor unimportant dusty little street of huts as we approached it but the great crests beyond struck me as very beautiful in the morning light  i forgot the beauty of those hills as we drew into the station it was the morning after the surrender of nicholsons nek i had come to join an army already tremendously astonished and shattered the sunny prospect of a triumphal procession to pretoria which had been still in mens minds at durban had vanished altogether in rather less than a fortnight of stubborn fighting we had displayed a strategy that was flighty rather than brilliant and lost a whole battery of guns and nearly twelve hundred prisoners we had had compensations our common soldiers were good stuff at any rate but the fact was clear that we were fighting an army not only very much bigger than ours but better equipped with bigger guns better information and it seemed superior strategy we were being shoved back into this ladysmith and encircled this confused disconcerted and thoroughly badtempered army whose mules and bullocks cumbered the central street of the place was all that was left of the british empire in natal behind it was an unprotected country and the line to pietermaritzburg durban and the sea  you cannot imagine how amazed i felt at it i had been prepared for a sort of kentucky quality in the enemy illiteracy pluck guile and good shooting but to find them with more modern arms than our own more modern methods werent we there after all to teach them werent we the twentieth and they the eighteenth century the town had been shelled the day before from those very hills i had admired at any time it might be shelled again the nose of a big gun was pointed out to me by a blasphemous little private in the devons it was a tremendous a profoundly impressive black snout his opinions of the directing wisdom at home were unquotable the platform was a wild confusion of women and children and colored peoplethere was even an invalid lady on a stretcher every noncombatant who could be got out of ladysmith was being hustled out that day everyone was smarting with the sense of defeat in progress everyone was disappointed and worried one got short answers to ones questions for a time i couldnt even find out where i had to go   § 2  i fired my first shot at a fellowcreature within four days of my arrival we rode out down the road to the south to search some hills and found the boers in fair strength away to the east of us we were dismounted and pushed up on foot through a wood to a grassy crest there for the first time i saw the enemy little respectablelooking unsoldierlike figures mostly in black dodging about upon a ridge perhaps a mile away i took a shot at one of these figures just before it vanished into a gully one or two bullets came overhead and i tried to remember what i had picked up about cover they made a sound whifferwhiff a kind of tearing whistle and there was nothing but a distant crackling to give one a hint of their direction until they took effect i remember the peculiar smell of the grass amidst which i crouched my sudden disgust to realize i was lying and had to lie now for an indefinite time in the open sunlight and far from any shade and how i wondered whether after all i had wanted to come to this war  we lay shooting intermittently until the afternoon i couldnt understand why we went forward a little and at last retired upon ladysmith on the way down to the horses i came upon my first dead man he was lying in a crumpled heap not fifty yards from where i had been shooting there he lay the shattered mirror of a world one side of his skull over the ear had been knocked away by a nearly spent bullet and he was crumpled up and face upward as though he had struggled to his feet and fallen back he looked rather horrible with blue eyes wide open and glassily amazed and the black flies clustering upon his clotted wound and round his open mouth  i halted for a moment at the sight and found the keen scrutiny of a fellow trooper upon me no good waiting for him i said with an affectation of indifference but all through the night i saw him again and marvelled at the stupendous absurdity of such a death i was a little feverish i remember and engaged in an interminable theological argument with myself why when a man is dead he should leave so queer and irrelevant a thing as a body to decay  i was already very far away from london and burnmore park i doubt if i thought of mary at all for many days   § 3  it isnt my business to write here any consecutive story of my war experiences luck and some latent quality in my composition made me a fairly successful soldier among other things i have an exceptionally good sense of direction and that was very useful to me and in burnmore park i suppose i had picked up many of the qualities of a scout i did some fair outpost work during the ladysmith siege i could report as well as crawl and watch and i was already a sergeant when we made a night attack and captured and blew up long tom there after the fight while we were covering the engineers i got a queer steel ball about the size of a pea in my arm a bicycle bearings ball it was and had my first experience of an army surgeons knife next day it was much less painful than i had expected i was also hit during the big assault on the sixth of january in the left shoulder but so very slightly that i wasnt technically disabled they were the only wounds i got in the war but i went under with dysentery before the relief and though i was by no means a bad case i was a very yellowfaced brokenlooking convalescent when at last the boer hosts rolled northward again and bullers men came riding across the flats  i had seen some stimulating things during those four months of actual warfare a hundred intense impressions of death wounds anger patience brutality courage generosity and wasteful destructionabove all wasteful destructionto correct the easy optimistic patriotism of my university days there is a depression in the opening stages of fever and a feebleness in a convalescence on a starvation diet that leads men to broad and sober views heavens how i hated the horse extractchevril we called itthat served us for beef tea when i came down from ladysmith to the sea to pick up my strength i had not an illusion left about the serene divinely appointed empire of the english but if i had less national conceit i had certainly more patriotic determination that grew with every day of returning health the reality of this war had got hold of my imagination as indeed for a time it got hold of the english imagination altogether and i was now almost fiercely keen to learn and do at the first chance i returned to active service and now i was no longer a disconsolate lover taking war for a cure but an earnest and i think reasonably able young officer very alert for chances  i got those chances soon enough i rejoined our men beyond kimberley on the way to mafekingwe were the extreme british left in the advance upon pretoriaand i rode with mahon and was ambushed with him in a little affair beyond koodoosrand it was a sudden brisk encounter we got fired into at close quarters but we knew our work by that time and charged home and brought in a handful of prisoners to make up for the men we had lost a few days later we came into the flattened ruins of the quaintest siege in history  three days after we relieved mafeking i had the luck to catch one of snymans retreating guns rather easily the only big gun that was taken at mafeking i came upon it unexpectedly with about twenty men spotted a clump of brush four hundred yards ahead galloped into it before the boers realized the boldness of our game shot all the draught oxen while they hesitated and held them up until chambers arrived on the scene the incident got perhaps a disproportionate share of attention in the papers at home because of the way in which mafeking had been kept in focus i was mentioned twice again in despatches before we rode across to join roberts in pretoria and see what we believed to be the end of the war we were too late to go on up to komatipoort and had some rather blank and troublesome work on the north side of the town that was indeed the end of the great war the rest was a struggle with guerillas  everyone thought things were altogether over i wrote to my father discussing the probable date of my return but there were great chances still to come for an active young officer the guerilla war was to prolong the struggle yet for a whole laborious eventful year and i was to make the most of those later opportunities  those years in south africa are stuck into my mind likelike those pink colored pages about something else one finds at times in a railway indicateur chance had put this work in my way and started me upon it with a reputation that wasnt altogether deserved and i found i could only live up to it and get things done well by a fixed and extreme concentration of my attention but the whole business was so interesting that i found it possible to make that concentration essentially warfare is a game of elaborate but witty problems in precaution and anticipation with amazing scope for invention you so saturate your mind with the facts and possibilities of the situation that intuitions emerge it did not do to think of anything beyond those facts and possibilities and dodges and counterdodges for to do so was to let in irrelevant and distracting lights during all that concluding year of service i was not so much myself as a forced and artificial thing i made out of myself to meet the special needs of the time i became a boeroutwitting animal when i was tired of this specialized thinking then the best relief i found was some quite trivial occupationplaying poker yelling in the chorus of some interminable song one of the men would sing or coining south african limericks or playing burlesque boutsrimés with fred maxim who was then my second in command  yet occasionally thought overtook me i remember lying one night out upon a huge dark hillside in a melancholy wilderness of rockribbed hills waiting for one of the flying commandoes that were breaking northward from cape colony towards the orange river in front of colonel eustace we had been riding all day i was taking risks in what i was doing and there is something very cheerless in a fireless bivouac my mind became uncontrollably active  it was a clear still night the young moon set early in a glow of white that threw the jagged contours of a hill to the southeast into strange weird prominence the patches of moonshine evaporated from the summits of the nearer hills and left them hard and dark then there was nothing but a great soft black darkness below that jagged edge and above it the stars very large and bright somewhere under that enormous serenity to the south of us the hunted boers must be halting to snatch an hour or so of rest and beyond them again extended the long thin net of the pursuing british it all seemed infinitely small and remote there was no sound of it no hint of it no searchlight at work no faintest streamer of smoke nor the reflection of a solitary fire in the sky  all this business that had held my mind so long was reduced to insignificance between the blackness of the hills and the greatness of the sky a little trouble it seemed of no importance under the southern cross and i fell wondering as i had not wondered for long at the forces that had brought me to this occupation and the strangeness of this game of war which had filled the minds and tempered the spirit of a quarter of a million of men for two hardliving years  i fell thinking of the dead  no soldier in a proper state of mind ever thinks of the dead at times of course one suspects one catches a man glancing at the pair of boots sticking out stiffly from under a blanket but at once he speaks of other things nevertheless some suppressed part of my being had been stirring up ugly and monstrous memories of distortion disfigurement torment and decay of dead men in stained and ragged clothes with their soleworn boots drawn up under them of the blood trail of a dying man who had crawled up to a dead comrade rather than die alone of kaffirs heaping limp pitiful bodies together for burial of the voices of inaccessible wounded in the rain on waggon hill crying in the night of a heap of men we found in a donga three days dead of the dumb agony of shelltorn horses and the vast distressful litter and heavy brooding stench the cans and cartridgecases and filth and bloody rags of a shelled and captured laager i will confess i have never lost my horror of dead bodies they are dreadful to medreadful i dread their stiff attitudes their terrible intent inattention to this day such memories haunt me that night they nearly overwhelmed me i thought of the grim silence of the surgeons tent the miseries and disordered ravings of the fever hospital of the midnight burial of a journalist at ladysmith with the distant searchlight on bulwana flicking suddenly upon our faces and making the coffin shine silver white what a vast trail of destruction south africa had become i thought of the black scorched stones of burnt and abandoned farms of wretched natives we had found shot like dogs and flung aside rottenly amazed decaying in infinite indignity of stories of treachery and fierce revenges sweeping along in the trail of the greater fighting i knew too well of certain atrocitiesone had to believe them incredibly stupid to escape the conviction that they were incredibly evil  for a time my mind could make no headway against its monstrous assemblage of horror there was something in that jagged black hill against the moonshine and the gigantic basin of darkness out of which it rose that seemed to gather all these gaunt and grisly effects into one appalling heap of agonizing futility that rock rose up and crouched like something that broods and watches  i remember i sat up in the darkness staring at it  i found myself murmuring get the proportions of things get the proportions of things i had an absurd impression of a duel between myself and the cavernous antagonism of the huge black spaces below me i argued that all this pain and waste was no more than the selvedge of a proportionately limitless fabric of sane interested impassioned and joyous living these stiff still memories seemed to refute me but why us they seemed to insist in some way its essentialthis margin i stopped at that  if all this pain waste violence anguish is essential to life why does my spirit rise against it what is wrong with me i got from that into a corner of selfexamination did i respond overmuch to these painful aspects in life when i was a boy i had never had the spirit even to kill rats siddons came into the meditation siddons the essential englishman a little scornful throwing out contemptuous phrases soft was i a soft what was a soft something not rough not hearty and bloody i felt i had to own to the wordafter years of resistance a dreadful thing it is when a great empire has to rely upon soft soldiers  was civilization breeding a type of human being too tender to go on living i stuck for a time as one does on these nocturnal occasions at the word hypersensitive going round it and about it  i do not know now how it was that i passed from a mood so darkened and sunless to one of exceptional exaltation but i recall very clearly that i did i believe that i made a crowning effort against this despair and horror that had found me out in the darkness and overcome i cried in my heart for help as a lost child cries to god i seem to remember a rush of impassioned prayer not only for myself not chiefly for myself but for all those smashed and soiled and spoilt and battered residues of men whose memories tormented me i prayed to god that they had not lived in vain that particularly those poor kaffir scouts might not have lived in vain they are like children i said it was a murder of children by children  my horror passed insensibly i have to feel the dreadfulness of these things i told myself because it is good for such a creature as i to feel them dreadful but if one understood it would all be simple not dreadful at all i clung to that and repeated itit would all be perfectly simple it would come out no more horrible than the things that used to frighten me as a childthe shadow on the stairs the white moonrise reflected on a barked and withered tree a peculiar dream of moving geometrical forms an ugly illustration in the arabian nights   i do not know how long i wrestled with god and prayed that night but abruptly the shadows broke and very suddenly and swiftly my spirit seemed to flame up into space like some white beacon that is set alight everything became light and clear and confident i was assured that all was well with us with us who lived and fought and with the dead who rotted now in fifty thousand hasty graves  for a long time it seemed i was repeating again and again with soundless lips and finding the deepest comfort in my wordsand out of our agonies comes victory out of our agonies comes victory have pity on us god our father  i think that mood passed quite insensibly from waking to a kind of clear dreaming i have an impression that i fell asleep and was aroused by a gun yet i was certainly still sitting up when i heard that gun  i was astonished to find things darkly visible about me i had not noted that the stars were growing pale until the sound of this gun very far away called my mind back to the grooves in which it was now accustomed to move i started into absolute wakefulness a gun  i found myself trying to see my watch  i heard a slipping and clatter of pebbles near me and discovered fred maxim at my side look he said hoarse with excitement already he pointed to a string of dim little figures galloping helterskelter over the neck and down the gap in the hills towards us  they came up against the pale western sky little nodding swaying black dots and flashed over and were lost in the misty purple groove towards us they must have been riding through the nightthe british following to them we were invisible behind us was the shining east we were in a shadow still too dark to betray us  in a moment i was afoot and called out to the men my philosophy my deep questionings all torn out of my mind like a page of scribbled poetry plucked out of a business notebook khaki figures were up all about me passing the word and hurrying to their places all the dispositions i had made overnight came back clear and sharp into my mind we hadnt long for preparations  it seems now there were only a few busy moments before the fighting began it must have been much longer in reality by that time we had seen their gun come over and a train of carts they were blundering right into us every moment it was getting lighter and the moment of contact nearer then crack from down below among the rocks and there was a sudden stoppage of the trail of dark shapes upon the hillside crack came a shot from our extreme left i damned the impatient men who had shot away the secret of our presence but we had to keep them at a shooting distance would the boers have the wit to charge through us before the daylight came or should we hold them i had a swift disturbing idea would they try a bolt across our front to the left had we extended far enough across the deep valley to our left but theyd hesitate on account of their gun the gun couldnt go that way because of the gullies and thickets but suppose they tried it i hung between momentous decisions  then all up the dim hillside i could make out the boers halting and riding back one rifle across there flashed  we held them  we had begun the fight of pieters nek which ended before midday with the surrender of simon botha and over seven hundred men it was the crown of all my soldiering   § 4  i came back to england at last when i was twentysix after the peace of vereeniging i worked under the repatriation commission which controlled the distribution of returning prisoners and concentrated population to their homes for the most part i was distributing stock and grain and presently manoeuvring a sort of ploughing flying column that the dearth of horses and oxen made necessary work that was certainly as hard as if far less exciting than war that particular work of replanting the desolated country with human beings took hold of my imagination and for a time at least seemed quite straightforward and understandable the comfort of ceasing to destroy  no one has written anything that really conveys the quality of that repatriation process the queer business of bringing these suspicious illiterate despondent people back to their desolated homes reuniting swarthy fathers and stockish mothers witnessing their touchingly inexpressive encounters doing what one could to put heart into their resumption memories come back to me of great littered heaps of luggage bundles blankets rough boxes piled newly purchased stores readymade doors window sashes heaped ready for the waggons slowmoving apathetic figures sitting and eating an infernal squawking of parrots sometimes a wailing of babies repatriation went on to a parrot obligato and i never hear a parrot squawk without a flash of south africa across my mind all the prisoners i believe brought back parrotssome two or three i had to spread these people out over a country still grassless with teams of warworn oxen mules and horses that died by the dozen on my hands the end of each individual instance was a handshake and one went lumbering on leaving the children one had deposited behind one already playing with old rationtins or hunting about for cartridgecases while adults stared at the work they had to do  there was something elementary in all that redistribution i felt at times like a child playing in a nursery and putting out its bricks and soldiers on the floor there was a kind of greatness too about the process a quality of atonement and the people i was taking back the men anyhow were for the most part charming and wonderful people very simple and emotional so that once a big bearded man when i wanted him in the face of an overflowing waggon to abandon about halfadozen great angular colored west indian shells he had lugged with him from bermuda burst into tears of disappointment i let him take them and at the end i saw them placed with joy and reverence in a little parlor to become the war heirlooms no doubt of a long and bearded family as we shook hands after our parting coffee he glanced at them with something between gratitude and triumph in his eyes  yes that was a great work more especially for a ripening youngster such as i was at that time the memory of long rides and tramps over that limitless veld returns to me lonely in spite of the creaking lumbering waggons and transport riders and kaffirs that followed behind south africa is a country not only of immense spaces but of an immense spaciousness everything is far apart even the grass blades are far apart sometimes one crossed wide stony wastes sometimes came great stretches of tall yellowgreen grass wheelhigh sometimes a little green patch of returning cultivation drew nearer for an hour or so sometimes the blundering toilsome passage of a torrent interrupted our slow onward march and constantly one saw long lines of torn and twisted barbed wire stretching away and away and here and there one found archipelagoes as it were in this dry ocean of the skeletons of cattle and there were places where troops had halted and their scattered rationtins shone like diamonds in the sunshine occasionally i struck talk some returning prisoner some group of discharged british soldiers become carpenters or bricklayers again and making their pound a day by the work of rebuilding always everyone was ready to expatiate upon the situation usually however i was alone thinking over this immense now vanished tornado of a war and this equally astonishing work of healing that was following it  i became keenly interested in all this great business and thought at first of remaining indefinitely in africa repatriation was presently done and finished i had won milners good opinion and he was anxious for me to go on working in relation to the labor difficulty that rose now more and more into prominence behind the agricultural resettlement but when i faced that i found myself in the middle of a tangle infinitely less simple than putting back an agricultural population upon its land   § 5  for the first time in my life i was really looking at the social fundamental of labor  there is something astonishingly naïve in the unconsciousness with which people of our class float over the great economic realities all my life i had been hearing of the working classes of industrialism of labor problems and the organization of labor but it was only now in south africa in this chaotic crude illuminating period of putting a smashed and desolated social order together again that i perceived these familiar phrases represented somethingsomething stupendously real there were i began to recognize two sides to civilization one traditional immemorial universal the side of the homestead the side i had been seeing and restoring and there was another ancient too but never universal as old at least as the mines of syracuse and the building of the pyramids the side that came into view when i emerged from the dusty station and sighted the squat shanties and slender chimneys of johannesburg that uprooted side of social life that accumulation of toilers divorced from the soil which is industrialism and labor and which carries such people as ourselves and whatever significance and possibilities we have as an elephant carries its rider  now all johannesburg and pretoria were discussing labor and nothing but labor bloemfontein was in conference thereon our work of repatriation which had loomed so large on the southernward veld became here a business at once incidental and remote one felt that a little sooner or a little later all that would resume and go on as the rains would and the veldgrass but this was something less kindred to the succession of the seasons and the soil this was a hitch in the upper fabric here in the great ugly minescarred basin of the rand with its bare hillsides half the stamps were standing idle machinery was eating its head off time and water were running to waste amidst an immense exasperated disputation something had given way the war had spoilt the kaffir boy he was demanding enormous wages he was away from johannesburg and above all he would no longer go underground  implicit in all the argument and suggestion about me was this profoundly suggestive fact that some people quite a lot of people scores of thousands had to go underground implicit too always in the discourse was the assumption that the talker or writer in question wasnt for a moment to be expected to go there those others whoever they were had to do that for us before the war it had been the artless portuguese kaffir but he alas was being diverted to openair employment at delagoa bay should we raise wages and go on with the fatal process of spoiling the workers should we by imposing a tremendous huttax drive the kaffir into our toils should we carry the labor hunt across the zambesi into central africa should we follow the lead of lord kitchener and mr creswell and employ the rather dangerous unskilled white labor with ideas about strikes and socialism that had drifted into johannesburg should we do tremendous things with laborsaving machinery or were we indeed desperate yet tempting resort to bring in the cheap indian or chinese coolie  steadily things were drifting towards that last tremendous experiment there was a vigorous opposition in south africa and in england growing there to an outcry but behind that proposal was the one vitalizing conviction in modern initiativeindisputably it would pay it would pay  the human mind has a much more complex and fluctuating process than most of those explanatory people who write about psychology would have us believe instead of that simple direct movement like the movement of a point forward and from here to there ones thoughts advance like an army sometimes extended over an enormous front sometimes in échelon sometimes bunched in a column throwing out skirmishing clouds of emotion some flying and soaring some crawling some stopping and dying in this matter of labor for example i have thought so much thought over the ground again and again come into it from this way and from that way that for the life of me i find it impossible to state at all clearly how much i made of these questions during that johannesburg time i cannot get back into those ancient ignorances revive my old astonishments and discoveries certainly i envisaged the whole process much less clearly than i do now ignored difficulties that have since entangled me regarded with a tremendous perplexity aspects that have now become lucidly plain i came back to england confused and doing what confused people are apt to do clinging to an inadequate phrase that seemed at any rate to define a course of action the word efficiency had got hold of me all our troubles came one assumed from being inefficient one turned towards politics with a bustling air and was all for faultfinding and renovation  i sit here at my desk pen in hand and trace figures on the blottingpaper and wonder how much i understood at that time i came back to england to work on the side of efficiency that is quite certain a little later i was writing articles and letters about it so that much is documented but i think i must have apprehended too by that time some vague outline at least of those wider issues in the sæcular conflict between the new forms of human association and the old to which contemporary politics and our national fate are no more than transitory eddies and rufflings of the surface waters it was all so nakedly plain there on the one hand was the primordial on the other the rankly new the farm on the veld stood on the veld a thing of the veld a thing rooted and established there and nowhere else the dusty crude brickfield desolation of the rand on the other hand did not really belong with any particularity to south africa at all it was one with our camps and armies it was part of something else something still bigger a monstrous shadowy arm had thrust out from europe and torn open this country erected these chimneys piled these heapsand sent the rationtins and cartridgecases to follow them it was gigantic kindred with that ancient predecessor which had built the walls of zimbabwe and this hungry impatient demand for myriads of toilers this threatening inundation of black or brown or yellow bondserfs was just the natural voice of this colossal system to which i belonged which had brought me hither and which i now perceived i did not even begin to understand  one day when asking my way to some forgotten destination i had pointed out to me the grey and roberts deep mine some familiarity in the name set me thinking until i recalled that this was the mine in which i had once heard lady ladislaw confess large holdings this mine in which gangs of indentured chinamen would presently be sweating to pay the wages of the gamekeepers and roadmenders in burnmore park  yes this was what i was taking in at that time but it found meinexpressive what i was saying on my return to england gave me no intimation of the broad conceptions growing in my mind i came back to be one of the many scores of energetic and ambitious young men who were parroting efficiency stirring up people and more particularly stirring up themselves with the utmost vigorand all the time within their secret hearts more than a little at a loss   § 6  while i had been in south africa circumstances had conspired to alter my prospects in life very greatly unanticipated freedoms and opportunities had come to me and it was no longer out of the question for me to think of a parliamentary career our fortunes had altered my father had ceased to be rector of burnmore and had become a comparatively wealthy man  my second cousin reginald stratton had been drowned in finland and his father had only survived the shock of his death a fortnight his sister arthur masons first wife had died in giving birth to a stillborn child the year before and my father found himself suddenly the owner of all that large stretch of developing downland and building land which old reginald had bought between shaddock and golding on the south and west esher station on the north and in addition of considerable investments in northern industrials it was an odd collusion of mortality we had had only the coldest relations with our cousins and now abruptly through their commercial and speculative activities which we had always affected to despise and ignore i was in a position to attempt the realization of my old political ambitions  my cousins house had not been to my fathers taste he had let it and i came to a new home in a pleasant plain redbrick house a hundred and fifty years old perhaps on an open and sunny hillside sheltered by trees eastward and northward a few miles to the southwest of guildford it had all the gracious proportions the dignified simplicity the roomy comfort of the good building of that time it looked sunward we breakfasted in sunshine in the library and outside was an old wall with peach trees and a row of pillar roses heavily in flower i had a little feared this place burnmore rectory had been so absolutely home to me with its quiet serenities its ample familiar garden its greenhouses and intimately known corners but i perceived i might have trusted my fathers character to preserve his essential atmosphere he was so much himself as i remembered him that i did not even observe for a day or so that he had not only aged considerably but discarded the last vestiges of clerical costume in his attire he met me in front of the house and led me into a wide panelled hall and wrung my hand again and again deeply moved and very inexpressive did you have a good journey he asked again and again with tears in his eyes did you have a comfortable journey  ive not seen the house said i it looks fine  youre a man he said and patted my shoulder of course it was at burnmore  youre not changed i said youre not an atom changed  how could i he replied comecome and have something to eat you ought to have something to eat  we talked of the house and what a good house it was and he took me out into the garden to see the peaches and grape vine and then brought me back without showing them to me in order to greet my cousin its very like burnmore he said with his eyes devouring me very like a little more space andno services no services at all that makes a gap of course theres a little chap about here youll findhis name is wednesdaywho sorts my papers and calls himself my secretary not necessary perhaps buti missed the curate  he said he was reading more than he used to do now that the parish was off his hands and he was preparing material for a book it was he explained later to take the form of a huge essay ostensibly on secular canons but its purport was to be no less than the complete secularization of the church of england at first he wanted merely to throw open the cathedral chapters to distinguished laymen irrespective of their theological opinions and to make each english cathedral a centre of intellectual activity a college as it were of philosophers and writers but afterwards his suggestions grew bolder the articles of religion were to be set aside the creeds made optional even for the clergy his dream became more and more richly picturesque until at last he saw canterbury a realized thelema and st pauls a new academic grove he was to work at that remarkable proposal intermittently for many years and to leave it at last no more than a shapeless mass of memoranda fragmentary essays and selected passages for quotation yet mere patchwork and scrapbook as it would be i still have some thought of publishing it there is a large human charity about it a sun too broad and warm a reasonableness too wide and free perhaps for the timid convulsive quality of our time yet all good as good wine for the wise is it incredible that a day should come when our great grey monuments to the norman spirit should cease to be occupied by narrowwitted parsons and besieged by narrowsouled dissenters the soul of our race in exile from the home and place our fathers built for it  if he was not perceptibly changed i thought my cousin jane had become more than a little sharper and stiffer she did not like my uncles own personal secularization and still less the glimpses she got of the ampler intentions of his book she missed the proximity to the church and her parochial authority but she was always a silent woman and made her comments with her profile and not with her tongue  im glad youve come back stephen said my father as we sat together after dinner and her departure with port and tall silver candlesticks and shining mahogany between us ive missed you ive done my best to follow things out there ive got i suppose every press mention theres been of you during the war and since ive subscribed to two presscutting agencies so that if one missed you the other fellow got you perhaps youll like to read them over one of these days you see theres not been a soldier in the family since the peninsular war and so ive been particularly interested you must tell me all the things youre thinking of and what you mean to do this last stuffthis chinese businessit puzzles me i want to know what you think of itand everything  i did my best to give him my ideas such as they were and as they were still very vague ideas i have no doubt he found me rhetorical i can imagine myself talking of the white mans burthen and how in africa it had seemed at first to sit rather staggeringly upon our undertrained shoulders i spoke of slackness and planlessness  ive come back in search of efficiency i have no doubt i said that at any rate  were trying to run this big empire i may have explained with undertrained undereducated poorspirited stuff and we shall come a cropper unless we raise our quality im still imperialist more than ever i was but im an imperialist on a different footing ive no great illusions left about the superiority of the anglosaxons all that has gone but i do think it will be a monstrous waste a disaster to human possibilities if this great liberalspirited empire sprawls itself asunder for the want of a little gravity and purpose and its here the work has to be done the work of training and bracing up and stimulating the public imagination  yes that would be the sort of thing i should have said in those days theres an old national review on my desk as i write containing an article by me with some of those very phrases in it i have been looking at it in order to remind myself of my own forgotten eloquence  yes i remember my father saying yes and then after reflection but those coolies those chinese coolies you cant build up an imperial population by importing coolies  i dont like that side of the business myself i said its detail  perhaps but the liberals will turn you out on it next year and then start badgering public houses and looting the church and then this tariff talk everybody on our side seems to be mixing up the unity of the empire with tariffs its a pity salisbury wouldnt have stood it unity unity depends on a common literature and a common language and common ideas and sympathies it doesnt unite people for them to be forced to trade with each other trading isnt friendship i dont trade with my friends and i dont make friends with my tradesmen natural enemiespolite of course but antagonists are you keen over this tariff stuff steve  not a bit i said that too seems a detail  it doesnt seem to be keeping its place as a detail said my father very few men can touch tariffs and not get a little soiled i hate all this international sharping all these attempts to get artificial advantages all this making poor people buy inferior goods dear in the name of the flag if it comes to that damn the flag customhouses are ugly things stephen the dirty side of nationality dirty things ignoble cross cunning things they wake you up in the small hours and rout over your bags an imperial people ought to be an urbane people a civilizing peopleabove such petty irritating things id as soon put barbed wire along the footpath across that field where the village children go to school or claim that our mushrooms are cultivated or prosecute a sundaysociety cockney for picking my primroses customhouses indeed its chinese there are things a great country mustnt do stephen a country like ours ought to get along without the manners of a hardbreathing competitive cad if it cant id rather it didnt get along whats the good of a huckster countryits like having a wife on the streets its no excuse that she brings you money but since the peace and that man chamberlains visit to africa you imperialists seem to have got this nasty spirit all over you the germans do it you say  my father shut one eye and regarded the color of his port against the waning light let em he said fancyquoting the germans when i was a boy there werent any germans they came up after 70 statecraft from germany and statesmen from birmingham german silver and electroplated empires no  its just a part of our narrow outlook i answered from the hearthrug after a pause its because were solimited that everyone is translating the greatness of empire into preferential trading and jealousy of germany its for something bigger than that that ive returned  those big things come slowly said my father and then with a sigh age after age they seem at timesto be standing still good things go with the bad bad things come with the good  i remember him saying that as though i could still hear him  it must have been after dinner for he was sitting duskily indistinct against the light with a voice coming out to him the candles had not been brought in and the view one saw through the big plate glass window behind him was very clear and splendid those little wealden hills in surrey and sussex assume at times for all that by swiss standards they are the merest ridges of earth the dignity and mystery of great mountains now the crests of hindhead and blackdown purple black against the level gold of the evening sky might have been some highflung boundary chain nearer there gathered banks and pools of luminous lavendertinted mist out of which hills of pinewood rose like islands out of the sea the intervening spaces were magnified to continental dimensions and the closer lowlier things over which we looked the cottages below us were grey and black and dim pierced by a few luminous orange windows and with a solitary street lamp shining like a star the village might have been nestling a mountains height below instead of a couple of hundred feet  i left my hearthrug and walked to the window to survey this  whos got all that land stretching away there that little blunted sierra of pines and escarpments i mean  my father halted for an instant in his answer and glanced over his shoulder  wardingham and baxter share all those coppices he remarked they come up to my corner on each side  but the dark heather and pine land beyond with just the gables of a house among the trees  oh that he said with a careful note of indifference thatsjustin you know justin he used to come to burnmore park     chapter the sixth  lady mary justin   § 1  i did not see lady mary justin for nearly seven months after my return to england of course i had known that a meeting was inevitable and i had taken that very carefully into consideration before i decided to leave south africa but many things had happened to me during those crowded years so that it seemed possible that that former magic would no longer sway and distress me not only had new imaginative interests taken hold of me buti had parted from adolescence i was a man i had been through a great war seen death abundantly seen hardship and passion and known hunger and shame and desire a hundred disillusioning revelations of the quality of life had come to me once for example when we were taking some people to the concentration camps it had been necessary to assist at the premature birth of a child by the wayside a startlingly gory and agonizing business for a young man to deal with heavens how it shocked me i could give a score of such grim picturesand queer pictures  and it wasnt only the earthlier aspects of the life about me but also of the life within me that i had been discovering the first wonder and innocence the worshipping dawnclear passion of youth had gone out of me for ever   § 2  we met at a dinner it was at a house the tarvrilles had taken for the season in mayfair the drawingroom was a big white square apartment with several big pictures and a pane of plate glass above the fireplace in the position in which one usually finds a mirror this showed another room beyond containing an exceptionally large gloriously colored portrait in pastellarger than i had ever thought pastels could be except for the pictures both rooms were almost colorless it was a brilliant dinner with a predominating note of ruby three of the women wore ruby velvet and ellersley was present just back from arabia and ethel manton lady hendon and the duchess of clynes i was greeted by lady tarvrille spoke to ellersley and lady hendon and then discovered a lady in a dress of blue and pearls standing quite still under a picture in the opposite corner of the room and regarding me attentively it was mary some man was beside her a tall grey man with a broad crimson ribbon and i think he must have spoken of me to her it was as if she had just turned to look at me  constantly during those intervening months i had been thinking of meeting her none the less there was a shock not so much of surprise as of deferred anticipation there she stood like something amazingly forgotten that was now amazingly recalled she struck me in that brief crowded instant of recognition as being exactly the person she had been when we had made love in burnmore park there were her eyes at once frank and sidelong the old familiar sweep of her hair the old familiar tilt of the chin the faint humor of her lip and at the same time she seemed to be something altogether different from the memories i had cherished she was something graver something inherently more splendid than they had recorded her face lit now with recognition  i went across to her at once with some dull obviousness upon my lips  and so you are back from africa at last she said still unsmiling i saw about you in the papers you had a good time  i had great good luck i replied  i never dreamt when we were boy and girl together that you would make a soldier  i think i said that luck made soldiers  then i think we found a difficulty in going on with our talk and began a dull little argument that would have been stupidly egotistical on my part if it hadnt been so obviously merely clumsy about luck making soldiers or only finding them out i saw that she had not intended to convey any doubt of my military capacity but only of that natural insensitiveness which is supposed to be needed in a soldier but our minds were remote from the words upon our lips we were like aphasiacs who say one thing while they intend something altogether different the impulse that had brought me across to her had brought me up to a wall of impossible utterances it was with a real quality of rescue that our hostess came between us to tell us our partners at the dinnertable and to introduce me to mine you shall have him again on your other side she said to lady mary with a charming smile for me treating me as if i was a lion in request instead of the mere outsider i was  we talked very little at dinner both of us i think were quite unequal to the occasion whatever meetings we had imagined certainly neither of us had thought of this very possible encounter a long disconcerting hour side by side i began to remember old happenings with an astonishing vividness there within six inches of me was the hand i had kissed her voice was the same to its lightest shade her hair flowed off her forehead with the same amazingly familiar wave was she too remembering but i perhaps had changed altogether  why did you go away as you did she asked abruptly when for a moment we were isolated conversationally why did you never write  she had still that phantom lisp  what else could i do  she turned away from me and answered the man on her left who had just addressed her  when the middinner change came we talked a little about indifferent things making a stiff conversation like a bridge over a torrent of unspoken intimacies we discussed something i think lady tarvrilles flowers and the cape flora and gardens she told me she had a japanese garden with three japanese gardeners they were wonderful little men to watch hummingbird gardeners she called them they wear their native costume  we are your neighbors in surrey she said going off abruptly from that we are quite near to your father  she paused with that characteristic effect of deliberation in her closed lips then she added i can see the trees behind your fathers house from the window of my room  yes i said you take all our southward skyline  she turned her face to me with the manner of a great lady adding a new acquaintance to her collection but her eyes met mine very steadily and intimately mr stratton she saidit was the first time in her life she had called me thatwhen we come back to surrey i want you to come and see me and tell me of all the things you are going to do will you   § 3  that meeting that revival must have been late in november or early in december already by that time i had met your mother i write to you little son not to you as you are now but to the man you are someday to be i write to understand myself and so far as i can understand to make you understand so that i want you to go back with me for a time into the days before your birth to think not of that dear spirit of love who broods over you three children that wise sure mother who rules your life but of a young and slender girl rachel more younger then than you will be when at last this story comes into your hands for unless you think of her as being a girl if you let your present knowledge of her fill out this part in our story you will fail to understand the proportions of these two in my life so i shall write of her here as rachel more as if she were someone as completely dissociated from yourself as lady mary as if she were someone in the story of my life who had as little to do with yours  i had met her in september the house my father lived in is about twelve miles away from your mothers home at ridinghanger and i was taken over by percy restall in his motorcar restall had just become a convert to this new mode of locomotion and he was very active with a huge malignantlooking french car that opened behind and had a kind of poke bonnet and all sorts of features that have since disappeared from the automobile world he took everyone that he could lay hands upon for rideshe called it extending their range and he called upon everyone else to show off the car he was responsible for more introduction and social admixture in that part of surrey than had occurred during the previous century we punctured in the ridinghanger drive restall did his own repairs and so it was we stayed for nearly four hours and instead of a mere caller i became a familiar friend of the family  your mother then was still not eighteen a soft white slip of being tall slender brownhaired and silent with very still deep dark eyes she and your three aunts formed a very gracious group of young women indeed alice then as now the most assertive with a gay initiative and a fluent tongue molly already a sunbrown gipsy and norah still a pigtailed thing of lank legs and wild embraces and the pinkest of swift pink blushes your uncle sidney with his shy lank moodiness acted the brotherly part of a foil there were several stray visitors young men and maidens there were always stray visitors in those days at ridinghanger and your grandmother rosy and brighteyed maintained a gentle flow of creature comforts and kindly but humorous observations i do not remember your grandfather on this occasion probably he wasnt there  there was tea and we played tennis and walked about and occasionally visited restall who was getting dirtier and dirtier and crosser and crosser at his repairs and spreading a continually more remarkable assemblage of parts and instruments over the grass about him he looked at last more like a pitch in the caledonian market than a decent country gentleman paying an afternoon call and then back to more tennis and more talk we fell into a discussion of tariff reform as we sat taking tea two of the visitor youths were strongly infected by the new teachings which were overshadowing the outlook of british imperialism some mean phrase about not conquering africa for the german bagman some ugly turn of thought that at a touch brought down empire to the level of a tradesmans advantage fell from one of them and stirred me to sudden indignation i began to talk of things that had been gathering in my mind for some time  i do not know what i said it was in the vein of my fathers talk no doubt but i think that for once i may have been eloquent and in the midst of my demand for ideals in politics that were wider and deeper than artful buying and selling that looked beyond a vulgar aggression and a churls dread and hatred of foreign things while i struggled to say how great and noble a thing empire might be i saw rachels face this it was manifest was a new kind of talk to her her dark eyes were alight with a beautiful enthusiasm for what i was trying to say and for what in the light of that glowing reception i seemed to be  i felt that queer shame one feels when one is taken suddenly at the full value of ones utmost expressions i felt as though i had cheated her was passing myself off for something as great and splendid as the empire of my dreams it is hard to dissociate oneself from the fine things to which one aspires i stopped almost abruptly dumbly her eyes bade me go on but when i spoke again it was at a lower level  that look in rachels eyes remained with me my mind had flashed very rapidly from the realization of its significance to the thought that if one could be sure of that then indeed one could pitch oneself high rachel i felt had something for me that i needed profoundly without ever having known before that i needed it she had the supreme gifts of belief and devotion in that instants gleam it seemed she held them out to me  never before in my life had it seemed credible to me that anyone could give me that or that i could hope for such a gift of support and sacrifice love as i had known it had been a community and an alliance a frank abundant meeting but this was another kind of love that shone for an instant and promised and vanished shyly out of sight as i and rachel looked at one another  some interruption occurred restall came i think blackened by progress to drink a cup of tea and negotiate the loan of a kitchen skewer a kitchen skewer it appeared was all that was needed to complete his reconstruction in the avenue norah darted off for a kitchen skewer while restall drank and then there was a drift to tennis and rachel and i were partners all this time i was in a state of startled attention towards her full of this astounding impression that something wonderful and unprecedented had flowed out from her towards my life full too of doubts now whether that shining response had ever occurred whether some trick of light and my brain had not deceived me i wanted tremendously to talk to her and did not know how to begin in any serious fashion beyond everything i wanted to see again that deep onset of belief  come again said your grandmother to me come again after she had tried in vain to make restall stay for an informal supper i was all for staying but restall said darkly there are the lamps  but they will be all right said mrs more  i cant trust em said restall with a deepening gloom not after that the motorcar looked selfconscious and uncomfortable but said nothing by way of excuse and restall took me off in it like one whose sun has set for ever i wouldnt be surprised said restall as we went down the drive if the damned thing turned a somersault it might doanything those were the brighter days of motoring  the next time i went over released from restalls limitations and stayed to a jolly family supper i found remarkably few obstacles in my way to a better acquaintance with rachel you see i was an entirely eligible and desirable young man in mrs mores eyes   § 4  when i recall these long past emotions again i am struck by the profound essential difference between my feelings for your mother and for mary they were so different that it seems scarcely rational to me that they should be called by the same name yet each was love profoundly deep and sincere the contrast lies i think in our relative ages and our relative maturity that altered the quality of all our emotions the one was the love of a man of sixandtwenty exceptionally seasoned and experienced and responsible for his years for a girl still at school a girl attractively beautiful mysterious and unknown to him the other was the love of coevals who had been playmates and intimate companions and of whom the woman was certainly as capable and wilful as the man  now it is exceptional for men to love women of their own age it is the commoner thing that they should love maidens younger and often much younger than themselves this is true more particularly of our own class the masculine thirties and forties marry the feminine twenties all the prevailing sentiment and usage between the sexes rises naturally out of that we treat this seniority as though it were a virile characteristic we treat the man as though he were a natural senior we expect a weakness a timid deference in the girl i and mary had loved one another as two rivers run together on the way to the sea we had grown up side by side to the moment when we kissed but i sought your mother i watched her and desired her and chose her very tenderly and worshipfully indeed to be mine i do not remember that there was any corresponding intention in my mind to be hers i do not think that that idea came in at all she was something to be won something playing an inferior and retreating part and i was artificial in all my attitudes to her i thought of what would interest her what would please her i knew from the outset that what she saw in me to rouse that deep shy glow of exaltation in her face was illusion illusion it was my business to sustain and so i won her and long years had to pass years of secret loneliness and hidden feelings of preposterous pretences and covert perplexities before we escaped from that crippling tradition of inequality and looked into one anothers eyes with understanding and forgiveness a woman and a man  i made no great secret of the interest and attraction i found in rachel and the mores made none of their entire approval of me i walked over on the second occasion and ridinghanger opened out a great flower of genial appreciation that i came alone hiding nothing of its dawning perception that it was rachel in particular i came to see  your grandmothers matchmaking was as honest as the day there was the same salad of family and visitors as on the former afternoon and this time i met freshman who was destined to marry alice there was tea tennis and by your grandmothers suggestion a walk to see the sunset from the crest of the hill rachel and i walked across the breezy moorland together while i talked and tempted her to talk  what i wonder did we talk about english scenery i think and african scenery and the weald about us and the long history of the weald and its present and future and at last even a little of politics i had never explored the mind of a girl of seventeen before there was a surprise in all she knew and a delight in all she didnt know and about herself a candor a fresh simplicity of outlook that was sweeter than the clear air about us sweeter than sunshine or the rising song of a lark she believed so gallantly and beautifully she was so perfectly unaffectedly and certainly prepared to be a brave and noble personif only life would let her and she hadnt as yet any suspicion that life might make that difficult  i went to ridinghanger a number of times in the spring and early summer i talked a great deal with rachel and still i did not make love to her it was always in my mind that i would make love to her the heavens and earth and all her family were propitious glowing golden with consent and approval i thought she was the most wonderful and beautiful thing in life and her eyes the intonation of her voice her hurrying color and a hundred little involuntary signs told me how she quickened at my coming but there was a shyness i loved her as one loves and admires a white flower or a beautiful childsome strangers child i felt that i might make her afraid of me i had never before thought that to make love is a coarse thing but still at high summer when i met mary again no definite thing had been said between myself and rachel but we knew each of us knew that somewhere in a world less palpable in fairyland in dreamland we had met and made our vows   § 5  you see how far my imagination had gone towards readjustment when mary returned into my life you see how strange and distant it was to meet her again changed completely into the great lady she had intended to be speaking to me with the restrained and practised charm of a woman who is young and beautiful and prominent and powerful and secure there was no immediate sense of shock in that resumption of our broken intercourse it seemed to me that night simply that something odd and curious had occurred i do not remember how we parted that evening or whether we even saw each other after dinner was over but from that hour forth mary by insensible degrees resumed her old predominance in my mind i woke up in the night and thought about her and next day i found myself thinking of her remembering things out of the past and recalling and examining every detail of the overnight encounter how cold and ineffective we had been both of us we had been like people resuming a disused and partially forgotten language had she changed towards me did she indeed want to see me again or was that invitation a mere demonstration of how entirely unimportant seeing me or not seeing me had become  then i would find myself thinking with the utmost particularity of her face had it changed at all was it altogether changed i seemed to have forgotten everything and remembered everything that peculiar slight thickness of her eyelids that gave her eyes their tenderness that light firmness of her lips of course she would want to talk to me as now i perceived i wanted to talk to her  was i in love with her still it seemed to me then that i was not it had not been that hesitating fierceness that pride and demand and doubt which is passionate love that had made all my sensations strange to me as i sat beside her it had been something larger and finer something great and embracing a return to fellowship here beside me veiled from me only by our transient embarrassment and the tarnish of separation and silences was the one person who had ever broken down the crust of shy insincerity which is so incurably my characteristic and talked intimately of the inmost things of life to me i discovered now for the first time how intense had been my loneliness for the past five years i discovered now that through all those years i had been hungry for such talk as mary alone could give me my mind was filled with talk filled with things i desired to say to her that chaos began to take on a multitudinous expression at the touch of her spirit i began to imagine conversations with her to prepare reports for her of those new worlds of sensation and activity i had discovered since that boyish parting  but when at last that talk came it was altogether different from any of those i had invented  she wrote to me when she came down into surrey and i walked over to martens the next afternoon i found her in her own sittingroom a beautiful characteristic apartment with tall french windows hung with blue curtains a large writingdesk and a great litter of books the room gave upon a broad sunlit terrace with a balustrading of yellowish stone on which there stood great oleanders beyond was a flower garden and then the dark shadows of cypresses she was standing as i came in to her as though she had seen me coming across the lawns and had been awaiting my entrance i thought you might come today she said and told the manservant to deny her to other callers again she produced that queer effect of being at once altogether the same and altogether different from the mary i had known justin she said is in paris he comes back on friday i saw then that the change lay in her bearing that for the easy confidence of the girl she had now the deliberate dignity and control of a married womana very splendidly and spaciously married woman her manner had been purged of impulse since we had met she had stood the mistress of great houses and had dealt with thousands of people  you walked over to me  i walked i said it is nearly a straight path you know it  you came over the heather beyond our pine wood she confirmed and then i think we talked some polite unrealities about surrey scenery and the weather it was so formal that by a common impulse we let the topic suddenly die we stood through a pause a hesitation were we indeed to go on at that altitude of cold civility she turned to the window as if the view was to serve again  sit down she said and dropped into a chair against the light looking away from me across the wide green space of afternoon sunshine i sat down on a little sofa at a loss also  and so she said turning her face to me suddenly you come back into my life and i was amazed to see that the brightness of her eyes was tears weve livedfive years  you i said clumsily have done all sorts of things i hear of youpatronizing young artistsorganizing experiments in village education  yes she said ive done all sorts of things one has to forced unreal things for the most part you i expect have doneall sorts of things also but yours have been real things  all things i remarked sententiously are real and all of them a little unreal south africa has been wonderful and now it is all over one doubts if it really happened like that incredulous mood after a storm of passion  youve come back for good  for good i want to do things in england  politics  if i can get into that  again a pause there came the characteristic moment of deliberation that i remembered so well  i never meant you she said to go away you could have written you never answered the notes i sent  i was frantic i said with loss and jealousy i wanted to forget  and you forgot  i did my best  i did my best said mary and now have you forgotten  nothing  nor i i thought i had until i saw you again ive thought of you endlessly ive wanted to talk to you we had a way of talking together but you went away you turned your back as though all that was nothingnot worth having youyou drove home my marriage stephen you made me know what a thing of sex a woman is to a manand how little else  she paused  you see i said slowly you had made me as people say in love with you i dont knowif you remember everything  she looked me in the eyes for a moment  i hadnt been fair she said with an abrupt abandonment of accusation but you know stephen that night i meant to explain and afterwards things sometimes go as one hasnt expected them to go even the things one has planned to say i supposei treated youdisgustingly  i protested  yes she said i treated you as i didand i thought you would stand it i knew i knew then as well as you do now that male to my female you wouldnt stand it but somehowi thought there were other things things that could override that  not i said for a boy of oneandtwenty  but in a man of twentysix  i weighed the question things are different i said and then yes anyhow nowif i may come back penitentto a friendship  we looked at one another gravely faintly in our ears sounded the music of past and distant things we pretended to hear nothing of that tried honestly to hear nothing of it i had not remembered how steadfast and quiet her face could be yes she said a friendship  ive always had you in my mind stephen she said when i saw i couldnt marry you it seemed to me i had better marry and be free of any further hope i thought we could get over that lets get it over i thought nowat any ratewe have got over that her eyes verified her words a little doubtfully and we can talk and you can tell me of your life and the things you want to do that make life worth living oh life has been stupid without you stephen large and expensive and aimlesstell me of your politics they sayjustin told meyou think of parliament  i want to do that i have been thinking in fact i am going to stand i found myself hesitating on the verge of phrases in the quality of a review article it was too unreal for her presence and yet it was this she seemed to want from me this i said is a phase of great opportunities the war has stirred the empire to a sense of itself to a sense of what it might be of course this tariff reform row is a squalid nuisance it may kill out all the fine spirit again before anything is done everything will become a haggle a chaffering of figures all the more reason why we should try and save things from the commercial traveller if the empire is anything at all it is something infinitely more than a combination in restraint of trade  yes she said and you want to take that line the high line  if one does not take the high line i said what does one go into politics for  stephen she smiled you havent lost a sort of simplicity people go into politics because it looks important because other people go into politics because they can get titles and a sense of influence andother things and then there are quarrels old grudges to serve  these are roughnesses of the surface  old stephen she cried with the note of a mother they will worry you in politics  i laughed perhaps im not altogether so simple  oh youll get through you have a way of going on but i shall have to watch over you i see i shall have to watch over you tell me of the things you mean to do where are you standing  i began to tell her a little disjointedly of the probabilities of my yorkshire constituency   § 6  i have a vivid vignette in my memory of my return to my fathers house down through the pine woods and by the winding path across the deep valley that separated our two ridges i was thinking of mary and nothing but mary in all the world and of the friendly sweetness of her eyes and the clean strong sharpness of her voice that sweet white figure of rachel that had been creeping to an ascendancy in my imagination was moonlight to her sunrise i knew it was mary i loved and had always loved i wanted passionately to be as she desired the friend she demanded that intimate brother and confederate but all my heart cried out for her cried out for her altogether  i would be her friend i repeated to myself i would be her friend i would talk to her often plan with her work with her i could put my meanings into her life and she should throw her beauty over mine i began already to dream of the talk of tomorrows meeting   § 7  and now let me go on to tell at once the thing that changed life for both of us altogether that turned us out of the courses that seemed set for us our spacious successful and divergent ways she to the tragedy of her death and i from all the prospects of the public career that lay before me to the work that now toilsomely inadequately and blunderingly enough i do it was to pierce and slash away the appearances of life for me it was to open my way to infinite disillusionment and unsuspected truths within a few weeks of our second meeting mary and i were passionately in love with one another we had indeed become lovers the arrested attractions of our former love released again drew us inevitably to that we tried to seem outwardly only friends with this hot glow between us our tormented secret was half discovered and half betrayed itself there followed a tragicomedy of hesitations and disunited struggle within four months the crisis of our two lives was past  it is not within my purpose to tell you my son of the particular events the particular comings and goings the chance words the chance meetings the fatal momentary misunderstandings that occurred between us i want to tell of something more general than that this misadventure is in our strain it is our inheritance it is a possibility in the inheritance of all honest and emotional men and women there are no doubt people altogether cynical and adventurous to whom these passions and desires are at once controllable and permissible indulgences without any radiation of consequences a secret and detachable part of life and there may be people of convictions so strong and simple that these disturbances are eliminated but we strattons are of a quality neither so low nor so high we stoop and rise we are not convinced about our standards and for many generations to come with us and with such people as the christians and indeed with most of our sort of people we shall be equally desirous of free and intimate friendship and prone to blaze into passion and disaster at that proximity  this is one of the essential riddles in the adaptation of such human beings as ourselves to that greater civilized state of which i dream it is the gist of my story it is one of the two essential riddles that confront our kind the servitude of sex and the servitude of labor are the twin conditions upon which human society rests today the two limitations upon its progress towards a greater social order to that greater community those uplands of light and happy freedom towards which that being who was my father yesterday who thinks in myself today and who will be you tomorrow and your sons after you by his very nature urges and must continue to urge the life of mankind the story of myself and mary is a mere incident in that gigantic scarce conscious effort to get clear of toils and confusions and encumbrances and have our way with life we are like little figures dots ascendant upon a vast hillside i take up our intimacy for an instant and hold it under a lens for you i become more than myself then and mary stands for innumerable women it happened yesterday and it is just a part of that same history that made edmond stratton of the hays elope with charlotte anstruther and get himself run through the body at haddington two hundred years ago which drove the laidlawchristians to virginia in 45 gave stratton street to the moneylenders when george iv was regent and broke the heart of margaret stratton in the days when charles the first was king with our individual variations and under changed conditions the old desires and impulses stirred us the old antagonisms confronted us the old difficulties and sloughs and impassable places baffled us there are times when i think of my history among all those widespread repeated histories until it seems to me that the human lover is like a creature who struggles for ever through a thicket without an end  there are no universal laws of affection and desire but it is manifestly true that for the most of us free talk intimate association and any real fellowship between men and women turns with an extreme readiness to love and that being so it follows that under existing conditions the unrestricted meeting and companionship of men and women in society is a monstrous sham a merely dangerous pretence of encounters the safe reality beneath those liberal appearances is that a woman must be content with the easy friendship of other women and of one man only letting a superficial friendship towards all other men veil impassable abysses of separation and a man must in the same way have one sole woman intimate to all other women he must be a little blind a little deaf politely inattentive he must respect the transparent intangible tacit purdah about them respect it but never allude to it to me that is an intolerable state of affairs but it is reality if you live in the spirit of any other understanding you will court social disaster i suppose it is a particularly intolerable state of affairs to us strattons because it is in our nature to want things to seem what they are that translucent yet impassible purdah outrages our veracity and it is plain to me that our social order cannot stand and is not standing the tensions it creates the convention that passions and emotions are absent when they are palpably present broke down between mary and myself as it breaks down in a thousand other cases as it breaks down everywhere our social life is honeycombed and rotten with secret hidden relationships the rigid the obtuse and the unscrupulously cunning escape the honest passion sooner or later flares out and destroys here is a difficulty that no bullying imposition of arbitrary rules on the one hand nor any reckless abandonment of law on the other can solve humanity has yet to find its method in sexual things it has to discover the use and the limitation of jealousy and before it can even begin to attempt to find it has to cease its present timid secret groping in shame and darkness and turn on the light of knowledge none of us knows much and most of us do not even know what is known   § 8  the house is very quiet today it is your mothers birthday and you three children have gone with her and mademoiselle potin into the forest to celebrate the occasion presently i shall join you the sunlit garden with its tall dreaming lilies against the trellised vines upon the wall the cedars and the grassy space about the sundial have that distinguished stillness that definite palpable and almost outlined emptiness which is so to speak your negative presence it is like a sheet of sunlit colored paper out of which your figures have been cut there is a commotion of birds in the jasmine and your barker reclines with an infinite tranquillity a masterless dog upon the lawn i take up this writing again after an interval of some weeks i have been in paris attending the sabotage conference and dealing with those intricate puzzles of justice and discipline and the secret sources of contentment that have to be solved if sabotage is ever to vanish from labor struggles again i think a few points have been made clearer in that curious riddle of reconciliations  now i resume this story i turn over the sheets that were written and finished before my departure and come to the notes for what is to follow  perhaps my days of work in paris have carried my mind on beyond the point at which i left the narrative i sit as it were among a pile of memories that are now all disordered and mixed up together their proper sequences and connexions lost i cannot trace the phases through which our mutual passion rode up through the restrained and dignified intentions of our friendship but i know that presently we were in a white heat of desire there must have been passages that i now altogether forget moments of tense transition i am more and more convinced that our swiftest intensest mental changes leave far less vivid memories than impressions one receives when one is comparatively passive and of this phase in my life of which i am now telling i have clear memories of a time when we talked like brother and sister or like angels if you will and hard upon that came a time when we were planning in all our moments together how and when and where we might meet in secret and meet again  things drift with a phantomlike uncertainty into my mind and pass again those fierce motives of our transition have lost now all stable form and feature but i believe there was a curious tormenting urgency in our jealousy of those others of justin on my part and of rachel on hers at first we had talked quite freely about rachel had discussed my conceivable marriage with her we had indeed a little forced that topic as if to reassure ourselves of the honesty of our new footing but the force that urged us nearer pervaded all our being it was hard enough to be barred apart to snatch back our hands from touching to avoid each others eyes to hurry a little out of the dusk towards the lit house and its protecting servants but the constant presence and suggestion of those others from whom there were no bars or towards whom bars could be abolished at a look at an impulse exacerbated that hardship roused a fierce insatiable spirit of revolt within us at times we grew angry with each others formalism came near to quarrelling  i associate these moods with the golden stillnesses of a prolonged and sultry autumn and with slowly falling leaves  i will not tell you how that step was taken it matters very little to my story nor will i tell which one of us it was first broke the barriers down   § 9  but i do want to tell you certain things i want to tell you them because they are things that affect you closely there was almost from the first a difference between mary and myself in this that i wanted to be public about our love i wanted to be open and defiant and shehesitated she wanted to be secret she wanted to keep me i sometimes think that she was moved to become my mistress because she wanted to keep me but she also wanted to keep everything else in her lifeher position her ample freedoms and wealth and dignity our love was to be a secret cavern endymions cave i was ready enough to do what i could to please her and for a time i served that secrecy lied pretended agreed to false addresses assumed names and tangled myself in a network of furtive proceedings these are things that poison and consume honest love  you will learn soon enough as you grow to be a man that beneath the respectable assumptions of our social life there is an endless intricate world of subterfuge and hidden and perverted passionfor all passion that wears a mask is perversionand that thousands of people of our sort are hiding and shamming about their desires their gratifications their true relationships i do not mean the open offenders for they are mostly honest and gallant people but the men and women who sin in the shadows the people who are not clean and scandalous but immoral and respectable this underworld is not for us i wish that i who have looked into it could in some way inoculate you now against the repetition of my misadventure we strattons are daylight men and if i work now for widened facilities of divorce for an organized freedom and independence of women and greater breadth of toleration it is because i know in my own person the degradations the falsity the bitterness that can lurk beneath the inflexible pretentions of the established code today  and i want to tell you too of something altogether unforeseen that happened to us and that was this that from the day that passion carried us and we became in the narrower sense of the word lovers all the wider interests we had in common our political intentions our impersonal schemes began to pass out of our intercourse our situation closed upon us like a trap and hid the sky something more intense had our attention by the feet and we used our wings no more i do not think that we even had the real happiness and beauty and delight of one another because i tell you there is no light upon kiss or embrace that is not done with pride i do not know why it should be so but people of our race and quality are a little ashamed of mere gratification in love always we seem in my memory to have been whispering with flushed cheeks and discussing interminablysituation had something betrayed us might something betray was this or that sufficiently cunning had we perhaps left a footmark or failed to burn a note was the second footman who was detailed as my valet even now pausing astonished in the brushing of my clothes with our crumpled secret in his hand between myself and the clear vision of this world about me this infernal network of precautions spread like a veil  and it was not only a matter of concealments but of positive deceptions the figure of justin comes back to me it is a curious thing that in spite of our bitter antagonism and the savage jealousy we were to feel for one another there has always been and there remains now in my thought of him a certain liking a regret at our opposition a quality of friendliness his broad face which the common impression and the caricaturist make so powerful and eaglelike is really not a brutal or heavy face at all it is no doubt aquiline after the fashion of an eagleowl the mouth and chin broad and the eyes very far apart but there is a minute puckering of the brows which combines with that queer streak of brown discoloration that runs across his cheek and into the white of his eyes to give something faintly plaintive and pitiful to his expression an effect enhanced by the dark softness of his eyes they are gentle eyes it is absurd to suppose them the eyes of a violently forceful man and indeed they do not belie justin it is not by vehemence or pressure that his wealth and power have been attained it is by the sheer detailed abundance of his mind in that queer big brain of his there is something of the calculating boy and not a little of the chess champion he has a kind of financial gift he must be rich and grows richer what else is there for him to do how many times have i not tried to glance carelessly at his face and scrutinize that look in his eyes and ask myself was that his usual look or was it lit by an instinctive jealousy did he perhaps begin to suspect i had become a persistent visitor in the house he might well be jealous of such minor favors as she showed me for with him she talked but little and shared no thoughts his manner with her was tinctured by an habituated despair they were extraordinarily polite and friendly with one another  i tried a hundred sophistications of my treachery to him i assured myself that a modern woman is mistress and owner of herself no chattel and so forth but he did not think so and neither she nor i were behaving as though we thought so in innumerable little things we were doing our best tacitly to reassure him and so you see me shaking hands with this man affecting an interest in his topics and affairs staying in his house eating his food and drinking his wine that i might be the nearer to his wife it is not the first time that has been done in the world there are esoteric codes to justify all i did i perceive there are types of men to whom such relationships are attractive by the very reason of their illicit excitement but we strattons are honest people there is no secretive passion in our blood this is no game for us never you risk the playing of it little son big son as you will be when you read this story perhaps but i hope indeed not this may reach you too late to be a warning come to you in midsituation go through with it then inheritor of mine and keep as clean as you can follow the warped honor that is still left to youand if you can come out of the tangle  it is not only justin haunts the memories of that furtive time but rachel more i see her still as she was then a straight whitedressed girl with big brown eyes that regarded me now with perplexity now with a faint dismay i still went over to see her and my manner had changed i had nothing to say to her now and everything to hide everything between us hung arrested and nothing could occur to make an end  i told mary i must cease my visits to the mores i tried to make her feel my own sense of an accumulating cruelty to rachel but it explains away so much she said if you stop going thereeveryone will talk everything will swing roundand point here  rachel i protested  no she said overbearing me you must keep on going to ridinghanger you must you must   for a long time i had said nothing to mary of the burthen these pretences were to me it had seemed a monstrous ingratitude to find the slightest flaw in the passionate love and intimacy she had given me but at last the divergence of our purposes became manifest to us both a time came when we perceived it clearly and discussed it openly i have still a vivid recollection of a golden october day when we had met at the edge of the plantation that overlooks bearshill she had come through the gardens into the pinewood and i had jumped the rusty banked stream that runs down the bearshill valley and clambered the barbed wire fence i came up the steep bank and through a fringe of furze to where she stood in the shade i kissed her hand and discovered mine had been torn open by one of the thorns of the wire and was dripping blood mind my dress she said and we laughed as we kissed with my arm held aloof  we sat down side by side upon the warm pine needles that carpeted the sand and she made a mothering fuss about my petty wound and bound it in my handkerchief we looked together across the steep gorge at the blue ridge of trees beyond anyone she said might have seen us this minute  i never thought i said and moved a foot away from her  its too late if they have said she pulling me back to her over beyond there that must be hindhead someone with a telescope  thats less credible i said and it occurred to me that the grey stretch of downland beyond must be the ridge to the west of ridinghanger  i wish i said it didnt matter i wish i could come and go and fear nobodyand spend long hours with youoh at our ease  now she said we spend short hours i wonder if i would like its no good stephen letting ourselves think of things that cant be here we are kiss that hand my lover there just between wrist and thumbthe little hollow yes exactly there  but thoughts had been set going in my mind why i said presently should you always speak of things that cant be why should we take all this as if it were all that there could be i want long hours i want you to shine all the day through on my life now dear its as if the sun was shown ever and again and then put back behind an eclipse i come to you halfblinded i go away unsatisfied all the world is dark in between and little phantom yous float over it  she rested her cheek on her hand and looked at me gravely  you are hard to satisfy brother heart she said  i live in snatches of brightness and all the rest of life is waiting and thinking and waiting  what else is there havent we the brightness  i want you i said i want you altogether  after so much  i want the more mary i want you to come away with me no listen this lifedont think im not full of the beauty the happiness the wonder but its a suspense it doesnt go on its just a dawn dear a splendid dawn a glory of color and brightness and freshness and hope andno sun rises i want the day everything else has stopped with me and stopped with you i do nothing with my politics nowi pretend i have no plans in life except plans for meeting you and again meeting you i want to go on i want to go on with you and take up work and the world againyou beside me i want you to come out of all this lifeout of all this immense wealthy emptiness of yours  stop she said and listen to me stephen  she paused with her lips pressed together her brows a little knit  i wont she said slowly i am going on like this i and you are going to be loversjust as we are lovers nowsecret lovers and i am going to help you in all your projects hold your party togetherfor you will have a partymy house shall be its centre  but justin  he takes no interest in politics he will do what pleases me  i took some time before i answered you dont understand how men feel i said  she waited for what else i had to say i lay prone and gathered together and shaped and reshaped a little heap of pine needles you see i cant do it i want you  she gripped a handful of my hair and tugged hard between each word havent you got me she asked between her teeth what more could you have  i want you openly  she folded her arms beneath her no she said  for a little while neither of us spoke  its the trouble of the deceit she asked  itsthe deceit  we can stop all that she said  i looked up at her face enquiringly  by having no more to hide she said with her eyes full of tears if its nothing to you  its everything to me i said its overwhelming me oh mary heart of my life my dear come out of this come with me come and be my wife make a clean thing of it let me take you away and then let me marry you i know its asking youto come to a sort of poverty  but marys blue eyes were alight with anger isnt it a clean thing now stephen she was crying do you mean that you and i arent clean now will you never understand  oh clean i answered clean as eve in the garden but can we keep clean wont the shadow of our falsehoods darken at all come out of it while we are still clean come with me justin will divorce you we can stay abroad and marry and come back  mary was kneeling up now with her hands upon her knees  come back to what she cried parliamentafter that you boy you sentimentalist youyou duffer do you think id let you do it for your own sake even do you think i want youspoilt we should come back to mope outside of things we should come back to fret our lives out i wont do it stephen i wont do it end this if you like break our hearts and throw them away and go on without them but to turn all our lives into a scandal to give ourselves over to the mean and the malicious a prey to old womenand you damned out of everything a man partly forgiven a man who went wrong for a woman no  she sprang lightly to her feet and stood over me as i knelt before her and i came here to be made love to stephen i came here to be loved and you talk that nonsense you remind me of everythingwretched  she lifted up her hands and then struck down with them a gesture of infinite impatience her face as she bent to me was alive with a friendly anger her eyes suddenly dark you duffer she repeated   § 10  discovery followed hard upon that meeting i had come over to martens with some book as a pretext the man had told me that lady mary awaited me in her blue parlor and i went unannounced through the long gallery to find her the door stood a little ajar i opened it softly so that she did not hear me and saw her seated at her writingdesk with her back to me and her cheek and eyebrow just touched by the sunlight from the open terrace window she was writing a note i put my hand about her shoulder and bent to kiss her as she turned then as she came round to me she started was for a moment rigid then thrust me from her and rose very slowly to her feet  i turned to the window and became as rigid facing justin he was standing on the terrace staring at us with a face that looked stupid and inexpressive andvery white the sky behind him appropriately enough was full of the tattered inky onset of a thunderstorm so we remained for a lengthy second perhaps a trite tableau vivant we two seemed to hang helplessly upon justin and he was the first of us to move  he made a queer incomplete gesture with one hand as if he wanted to undo the top button of his waistcoat and then thought better of it he came very slowly into the room when he spoke his voice had neither rage nor denunciation in it it was simply conversational i felt this was going on he said and then to his wife with the note of one who remarks dispassionately on a peculiar situation yet somehow it seemed wrong and unnatural to think such a thing of you  his face took on something of the vexed look of a child who struggles with a difficult task do you mind he said to me will you go  i took a moment for my reply no i said since you know at last there are things to be said  no said mary suddenly go let me talk to him  no i said my place is here beside you  he seemed not to hear me his eyes were fixed on mary he seemed to think he had dismissed me and that i was no longer there his mind was not concerned about me but about her he spoke as though what he said had been in his mind and no doubt it had been in his mind for many days i didnt deserve this he said to her ive tried to make your life as you wanted your life its astonishing to findi havent you gave no sign i suppose i ought to have felt all this happening but it comes upon me surprisingly i dont know what im to do he became aware of me again and you he said what am i to do to think that youwhile i have been treating her like some sacred thing  the color was creeping back into his face indignation had come into his voice the first yellow lights of rising jealousy showed in his eyes  stephen i heard mary say will you leave me to talk to my husband  there is only one thing to do i said what is the need of talking we two are lovers justin i spoke to both of them we two must go out into the world go out now together this marriage of yoursits no marriage no real marriage  i think i said that i seem to remember saying that perhaps with other phrases that i have forgotten but my memory of what we said and did which is so photographically clear of these earlier passages that i believe i can answer for every gesture and nearly every word that i have set down becomes suddenly turbid the high tension of our first confrontation was giving place to a flood of emotional impulse we all became eager to talk to impose interpretations and justifications upon our situation we all three became divided between our partial attention to one another and our urgent necessity to keep hold of our points of view that i think is the common tragedy of almost all human conflicts that rapid breakdown from the first cool apprehension of an issue to heat confusion and insistence i do not know if indeed we raised our voices but my memory has an effect of raised voices and when at last i went out of the house it seemed to me that the menservants in the hall were as hushed as beasts before a thunderstorm and all of them quite fully aware of the tremendous catastrophe that had come to martens and moreover as i recalled afterwards with astonishment i went past them and out into the driving rain unprotected and not one of them stirred a serviceable hand  what was it we said i have a vivid sense of declaring not once only but several times that mary and i were husband and wife in the sight of god i was full of the idea that now she must inevitably be mine i must have spoken to justin at times as if he had come merely to confirm my view of the long dispute there had been between us for a while my mind resisted his extraordinary attitude that the matter lay between him and mary that i was in some way an interloper it seemed to me there was nothing for it now but that mary should stand by my side and face justin with the world behind him i remember my confused sense that presently she and i would have to go straight out of martens and she was wearing a teagown easy and open and the flimsiest of slippers any packing any change of clothing struck me as an incredible anticlimax i had visions of our going forth hand in hand outside was the soughing of a coming storm a chill wind drove a tumult of leaves along the terrace the door slammed and yawned open again and then came the rain justin i remember still talking closed the door i tried to think how i could get to the station five miles away and then what we could do in london we should seem rather odd visitors to an hotelwithout luggage all this was behind my valiant demand that she should come with me and come now  and then my mind was lanced by the thin edge of realization that she did not intend to come now and that justin was resolved she should not do so after the first shock of finding herself discovered she had stood pale but uncowed before her bureau with her eyes rather on him than on me her hands i think were behind her upon the edge of the writing flap and she was a little leaning upon them she had the watchful alert expression of one who faces an unanticipated but by no means overwhelming situation she cast a remark to me but i do not want to come with you she said i have told you i do not want to come with you all her mind seemed concentrated upon what she should do with justin you must send him away he was saying its an abominable thing it must stop how can you dream it should go on  but you said when you married me i should be free i should own myself you gave me this house  what to disgrace myself  i was moved to intervene  you must choose between us mary i cried it is impossible you should stay here you cannot stay here  she turned upon me a creature at bay why shouldnt i stay here why must i choose between two men i want neither of you i want myself im not a thing im a human being im not your thing justinnor yours stephen yet you want to quarrel over melike two dogs over a bone i am going to stay herein my house its my house i made it every room of it is full of me here i am  she stood there making this magnificently extravagant claim her eyes blazing blue her hair a little dishevelled with a strand across her cheek  both i and justin spoke together and then turned in helpless anger upon one another i remember that with the clumsiest of weak gestures he bade me begone from the house and that i with a now rather deflated rhetoric answered i would go only with mary at my side and there she stood less like a desperate rebel against the most fundamental social relations than an indignant princess and demanded of us and high heaven why should i be fought for why should i be fought for  and then abruptly she gathered her skirts in her hand and advanced open that door stephen she said and was gone with a silken whirl and rustle from our presence  we were left regarding one another with blank expressions  her departure had torn the substance out of our dispute for the moment we found ourselves left with a new situation for which there is as yet no tradition of behavior we had become actors in that new human comedy that is just beginning in the world that comedy in which men still dispute the possession and the manner of the possession of woman according to the ancient rules while they on their side are determining ever more definitely that they will not be possessed  we had little to say to one anothermere echoes and endorsements of our recent declarations she must come to me said i and he i will save her from that at any cost  that was the gist of our confrontation and then i turned about and walked along the gallery towards the entrance with justin following me slowly i was full of the wrath of baffled heroics i turned towards him with something of a gesture down the perspective of the white and empty gallery he appeared small and perplexed the panes of the tall french windows were slashed with rain   § 11  i forget now absolutely what i may have expected to happen next i cannot remember my return to my fathers house that day but i know that what did happen was the most unanticipated and incredible experience of my life it was as if the whole world of mankind were suddenly to turn upside down and people go about calmly in positions of complete inversion i had a note from mary on the morning after this discovery that indeed dealt with that but was otherwise not very different from endless notes i had received before our crisis it was destroyed so that i do not know its exact text now but it did not add anything material to the situation or give me the faintest shadow to intimate what crept close upon us both she repeated her strangely thwarting refusal to come away and live with me she seemed indignant that we had been discoveredas though justin had indulged in an excess of existence by discovering us i completed and despatched to her a long letter i had already been writing overnight in which i made clear the hopeless impossibility of her attitude vowed all my life and strength to her tried to make some picture of the happiness that was possible for us together sketched as definitely as i could when and where we might meet and whither we might go it must have made an extraordinary jumble of protest persuasion and practicality it never reached her it was intercepted by justin  i have gathered since that after i left martens he sent telegrams to guy and philip and her cousin lord tarvrille he was i think amazed beyond measure at this revelation of the possibilities of his cold and distant wife with a vast passion of jealousy awaking in him and absolutely incapable of forming any plan to meet the demands of his extraordinary situation guy and philip got to him that night tarvrille came down next morning and martens became a debate justin did not so much express views and intentions as have them extracted from him it was manifest he was prepared for the amplest forgiveness of his wife if only i could be obliterated from their world confronted with her brothers the two men in the world who could be frankly brutal to her marys dignity suffered she persisted she meant to go on seeing me but she was reduced to passionate tears  into some such state of affairs i came that morning on the heels of my letter demanding lady mary of a scared evasive butler  maxton and tarvrille appeared hullo stratton said tarvrille with a fine flavor of an agreeable chance meeting philip had doubts about his greeting me and then extended his reluctant hand with a nervous grin to excuse the delay  i want to see lady mary said i stiffly  shes not up yet said tarvrille with a hand on my shoulder come and have a talk in the garden  we went out with tarvrille expanding the topic of the seasons its a damned good month november say what you like about it philip walked grimly silent on my other hand  and its a damned awkward situation youve got us into stratton said tarvrille say what you like about it  it isnt as though old justin was any sort of beast he reflected or anything like that you know hes a most astonishing decent chap clean as they make them  this isnt a beastly intrigue i said  it never is said tarvrille genially  weve loved each other a long time its just flared out here  no doubt of that said tarvrille its been like a beacon to all surrey  its one of those cases where things have to be readjusted the best thing to do is for mary and me to go abroad  yes but does mary think so  look here said philip in a voice thick with rage i wont have mary divorced i wont see i wont  what the devils it got to do with you i asked with an answering flash of fury  tarvrilles arm ran through mine nobodys going to divorce mary he said reassuringly not even justin he doesnt want to and nobody else can and there you are  but we two  you two have had a tremendously good time youve got found outand there you are  this thing has got to stop absolutely now said philip and echoed with a note of satisfaction in his own phrasing absolutely now  you see stratton said tarvrille as if he were expanding philips assertion theres been too many divorces in society its demoralizing people its discrediting us its setting class against class everybody is saying why dont these big people either set about respecting the law or altering it common people are getting too infernally clearheaded hitherto its mattered so little but we cant stand any more of it stratton now its something more than a private issue its a question of public policy we cant stand any more divorces  he reflected we have to consider something more than our own personal inclinations weve got no business to be here at all if were not a responsible class we owe somethingto ourselves  it was as if tarvrille was as concerned as i was for this particular divorce as if he struggled with a lively desire to see me and mary happily married after the shortest possible interval and indeed he manifestly wasnt unsympathetic he had the strongest proclivity for the romantic and picturesque and it was largely the romantic picturesqueness of renunciation that he urged upon me philip for the most part maintained a resentful silence he was a clenched anger against me against mary against the flaming possibilities that threatened the sister of lord maxton that most promising and distinguished young man  of course their plans must have been definitely made before this talk probably they had made them overnight and probably it was tarvrille had given them a practicable shape but he threw over the whole of our talk so satisfying a suggestion of arrest and prolonged discussion that it never occurred to me that i should not be able to come again on the morrow and renew my demand to see mary even when next day i turned my face to martens and saw the flag had vanished from the flagstaff it seemed merely a token of that households perturbation i thought the house looked oddly blank and sleepy as i drew near but i did not perceive that this was because all the blinds were drawn the door upon the lawn was closed and presently the butler came to open it he was in an old white jacket and collarless lady mary he said lady mary has gone sir she and mr justin went yesterday after you called  gone said i but where  i think abroad sir  abroad  i think abroad  but theyve left an address  only to mr justins office said the man any letters will be forwarded from there  i paused upon the step he remained stiffly deferential but with an air of having disposed of me he reproved me tacitly for forgetting that i ought to conceal my astonishment at this disappearance he was indeed an admirable manservant thank you said i and dropped away defeated from the door  i went down the broad steps walked out up the lawn and surveyed house and trees and garden and sky to the heights and the depths and the uttermost i knew now what it was to be amazed   § 12  i had felt myself an actor in a drama and now i had very much the feeling an actor would have who answers to a cue and finds himself in midstage with the scenery and the rest of the cast suddenly vanished behind him by that mixture of force and persuasion which avails itself of a womans instinctive and cultivated dread of disputes and raised voices and the betrayal of contention to strangers by the sheer tiring down of nerves and of sleepless body and by threats of an immediate divorce and a campaign of ruin against me these three men had obliged mary to leave martens and go with them to southampton and thence they took her in justins yacht the waterwitch to waterford and thence by train to a hired house an adapted old castle at mirk near crogham in mayo there for all practical purposes she was a prisoner they took away her purse and she was four miles from a pillarbox and ten from a telegraph office this house they had taken furnished without seeing it on the recommendation of a london agent and in the name of justins solicitor thither presently went lady ladislaw and an announcement appeared in the times that justin and lady mary had gone abroad for a time and that no letters would be forwarded  i have never learnt the particulars of that abduction but i imagine mary astonished her pride outraged humiliated helpless perplexed and maintaining a certain outward dignity moreover as i was presently to be told she was ill guy and philip were i believe the moving spirits in the affair tarvrille was their apologetic accomplice justin took the responsibility for what they did and bore the cost he was bitterly ashamed to have these compulsions applied to his wife but full now of a gusty fury against myself he loved mary still with a love that was shamed and torn and bleeding but his ruling passion was that infinitely stronger passion than love in our poor human hearts jealousy he was prepared to fight for her now as men fight for a flag tearing it to pieces in the struggle he meant now to keep mary that settled he was prepared to consider whether he still loved her or she him  now here it may seem to you that we are on the very verge of romance here is a beautiful lady carried off and held prisoner in a wild old place standing out half cut off from the mainland among the wintry breakers of the west coast of ireland here is the lover baffled but insistent here are the fierce brothers and the stern dragon husband and you have but to make out that the marriage was compulsory irregular and on the ground of that irregularity finally dissoluble to furnish forth a theme for marriott watson in his most admirable and adventurous vein you can imagine the happy chances that would have guided me to the hidingplace the trusty friend who would have come with me and told the story the grim siege of the placeall as it were sotto voce for fear of scandalthe fight with guy in the little cave my attempted assassination the secret passage would to heaven life had those rich simplicities and one could meet ones man at the end of a sword my siege of mirk makes a very different story from that  in the first place i had no trusted friend of so extravagant a friendship as such aid would demand i had no one whom it seemed permissible to tell of our relations i was not one man against three or four men in a romantic struggle for a woman i was one man against something infinitely greater than that i was one man against nearly all men one man against laws traditions instincts institutions social order whatever my position had been before my continuing pursuit of mary was open social rebellion and i was in a state of extreme uncertainty how far mary was a willing agent in this abrupt disappearance i was disposed to think she had consented far more than she had done to this astonishing step carrying off an unwilling woman was outside my imaginative range it was luminously clear in my mind that so far she had never countenanced the idea of flight with me and until she did i was absolutely bound to silence about her i felt that until i saw her face to face again and was sure she wanted me to release her that prohibition held yet how was i to get at her and hear what she had to say clearly it was possible that she was under restraint but i did not know i was not certain i could not prove it at guildford station i gathered after ignominious enquiries that the justins had booked to london i had two days of nearly frantic inactivity at home and then pretended business that took me to london for fear that i should break out to my father i came up revolving a dozen impossible projects of action in my mind i had to get into touch with mary at that my mind hung and stopped all through the twentyfour hours my nerves jumped at every knock upon my door this might be the letter this might be the telegram this might be herself escaped and come to me the days passed like days upon a painful sickbed grey or foggy london days of an appalling length and emptiness if i sat at home my imagination tortured me if i went out i wanted to be back and see if any communication had come i tried repeatedly to see tarvrille i had an idea of obtaining a complete outfit for an elopement but i was restrained by my entire ignorance of what a woman may need i tried to equip myself for a sudden crisis by the completest preparation of every possible aspect i did some absurd and illadvised things i astonished a respectable solicitor in a grimy little office behind a queer little court with trees near cornhill by asking him to give advice to an anonymous client and then putting my anonymous case before him suppose said i it was for the plot of a play he nodded gravely  my case as i stated it struck me as an unattractive one  application for a writ of habeas corpus he considered with eyes that tried to remain severely impartial by a wifes lover who wants to find out where she is its unusual you will be requiring the husband to produce her corpus i dont thinkspeaking in the same general terms as those in which you put the circumstances it would be likely to succeed no  then i overcame a profound repugnance and went to a firm of private detectives it had occurred to me that if i could have justin tarvrille guy or philip traced i might get a clue to marys hidingplace i remember a queer little office a blusterous frockcoated creature with a pockmarked face irongrey hair an eyeglass and a strained tenor voice who told me twice that he was a gentleman and several times that he would prefer not to do business than to do it in an ungentlemanly manner and who was quite obviously ready and eager to blackmail either side in any scandal into which spite or weakness admitted his gesticulating fingers he alluded vaguely to his staff to his woman helpers some personally attached to me to his remarkable underground knowledge of social lifethe illicit side what could he do for me there was nothing i said illicit about me his interest waned a little i told him that i was interested in certain financial matters no matter what they were and that i wanted to have a report of the movements of justin and his brothersinlaw for the past few weeks and for a little time to come you want them watched said my private enquiry agent leaning over the desk towards me and betraying a slight squint exactly said i i want to know what sort of things they are looking at just at present  have you any inkling  none  if our agents have to travel  i expressed a reasonable generosity in the matter of expenses and left him at last with a vague discomfort in my mind how far mightnt this undesirable unearth the whole business in the course of his investigations and then what could he do suppose i went back forthwith and stopped his enquiries before they began i had a disagreeable feeling of meanness that i couldnt shake off i felt i was taking up a weapon that justin didnt deserve yet i argued with myself that the abduction of mary justified any such course  as i was still debating this i saw philip he was perhaps twenty yards ahead of me he was paying off a hansom which had just put him down outside blakes philip i cried following him up the steps and overtaking him and seizing his arm as the commissionaire opened the door for him philip what have you people done with mary where is mary  he turned a white face to me how dare you he said with a catch of the breath mention my sister  i spoke in an undertone and stepped a little between him and the man at the door in order that the latter might not hear what i said i want to see her i expostulated i must see her what you are doing is not playing the game ive got to see her  let go of my arm sir cried he and suddenly i felt a whirlwind of rage answering the rage in his eyes the pentup exasperation of three weeks rushed to its violent release he struck me in the face with the hand that was gripped about his umbrella he meant to strike me in the face and then escape into his club but before he could get away from me after his blow i had flung out at him and had hit him under the jawbone my blow followed his before guard or counter was possible i hit with all my being it was an amazing flare up of animal passion from the moment that i perceived he was striking at me to the moment when both of us came staggering across the doormat into the dignified and spacious hallway of blakes we were back at the ancestral ape and we did exactly what the ancestral ape would have done the arms of the commissionaire about my waist the rush of the astonished porter from his little glass box two incredibly startled and delighted pages and an intervening member bawling out sir sir converged to remind us that we were a million years or so beyond those purely arboreal days  we seemed for a time to be confronted before an audience that hesitated to interfere how dare you name my sister to me he shouted at me and brought to my mind the amazing folly of which he was capable i perceived marys name flung to the four winds of heaven  you idiot philip i cried i dont know your sister ive not seen herscarcely seen her for years i ask youi ask you for a matchbox or something and you hit me  if you dare to speak to her  you fool i cried going nearer to him and trying to make him understand but he winced and recoiled defensively im sorry i said to the commissionaire who was intervening lord maxton has made a mistake  is he a member said someone in the background and somebody else suggested calling a policeman i perceived that only a prompt retreat would save the whole story of our quarrel from the newspapers so far as i could see nobody knew me there except philip i had to take the risks of his behavior manifestly i couldnt control it i made no further attempt to explain anything to anybody everyone was a little too perplexed for prompt action and so the advantage in that matter lay with me i walked through the door and with what i imagined to be an appearance of the utmost serenity down the steps i noted an ascending member glance at me with an expression of exceptional interest but it was only after i had traversed the length of pall mall that i realized that my lip and the corner of my nostril were both bleeding profusely i called a cab when i discovered my handkerchief scarlet and retreated to my flat and cold ablutions then i sat down to write a letter to tarvrille with a clamorous urgent please forward if away above the address and tell him at least to suppress philip but within the club that blockhead thinking of nothing but the appearances of our fight and his own credit was varying his assertion that he had thrashed me with denunciations of me as a blackguard and giving half a dozen men a highly colored improvised and altogether improbable account of my relentless pursuit and persecution of lady mary justin and how she had left london to avoid me they listened no doubt with extreme avidity the matrimonial relations of the justins had long been a matter for speculative minds  and while philip was doing this guy away in mayo still was writing a tender trusting and all too explicit letter to a wellknown and extremely impatient lady in london to account for his continued absence from her house so that is it said the lady reading and was at least in the enviable position of one who had confirmatory facts to impart  and so quite suddenly the masks were off our situation and we were open to an impertinent world for some days i did not realize what had happened and lived in hope that philip had been willing and able to cover his lapse i went about with my preoccupation still as i imagined concealed and with an increasing number of typed letters from my private enquiry agent in my pocket containing inaccurate and worthless information about the movements of justin which appeared to have been culled for the most part from a communicative young policeman stationed at the corner nearest to the justins house or expanded from whos who and other kindred works of reference the second letter i remember gave some particulars about the financial position of the younger men and added that justins credit with the westend tradesmen was limitless points upon which i had no sort of curiosity whatever  i suppose a couple of hundred people in london knew before i did that lady mary justin had been carried off to ireland and practically imprisoned there by her husband because i was her lover the thing reached me at last through little fred riddling who came to my rooms in the morning while i was sitting over my breakfast stratton said he what is all this story of your shaking justin by the collar and threatening to kill him if he didnt give up his wife to you and why do you want to fight a duel with maxton whats it all about fireeater you must be i stood up for you as well as i could but i heard you abused for a solid hour last night and there was a chap there simply squirting out facts and dates and names got it all what have you been up to  he stood on my hearthrug with an air of having called for an explanation to which he was entitled and he very nearly got one but i just had some scraps of reserve left and they saved me tell me first i said delaying myself with the lighting of a cigarette the particulars  as you heard them  riddling embarked upon a descriptive sketch and i got a minute or so to think  go on i said with a note of irony when he paused go on tell me some more where did you say they have taken her let us have it right  by the time his little store had run out i knew exactly what to do with him riddling said i and stood up beside him suddenly and dropped my hand with a little added weight upon his shoulder riddling do you know the only right and proper thing to do when you hear scandal about a friend  come straight to him said riddling virtuously as i have done  no say you dont believe it ask the scandalmonger how he knows and insist on his telling youinsist and if he wontbe very very rude to him insist up to the quarrelling point now who were those people  wellthats a bit stiff one chap i didnt know at all  you should have pulled him up and insisted upon knowing who he was and what right he had to lie about me for its lying riddling listen it isnt true that im besieging lady mary justin so far from besieging her i didnt even know where she was until you told me justin is a neighbor of my fathers and a friend of mine i had tea with him and his wife not a month ago i had tea with them together i knew they were going away but it was a matter of such slight importance to me such slight importancei impressed this on his collarbonethat i was left with the idea that they were going to the south of france i believe they are in the south of france and there you are im sorry to spoil sport but thats the bleak unromantic truth of the matter  you mean to say that there is nothing in it all  nothing  he was atrociously disappointed but everybody he said everybody has got something  somebody will get a slander case if this goes on i dont care what theyve got  good lord he said and stared at the rug youll take your oath he glanced up and met my eye oh of course its all right what you say he was profoundly perplexed he reflected but then i say stratton why did you go for maxton at blakes that i had from an eyewitness you cant deny a scrap like thatin broad daylight why did you do that  oh thats it said i i begin to have glimmerings theres a little matter between myself and maxton i found it a little difficult to improvise a plausible story  but he said it was his sister persisted riddling he said so afterwards in the club  maxton said i losing my temper is a fool and a knave and a liar his sister indeed lady mary if he cant leave his sister out of this business ill break every bone of his body  i perceived my temper was undoing me i invented rapidly but thinly as a matter of fact riddling its quite another sort of lady has set us by the ears  riddling stuck his chin out tucked in the corners of his mouth made round eyes at the breakfast things and hands in pockets rocked from heels to toes and from toes to heels i see stratton yes i see yes all this makes it very plain of course very plain stupid thing scandal is thanks no i wont have a cigarette  and he left me presently with an uncomfortable sense that he did see and didnt for one moment intend to restrain his considerable histrionic skill in handing on his vision to others for some moments i stood savoring this all too manifest possibility and then my thoughts went swirling into another channel at last the curtain was pierced i was no longer helplessly in the dark i got out my bradshaw and sat with the map spread out over the breakfast things studying the routes to mayo then i rang for williams the man i shared with the two adjacent flatholders and told him to pack my kitbag because i was suddenly called away   § 13  many of the particulars of my journey to ireland have faded out of my mind altogether i remember most distinctly my mood of grim elation that at last i had to deal with accessible persons again  the weather was windy and violent and i was seasick for most of the crossing and very tired and exhausted when i landed williams had thought of my thick overcoat and loaded me with wraps and rugs and i sat in the corner of a compartment in that state of mental and bodily fatigue that presses on the brows like a painless headache i got to some little junction at last where i had to wait an hour for a branchline train i tasted all the bitterness of irish hospitality and such coffee as ireland alone can produce then i went on to a station called clumber or clumboye or some such name and thence after some difficulty i got a car for my destination it was a wretched car in which hens had been roosting and it was drawn by a steaming horse that had sores under its mended harness  an immense wet wind was blowing as we came over the big hill that lies to the south of mirk everything was wet the hillside above me was either intensely green sodden turf or great streaming slabs of limestone seaward was a rocky headland a ruin of a beehive shape and beyond a vast waste of tumbling waters unlit by any sun not a tree broke that melancholy wilderness nor any living thing but ourselves the horse went stumblingly under the incessant stimulation of the drivers lash and tongue  yonder it is said my man pointing with his whip and i twisted round to see over his shoulder not the rhinelike castle i had expected but a long low house of stone upon a headland backed by a distant mountain that vanished in a wild driven storm of rain as i looked but at the sight of mirk my lassitude passed my nerves tightened and my will began to march again now thought i we bring things to an issue now we come to something personal and definite the vagueness is at an end i kept my eyes upon the place and thought it more and more like a prison as we drew nearer perhaps from that window mary was looking for me now had she wondered why i did not come to her before now at any rate i had found her i sprang off the car found a bellhandle and set the house jangling  the door opened and a little old man appeared with his fingers thrust inside his collar as though he were struggling against strangulation he regarded me for a second and spoke before i could speak  what might you be wanting said he as if he had an answer ready  i want to see lady mary justin i said  you cant he said shes gone  gone  the day before yesterday she went to london youll have to be getting back there  shes gone to london  no less  willingly  the little old man struggled with his collar anyone would go willingly he said and seemed to await my further commands he eyed me obliquely with a shadow of malice in his eyes  it was then my heart failed and i knew that we lovers were beaten i turned from the door without another word to the janitor back said i to my driver and got up behind him  but it is one thing to decide to go back and another to do it at the little station i studied timetables and i could not get to england again without a delay of half a day somewhere i must wait i did not want to wait where there was any concourse of people i decided to stay in the inn by the station for the intervening six hours and get some sleep before i started upon my return but when i saw the bedroom i changed my plan and went down out of the village by a steep road towards the shore i wandered down through the rain and spindrift to the very edge of the sea and there found a corner among the rocks a little sheltered from the wind and sat inert and wretched my lips salt my hair stiff with salt and my body wet and cold a miserable defeated man for i had now an irrational and entirely overwhelming conviction of defeat i saw as if i ought always to have seen that i had been pursuing a phantom of hopeless happiness that my dream of ever possessing mary again was fantastic and foolish and that i had expended all my strength in vain over me triumphed a law and tradition more towering than those cliffs and stronger than those waves i was overwhelmed by a sense of human weakness of the infinite feebleness of the individual man against wind and wave and the stress of tradition and the ancient usages of mankind we must submit i whispered crouching close we must submit   far as the eye could reach the waves followed one another in long unhurrying lines an inexhaustible succession rolling hissing breaking and tossing white manes of foam to gather at last for a crowning effort and break thunderously squirting foam two hundred feet up the streaming faces of the cliffs the wind tore and tugged at me and wind and water made together a clamor as though all the evil voices in the world all the violent passions and all the hasty judgments were seeking a hearing above the more elemental uproar   § 14  and while i was in this phase of fatigue and despair in mayo the scene was laid and all the other actors were waiting for the last act of my defeat in london i came back to find two letters from mary and a little accumulation of telegrams and notes one written in my flat from tarvrille  marys letters were neither of them very long and full of a newborn despair she had not realized how great were the forces against her and against us both she let fall a phrase that suggested she was ill she had given in she said to save herself and myself and others from the shame and ruin of a divorce and i must give in too we had to agree not to meet or communicate for three years and i was to go out of england she prayed me to accept this she knew she said she seemed to desert me but i did not know everythingi did not know everythingi must agree she could not come with me it was impossible now certainly it was impossible she had been weak but i did not know all if i knew all i should be the readier to understand and forgive her but it was part of the conditions that i could not know all justin had been generous in his way justin had everything in his hands the whole world was behind him against us and i must give in those letters had a quality i had never before met in her they were brokenspirited i could not understand them fully and they left me perplexed with a strong desire to see her to question her to learn more fully what this change in her might mean  tarvrilles notes recorded his repeated attempts to see me i felt that he alone was capable of clearing up things for me and i went out again at once and telegraphed to him for an appointment  he wired to me from that same house in mayfair in which i had first met mary after my return he asked me to come to him in the afternoon and thither i went through a november fog and found him in the drawingroom that had the plate glass above the fireplace but now he was vacating the house and everything was already covered up the pictures and their frames were under holland the fine furniture all in covers of faded stuff the chandeliers and statues wrapped up the carpets rolled out of the way even the windowcurtains were tucked into wrappers and the blinds except one he had raised drawn down he greeted me and apologized for the cold inhospitality of the house it was convenient here he said i came here to clear out my papers and boxes and theres no chance of interruptions  he went and stood before the empty fireplace and plunged into the middle of the matter  you know my dear stratton in this confounded business my hearts with you it has been all along if i could have seen a clear chance before youfor you and mary to get awayand make any kind of life of itthough shes my cousinid have helped you indeed i would but theres no sort of chancenot the ghost of a chance  he began to explain very fully quite incontrovertibly that entire absence of any chance for mary and myself together he argued to the converted you know as well as i do what that romantic flight abroad that ouidaesque casa in some secluded valley comes to in reality all round florence theres no end of such scandalous people ive been among them the nine circles of the repenting scandalous all cutting one another  i agree i said and yet  what  we could have come back  tarvrille paused and then leant forward no  but people have done so it would have been a clean sort of divorce  you dont understand justin justin would ruin you if you were to take mary away hes a queer little man everything is in his hands everything always is in the husbands hands in these affairs if he chooses and keeps himself in the right for an injured husband the law sanctifies revenge  and you see youve got to take justins terms hes changed he didnt at first fully realize he feelscheated weve had to persuade him theres a case for justin you know hes had to standa lot i dont wonder at his going stiff at last no doubt its hard for you to see that but you have to see it youve got to go away as he requiresthree years out of england youve got to promise not to correspond not to meet afterwards  its so extravagant a separation  the alternative isnot for you to have mary but for you two to be flung into the ditch togetherthats what it comes to stratton justins got his case hes set likesteel youre up against the law up against social tradition up against moneyany one of those a man may fight but not all three and shes ill stratton you owe her consideration you of all people thats no gotup story shes truly ill and broken she can no longer fly with you and fight with you travel in uncomfortable trains stay in horrible little inns you dont understand the edge is off her pluck stratton  what do you mean i asked and questioned his face  just exactly what i say  a gleam of understanding came to me  why cant i see her i broke in with my voice full of misery and anger why cant i see her as if seeing her once more could matter so very greatly now  he appeared to weigh something in his mind you cant he said  how do i know that shes not being told some story of my abandonment of her how do i know she isnt being led to believe i no longer want her to come to me  she isnt said tarvrille still with that arrested judicial note in his voice you had her letters he said  two  yes didnt they speak  i want to see her damn it tarvrille i cried with sudden tears in my smarting eyes let her send me away this isnt not treating us like human beings  women said tarvrille and looked at his boot toes are different from men you see stratton  he paused you always strike me stratton as not realizing that women are weak things weve got to take care of them you dont seem to feel that as i do their moodsfluctuatemore than ours do if you hold em to what they say in the same way you hold a manit isnt fair  he halted as though he awaited my assent to that proposition  if you were to meet mary now you see and if you were to say to her comecome and well jump down etna together and you said it in the proper voice and with the proper force shed do it stratton you know that any man knows a thing like that and she wouldnt want to do it  you mean thats why i cant see her  thats why you cant see her  because wed becomedramatic  because youd becomeromantic and uncivilized  well i said sullenly realizing the bargain we were making i wont  you wont make any appeal  no  he made no answer and i looked up to discover him glancing over his shoulder through the great glass window into the other room i stood up very quickly and there in the further apartment were guy and mary standing side by side our eyes met and she came forward towards the window impulsively and paused with that unpitying pane between us  then guy was opening the door for her and she stood in the doorway she was in dark furs wrapped about her but in the instant i could see how ill she was and how broken she came a step or so towards me and then stopped short and so we stood shyly and awkwardly under guy and tarvrilles eyes two yards apart you see she said and stopped lamely  you and i i said have to part mary we we are beaten is that so  stephen there is nothing for us to do weve offended we broke the rules we have to pay  by parting  what else is there to do  no i said theres nothing else   i tried she said that you shouldnt be sent from england  thats a detail i answered  but your politicsyour work  that does not matter the great thing is that you are ill and unhappythat i cant help you i cant do anything id go anywhere  to save you all i can do i suppose is to part like this and go  i shant bealtogether unhappy and i shall think of you  she paused and we stood facing one another tonguetied there was only one word more to say and neither of us would say it for a moment  goodbye she whispered at last and then dont think i deserted you stephen my dear dont think ill of me i couldnt comei couldnt come to you and suddenly her face changed slowly and she began to weep my fearless playmate whom i had never seen weeping before she began to weep as an unhappy child might weep  oh my mary i cried weeping also and held out my arms and we clung together and kissed with tearwet faces  no cried guy belatedly we promised justin  but tarvrille restrained his forbidding arm and then after a seconds interval put a hand on my shoulder come he said  and so it was mary and i parted from one another     chapter the seventh  beginning again   § 1  in operas and romances one goes from such a parting in a splendid dignity of gloom but i am no hero and i went down the big staircase of tarvrilles house the empty shuck of an abandoned desire i was acutely ashamed of my recent tears in the centre of the hall was a marble figure swathed about with yellow muslin on account of the flies i said breaking our silence  my words were far too unexpected for tarvrille to understand the flies i repeated with an air of explanation  youre sure shell be all right i said abruptly  youve done the best thing you can for her  i suppose i have i have to go and then i saw ahead of me a world full of the tiresome need of decisions and arrangements and empty of all interest where the devil am i to go tarvrille i cant even get out of things altogether  and then with a fresh realization of painful difficulties ahead i have to tell this to my father ive got to explain and he thoughthe expected  tarvrille opened the half of the heavy front door for me hesitated and came down the broad steps into the chilly grey street and a few yards along the pavement with me he wanted to say something that he found difficult to say when at last he did find words they were quite ridiculous in substance and yet at the time i took them as gravely as he intended them its no good quoting marcus aurelius said tarvrille to a chap with his finger in the crack of a door  i suppose it isnt i said  one doesnt want to be a flatulent ass of course said tarvrille still  he resumed with an air of plunging it will sound just rot to you now stratton but after all it comes to this behind us is asituationwith halfadozen particular persons out herei mean here round the worldbefore youve done with themtheres a thousand million peoplemen and women  oh what does that matter to me said i  everything said tarvrille at leastit ought to  he stopped and held out his hand goodbye strattongood luck to you goodbye  yes i said goodbye  i turned away from him the image of mary crying as a child cries suddenly blinded me and blotted out the world   § 2  i want to give you as clearly as i can some impression of the mental states that followed this passion and this collapse it seems to me one of the most extraordinary aspects of all that literature of speculative attack which is called psychology that there is no name and no description at all of most of the mental states that make up life psychology like sociology is still largely in the scholastic stage it is ignorant and intellectual a happy refuge for the lazy industry of pedants instead of experience and accurate description and analysis it begins with the rash assumption of elements and starts out upon ridiculous syntheses who with a sick soul would dream of going to a psychologist  now here was i with a mind sore and inflamed i did not clearly understand what had happened to me i had blundered offended entangled myself and i had no more conception than a beast in a bog what it was had got me or the method or even the need of escape the desires and passionate excitements the anger and stress and strain and suspicion of the last few months had worn deep grooves in my brain channels without end or issue out of which it seemed impossible to keep my thoughts i had done dishonorable things told lies abused the confidence of a friend i kept wrestling with these intolerable facts if some momentary distraction released me for a time back i would fall presently before i knew what was happening and find myself scheming once more to reverse the accomplished or eloquently restating things already intolerably overdiscussed in my mind justifying the unjustifiable or avenging defeat i would dream again and again of some tremendous appeal to mary some violent return and attack upon the situation  one very great factor in my mental and moral distress was the uncertain values of nearly every aspect of the case there is an invincible sense of wild rightness about passionate love that no reasoning and no training will ever altogether repudiate i had a persuasion that out of that i would presently extract a magic to excuse my deceits and treacheries and assuage my smarting shame and round these deep central preoccupations were others of acute exasperation and hatred towards secondary people there had been interventions judgments upon insufficient evidence comments and often quite justifiable comments that had filled me with an extraordinary savagery of resentment  i had a persuasion illogical but invincible that i was still entitled to all the respect due to a man of unblemished honor i clung fiercely to the idea that to do dishonorable things isnt necessarily to be dishonorable this state of mind i am describing is i am convinced the state of every man who has involved himself in any affair at once questionable and passionate he seems free but he is not free he is the slave of the relentless paradox of his position  and we were all of us more or less in deep grooves we had made for ourselves philip guy justin the friends involved and all in the measure of our grooves incapable of tolerance or sympathetic realization even when we slept the clenched fist of the attitudes we had assumed gave a direction to our dreams  you see the same string of events that had produced all this system of intense preoccupations had also severed me from the possible resumption of those wider interests out of which our intrigue had taken me i had had to leave england and all the political beginnings i had been planning and to return to those projects now those now impossible projects was to fall back promptly into hopeless exasperation  and then the longing the longing that is like a physical pain that hunger of the heart for some one intolerably dear the desire for a voice the arrested habit of phrasing ones thoughts for a hearer who will listen in peace no more from that lonely distress even rage even the concoction of insult and conflict was a refuge from that pitiless travail of emptiness i was ready to turn desperately to any offer of excitement and distraction  from all those things i was to escape at last unhelped but i want you to understand particularly these phases through which i passed it falls to many and it may fall to you to pass through such a period of darkness and malign obsession make the groove only a little deeper a little more unclimbable make the temperament a little less sanguine and suicide stares you in the face and things worse than suicide that suicide of selfrespect which turns men to drugs and inflammatory vices and the utmost outrageous defiance of the dreaming noble self that has been so despitefully used into these same inky pools i have dipped my feet where other men have drowned i understand why they drown and my taste of misdeed and resentment has given me just an inkling of what men must feel who go to prison i know what it is to quarrel with a world   § 3  my first plan when i went abroad was to change my harbury french which was poor stuff and pedantic into a more colloquial article and then go into germany to do the same thing with my german and then perhaps to remain in germany studying german social conditionsand the quality of the german army it seemed to me that when the term of my exile was over i might return to england and reenter the army but all these were very anæmic plans conceived by a tired mind and i set about carrying them out in a mood of slack lassitude i got to paris and in paris i threw them all overboard and went to switzerland  i remember very clearly how i reached paris i arrived about sunseti suppose at st lazare or the gare du nordsent my luggage to the little hotel in the rue dantin where i had taken rooms and dreading their loneliness decided to go direct to a restaurant and dine i remember walking out into the streets just as shops and windows and street lamps were beginning to light up and strolling circuitously through the clear bright stir of the parisian streets to find a dinner at the café de la paix some day you will know that peculiar sharp definite excitement of paris all cities are exciting and each i think in a different way and as i walked down along some boulevard towards the centre of things i saw a woman coming along a side street towards me a woman with something in her body and something in her carriage that reminded me acutely of mary her face was downcast and then as we converged she looked up at me not with the meretricious smile of her class but with a steadfast friendly look her face seemed to me sane and strong i passed and hesitated an extraordinary impulse took me i turned back i followed this woman across the road and a little way along the opposite pavement i remember i did that but i do not remember clearly what was in my mind at the time i think it was a vague rush towards the flash of companionship in her eyes there i had seemed to see the glimmer of a refuge from my desolation then came amazement and reaction i turned about and went on my way and saw her no more  but afterwards later i went out into the streets of paris bent upon finding that woman she had become a hope a desire  i looked for her for what seemed a long time half an hour perhaps or two hours i went along peering at the womens faces through the blazing various lights the pools of shadowy darkness the flickering reflections and transient glitter one of a vast stream of slowmoving adventurous human beings i crossed streams of traffic paused at luminous kiosks became aware of dim rows of faces looking down upon me from above the shining enamel of the omnibuses my first intentness upon one person so that i disregarded any distracting intervention gave place by insensible degrees to a more general apprehension of the things about me that original woman became as it were diffused i began to look at the men and women sitting at the little tables behind the panes of the cafés and even on the terracesfor the weather was still dry and open i scrutinized the faces i passed faces for the most part animated by a sort of shallow eagerness many were ugly many vile with an intense vulgarity but some in that throng were pretty some almost gracious there was something pathetic and appealing for me in this great sweeping together of people into a little light into a weak community of desire for joy and eventfulness there came to me a sense of tolerance of fellowship of participation from an outer darkness of unhappiness or at least of joylessness they had all come hitheras i had come  i was like a creature that slips back again towards some deep waters out of which long since it came into the light and air it was as if old forgotten things prenatal experiences some magic of ancestral memories urged me to mingle again with this unsatisfied passion for life about me  then suddenly a wave of feeling between selfdisgust and fear poured over me this vortex was drawing me into deep and unknown things i hailed a passing fiacre went straight to my little hotel settled my account with the proprietor and caught a night train for switzerland  all night long my head ached and i lay awake swaying and jolting and listening to the rhythms of the wheels paris clean forgotten so soon as it was left and my thoughts circling continually about justin and philip and mary and the things i might have said and done   § 4  one day late in february i found myself in vevey i had come down with the breakup of the weather from montana where i had met some oxford men i knew and had learned to ski i had made a few of those vague acquaintances one makes in a wintersport hotel but now all these people were going back to england and i was thrown back upon myself once more i was dull and angry and unhappy still full of selfreproaches and dreary indignations and then very much as the sky will sometimes break surprisingly through storm clouds there began in me a new series of moods they came to me by surprise one clear bright afternoon i sat upon the wall that runs along under the limes by the lake shore envying all these people who were going back to england and work and usefulness i thought of myself of my career spoilt my honor tarnished my character tested and found wanting so far as english politics went my prospects had closed for ever even after three years it was improbable that i should be considered by the party managers again and besides it seemed to me i was a man crippled my other self the mate and confirmation of my mind had gone from me i was no more than a mutilated man my life was a thing condemned i had joined the ranks of loafing morallylimping english exiles  i looked up the sun was setting a warm glow fell upon the dissolving mountains of savoy and upon the shining mirror of the lake the luminous tranquil breadth of it caught me and held me i am done for the light upon the lake and upon the mountains the downward swoop of a bird over the water and something in my heart gave me the lie  what nonsense i said and felt as if some dark cloud that had overshadowed me had been thrust back  i stared across at savoy as though that land had spoken why should i let all my life be ruled by the blunders and adventures of one short year of adventure why should i become the votary of a train of consequences what had i been dreaming of all this time over there were gigantic uplands i had never seen and trodden and beyond were great plains and cities and beyond that the sea and so on great spaces and multitudinous things all round about the world what did the things i had done the things i had failed to do the hopes crushed out of me the tears and the anger matter to that and in some amazing way this thought so took possession of me that the question seemed also to carry with it the still more startling collateral what then did they matter to me come out of yourself said the mountains and all the beauty of the world whatever you have done or suffered is nothing to the inexhaustible offer life makes you we are you just as much as the past is you  it was as though i had forgotten and now remembered how infinitely multitudinous life can be it was as if tarvrilles neglected words to me had sprouted in the obscurity of my mind and borne fruit  i cannot explain how that mood came i am doing my best to describe it and it is not easy even to describe and i fear that to you who will have had i hope no experience of such shadows as i had passed through it is impossible to convey its immense elation i remember once i came in a boat out of the caves of han after two hours in the darkness and there was the common daylight that is nothing wonderful at all and its brightness ahead there seemed like trumpets and cheering like waving flags and like the sunrise and so it was with this mood of my release  there is a phrase of peter e noyes that queer echo of emerson whom people are always rediscovering and forgetting again a phrase that sticks in my mindevery living soul is heir to an empire and has fallen into a pit its an image wonderfully apt to describe my change of mental attitude and render the contrast between those intensely passionate personal entanglements that had held me tight and that wide estate of life that spreads about us all open to all of us in just the measure that we can scramble out of our individual selvesto a more general self i seemed to be hanging there at the brim of my stale and painful den staring at the unthoughtof greatness of the world with an unhopedfor wind out of heaven blowing upon my face  i suppose the intention of the phrase finding salvation as religious people use it is very much this experience if it is not the same thing it is something very closely akin it is as if someone were scrambling out of a pit into a largenessa largeness that is attainable by every man just in the measure that he realizes it is there  i leave these fine discriminations to the theologian i know that i went back to my hotel in vevey with my mind healed with my will restored to me and my ideas running together into plans and i know that i had come out that day a broken and apathetic man   § 5  the next day my mood declined again it was as if that light that sense of release that had shone so clear and strong in my mind had escaped me i sought earnestly to recover it but i could not do so and i found my old narrow preoccupations calling urgently to me again  i thought that perhaps i might get back those intimations of outlook and relief if i clambered alone into some high solitude and thought i had a crude attractive vision of myself far above the heat and noise communing with the sky it was the worst season for climbing and on the spur of the moment i could do nothing but get up the rochers de naye on the wrong side and try and find some eyrie that was neither slippery nor wet i did not succeed in one place i slipped down a wet bank for some yards and held at last by a root if i had slipped much further i should not be writing here now and i came back a very weary and bruised climber without any meditation  three nights after when i was in bed i became very lucidly awakeit must have been about two or three in the morningand the vision of life returned to me with that same effect of enlargement and illumination it was as if the great stillness that is behind and above and around the world of sense did in some way communicate with me it bade me rouse my spirit and go on with the thoughts and purposes that had been stirring and proliferating in my mind when i had returned to england from the cape dismiss your passion but i urged that that i could not do there was the thought of mary subjugated and weeping the smarting memory of injury and defeat the stains of subterfuge and discovery the aching separation no matter the stillness answered in the end all that is just to temper you for your greater uses i cannot forget i insisted do not forget but for the present this leads you no whither this chapter has ended dismiss it and turn to those other things you are not only stephen stratton who fell into adultery in these silences he is a little thing and far away here and with me you are maneverymanin this round world in which your lot has fallen but mary i urged to forget mary is a treason an ingratitude seeing that she loved me but the stillness did not command me to forget her but only to turn my face now to the great work that lies before mankind and that work that work so far as your share goes is first to understand to solve and then to achieve to work out in the measure of yourself that torment of pity and that desire for order and justice which together saturate your soul go about the world embrue yourself with life make use of that confusedly striving brain that i have lifted so painfully out of the deadness of matter  but who are you i cried out suddenly to the night who are you  i sat up on the side of my bed the dawn was just beginning to break up the featureless blackness of the small hours this is just some odd corner of my brain i said  yet how did i come to have this odd corner in my brain what is this lucid stillness   § 6  let me tell you rather of my thoughts than of my moods for there at least one comes to something with a form that may be drawn and a substance that is measurable one ceases to struggle with things indefinable and the effort to convey by metaphors and imaginary voices things that are at once bodiless and soundless and lightless and yet infinitely close and real and moreover with that mysterious and subtle change of heart in me there came also a change in the quality and range of my ideas i seemed to rise out of a tangle of immediacies and misconceptions to see more largely and more freely than i had ever done before  i have told how in my muddled and wounded phase i had snatched at the dull project of improving my languages and under the cloak of that spying a little upon german military arrangements now my mind set such petty romanticism on one side it had recovered the strength to look on the whole of life and on my place in it it could resume the ideas that our storm of passion had for a time thrust into the background of my thoughts i took up again all those broad generalizations that had arisen out of my experiences in south africa and which i had been not so much fitting into as forcing into the formulæ of english politics i recalled my disillusionment with british imperialism my vague but elaborating apprehension of a profound conflict between enterprise and labor a profound conflict between the life of the farm and the life of trade and finance and wholesale production as being something far truer to realities than any of the issues of party and patriotism upon which men were spending their lives so far as this rivalry between england and germany which so obsessed the imagination of europe went i found that any faith i may have had in its importance had simply fallen out of my mind as a danger to civilization as a conceivable source of destruction and delay it was a monstrous business enough but that in the long run it mattered how or when they fought and which won i did not believe in the development of mankind the thing was of far less importance than the struggle for flanders or the wars of france and burgundy i was already coming to see europe as no more than the dogseared corner of the page of historylike most europeans i had thought it the pageand my recovering mind was eager and open to see the world beyond and form some conception of the greater forces that lay outside our insularities what is humanity as a whole doing what is the nature of the world process of which i am a part why should i drift from cradle to grave wearing the blinkers of my time and nationality a mere denizen of christendom accepting its beliefs its stale antagonisms its unreal purposes that perhaps had been tolerable while i was still an accepted member of the little world into which my lot had fallen but now that i was thrust out its absurdity glared for me the alternative was to be a worldman or no man i had seemed sinking towards the latter now i faced about and began to make myself what i still seek to make myself today a son of mankind a conscious part of that web of effort and perplexity which wraps about our globe  all this i say came into my mind as if it were a part of that recovery of my mind from its first passionate abjection and it seemed a simple and obvious part of the same conversion to realize that i was ignorant and narrow and that too in a world which is suffering like a beast in a slime pit by reason of ignorance and narrowness of outlook and that it was my manifest work and purpose to make myself less ignorant and to see and learn with all my being it came to me as a clear duty that i should get out of the land of hotels and leisure and go seeking the facts and clues to human interrelationship nearer the earthy roots of things and i turned my thoughts to india and china those vast enigmas of human accumulation in a spirit extraordinarily like that of some mystic who receives a call i felt i must go to asia and from asia perhaps round the world but it was the greatness of asia commanded me i wanted to see the east not as a spectacle but as the simmering vat in which the greater destiny of man brews and brews   § 7  it was necessary to tell my father of my intentions i made numerous beginnings i tore up several letters and quarrelled bitterly with the hotel pens at first i tried to describe the change that had happened to my mind to give him some impression of the new light the release that had come to me but how difficult this present world is with its tainted and poisoned phrases and its tangled misunderstandings here was i writing for the first time in my life of something essentially religious and writing it to him whose profession was religion and i could find no words to convey my meaning to him that did not seem to me fraught with the possibilities of misinterpretation one evening i made a desperate resolve to let myself go and scrawled my heart out to him as it seemed that night a strange long letter it was one of the profoundest regrets that came to me when i saw him dead last winter that i did not risk his misunderstanding and post that letter but when i reread it in the next mornings daylight it seemed to me so rhetorical so full ofwhat shall i call itspiritual bombast it so caricatured and reflected upon the deep feelings sustaining me that i could not post it for shamefacedness and i tore it up into little pieces and sent instead the briefest of notes  i am doing no good here in switzerland i wrote would you mind if i went east i want to see something of the world outside europe i have a fancy i may find something to do beyond there of course it will cost rather more than my present allowance i will do my best to economize dont bother if it bothers youive been bother enough to you  he replied still more compactly by all means i will send you some circular notes poste restante rome that will be on your way good wishes to you stephen im glad you want to go east instead of just staying in switzerland  i sit here now and wonder little son what he thought what he supposed what he understood  i loved my father and i began to perceive he loved me wonderfully i can imagine no man i would have sooner had for a priest than him all priestcraft lays hands if it can and with an excellent wisdom upon the titles and dignity of fatherhood and yet here am i left to guessingi do not know whether my father ever worshipped whether he ever prayed with his heart bared to god there are times when the inexpressiveness of life comes near to overwhelming me when it seems to me we are all asleep or entranced and but a little way above the still cows who stand munching slowly in a field why couldnt we and why didnt we talk together we fear bathos too much are shyly decent to the pitch of mania we have neither the courage of our bodies nor of our souls  i went almost immediately to rome i stayed in rome some days getting together an outfit and incidentally seeing that greater city of the dead in whose embrace the modern city lies i was now becoming interested in things outside my grooves though my grooves were still there deep and receptive and i went about the place at last almost eagerly tracing the outlines of that great departed city on whose colossal bones the churches and palaces of the middle ages cluster like weeds in the spaces and ruins of a magnificent garden i found myself one day in the forum thinking of that imperialism that had built the basilica of julius cæsar and comparing its cramped vestiges with that vaster second administrative effort which has left the world the monstrous arches of constantine i sat down over against these last among the ruins of the vestals house and mused on that later reconstruction when the empire with its science aborted and its literature and philosophy shrivelled to nothing its social fabric ruined by the extravagances of financial adventure and its honor and patriotism altogether dead united itself in a desperate effort to continue with all that was most bickeringly intolerant and destructive in christianityonly to achieve one common vast decay all europe to this day is little more than the sequel to that failure it is the roman empire in disintegration the very churches whose domes rise to the northward of the ancient remains are built of looted stones and look like parasitic and fungoid growths and the tourists stream through those spaces day by day stare at the marble fragments the arches the fallen carvings and rich capitals with nothing greater in their minds and nothing clearer  i discovered i was putting all this into the form of a letter to mary i was writing to her in my mind as many people talk to themselves and i remember that i wandered upon the palatine hill musing over the idea of writing a long letter to her a long continuous letter to her a sort of diary of impressions and ideas that somewhen years ahead i might be able to put into her hands  one does not carry out such an idea into reality it is so much easier to leave the letter imagined and unwritten if there lives but little hope of its delivery yet for many years i kept up an impalpable correspondence in my thoughts a stream of expression to which no answer cameuntil at last the habits of public writing and the gathering interests of a new rôle in life diverted it to other ends   § 8  one morning on the way from brindisi to egypt i came up on deck at dawn because my mind was restless and i could not sleep another solitary passenger was already up so intently watching a pinklit rocky coastline away to the north of us that for a time he did not observe me  thats crete he said when at last he became aware of me close at hand  crete said i  yes he said crete  he came nearer to me that sir he said with a challenging emphasis is the most wonderful island ive ever yet set eyes onquite the most wonderful  five thousand years ago he remarked after a pause that seemed to me to be calculated they were building palaces there better than the best we can build today and thingslike modern things they had bathrooms there beautifully fitted bathroomsand admirable sanitationadmirable practicallyamerican they had better artists to serve them than your king edward has why minos would have laughed or screamed at all that windsor furniture and the things they made of gold siryou couldnt get them done anywhere today not for any money there was a go about them they had a kind of writing toobefore the phoenicians no man can read it now and there it is fifty centuries ago it was and todaythey grow oranges and lemons and they riot everything else gone its as if men struggled up to a certain pitch and thengrew tired all this mediterranean its a tired sea  that was the beginning of a curious conversation he was an american a year or so younger than myself going he said to look at egypt  in our country he explained were apt to forget all these workedout regions too apt we dont get our perspectives we think the whole blessed world is one everlasting boom it hit me first down in yucatan that that wasnt so why the worlds littered with the remains of booms and swaggering beginnings americanismtheres always been americanism this mediterranean is just a museum of old americas i guess tyre and sidon thought they were licking creation all the time its set me thinking whats really going on whyanywhereyoure running about among ruinsanywhere and ruins of something just as good as anything were doing today betterin some ways it takes the heart out of you  it was gidding who is now my close friend and ally i remember very vividly the flavor of morning freshness as we watched crete pass away northward and i listened to his talk  i was coming out of new york harbor a month ago and looking back at the skyscrapers he said and suddenly it hit me in the mindthats just the next ruin i thought  i remember that much of our first talk but the rest of it now is indistinct  we had however struck up an acquaintance we were both alone and until he left me on his way to abydos we seem now to have been conversing all the time and almost all the time we were discussing human destiny and the causes of effort and decay and whether the last few ascendant centuries the world has seen have in them anything more persistent than the countless beginnings that have gone before  theres science said i a little doubtfully  at cnossus there they had dædalus sir fifty centuries ago dædalus he was an frs all right i havent a doubt he flew if they hadnt steel they had brass were too conceited about our little modern things   § 9  i found something very striking and dramatic in the passage from europe to asia one steams slowly through a desert that comes up close to the ship the sand stretches away hillock and mound beyond hillock and mound one sees camels in the offing stringing out to some ancient destination one is manifestly passing across a barrierthe canal has changed nothing of that suez is a first dab of tumultuous orientalism noisy and vivid and then after that gleam of turmoil one opens out into the lonely dark blue waters of the red sea right and left the shore is a bitter sunscorched desolation eastward frowns a great rampart of lowering purple mountains towering up to sinai it is like no european landscape the boat goes slowly as if uncharted dangers lurked ahead it is a new world with a new atmosphere then comes wave upon wave of ever more sultry air and the punkahs begin to swing and the white clothes appear everyone casts off europe assumes an asiatic livery the very sun rushing up angrily and abruptly after a heated night is unfamiliar an asiatic sun  and so one goes down that reeffringed waterway to aden it is studded with lonelylooking lighthouses that burn it seems untended and sometimes in their melancholy isolation swing great rhythmic arms of light and then land and the last lateen sails of aden vanishing together one stands out into the hot thundery monotonies of the indian ocean into imprisonment in a blue horizon across whose titan ring the engines seem to throb in vain how one paces the ship day by day and eats and dozes and eats again and gossips inanely and thanks heaven even for a flight of flying fish or a trail of smoke from over the horizon to take ones mind a little out of ones oily quivering prison a hot portentous delay a sinister significant pause that is the voyage from europe to india still  i suppose by the time that you will go to india all this prelude will have vanished you will rattle through in a traindeluxe from calais by way of baku or constantinople you will have none of this effect of a deliberate sullen approach across limitless miles of sea but that is how i went to india everything seemed to expand i was coming out of the frequent landfalls the neighborly intimacies and neighborly conflicts of the mediterranean into something remoter into larger seas and greater lands rarer communications and a vaster future  to go from europe to asia is like going from norway to russia from something slight and advanced to something massive and portentous i felt that nearly nine years ago today all asia seems moving forward to justify my feelings  and i remember too that as i went down the red sea and again in the indian ocean i had a nearly intolerable passion of loneliness a wound may heal and still leave pain i was coming out of europe as one comes out of a familiar house into something larger and stranger i seemed but a little speck of life and behind me far away and silent and receding was the one other being to whom my thoughts were open it seemed very cruel to me that i could not write to her  such moods were to come to me again and again and particularly during the inactivities of voyages and in large empty spaces and at night when i was weary at other times i could banish and overcome them by forcing myself to be busy and by going to see novel and moving things     chapter the eighth  this swarming business of mankind   § 1  i do not think i could now arrange into a consecutive history my travellings my goings and returnings in my wandering effort to see and comprehend the world and certainly even if i could arrange my facts i should still be at a loss to tell of the growth of ideas that is so much more important than any facts to trace the increasing light to its innumerable sources to a chink here to a glowing reflection there to a leap of burning light from some long inert darkness close at hand but steadily the light grew and this vast world of man in which our world little son is the world of a limited class in a small island began to take on definite forms to betray broad universal movements what seemed at first chaotic a drift and tangle of passions traditions foolish ideas blundering hostilities careless tolerances became confusedly systematic showed something persistent and generalized at work among its multitudinous perplexity  i wonder now if i can put before you very briefly the main generalizations that were growing up in my mind during my exile the simplified picture into which i translated the billions of sights and sounds andsmells for every part of the world has its distinctive olfactory palette as much as its palette of colorsthat rained daily and nightly upon my mind  before my eyes again as i sit here in this quiet walled french garden the great space before the jumna musjid at delhi reappears as i saw it in the evening stillness against a glowing sky of gold and the memory of countless worshippers within praying with a devotion no european displays and then comes a memory of that long reef of staircases and temples and buildings the ghats of benares in the blazing morning sun swarming with a vast multitude of multicolored people and the water also swarming with brown bodies it has the colors of a bed of extravagantly splendid flowers and the light that is indian alone even as i sit here these places are alive with happening it is just past midday here at this moment the sun sinks in the skies of india the jumna musjid flushes again with the glow of sunset the smoke of evening fires streams heavenward against its subtle lines and upon those steps at benares that come down the hillside between the conquering mosque of aurangzeb and the shining mirror of the ganges a thousand silent seated figures fall into meditation and other memories recur and struggle with one another the crowded riverstreets of canton the rafts and houseboats and junks innumerable riding over inky water begin now to twinkle with a thousand lights they are ablaze in osaka and yokohama and tokio and the swarming staircase streets of hong kong glitter with a wicked activity now that night has come i flash a glimpse of burmese temples of villages in java of the sombre purple masses of the walls of the tartar city at pekin with squat pagodaguarded gates how those great outlines lowered at me in the twilight full of fresh memories and grim anticipations of baseness and violence and bloodshed i sit here recalling itfeeling it all out beyond the trellised vineclad wall that bounds my physical vision vast crowded world that i have seen going from point to point seeking for clues for generalities until at last it seems to me that there emergessomething understandable  i think i have got something understandable out of it all  what a fantastically courageous thing is this mind of ours my thoughts seem to me at once presumptuous and inevitable i do not know why it is that i should dare that any of us should dream of this attempt to comprehend but we who think are everyone impelled to this amazing effort to get it all together into some simple generality it is not reason but a deepseated instinct that draws our intelligence towards explanations that sets us perpetually seeking laws seeking statements that will fit into infinite incessantly interweaving complexities and be true of them all there is i perceive a valiant and magnificent stupidity about the human mind a disregard of disproportion and insufficiencylike the ferret which will turn from the leveret it has seized to attack even man if he should interfere by these desperate feats of thinking it is that our species has achieved its victories by them it survives by them it must stand the test of ultimate survival some forgotten man in our ancestryfor every begetting man alive was in my individual ancestry and yours three thousand years agofirst dared to think of the world as roundan astounding temerity he rolled up the rivers and mountains the forests and plains and broad horizons that stretched beyond his ken that seemed to commonsense to go on certainly for ever into a ball into a little ball like an orange magnificent feat of the imagination outdoing thors deep draught of the sea and once he had done it all do it and no one falters at the deed you are not yet seven as i write and already you are serenely aware that you live upon a sphere and in much the same manner it is that we who are sociologists and economists publicists and philosophers and what not are attempting now to roll up the vast world of facts which concern human intercourse the whole indeed of history and archæology into some similar imaginable and manageable shape that presently everyone will be able to grasp  i suppose there was a time when nobody bothered at all about the shape of the earth when nobody had even had the idea that the earth could be conceived as having a shape and similarly it is true that it is only in recent centuries that people have been able to suppose that there was a shape to human history it is indeed not much more than a century since there was any real emergence from theological assumptions and pure romanticism and accidentalism in these matters old adam smith it was probing away at the roots of economics who set going the construction of ampler propositions from him spring all those new interpretations which have changed the writing of history from a record of dramatic reigns and wars and crises to an analysis of economic forces how impossible it would be for anyone now to write that great chapter of gibbons in which he sweeps together into one contempt the history of sixty emperors and six hundred years of time his note of weariness and futility vanishes directly ones vision penetrates the immediate surface those heraclians and isaurians and comneni were not history a schoolboy nowadays knows that their record is not history knows them for the mere scum upon the stream  and still today we have our great interpretations to make ours is a time of guesses theories and provisional generalizations our phase corresponds to the cosmography that was still a little divided between discs and domes and spheres and cosmic eggs that was still a thousand years from measuring and weighing a planet for a long time my mind hovered about the stimulating theories of socialism and particularly about those more systematic forms of socialist teaching that centre about karl marx he rose quite naturally out of those early economists who saw all the world in terms of production and saving he was a necessary step for me at least on the way to understanding for a time i did so shape the world in my mind that it seemed to me no more than a vast enterprise for the organization and exploitation of labor for a time i thought human life was essentially a labor problem that working and controlling work and lending and selling and speculating made the essential substance of human life over which the forms of politics ran as the stripes of a tigers skin run and bend over its living muscles i followed my period in thinking that you will find in ferreros roman decline which was published early in this century and which waits for you in the library almost exactly the method of interpretation that was recommending itself to me in 1904 and 1905  well the labor problem concerns a greatsubstantial shall i sayin human society it is only i think the basis and matter of society not its shape and life and reality but it had to be apprehended before i could get on to more actual things insensibly the idea that contemporary political forms mattered very fundamentally to men was fading out of my mind the british empire and the german empire the unity of italy and anglosaxon ascendency the yellow peril and all the other vast phantoms of the worldpoliticians mythology were fading out of my mind in those years as the olympic cosmogony must have faded from the mind of some inquiring greek philosopher in the days of heraclitus and i revised my history altogether in the new light the world had ceased to be chaotic in my mind it had become a vast if as yet a quite inconclusive drama between employer and employed  it makes a wonderful history this history of mankind as a history of labor as a history of the perpetual attempts of an intelligent minority to get things done by other people it does not explain how that aggression of the minority arose nor does it give any conception of a primordial society which corresponds with our knowledge of the realities of primitive communities one begins rather in the air with a human society that sells and barters and sustains contracts and permits land to be privately owned and having as hastily as possible got away from that difficulty of beginnings having ignored the large areas of the world which remain under a pacific and unprogressive agriculture to this day the rest of the story becomes extremely convincing and illuminating it does indeed give a sustaining explanation to a large part of recorded history this generalization about the proclivity of able and energetic people to make other people do things one ignores what is being done as if that mattered nothing and concentrates upon the use and enslavement of men  one sees that enslavement to labor progressing from crude directness to the most subtly indirect methods the first expedient of enterprise was the sword and then the whip and still there are remote and ugly corners of the world in the mexican valle nazionale or in portuguese south africa where the whip whistles still and the threat of great suffering and death follows hard upon the reluctant toiler but the larger part of our modern slavery is past the stage of brand and whip we have fallen into methods at once more subtle and more effective we stand benevolently in front of our fellow man offering almost as if it were food and drink and shelter and love the work we want him to do and behind him we are acutely aware is necessity sometimes quite of our making as when we drive him to work by a huttax or a poll tax or a rent that obliges him to earn money and sometimes not so obviously of our making sometimes so little of our making that it is easy to believe we have no power to remove it instead of flicking the whip we groan at last with harriet martineau at the inexorable laws of political economy that condemn us to comfort and direction and those others to toil and hardship and indignity  and through the consideration of these latter later aspects it was that i came at last to those subtler problems of tacit selfdeception of imperfect and unwilling apprehension of innocently assumed advantages of wilfully disregarded unfairness and also to all those other problems of motive those forgotten questions of why we make others work for us long after our personal needs are satisfied why men aggrandize and undertake which gradually have become in my mind the essential problems of human relationship replacing the crude problems of labor altogether in that position making them at last only questions of contrivance and management on the way to greater ends  i have come to believe now that labor problems are problems merely by the way they have played their part in a greater scheme this phase of expropriation and enslavement this half designed and half unconscious driving of the duller by the clever of the pacific by the bolder of those with weak appetites and imaginations by those with stronger appetites and imaginations has been a necessary phase in human development with my innate passionate desire to find the whole world purposeful i cannot but believe that but however necessary it has been it is necessary no longer strangest of saviors there rises over the conflicts of mankind the glittering angular promise of the machine there is no longer any need for slavery open or disguised we do not need slaves nor toilers nor mere laborers any more they are no longer essential to a civilization man has ridden on his brother man out of the need of servitude he struggles through to a new phase a phase of release a phase when leisure and an unexampled freedom is possible to every human being is possible and it is there one halts seeing that splendid possibility of aspiration and creation before mankindand seeing mankind for the most part still downcast quite unaware or incredulous following the old rounds the grooves of ancient and superseded assumptions and subjections  but here i will not trace in any detail the growth of my conviction that the ancient and heavy obligation to work hard and continually throughout life has already slipped from mans shoulders suffice it that now i conceive of the task before mankind as a task essentially of rearrangement as a problem in relationships extremely complex and difficult indeed but credibly solvable during my indian and chinese journey i was still at the marxist stage i went about the east looking at labor watching its organization and direction seeing great interests and enterprises replace the diffused life of an earlier phase the disputes and discussions in the transvaal which had first opened my mind to these questions came back to me and steadily i lost my interest in those mere political and national issues with their paraphernalia of kings and flags and governments and parties that had hitherto blinded me to these more fundamental interactions   § 2  it happened that in bombay circumstances conspired to bring the crude facts of labor enslavement vividly before me i found a vigorous agitation raging in the english press against the horrible sweating that was going on in the cotton mills i met the journalist most intimately concerned in the business on my second day in india and before a week was out i was hard at work getting up the question and preparing a memorandum with him on the possibility of immediate legislative intervention the very name of bombay which for most people recalls a spacious and dignified landfall lateen sails green islands and jutting precipices a long city of trees and buildings like a bright and various breakwater between the great harbor and the sea and then exquisite little temples painted bullock carriages towers of silence parsis and an amazingly kaleidoscopic populationis for me a reminder of narrow foetid plaguestricken streets and tall insanitary tenementhouses packed and dripping with humanity and of terrible throbbing factories working far into the night blazing with electric light against the velvetblack nightsky of india damp with the steamclouds that are maintained to moisten the thread and swarming with emaciated overworked brown childrenfor even the adults spare and small in those mills seem children to a western eye  i plunged into this heated dreadful business with a passionate interest and went back to the yacht club only when the craving for air and a good bath and clean clothes and space and respect became unendurable i waded deep in labor in this process of consuming humanity for gain chasing my facts through throbbing quivering sheds reeking of sweat and excrement under the tall blacksmoking chimneyschasing them in very truth because when we came prying into the mills after the hour when childlabor should cease there would be a shrill whistle a patter of feet and a cuffing and hiding of the naked little creatures we were trying to rescue they would be hidden under rugs in boxes in the most impossible places and we dragged them out scared and lying many of them were perhaps seven years old at most and the adultsmen and women of fourteen that is to saywe could not touch at all and they worked in that indian heat in a noisome air drenched with steam for fourteen and fifteen hours a day and essential to that general impression is a memory of a slim parsi millmanager luminously explaining the inherited passion for toil in the indian weaver and a certain bulky hindu with a lemonyellow turban and a strip of plump brown stomach showing between his clothes who was doing very well he said with two wives and five children in the mills  that is my bombay that and the columns of crossed circles marking plague cases upon the corners of houses and a peculiar acrid smell and the polychromatic stir of crowded narrow streets between cliffs of architecture with carved timbers and heavy ornamentations into which the sun strikes obliquely and lights a thousand vivid hues  bombay the gateway of what silly people were still calling in those days the immemorial east bombay which is newer than boston or new york bombay which has grown beneath the englishmans shadow out of a portuguese fort in the last two hundred years   § 3  i came out of these dark corners presently into the sunblaze of india i was now intensely interested in the whole question of employment and engaged in preparing matter for my first book enterprise and india and therein you may read how i went first to assam and then down to ceylon following up this perplexing and complicated business of human enslavement to toil exercised by this great spectacle of human labor and at once attracted by and stimulated by and dissatisfied with those socialist generalizations that would make all this vast harsh spectacle of productive enterprise a kind of wickedness and outrage upon humanity and behind and about the things i was looking for were other things for which i was not looking that slowly came into and qualified the problem it dawned upon me by degrees that india is not so much one country as a vast spectacle of human development at every stage in infinite variety one ranges between naked savages and the most sophisticated of human beings i pursued my enquiries about great modern enterprises about railway labor canal labor teaplanting across vast stretches of country where men still lived illiterate agricultural unprogressive and simple as men lived before the first stirrings of recorded history one sees by the tanks of those mudbuilt villages groups of women with brass vessels who are identical in pose and figure and quality with the women modelled in tanagra figures and the droning wallwheel is the same that irrigated the fields of ancient greece and the crops and beasts and all the life is as it was in greece and italy phoenicia and judea before the very dawn of history  by imperceptible degrees i came to realize that this matter of expropriation and enslavement and control which bulks so vastly upon the modern consciousness which the socialists treat as though it was the comprehensive present process of mankind is no more than one aspect of an overlife that struggles out of a massive ancient and traditional common way of living struggles out again and againblindly and always so far with a disorderly insuccess  i began to see in their proper proportion the vast enduring normal human existence the peasants agricultural life unlettered laborious and essentially unchanging on the one hand and on the other those excrescences of multitudinous city aggregation those stormy excesses of productive energy that flare up out of that life establish for a time great unstable strangenesses of human living palaces cities roads empires literatures and then totter and fall back again into ruin in india even more than about the mediterranean all this is spectacular there the peasant goes about his work according to the usage of fifty thousand years he has a primitive version of religion a moral tradition a social usage closely adapted by countless years of trial and survival to his needs and the whole land is littered with the vestiges and abandoned material of those newer bolder more experimental beginnings beginnings that merely began  it was when i was going through the pantherhaunted palaces of akbar at fatehpur sikri that i first felt how tremendously the ruins of the past may face towards the future the thing there is like a frozen wave that rose and never broke and once i had caught that light upon things i found the same quality in all the ruins i saw in amber and vijayanagar and chitor and in all that i have seen or heard of in ancient rome and ancient verona in pæstum and cnossus and ancient athens none of these places was ever really finished and done with the basilicas of cæsar and constantine just as much as the baths and galleries and halls of audience at fatehpur sikri express not ends achieved but thwarted intentions of permanence they embody repulse and rejection they are trials abandoned trials towards ends vaguely apprehended ends felt rather than known even so was i moved by the brugeslike emptinesses of pekin in the vast pretensions of its forbidden city which are like a cry long sustained that at last dies away in a wail i saw the place in 1905 in that slack interval after the european looting and before the great awakening that followed the russojapanese war pekin in a century or so may be added in its turn to the list of abandoned endeavors insensibly the sceptre passes nearer home than any of these places have i imagined the same thing in paris it seemed to me i felt the first chill shadow of that same arrest that impalpable ebb and cessation at the very crest of things that voice which opposes to all the hasty ambitions and gathering eagerness of men it is not here it is not yet  only the other day as i came back from paris to this quiet place and walked across the fields from the railway station to this house i saw an old woman a grandmother a bent old crone with two children playing about her as she cut grass by the wayside and she cut it except that her sickle was steel exactly as old women were cutting grass before there was writing before the dawn of history before men laid the first stones one upon the other of the first city that ever became a ruin  you see civilization has never yet existed it has only continually and obstinately attempted to be our civilization is but the indistinct twilight before the dawn it is still only a confused attempt a flourish out of barbarism and the normal life of men the toiling earthy life of the field and the byre goes on still like a stream that at once supports and carries to destruction the experimental ships of some still imperfect inventor india gives it all from first to last and now the modern movement the latest halfconscious struggle of the new thing in mankind throws up bombay and calcutta vast feverish pustules upon the face of the peninsula bridges the sacred rivers with hideous iron latticework and smears the sky of the dusty ruingirdled city of delhieach ruin is the vestige of an empirewith the black smoke of factory chimneys  altogether scattered over that sunburnt plain there are the remains of five or six extinguished delhis that played their dramas of frustration before the delhi of the great mogul this present phase of human livingits symbol at delhi is now i suppose a scaffoldbristling pile of neogeorgian buildingis the latest of the constructive synthetic efforts to make a newer and fuller life for mankind who dares call it the last i question myself constantly whether this life we live today whether that too is more than a trial of these blind constructive forces more universal perhaps more powerful perhaps than any predecessor but still a trial to litter the world with rusting material when the phase of recession recurs  but yet i can never quite think that is so this time surely it is different this time may indeed be the beginning of a permanent change this time there are new elements new methods and a new spirit at work upon construction that the world has never known before mankind may be now in the dawn of a fresh phase of living altogether it is possible the forces of construction are proportionally gigantic there was never so much clear and critical thought in the world as there is now never so large a body of generally accessible knowledge and suggestion never anything like the same breadth of outlook the same universality of imaginative freedom that is so in spite of infinite turmoil and confusion moreover the effort now is less concentrated less dramatic there is no one vital center to the modern movement which disaster can strike or decay undermine if paris or new york slacken and grow dull and materialist if berlin and london conspire for a mutual destruction tokio or baku or valparaiso or christiania or smyrna or delhi will shelter and continue the onward impetus  and this time too it is not any one person any one dynasty any one cult or race which carries our destiny human thought has begun to free itself from individual entanglements and dramatic necessities and accidental standards it becomes a collective mind a collective will towards achievement greater than individuals or cities or kingdoms or peoples a mind and will to which we all contribute and which none of us may command nor compromise by our private errors it ceases to be aristocratic it detaches itself from persons and takes possession of us all we are involved as it grows free and dominant we find ourselves in spite of ourselves in spite of quarrels and jealousies and conflicts helping and serving in the making of a new worldcity a new greater state above our legal states in which all human life becomes a splendid enterprise free and beautiful whose aptest symbol in all our world is a huge gothic cathedral lit to flame by the sun whose scheme is the towering conquest of the universe whose every little detail is the wroughtout effort of a human soul  such were the ideas that grew together in my mind as i went about india and the east across those vast sunlit plains where men and women still toil in their dusty fields for a harsh living and live in doorless hovels on floors of trampled cowdung persecuted by a hundred hostile beasts and parasites caught and eaten by tigers and panthers as cats eat mice and grievously afflicted by periodic famine and pestilence even as men and women lived before the dawn of history for untold centuries for hundreds of thousands of years   § 4  how strange we english seem in india a little scattered garrison are we anything more than accidental anything more than the messengerboy who has brought the impetus of the new effort towards civilization through the gates of the east are we makers or just a means casually taken up and used by the great forces of god  i do not know i have never been able to tell i have never been able to decide whether we are the greatest or the dullest of peoples  i think we are an imaginative people with an imagination at once gigantic heroic and shy and also we are a strangely restrained and disciplined people who are yet neither subdued nor subordinated these are flat contradictions to state and yet how else can one render the paradox of the english character and this spectacle of a handful of mute snobbish not obviously clever and quite obviously illeducated men holding together kingdoms tongues and races three hundred millions of them in a restless fermenting peace again and again in india i would find myself in little circles of the official englishsupercilious pretentious conventional carefully turned out people living gawkily thinking gawkily talking nothing but sport and gossip relaxing at rare intervals into sentimentality and levity as mean as a banjo tune and a kind of despairful disgust would engulf me and then in some mans work in some huge irrigation scheme some feat of strategic foresight some simple penetrating realization of deeplying things i would find an effect as if out of a thickly rusted sheath one had pulled a sword and found itflame  i recall one evening i spent at a little station in bengal between lucknow and delhi an evening given over to private theatricals the theatre was a huge tent and the little roughly improvised stage was lit by a row of oil footlights and so small as barely to give a foothold for the actors and actresses in the more crowded scenes about me were the great people the colonels wife a touring young man of family officers and the wife of the manager of the big sugar refinery close at hand behind were english of a more dubious social position also connected with the sugar refinery a eurasian family or so very dressy and aggressive and terribly snubbed and then i think various portuguese and other nondescripts and groups of noncommissioned officers and men some with their wives the play admirably chosen was that crystallization of liberal victorian snobbery caste and i remember there was a subcurrent of amusement because the young officer who playedwhat is the name of the heros friend i forgethad in the haste of his superficiality adopted a moustache that would not keep on and an eyeglass that would not keep in  everybody was acting very badly nobody was wordperfect and a rasping prompter would not keep ahead as he ought to have done the scenery and the makeups were daubs and i was filled with amazement that having quite wantonly undertaken to do this thing these people could then do it so slackly then a certain sudden warmth in the applause about me quickened my attention and i realized the satirical purport of drunken old father eccles and the moral intention of his soninlaw the plumber between them they expressed the whole duty of the workingman as the prosperous victorians conceived it he was to work hard always at any job he could find for any wages he could get and if he didnt he was a drunken shirker and the dupe of paid agitators a comforting but misleading doctrine and here were these people a decade on in the twentieth century with time death and judgment close upon them still eagerly applauding eager to excuse their minds with this onesided ungracious oldfashioned nonsense that has done so much to intensify the deepening class antagonisms that strain us now at home almost to the breaking point  how amazingly it seemed those people didnt understand and wouldnt understand any class but their own any race but their own any usage other than their use covertly i surveyed the colonels profile it expressed nothing but entire satisfaction with these disastrous interpretations what a weatherworn thoughtfree face that grizzled veteran showed the world  i was seized with a sudden curiosity to see how the private soldiers behind me were taking old eccles i turned round to discover cropped heads and faces as expressionless as masks and behind them dusky faces watching very alertly and then other dusky faces eurasians inferiors servants natives  then at a sharp edge the glare of our lighting ceased and the canvas walls of our narrow world of illusion opened into a vast blue twilight at the opening stood two whiteclad sikhs very very still and attentive watching the performance and beyond them was a great space of sky over a dim profile of trees and roofs and a minaret a sky darkling down to the flushed red memorysuch a short memory it is in indiaof a day that had gone for ever  i remained staring at that for some time  isnt old eccles good whispered the colonels wife beside me and recalled me to the play  somehow that picture of a narrow canvas tent in the midst of immensities has become my symbol for the whole life of the governing english the english of india and switzerland and the riviera and the west end and the public services  but they are not england they are not the english reality which is a thing at once bright and illuminating and fitful a thing humorous and wise and adventurousshakespeare dickens newton darwin nelson bacon shelleyenglish names every onelike the piercing light of lanterns swinging and swaying among the branches of dark trees at night   § 5  i went again to ceylon to look into the conditions of coolie importation and then i was going back into assam once more still in the wake of indentured labor when i chanced upon a misadventure i had my first and only experience of big game shooting in the garo hills i was clawed out of a tree by a wounded panther he missed his hold and i got back to my branch but my shoulder was put out my thigh was badly torn and my blood was poisoned by the wound i had an evil uncomfortable time my injury hampered me greatly and for a while it seemed likely i should be permanently lamed i had to keep to vehicles and reasonably good roads i wound up my convalescence with a voyage to singapore and from thence i went on rather disconnectedly to a number of exploratory journeysexcursions rather than journeysinto china i got to pekin and then suddenly faced back to europe returning overland through russia  i wanted now to study the conditions of modern industrialism at its sources and my disablement did but a little accelerate a return already decided upon i had got my conception of the east as a whole and of the shape of the historical process i no longer felt adrift in a formless chaos of forces i perceived now very clearly that human life is essentially a creative struggle out of the usage of immemorial years that the synthesis of our contemporary civilization is this creative impulse rising again in its latest and greatest effort the creative impulse rising again as a wave rises from the trough of its predecessors out of the ruins of our parent system imperial rome but this time and for the first time the effort is worldwide and china and iceland patagonia and central africa all swing together with us to makeor into another catastrophic failure to makethe great state of mankind all this i had now distinctly in my mind the new process i perceive had gone further in the west was most developed in the west the lighter end lifts first so back i came away from the great body of mankind which is asia to its head and since i was still held by my promise from returning to england i betook myself first to the pas de calais and then to belgium and thence into industrial germany to study the socialistic movement at its sources  and i was beginning to see too very clearly by the time of my return that what is confusedly called the labor problem is really not one problem at all but two there is the old problem the problem as old as zimbabwe and the pyramids the declining problem the problem of organizing masses of unskilled labor to the constructive ends of a great state and there is the new modification due to machinery which has rendered unskilled labor and labor of a low grade of skill almost unnecessary to mankind added coal oil wind and water the elementary school and the printingpress to our sources of power and superseded the ancient shepherding and driving of men by the possibility of their intelligent and willing cooperation the two are still mixed in every discussion even as they are mixed in the practice of life but inevitably they will be disentangled we break free from slavery open or disguised just as we illuminate and develop this disentanglement  i have long since ceased to trouble about the economics of human society ours are not economic but psychological difficulties there is enough for everyone and only a fool can be found to deny it but our methods of getting and making are still ruled by legal and social traditions from the time before we had tapped these new sources of power before there was more than enough for everyone and when a bare supply was only secured by jealous possession and unremitting toil we have no longer to secure enough by a stern insistence we have come to a plenty the problem now is to make that plenty go round and keep it enough while we do  our real perplexities are altogether psychological there are no valid arguments against a greatspirited socialism but this that people will not indolence greed meanness of spirit the aggressiveness of authority and above all jealousy jealousy for our pride and vanity jealousy for what we esteem our possessions jealousy for those upon whom we have set the heavy fetters of our love a jealousy of criticism and association these are the real obstacles to those brave large reconstructions those profitable abnegations and brotherly feats of generosity that will yet turn human lifeof which our individual lives are but the momentary partsinto a glad beautiful and triumphant cooperation all round this sunlit world  if but humanity could have its imagination touched  i was already beginning to see the great problem of mankind as indeed nothing other than a magnification of the little problem of myself as a problem in escape from grooves from preoccupations and suspicions precautions and ancient angers a problem of escape from these spiritual beasts that prowl and claw to a new generosity and a new breadth of view  for all of us little son as for each of us salvation is that we have to get away from ourselves to a greater thing to a giants desire and an unending life ours and yet not our own   § 6  it is a queer experience to be even for a moment in the grip of a great beast i had been put into the fork of a tree so that i could shoot with the big stem behind my back the fork wasnt i suppose more than a score of feet from the ground it was a safe enough place from a tiger and that is what we expected we had been misled by our tracker who had mistaken the pugs of a big leopard for a tigersthey were over rocky ground for the most part and he had only the spoor of a chance patch of halfdried mud to go upon the beast had killed a goat and was beaten out of a thicket near by me in which he had been lying up the probability had seemed that he would go away along a tempting ravine to where captain crosby who was my host awaited him i as the amateur was intended to be little more than a spectator but he broke back towards the wing of the line of beaters and came across the sunlit rocks within thirty yards of my post  seen going along in that way flattened almost to the ground he wasnt a particularly impressive beast and i shot at his shoulder as one might blaze away at a rabbitperhaps just a little more carefully feeling as a lord of creation should who dispenses a merited death i expected him either to roll over or bolt  then instantly he was coming in huge bounds towards me  he came so rapidly that he was covered by the big limb of the tree on which i was standing until he was quite beneath me and my second shot which i thought in the instant must have missed him was taken rapidly as he crouched to spring up the trunk  then you know came a sort of astonishment and i thinkbecause afterwards crosby picked up a dropped cartridge at the foot of the treethat i tried to reload i believe i was completely incredulous that the beast was going to have me until he actually got me the thing was too completely out of my imaginative picture i dont believe i thought at all while he was coming up the tree i merely noted how astonishingly he resembled an angry cat then hed got my leg he was hanging on to it first by two claws and then by one claw and the whole weight of him was pulling me down it didnt seem to be my leg i wasnt frightened i felt absolutely nothing i was amazed i slipped tried to get a hold on the tree trunk felt myself being hauled down and then got my arm about the branch i still clung to my unloaded gun as an impoverished aristocrat might cling to his patent of nobility that was i felt my answer for him yet  i suppose the situation lasted a fraction of a second though it seemed to me to last an interminable time then i could feel my leggings rip and his claw go scoring deeply down my calf that hurt in a kind of painless impersonal interesting way was my leg coming off boot the weight had gone that enormous weight  hed missed his hold altogether i heard his claws tear down the bark of the tree and then his heavy soft fall upon the ground  i achieved a catlike celerity in another second i was back in my fork reloading my legs tucked up as tightly as possible  i peered down through the branches ready for him he wasnt there not up the tree again then i saw him making off with a halting gait across the scorching rocks some thirty yards away but i could not get my gun into a comfortable position before he was out of sight behind a ridge i wondered why the sunlight seemed to be flickering like an electric light that fails was somehow aware of blood streaming from my leg down the treestem it seemed a torrent of blood and there was a long loose ribbon of flesh very sickening to see and then i fainted and fell out of the tree bruising my arm and cheek badly and dislocating my shoulder in the fall some of the beaters saw me fall and brought crosby in sufficient time to improvise a torniquet and save my life     chapter the ninth  the spirit of the new world   § 1  i met rachel again in germany through the devices of my cousin the fürstin letzlingen i had finished seeing what i wanted to see in westphalia and i was preparing to go to the united states there i thought i should be able to complete and round off that large view of the human process i had been developing in my mind but my departure was delayed by an attack of influenza that i picked up at a socialist congress in munich and the dear durchlaucht hearing of this and having her own views of my destiny descended upon me while i was still in bed there made me get up and carried me off in her car to take care of me herself at her villa at boppard telling me nothing of any fellowguests i might encounter  she had a villa upon the rhine under a hill of vineyards where she devoted herselfshe was a widowto matchmaking and belated regrets for the childlessness that necessitated a perpetual borrowing of material for her pursuit she had a motorcar a steamlaunch several rowing boats and canoes a tennislawn a rambling garden a devious house and a rapid mind and in fact everything that was necessary for throwing young people together she made her surprise seem easy and natural and with returning health i found myself already back upon my old footing of friendly intimacy with rachel  i found her a new and yet a familiar rachel she had grown up she was no longer a schoolgirl crystalline clear with gleams of emotion and understanding and what she had lost in transparency she had gained in depth and she had become wellinformed she had been reading very widely and well i could see and not simply reading but talking and listening and thinking she showed a vivid interest in the current of home politicsat that time the last government of mr balfour was ebbing to its end and my old transvaal friends the chinese coolies were to avenge themselves on their importers the tariff reformers my father detested were still struggling to unseat the premier from his leadership of conservatism  it was queer to hear once more after my asiatic wanderings and dreamings those westend dinnertable politics those speculations about winstons future and the possibility of lloyd george or ramsay macdonald or macnamara taking office with the liberals and whether there might not ultimately be a middle party in which haldane and balfour grey and the cecils could meet upon common ground it seemed now not only very small but very far off she told me too of the huge popularity of king edward he had proved to be interested curious understanding and clever an unexpectedly successful king she described how he was breaking out of the narrow official limits that had kept his mother in a kind of social bandbox extending his solvent informality of friendliness to all sorts of men he had won the heart of will crooks the labor member for poplar for example made john burns a social success and warmed all france for england  i surveyed this novel picture of the english throne diffusing amiability  i suppose its what the throne ought to do said rachel if it cant be inspiration at any rate it can tolerate and reconcile and take the illbred bitterness out of politics  my father might have said that  i got that from your father she said and added after a momentary pause i go over and talk to him  you talk to my father  i like to or rather i listen and take it in i go over in the afternoon i go sometimes twice or three times a week  thats kind of you  not at all you see it sounds impudent i know for a girl to say so but weve so many interests in common   § 2  i was more and more interested by rachel as the days went on a man must be stupid who does not know that a woman is happy in his presence and for two years now and more i had met no one with a very strong personal feeling for me and quite apart from that her mind was extraordinarily interesting to me because it was at once so active and so clear and so limited by her entirely english circumstances she had the prosperous english outlook she didnt so much see the wide world as get glimpses of it through the tangle of westminster and of west end and weekend limitations she wasnt even aware of that greater unprosperous england already sulking and darkling outside her political world that greater england which was presently to make its first audible intimations of discontent in that remarkable anticlimax to king georges coronation the railway strike india for her was the land of peoples cousins germany and the german dreadnoughts bulked far larger and all the tremendous gathering forces of the east were beyond the range of her imagination i set myself to widen her horizons  i told her something of the intention and range of my travels and something of the views that were growing out of their experiences  i have a clear little picture in my mind of an excursion we made to that huge national denkmal which rears its head out of the amiable vineyards of assmannshausen and rudesheim over against bingen we landed at the former place went up its little funicular to eat our lunch and drink its red wine at the pleasant inn above and then strolled along through the woods to the monument  the fürstin fell behind with her unwilling escort a newly arrived medical student from england a very pleasant youngster named berwick who was all too obviously anxious to change places with me she devised delays and meanwhile i as yet unaware of the state of affairs went on with rachel to that towering florid monument with its vast gesticulating germania which triumphs over the conquered provinces  we fell talking of war and the passions and delusions that lead to war rachels thoughts were strongly colored by those ideas of a natural rivalry between germany and england and of a necessary revenge for france which have for nearly forty years diverted the bulk of european thought and energy to the mere waste of military preparations i jarred with an edifice of preconceptions when i scoffed and scolded at these assumptions  our two great peoples are disputing for the leadership of the world i said and meanwhile the whole world sweeps past us were drifting into a quarrelsome backwater  i began to tell of the fermentation and new beginnings that were everywhere perceptible throughout the east of the vast masses of human ability and energy that were coming into action in china and india of the unlimited future of both north and south america of the mere accidentalness of the european advantage history i said is already shifting the significance out of western europe altogether and we english cannot see it we can see no further than berlin and these germans can think of nothing better than to taunt the french with such tawdry effigies as this europe goes on today as india went on in the eighteenth century making aimless history and the sands of opportunity run and run  i shrugged my shoulders and we stood for a little while looking down on the shining crescent of the rhine  suppose said rachel that someone were to say thatin the house  the house i said doesnt hear things at my pitch bat outcries too shrill altogether  it might if you  she halted hesitated for a moment on the question and asked abruptly  when are you coming back to england mr stratton  certainly not for six months i said  a movement of her eyes made me aware of the fürstin and berwick emerging from the trees and then asked rachel  i didnt want to answer that question in which the personal note sounded so clearly i am going to america to see america i said and america may be rather a big thing to see  you must see it  i want to be sure of itas something comprehensive i want to get a general effect of it  rachel hesitated looked back to measure the distance of the fürstin and her companion and put her question again but this time with a significance that did not seem even to want to hide itself then will you come back she said  her face flamed scarlet but her eyes met mine boldly between us there was a flash of complete understanding  my answer if it was lame and ungallant to such a challenge was at least perfectly honest i cant make up my mind i said ive been near making planstaking steps something holds me back  i had no time for an explanation  i cant make up my mind i repeated  she stood for a moment rather stiffly staring away towards the blue hills of alsace  then she turned with a smiling and undisturbed countenance to the fürstin her crimson had given place to white the triumph of it she said with a slight gesture to the flamboyant teutonism that towered over us and boldly repeating words i had used scarcely five minutes before makes me angry they conqueredungraciously  she had overlooked something in her effort to seem entirely selfpossessed she collapsed my dear she criedi forgot  oh im only a german by marriage cried the fürstin and i can assure you i quite understandabout the triumph of it she surveyed the achievement of her countrymen it isungracious but indeed its only a sort of artlessness if you see the thing properly its not vulgarityits childishness theyve hardly got over it yettheir intense astonishment at being any good at war that large throaty victory shes not so militant as she seems shes too plump of course what a german really appreciates is nutrition but i quite agree with you both im beginning to want my tea mr stratton rachel  her eyes had been on rachel as she chattered the girl had turned to the distant hills again and had forgotten even to pretend to listen to the answer she had evoked now she came back sharply to the sound of her name  tea said the fürstin  oh cried rachel yes yes certainly rather tea   § 3  it was clear to me that after that i must as people say have things out with rachel but before i could do anything of the sort the fürstin pounced upon me she made me sit up that night after her other guests had gone to their rooms in the cosy little turret apartment she called her study and devoted to the reading of whatever was most notorious in contemporary british fiction sit down said she by the fire in that chair there and tell me all about it its no good your pretending you dont know what i mean what are you up to with her and why dont you go straight to your manifest destiny as a decent man should  because manifestly it isnt my destiny i said  stuff said the fürstin  you know perfectly well why i am out of england  everybody knowsexcept of course quite young persons who are being carefully brought up  does she know  she doesnt seem to  well thats what i want to know  need she know  well it does seem rather essential  i suppose if you think so  will you tell her  tell her yourself if she must be told down there in surrey she must have seen things and heard things but i dont see that she wants a lot of ancient history  if it is ancient history  oh two years and a halfits an era  i made no answer to that but sat staring into the fire while my cousin watched my face at length i made my confession i dont think it is ancient history at all i said i think if i met mary again now  you mean lady mary justin  of course  it would be good for your mind if you remembered to call her by her proper name you think if you met her again you two would begin to carry on but you seeyou arent going to meet her everybody will see that doesnt happen  i mean that i well  youd better not say it besides its nonsense i doubt if youve given her a thought for weeks and weeks  until i came here perhaps that was almost nearly true but youve stirred me up sweet cousin and old things old memories and habits have come to the surface again mary wrote herself over my lifein all sorts of places i cant tell you ive never talked of her to anyone im not able very well to talk about my feelings perhaps a man of my sortdoesnt love twice over  i disregarded a note of dissent from my cousin that was all so magic all my youth all my hope all the splendid adventure of it why should one pretend im giving none of that to rachel it isnt there any more to give  one would think remarked the fürstin there was no gift of healing  she waited for me to speak and then irritated by my silence struck at me sharply with that wicked little tongue of hers  do you think that lady mary justin thinks of youas you think of her do you think she hasnt settled down  i looked up at her quickly  shes just going to have a second child the fürstin flung out  yes that did astonish me i suppose my face showed it  that girl said the fürstin that clean girl would have sooner diedten thousand deaths and shes nevernever been anything to you  i think that for an instant she had been frightened at her own words she was now quite angry and short of breath she had contrived a rapid indignation against mary and myself  i didnt know mary had had any child at all i said  this makes two said the fürstin and held up a brace of fingers with scarcely a year and a half between them not much more anyhow it was natural i suppose a natural female indecency i dont blame her when a woman gives in she ought to do it thoroughly but i dont see that it leaves you much scope for philandering stephen does it and there you are and here is rachel and why dont you make a clean job of your life  i didnt understand  i wonder what you imagined  i reflected i wonder what i did i suppose i thought of maryjust as i had left heralways  i remained with my mind filled with confused images of mary memories astonishment  i perceived the fürstin was talking  maundering about she was saying like a huntsman without a horse youve got work to doblood in your veins im not one of your ignorant women stephen you ought to have a wife  rachels too good i said at the end of a pause and perceiving i had to say something to be that sort of wife  no womans too good for a man said the fürstin von letzlingen with conviction its what god made her for   § 4  my visit to boppard was drawing to an end before i had a clear opportunity to have things out with rachel it was in a little garden under the very shadow of that gracious cathedral at worms the sort of little garden to which one is admitted by ringing a bell and tipping a custodian i think worms is in many respects one of the most beautiful cathedrals i have ever seen so perfectly proportioned so delicately faded so aloof so free from pride or presumption and it rises over this green and flowery peace a towering lithe light brown sunlit easy thing as unconsciously and irrelevantly splendid as a tall ship in the evening glow under a press of canvas we looked up at it for a time and then went on with the talk to which we had been coming slowly since the fürstin had packed us off for it while she went into the town with berwick to buy toys for her gatekeepers children i had talked about myself and the gradual replacement of my ambition to play a part in imperial politics by wider intentions you know i asked abruptly why i left england  she thought through the briefest of pauses no she decided at last  i made love i said to lady mary justin and we were found out we couldnt go away together  why not she interjected  it was impossible  for some moments neither of us spoke something she said and then some vague report and left these fragments to be her reply  we were old playmates we were children together we havesomethingthat draws us to each other sheshe made a mistake in marrying we were both very young and the situation was difficult and then afterwards we were thrown together but you see that has made a great difference to my life its turned me off the rails on which men of my sort usually run ive had to look to these other things theyve become more to me than to most people if only because of that  you mean these ideas of yourslearning as much as you can about the world and then doing what you can to help other people to a better understanding  yes i said  and thatwill fill your life  it ought to  i suppose it ought i supposeyou findit does  dont you think it ought to fill my life  i wondered if it did  but why shouldnt it  its soso cold  my questioning silence made her attempt to explain  one wants life more beautiful than that she said one wants there are things one needs things nearer one  we became aware of a jangling at the janitors bell our opportunity for talk was slipping away and we were both still undecided both blunderingly nervous and insecure we were hurried into clumsy phrases that afterwards we would have given much to recall  but how could life be more beautiful i said than when it serves big human ends  her brows were knit she seemed to be listening for the sound of the unlocking gate  but she said and plunged one wants to be loved surely one needs that  you see for methats gone  why should it be gone  it is one doesnt begin again i meanmyself youcan youve never begun not when youve lovedloved really i forced that on her i over emphasized it was real love you know the real thing i dont mean the mere imaginative love blindfold love but love that sees i want you to understand that i lovedaltogether  across the lawn under its trim floweringtrees appeared berwick loaded with little parcels and manifestly eager to separate us and the fürstin as manifestly putting on the drag  theres a sort of love i hurried that doesnt renew itself ever dont let yourself believe it does something else may come in its place but that is different its youtha wonderful newness look at that youngster he can love you like that ive watched him he does you know he does  yes she said as hurriedly but then you see i dont love him  you dont  i cant  but hes such a fresh clean human being  thats not all said rachel thats not all you dont understand  the two drew near it is so hard to explain she said things that one hardly sees for oneself sometimes it seems one cannot help oneself you cant choose you are taken she seemed about to say something more and stopped and bit her lip  in another moment i was standing up and the fürstin was calling to us across ten feet of space such amoosin little toyshops weve got a heap of things just look at him  he smiled over his load with anxious eyes upon our faces  ten separate parcels he said appealing for rachels sympathy im doing my best not to complain  and rather adroitly he contrived to let two of them slip and captured rachel to assist him  he didnt relinquish her again   § 5  the fürstin and i followed them along the broad pleasant treelined street towards the railway station  a boy of that age ought not to marry a girl of that age said the fürstin breaking a silence  i didnt answer  well she said domineering  my dear cousin i said i know all that you have in your mind i admiti covet her you cant make me more jealous than i am shes clean and sweetit is marvellous how the god of the rest of the world can have made a thing so brave and honest and wonderful shes better than flowers but i think im going away tonight nevertheless  you dont mean youre going to carry chivalry to the point of giving that boy a chancefor he hasnt one while youre about  no you seei want to give rachel a chance you know as well as i dothe things in my mind  that youve got to forget  that i dont forget  that youre bound in honor to forget and who could help you better  im going i said and then wrathfully if you think i want to use rachel as a sort of dressingfor my old sores  i left the sentence unfinished  oh nonsense cried the fürstin and wouldnt speak to me again until we got to that entirely teutonic art station that is not the least among the sights of worms  sores indeed said the fürstin presently as we walked up the end of the platform  theres nothing said the fürstin with an unusual note of petulance shed like better  i cant think what men are coming to she went on youre in love with her or you wouldnt be so generous and shes head over heels with you and here you are ill give you one more chance  i wont take it i interrupted it isnt fair i tell you i wont take it ill go two days earlier to prevent you unless you promise me of course i see how things are with her shes not a sphinx but it isnt fair it isnt not to her or to himor myself hes got some claims hes got more right to her than i  a boy like that no man has any rights about womenuntil hes thirty and as for me and all the pains ive taken oh i hate worms dust and ashes well here thank heaven comes the train if nothing else could stir you stephen at least i could have imagined some decent impulse of gratitude to me stephen youre disgusting youve absolutely spoilt this trip for meabsolutely when only a little reasonableness on your part oh  she left her sentence unfinished  berwick and i had to make any conversation that was needed on the way back to boppard rachel did not talk and the fürstin did not want to   § 6  directly i had parted from rachels questioning eyes i wanted to go back to them it seems to me now that all the way across to america in that magnificent german liner i joined at hamburg i was thinking in confused alternations of her and of mary there are turns of thought that still bring back inseparably with them the faint echo of the airs of the excellent but industrious band that glorified our crossing  i had been extraordinarily shocked and concerned at the thought of mary bearing children it is a grotesque thing to confess but i had never let myself imagine the possibility of such a thing for her who had been so immensely mine  we are the oddest creatures little son beasts and barbarians and brains neither one nor the other but all confusedly and here was i who had given up mary and resigned her and freed myself from her as i thought altogether cast back again into my old pit by the most obvious and necessary consequence of her surrender and mine and its just there and in that relation that we men and women are so elaborately insecure we try to love as equals and behave as equals and concede a level freedom and then comes a crisisour laboriously contrived edifice of liberty collapses and we perceive that so far as sex goes the woman remains to the man no more than a possessioncapable of loyalty or treachery  there still at that barbaric stage the situation stands you see i had always wanted to own mary and always she had disputed that that is our whole story the story of an instinctive subjugation struggling against a passionate desire for fellowship she had denied herself to me taken herself away that much i could endure but now came this blazing fact that showed her as it seemed in the most material and conclusive wayovercome i had storms of retrospective passion at the thoroughness of her surrender yes and thats in everyone of usin everyone i wonder if in all decent lawabiding london there lives a single healthy adult man who has not at times longed to trample and kill  for once i think the fürstin miscalculated consequences i think i should have engaged myself to rachel before i went to america if it had not been for the fürstins revelation but this so tore me that i could no longer go on falling in love again naturally and sweetly no man falls in love if he has just been flayed i could no longer think of rachel except as a foil to mary i was moved to marry her by a new set of motives to fling her so to speak in marys face and from the fierce vulgarity of that at least i recoiledand let her go as i have told you   § 7  i had thought all that was over  i remember my struggles to recover my peace  i remember how very late one night i went up to the promenade deck to smoke a cigar before turning in it was a warm moonlight night the broad low waves of ebony water that went seething past below foamed luminous and were streaked and starred with phosphorescence the recumbent moon past its full and sinking westward seemed bigger than i had ever seen it before and the roundness of the watery globe was manifest about the edge of the sky one had that sense so rare on land so common in the night at sea of the world as a conceivable sphere and of interstellar space as of something clear and close at hand  there came back to me again that feeling i had lost for a time in germany of being not myself but man consciously on his little planet communing with god  but my spirit was saying all the time i am still in my pit in my pit after all i am still in my pit  and then there broke the answer on my mind that all our lives we must struggle out of our pits that to struggle out of our pit is this life there is no individual life but that and that there comes no escape here no end to that effort until the release of death continually or frequently we may taste salvation but never may we achieve it while we are things of substance each moment in our lives we come to the test and are lost again or saved again to be assured of ones security is to forget and fall away  and standing at the rail with these thoughts in my mind suddenly i prayed  i remember how the enginethrobs beat through me like the beating of a heart and that far below among the dim lights that came up from the emigrants in the steerage there was a tinkling music as i prayed and a mans voice singing a plaintive air in some strange slavonic tongue  that voice of the invisible singer and the spirit of the unknown songmaker and the serenity of the sky they were all i perceived no more and no less than things in myself that i did not understand they were out beyond the range of understanding and yet they fell into the completest harmony that night with all that i seemed to understand   § 8  the onset of new york was extraordinarily stimulating to me i write onset it is indeed that new york rides up out of the waters a cliff of mans making its great buildings at a distance seem like long chinese banners held up against the sky from sandy hook to the great landing stages and the swirling hooting traffic of the hudson river there fails nothing in that magnificent crescendo of approach  and new york keeps the promise of its first appearance there is no such fulness of life elsewhere in all the world the common man in the streets is a bigger common man than any old world city can show physically bigger there is hope in his eyes and a braced defiance new york may be harsh and blusterous and violent but there is a breeze from the sea and a breeze of fraternity in the streets and the americans of all peoples in the world are a nation of still unbroken men  i went to america curious balancing between hope and scepticism the european world is full of the criticism of america and for the matter of that america too is full of it hostility and depreciation prevailovermuch for in spite of rawness and vehemence and a scum of blatant oh quite asinine folly the united states of america remains the greatest country in the world and the living hope of mankind it is the supreme break with the old tradition it is the freshest and most valiant beginning that has ever been made in human life  here was the antithesis of india here were no peasants whatever no traditional culture no castes no established differences except for the one schism of color this amazing place had never had a famine never a plague here were no temples and no priesthoods dominating the lives of the peopleold trinity church embedded amidst towering skyscrapers was a symbol for as much as they had of all that and here too there was no crown no affectations of an ancient loyalty no visible army no traditions of hostility for the old defiance of britain is a thing now ridiculous and dead and everyone i met had an air as if he knew that tomorrow must be different from today and different and novel and remarkable by virtue of himself and such as himself  i went about new york with the incredulous satisfaction of a man who has long doubted to find that after all america was coming true the very clatter pleased me the crowds the camplike slovenliness a disorder so entirely different from the established and accepted untidiness of china or india here was something the old world had never shown me a new enterprise a fresh vigor in the old world there is change a mighty wave now of change but it drives men before it as if it were a power outside them and not in them they do not know they do not believe but here the change is in the very blood and spirit of mankind they breathe it in even before the launch has brought their feet to ellis island soil in six months they are americanized does it matter that a thing so gigantic should be a little coarse and blundering in detail if this stumbling giant of the new time breaks a gracious relic or so in his eager clutch and treads a little on the flowers   § 9  and in this setting of energy and activity towering city life and bracing sea breezes i met gidding again whom i had last seen departing into egypt to look more particularly at the prehistoric remains and the temples of the first and second dynasty at abydos it was at a dinnerparty one of those large gatherings that welcome interesting visitors it wasnt of course i who was the centre of interest but a distinguished french portrait painter i was there as just any guest i hadnt even perceived gidding until he came round to me in that precious gap of masculine intercourse that ensues upon the departure of the ladies that gap is one of the rare opportunities for conversation men get in america  i dont know whether you will remember me he said but perhaps you remember cretein the sunrise  and no end of talk afterwards i said grasping his hand no endfor we didnt half finish did you have a good time in egypt  im not going to talk to you about egypt said gidding im through with ruins im going to ask youyou know what im going to ask you  what i think of america its the same inevitable question i think everything of it its the steppingoff place ive come here at last because it matters most  thats what we all want to believe said gidding thats what we want you to tell us  he reflected its immense isnt it perfectly immense but i am afraid at times were too disposed to forget just what its all about weve got to be reminded that you know is why we keep on asking  he went on to question me where i had been what i had done what i made of things hed never he said forgotten our two days gossip in the levant and all the wide questions about the world and ourselves that we had broached then and left so open i soon found myself talking very freely to him i am not a ready or abundant talker but gidding has the knack of precipitating my ideas he is america to my europe and at his touch all that has been hanging in concentrated solution in my mind comes crystallizing out he has to a peculiar degree that directness and simplicity which is the distinctive american quality i tried to explain to his solemnly nodding head and entirely intelligent eyes just exactly what i was making of things of the world of humanity of myself  it was an odd theme for two men to attempt after dinner servants hovering about them their two faces a little flushed by wine and good eating their keen interest masked from the others around them by a gossiping affectation their hands going out as they talked for matches or cigarette and before we had gone further than to fling out a few intimations to each other our colloquy was interrupted by our host standing up and by the general stir that preluded our return to feminine society weve got more to say than this said gidding weve got to talk he brought out a little engagement book that at once drew out mine in response and a couple of days after we spent a morning and afternoon together and got down to some very intimate conversation we motored out to lunch at a place called nyack above the palisades we crossed on a ferry to reach it and we visited the house of washington irving near yonkers on our way  ive still a vivid picture in my mind of the little lawn at irvington that looks out upon the rushing steel of hudson river where gidding opened his heart to me i can see him now as he leant a little forward over the table with his wrists resting upon it his long cleanshaven face very solemn and earnest and grey against the hard american sunlight in the greenery about us while he told me in that deliberate american voice of his and with the deliberate american solemnity of his desire to do some decent thing with life  he was very anxious to set himself completely before me i remember on that occasion there was a peculiar mental kinship between us that even the profound differences of our english and american trainings could not mask and now he told me almost everything material about his life for the first time i learnt how enormously rich he was not only by reason of his fathers acquisitions but also because of his own almost instinctive aptitude for business ive got he said to begin with what almost all men spend their whole lives in trying to get and it amounts to nothing it leaves me with life like a blank sheet of paper and nothing in particular to write on it  you know he said itsexasperating im already halfway to threescore and ten and im still wandering about wondering what to do with this piece of life god has given me  he had lived as people say he had been in scrapes and scandals tasted to the full the bitter intensities of the personal life he had come by a different route to the same conclusions as myself was as anxious as i to escape from memories and associations and feuds and that excessive vividness of individual feeling which blinds us to the common humanity the common interest the gentler larger reality which lies behind each tawdrily emphatic self  its a sort of inverted homoeopathy i want he said the big thing to cure the little thing  but i will say no more of that side of our friendship because the ideas of it are spread all through this book from the first page to the last what concerns me now is not our sympathy and agreement but that other aspect of our relations in which gidding becomes impulse and urgency seeing we have these ideas said heand mind you there must be others who have them or are getting to them for nobody thinks all alone in this worldseeing we have these ideas what are we going to do   § 10  that meeting was followed by another before i left new york and presently gidding joined me at denver where i was trying to measure the true significance of a labor paper called the appeal to reason that in spite of a rigid boycott by the ordinary agencies for news distribution went out in the middle west to nearly half a million subscribers and was filled with such a fierceness of insurrection against labor conditions such a hatred blind and impassioned as i had never known before gidding remained with me there and came back with me to chicago where i wanted to see something of the americanization of the immigrant and my survey of america the social and economic problem of america resolved itself more and more into a conference with him  there is no more fruitless thing in the world than to speculate how life would have gone if this thing or that had not happened yet i cannot help but wonder how far i might have travelled along the lines of my present work if i had gone to america and not met gidding or if i had met him without visiting america the man and his country are inextricably interwoven in my mind yet i do think that his simplicity and directness his force of initiative that turned me from a mere enquirer into an active writer and organizer are qualities less his in particular than americas in general there is in america a splendid crudity a directness that cleared my spirit as a bracing wind will sweep the clouds from mountain scenery compared with our older continents america is mankind stripped for achievement so many things are not there at all need not be considered no institutional aristocracy no kaisers czars nor kingemperors to maintain a litigious sequel to the empire of rome it has no uneducated immovable peasantry rooted to the soil indeed it has no rooting to the soil at all it is from the fortyninth parallel to the tip of cape horn one triumphant embodiment of freedom and deliberate agreement for i mean all america spanishspeaking as well as englishspeaking they have this detachment from tradition in common see how the united states for example stands flatly on that bare piece of eighteenthcentury intellectualism the constitution and is by virtue of that a structure either wilful and intellectual or absurd that sense of incurable servitude to fate and past traditions that encumbrance with ruins pledges laws and ancient institutions that perpetual complication of considerations and those haunting memories of preceding human failures which dwarf the courage of destiny in europe and asia vanish from the mind within a week of ones arrival in the new world naturally one begins to do things one is inspired to do things one feels that one has escaped one feels that the time is now all america north and south alike is one tremendous escape from ancient obsessions into activity and making  and by the time i had reached america i had already come to see that just as the issues of party politics at home and international politics abroad are mere superficialities above the greater struggle of an energetic minority to organize and exploit the labor of the masses of mankind so that struggle also is only a huge incident in the still more than half unconscious impulse to replace the ancient way of human living by a more highly organized worldwide social order by a world civilization embodying itself in a world state and i saw now how that impulse could neither cease nor could it on the other hand realize itself until it became conscious and deliberate and merciful free from haste and tyranny persuasive and sustained by a nearly universal sympathy and understanding for until that arrives the creative forces must inevitably spend themselves very largely in blind alleys futile rushes and destructive conflicts upon that our two minds were agreed  we have said gidding to understand and make understanding that is the real work for us to do stratton that is our job the world as you say has been floundering about half making civilization and never achieving it now we i dont mean just you and me stratton particularly but every intelligent man among us have got to set to and make it thorough there is no other sane policy for a man outside his private passions but that so lets get at it  i find it now impossible to trace the phases by which i reached these broad ideas upon which i rest all my work but certainly they were present very early in my discussions with gidding we two men had been thinking independently but very similarly and it is hard to say just what completing touches either of us gave to the others propositions we found ourselves rather than arrived at the conception of ourselves as the citizens neither of the united states nor of england but of a state that had still to come into being a world state a great unity behind and embracing the ostensible political fabrics of todaya unity to be reached by weakening antagonisms by developing understandings and toleration by fostering the sense of brotherhood across the ancient bounds  we believed and we believe that such a creative conception of a human commonweal can be fostered in exactly the same way that the idea of german unity was fostered behind the dukedoms the free cities and kingdoms of germany a conception so creative that it can dissolve traditional hatreds incorporate narrower loyalties and replace a thousand suspicions and hostilities by a common passion for collective achievement so creative that at last the national boundaries of today may become obstacles as trivial to the amplifying goodwill of men as the imaginary line that severs normandy from brittany or berwick from northumberland  and it is not only a great peace about the earth that this idea of a world state means for us but social justice also we are both convinced altogether that there survives no reason for lives of toil for hardship poverty famine infectious disease for the continuing cruelties of wild beasts and the greater multitude of crimes but mismanagement and waste and that mismanagement and waste spring from no other source than ignorance and from stupid divisions and jealousies base patriotisms fanaticisms prejudices and suspicions that are all no more than ignorance a little mingled with viciousness we have looked closely into this servitude of modern labor we have seen its injustice fester towards syndicalism and revolutionary socialism and we know these things for the mere aimless ignorant resentments they are punishments not remedies we have looked into the portentous threat of modern war and it is ignorant vanity and ignorant suspicion the bargaining aggression of the british prosperous and the swaggering vulgarity of the german junker that make and sustain that monstrous european devotion to arms and we are convinced there is nothing in these evils and conflicts that light may not dispel we believe that these things can be dispelled that the great universals science which has limitations neither of race nor class art which speaks to its own in every rank and nation philosophy and literature which broaden sympathy and banish prejudice can flood and submerge and will yet flow over and submerge every one of these separations between man and man  i will not say that this great state this world republic of civilized men is our dream because it is not a dream it is a manifestly reasonable possibility it is our intention it is what we are deliberately making and what in a little while very many men and women will be making we are secessionists from all contemporary nationalities and loyalties we have set ourselves with all the capacity and energy at our disposal to create a worldwide common fund of ideas and knowledge and to evoke a worldwide sense of human solidarity in which the existing limitations of political structure must inevitably melt away  it was gidding and his americanism his inborn predisposition to innovation and the large freedom of his wealth that turned these ideas into immediate concrete undertakings i see more and more that it is here that we of the old european stocks who still grow upon the old wood differ most from those vigorous grafts of our race in america and africa and australia on the one hand and from the renascent peoples of the east on the other that we have lost the courage of youth and have not yet gained the courage of desperate humiliations in taking hold of things to gidding it was neither preposterous nor insufferably magnificent that we should set about a propaganda of all science all knowledge all philosophical and political ideas round about the habitable globe his mind began producing concrete projects as a firework being lit produces sparks and soon he was figuring out the most colossal of printing and publishing projects as a man might work out the particulars for an alteration to his bathroom it was so entirely natural to him it was so entirely novel to me to go on from the proposition that understanding was the primary need of humanity to the systematic organization of free publishing exhaustive discussion intellectual stimulation he set about it as a company of pharmacists might organize the distribution of some beneficial cure  say stratton he said after a conversation that had seemed to me half fantasy lets do it  there are moments still when it seems to me that this life of mine has become the most preposterous of adventures we two absurd human beings are spending our days and nights in a sustained and growing attempt to do what to destroy certain obsessions and to give the universal human mind a form and a desire for expression we have put into the shape of one comprehensive project that force of released wealth that has already dotted america with universities libraries institutions for research and enquiry already there are others at work with us and presently there will be a great number we have started an avalanche above the old politics and it gathers mass and pace  and there never was an impulse towards endeavor in a human heart that wasnt preposterous man is a preposterous animal thereby he ceases to be a creature and becomes a creator he turns upon the powers that made him and subdues them to his service by his sheer impudence he establishes his claim to possess a soul  but i need not write at all fully of my work here this book is not about that but about my coming to that long before this manuscript reaches your handsif ultimately i decide that it shall reach your handsyou will be taking your share i hope in this open conspiracy against potentates and prejudices and all the separating powers of darkness   § 11  i would if i could omit one thing that i must tell you here because it goes so close to the very core of all this book has to convey i wish i could leave it out altogether i wish i could simplify my story by smoothing out this wrinkle at least and obliterating a thing that was at once very real and very ugly you see i had at last struggled up to a sustaining idea to a conception of work and duty to which i could surely give my life i had escaped from my pit so far and it was natural that now with something to give i should turn not merely for consolation and service but for help and fellowship to that dear human being across the seas who had offered them to me so straightly and sweetly all that is brave and good and as you would have me is it not only dear son that is not all the truth  there was still in my mind for long it remained in my mind a bitterness against mary i had left her i had lost her we had parted but from germany to america and all through america and home again to my marriage and with me after my marriage it rankled that she could still go on living a life independent of mine i had not yet lost my desire to possess her to pervade and dominate her existence my resentment that though she loved me she had first not married me and afterwards not consented to come away with me was smouldering under the closed hatches of my mind and so while the better part of me was laying hold of this work because it gave me the hope of a complete distraction and escape from my narrow and jealous self that lower being of the pit was also rejoicing in the great enterprises before me and in the marriage upon which i had now determined because it was a last trampling upon my devotion to mary because it defied and denied some lurking claims to empire i could suspect in her i want to tell you that particularly because so i am made so you are made so most of us are made there is scarcely a high purpose in all the world that has no dwarfish footman at its stirrup no base intention over which there does not ride at least the phantom of an angel  constantly in those days it seems to me now i was haunted by my own imagination of mary amiably reconciled to justin bearing him children forgetful of or repudiating all the sweetness all the wonder and beauty we had shared it was an unjust and ungenerous conception i knew it for a caricature even as i entertained it and yet it tormented me it stung me like a spur it kept me at work and if i strayed into indolence brought me back to work with a mind galled and bleeding   § 12  and i suppose it is mixed up with all this that i could not make love easily and naturally to rachel i could not write loveletters to her there is a burlesque quality in these scruples i know seeing that i was now resolved to marry her but that is the quality that is the mixed texture of life we overcome the greater things and are consciencestricken by the details  i wouldnt even at the price of losing herand i was now passionately anxious not to lose heruse a single phrase of endearment that did not come out of me almost in spite of myself at any rate i would not cheat her and my offer of marriage when at last i sent it to her from chicago was as i remember it almost businesslike i atoned soon enough for that arid letter in ten thousand sweet words that came of themselves to my lips and she paid me at any rate in my own coin when she sent me her answer by cable the one word yes  and indeed i was already in love with her long before i wrote it was only a dread of giving her a single undeserved cheapness that had held me back so long it was that and the perplexity that mary still gripped my feelings my old love for her was there in my heart in spite of my new passion for rachel it was blackened perhaps and ruined and changed but it was there it was as if a new crater burnt now in the ampler circumference of an old volcano which showed all the more desolate and sorrowful and obsolete for the warm light of the new flames  how impatiently i came home thoughts of england i had not dared to think for three long years might now do what they would in me i dreamt of the surrey hills and the great woods of burnmore park of the changing skies and stirring soft winds of our grey green motherland there was fog in the irish sea and we lost the better part of a day hooting our way towards liverpool while i fretted about the ship with all my luggage packed staring at the grey waters that weltered under the mist it was the longest day in my life my heart was full of desire my eyes ached for the little fields and golden october skies of england england that was waiting to welcome me back from my exile with such open arms i was coming homehome  i hurried through london into surrey and in my fathers study warned by a telegram i found a brighteyed resolute young woman awaiting me with the quality about her of one who embarks upon a long premeditated adventure and i found too a family her sisters and her brother all gladly ready for me my father too was a happy man and on the eighth of november in 1906 rachel and i were married in the little church at shere we stayed for a week or so in hampshire near ringwood the season was late that year and the trees still very beautiful and then we went to portofino on the ligurian coast  there presently gidding joined us and we began to work out the schemes we had made in america the schemes that now fill my life     chapter the tenth  mary writes   § 1  it was in the early spring of 1909 that i had a letter from mary  by that time my life was set fully upon its present courses gidding and i had passed from the stage of talking and scheming to definite undertakings indeed by 1909 things were already organized upon their present lines we had developed a huge publishing establishment with one big printing plant in barcelona and another in manchester and we were studying the peculiar difficulties that might attend the establishment of a third plant in america our company was an english company under the name of alphabet and mollentrave and we were rapidly making it the broadest and steadiest flow of publication the world had ever seen its streams already reached further and carried more than any single firm had ever managed to do before we were reprinting in as carefully edited and revised editions as we could the whole of the english spanish and french literature and we were only waiting for the release of machinery to attack german russian and italian and were giving each language not only its own but a very complete series of good translations of the classical writers in every other tongue we had a little band of editors and translators permanently in our service at each important literary centre we had for example more than a score of men at work translating bengali fiction and verse into englisha lot of that new literature is wonderfully illuminating to an intelligent englishmanand we had a couple of men hunting about for new work in arabic we meant to give so good and cheap a book and to be so comprehensive in our choice of books excluding nothing if only it was real and living on account of any inferiority of quality obscurity of subject or narrowness of demand that in the long run anybody anywhere desiring to read anything would turn naturally and inevitably to our lists  ours was to be in the first place a world literature then afterwards upon its broad currents of distribution and in the same forms we meant to publish new work and new thought we were also planning an encyclopædia behind our enterprise of translations and reprints we were getting together and putting out a series of guidebooks gazetteers dictionaries textbooks and books of reference and we were organizing a revising staff for these a staff that should be constantly keeping them up to date it was our intention to make every copy we printed bear the date of its last revision in a conspicuous place and we hoped to get the whole line of these books ultimately upon an annual basis and to sell them upon repurchasing terms that would enable us to issue a new copy and take back and send the old one to the pulping mill at a narrow margin of profit then we meant to spread our arms wider and consolidate and offer our whole line of textbooks guidebooks and gazetteers bibliographies atlases dictionaries and directories as a new world encyclopædia that should also annually or at longest biennially renew its youth  so far we had gone in the creation of a huge international organ of information and of a kind of gigantic modern bible of world literature and in the process of its distribution we were rapidly acquiring an immense detailed knowledge of the book and publishing trade finding congestions here neglected opportunities there and devising and drawing up a hundred schemes for relief assistance amalgamation and rearrangement we had branches in china japan peru iceland and a thousand remote places that would have sounded as far off as the moon to an english or american bookseller in the seventies china in particular was a growing market we had a subsidiary company running a flourishing line of book shops in the eastend of london and others in new jersey chicago buenos ayres the south of france and ireland incidentally we had bought up some thousands of miles of labrador forest to ensure our paper supply and we could believe that before we died there would not be a corner of the world in which any book of interest or value whatever would not be easily attainable by any intelligent person who wanted to read it and already we were taking up the more difficult and ambitious phase of our selfappointed task and considering the problem of using these channels we were mastering and deepening and supplementing for the stimulation and wide diffusion of contemporary thought  there we went outside the province of alphabet and mollentrave and into an infinitely subtler system of interests we wanted to give sincere and clearthinking writers encouragement and opportunity to improve the critical tribunal and make it independent of advertising interests so that there would be a readier welcome for luminous thinking and writing and a quicker explosion of intellectual imposture we sought to provide guides and intelligencers to contemporary thought we had already set up or subsidized or otherwise aided a certain number of magazines and periodicals that seemed to us independentspirited outspoken and well handled but we had still to devise our present scheme of financing groups of men to create magazines and newspapers which became their own separate but inalienable property after so many years of success  but all this i hope you will already have become more or less familiar with when this story reaches your hands and i hope by the time it does so we shall be far beyond our present stage of experiment and that you will have come naturally to play your part in this most fascinating business of maintaining an onward intellectual movement in the world a movement not simply independent of but often running counter to all sorts of political and financial interests i tell you this much here for you to understand that already in 1909 and considering the business side of my activities alone i was a hard worker and very strenuously employed and in addition to all this huge network of enterprises i had developed with gidding i was still pretty actively a student i wasnti never shall beabsolutely satisfied with my general ideas i was enquiring keenly and closely into those problems of group and crowd psychology from which all this big publishing work has arisen and giving particular attention to the warpanics and outbreaks of international hostility that were then passing in deepening waves across europe i had already accumulated a mass of notes for the book upon group jealousy in religious persecution racial conflicts and war which i hope to publish the year after next and which therefore i hope you will have read long before this present book can possibly come to you and moreover rachel and i had established our home in londonin the house we now occupy during the winter and springand both you and your little sister had begun your careers as inhabitants of this earth your little sister had indeed but just begun  and then one morning at the breakfasttable i picked a square envelope out of a heap of letters and saw the halfforgotten and infinitely familiar handwriting of lady mary justin the sight of it gave me an odd mixture of sensations i was startled i was disturbed i was a little afraid i hadnt forgiven her yet it needed but this touch to tell me how little i had forgotten   § 2  i sat with it in my hand for a moment or so before i opened it hesitating as one hesitates before a door that may reveal a dramatic situation then i pushed my chair a little back from the table and ripped the envelope  it was a far longer letter than mary had ever written me in the old days and in a handwriting as fine as ever but now rather smaller i have it still and here i open its worn folds and except for a few trifling omissions copy it out for you a few trifling omissions i sayjust one there is that is not trifling but that i must needs make  you will never see any of these letters because i shall destroy them so soon as this copy is made it has been difficultor i should have destroyed them before but some things can be too hard for us  this first letter is on the martens notepaper its very heading was familiar to me the handwriting of the earlier sentences is a little stiff and disjointed and there are one or two scribbled obliterations it is like someone embarrassed in speaking and then it passes into her usual and characteristic ease  and as i read slowly my longcherished anger evaporated and the real mary outspoken and simple whom i had obscured by a cloud of fancied infidelities returned to me  my dear stephen she begins about six weeks ago i saw in the times that you have a little daughter it set me thinking picturing you with a mite of a baby in your armswhat little things they are stephenand your old face bent over it so that presently i went to my room and cried it set me thinking about you so that i have at last written you this letter i love to think of you with wife and children about you stepheni heard of your son for the first time about a year ago butdont mistake mesomething wrings me too  well i too have children have you ever thought of me as a mother i am i wonder how much you know about me now i have two children and the youngest is just two years old and somehow it seems to me that now that you and i have both given such earnests of our good behavior such evidence that that side of life anyhow is effectually settled for us there is no reason remaining why we shouldnt correspond you are my brother stephen and my friend and my twin and the core of my imagination fifty babies cannot alter that we can live but once and then die and promise or no promise i will not be dead any longer in your world when im not dead nor will i have you if i can help it a cold unanswering corpse in mine  too much of my life and being stephen has been buried and i am in rebellion this is a breach of the tomb if you like an irregular private premature resurrection from an interment in error out of my alleged grave i poke my head and say hello to you stephen old friend dear friend how are you getting on what is it like to you how do you feel i want to know about you im not doing this at all furtively and you can write back to me stephen as openly as your heart desires i have told justin i should do this i rise you see blowing my own trump let the other graves do as they please  your letters will be respected stephen if you choose to rise also and write me a letter  stephen ive been wanting to do this forfor all the time if there was thoughtreading you would have had a thousand letters but formerly i was content to submit and latterly ive chafed more i think that as what they call passion has faded the immense friendliness has become more evident and made the bar less and less justifiable you and i have had so much between us beyond what somebody the other dayit was in a report in the times i thinkwas calling materia matrimoniala and of course i hear about you from all sorts of people and in all sorts of wayswhatever you have done about me ive had a womans sense of honor about you and ive managed to learn a great deal without asking forbidden questions ive pricked up my ears at the faintest echo of your name  they say you have become a publisher with an american partner a sort of harmsworth and nelson and times book club and hooper and jackson all rolled into one that seems so extraordinary to me that for that alone i should have had to write to you i want to know the truth of that i never see any advertisement of stratton  co or get any inkling of what it is you publish are you the power behind the respectable murgatroyd and the honest milvain i know them both and neither has the slightest appearance of being animated by you and equally perplexing is your being mixed up with an american like that man gidding in peace conferences and social reform congresses and so forth its socarnegieish there im surer because ive seen your name in reports of meetings and ive read your last two papers in the fortnightly i cant imagine you of all people with your touch of reserve launching into movements and rubbing shoulders with faddists what does it mean stephen i had expected to find you coming back into english politicsspeaking and writing on the lines of your old beginning taking up that work you droppedits six years now ago ive been accumulating disappointment for two years mr arthur you see on our sidethis you will remember was in 1909still steers our devious party courses and the tariff reformers have still to capture us weston massinghay was comparing them the other night at a dinner at the clynes to a crowded piratical galley trying to get alongside a good seaman in rough weather he was very funny about leo maxse in the poop white and shrieking with passion and the motion and all the capitalists armed to the teeth and hiding snug in the hold until the grapplingirons were fixed why havent you come into the game id hoped it if only for the sake of meeting you again what are you doing out beyond there  we are in it so far as i can contrive but i contrive very little we are pillars of the conservative partyon that justins mind is firmly settledand every now and then i clamor urgently that we must do more for it but justins ideas go no further than writing chequesdoing more for the party means writing a bigger chequeand there are moments when i feel we shall simply bring down a peerage upon our heads and bury my ancient courtesy title under the ignominy of a new creation he would certainly accept it he writes his cheque and turns back at the earliest opportunity to his miniature gardens and the odd little freaks of collecting that attract him have you ever heard of chintz oil jars no you will say nor has anyone else yet except our immediate circle of friends and a few dealers who are no doubt industriously increasing the present scanty supply we possess three they are matronly shaped jars about two feet or a yard high of a kind of terracotta with wooden tops surmounted by gilt acorns and they have been covered with white paint and on this flowers and birds and figures from some very rich old chintz have been stuck very cunningly and then everything has been varnishedand there you are our first and best was bought for sevenandsixpence brought home in the car put upon a console table on the second landing and worshipped its really a very pleasant mellow thing to see nobody had ever seen the like guests sycophantic people of all sorts were taken to consider it it was looked at with heads at every angle one man even kept his head erect and one went a little upstairs and looked at it under his arm also the most powerful lenses have been used for a minute examination and one expert licked the varnish and looked extremely thoughtful and wise at me as he turned the booty over his gifted tongue and now god being with us we mean to possess every specimen in existencebefore the americans get hold of the idea yesterday justin got up and motored sixty miles to look at an alleged fourth  oh my dear i am writing chatter you perceive ive reached the chattering stage it is the fated end of the clever woman in a good social position nowadays her mind beats against her conditions for the last time and breaks up into this carping talk this spume of observation and comment this anecdotal natural history of the restraining husband as waves burst out their hearts in a foam upon a reef but it isnt chatter i want to write to you  stephen im intolerably wretched no creature has ever been gladder to have been born than i was for the first five and twenty years of my life i was full of hope and i was full i suppose of vanity and rash confidence i thought i was walking on solid earth with my head reaching up to the clouds and that sea and sky and all mankind were mine for the smiling and i am nothing and worse than nothing i am the ineffectual mother of two children a daughter whom i adorebut of her i may not tell youand a sona son who is too like his father for any fury of worship a stolid little creature that is all i have done in the world a mere blink of maternity and my blue persian who is scarcely two years old has already had nine kittens my husband and i have never forgiven each other the indefinable wrong of not pleasing each other that embitters more and more to take it out of each other is our rôle i have done my duty to the great new line of justin by giving it the heir it needed and now a polite and silent separation has fallen between us we hardly speak except in company i have not been so much married stephen i find as collected and since our tragic misadventurebut there were beautiful moments stephen unforgettable glimpses of beauty in thatthank god i say impenitently for thatthe door of the expensively splendid cabinet that contains me when it is not locked is very discreetlywatched i have no men friends no social force no freedom to take my line my husband is my official obstacle we barb the limitations of life for one another a little while ago he sought to chasten meto rouse me ratherthrough jealousy and made me aware indirectly but a little defiantly of a young person of artistic gifts in whose dramatic career he was pretending a conspicuous interest i was jealous and roused but scarcely in the way he desired this i said quite cheerfully means freedom for me justinand the young woman vanished from the visible universe with an incredible celerity i hope she was properly paid off and not simply made away with by a minion but i become more and more aware of my ignorance of a great financiers methods as i become more and more aware of them  stephen my dear my brother i am intolerably unhappy i do not know what to do with myself or what there is to hope for in life i am like a prisoner in a magic cage and i do not know the word that will release me how is it with you are you unhappy beyond measure or are you not and if you are not what are you doing with life have you found any secret that makes living tolerable and understandable write to me write to me at least and tell me that please write to me  do you remember how long ago you and i sat in the old park at burnmore and how i kept pestering you and asking you what is all this for and you looked at the question as an obstinate mule looks at a narrow bridge he could cross but doesnt want to well stephen youve had nearlyhow many years is it nowto get an answer ready what is it all for what do you make of it never mind my particular case or the case of women with a capital w tell me your solution you are active you keep doing things you find life worth living is publishing a way of peace for the heart i am prepared to believe even that but justify yourself tell me what you have got there to keep your soul alive   § 3  i read this letter to the end and looked up and there was my home about me a room ruddybrown and familiar with the row of old pewter things upon the dresser the steel engravings of former strattons that came to me from my father a convex mirror exaggerating my upturned face and rachel just risen again sat at the other end of the table a young mother fragile and tendereyed the clash of these two systems of reality was amazing it was as though i had not been parted from mary for a day as though all that separation and all that cloud of bitter jealousy had been a mere silence between two people in the same room indeed it was extraordinarily like that as if i had been sitting at a desk imagining myself alone reading my present life as one reads in a book at a shaded lamp and then suddenly that silent other had spoken  and then i looked at the page of my life before me and became again a character in the story  i met the enquiry in rachels eyes its a letter from mary justin i said  she did not answer for a few moments she became interested in the flame of the little spirit lamp that kept her coffee hot she finished what she had to do with that and then remarked i thought you two were not to correspond  yes i said putting the letter down that was the understanding  there was a little interval of silence and then i got up and went to the fireplace where the bacon and sausages stood upon a trivet  i suppose said rachel she wants to hear from you again  she thinks that now we have children and that she has two we can consider what was past past and closed and done with and she wants to hearabout me apart from everything elsewe were very great friends  of course said rachel with lips a little awry of course you must have been great friends and its natural for her to write  i suppose she added her husband knows  shes told him she says  her eye fell on the letter in my hand for the smallest fraction of a second and it was as if hastily she snatched away a thought from my observation i had a moment of illuminating embarrassment so far we had contrived to do as most young people do when they marry we had sought to make our lives unreservedly open to one another we had affected an entire absence of concealments about our movements our thoughts if perhaps i had been largely silent to her about mary it was not so much that i sought to hide things from her as that i myself sought to forget it is one of the things that we learn too late the impossibility of any such rapid and wilful coalescences of souls but we had maintained a convention of infinite communism since our marriage we had shown each other our letters as a matter of course shared the secrets of our friends gone everywhere together as far as we possibly could  i wanted now to give her the letter in my hand to readand to do so was manifestly impossible something had arisen between us that made out of our unity two abruptly separated figures masked and veiled here were things i knew and understood completely and that i could not even describe to rachel what would she make of marys write to me write to me a mere wish to resume i would not risk the exposure of marys mind and heart and unhappiness to her possible misinterpretation  that letter fell indeed like a pitiless searchlight into all that region of differences ignored over which we had built the vaulted convention of our complete mutual understanding in my memory it seems to me now as though we hung silent for quite a long time over the evasions that were there so abruptly revealed  then i put the letter into my pocket with a clumsy assumption of carelessness and knelt down to the fender and sausages  it will be curious i said to write to her again to tell her about things  and then with immense interest are these chichester sausages youve got here rachel or some new kind  rachel roused herself to respond with an equal affectation and we made an eager conversation about bacon and sausagesfor after that startling gleam of divergence we were both anxious to get back to the superficialities of life again   § 4  i did not answer marys letter for seven or eight days  during that period my mind was full of her to the exclusion of every other interest i reread all that she had to say many times and with each reading the effect of her personality deepened it was all so intensely familiar the flashes of insight the blazing frankness the quick turns of thought and her absurd confidence in a sort of sane stupidity that she had always insisted upon my possessing and her unembarrassed affectionateness her quick irregular writing seemed to bring back with it the changing light in her eyes the intonations of her voice something of her gesture  i didnt go on discussing with myself whether we two ought to correspond that problem disappeared from my thoughts her challenge to me to justify myself took possession of my mind that thrust towards selfexamination was the very essence of her ancient influence how did i justify myself i was under a peculiar compulsion to answer that to her satisfaction she had picked me up out of my work and accumulating routines with that demand made me look at myself and my world again as a whole i had a case i have a case it is a case of passionate faith triumphing over every doubt and impossibility a case real enough to understand for those who understand but very difficult to state i tried to convey it to her  i do not remember at all clearly what i wrote to her it has disappeared from existence but it was certainly a long letter throughout this book i have been trying to tell you the growth of my views of life and its purpose from my childish dreams and harbury attitudes to those ideas of human development that have made me undertake the work i do it is not glorious work i know as the work of great artists and poets and leaders is glorious but it is what i find best suits my gifts and my want of gifts greater men will come at last to build within my scaffoldings in some summary phrasing i must have set out the gist of this i must have explained my sense of the supreme importance of mental clarification in human life all this is manifest in her reply and i think too i did my best to tell her plainly the faith that was in me and why life seemed worth while to me  her second letter came after an interval of only a few days from the despatch of mine she began abruptly  i wont praise your letter or your beliefs they are fine and largeand generouslike you just a little artificial but you will admit that as though you had felt them give here and there and had made up your mind they shouldnt at times its oddly like looking at the alps the real alps and finding that every now and then the mountains have been eked out with a plank and canvas earls court background yes i like what you say about faith i believe you are right i wish i couldperhaps some day i shalllight up and feel you are right butbut that large respectable project the increase of wisdom and freedom and selfknowledge in the world the calming of wars the ending of economic injustice and so on and so on  when i read it first it was like looking at a man in profile and finding him solid and satisfactory and then afterwards when i thought it all over and looked for the particular things that really matter to me and tried to translate it into myselfnothing is of the slightest importance in the world that one cannot translate into oneselfthen i began to realize just how amazingly deficient you are it was like walking round that person in profile and finding his left side wasnt therewith everything perfect on the right down to the buttons a kind of intellectual loreleisideways youve planned out your understandings and tolerances and enquiries and clearingsup as if the world were all just menor citizensand nothing doing but racial and national and class prejudices and the exacting and shirking of labor and you seem to ignore altogether that man is a sexual animal firstfirst stephen firstthat he has that in common with all the animals that it made him indeed because he has it more than they haveand after that a long way after that he is the laboreconomizing warand feudmaking creature you make him out to be a long way after that  man is the most sexual of all the beasts stephen half of him womankind rather more than half isnt simply human at all its specialized specialized for the young not only naturally and physically as animals are but mentally and artificially womankind isnt human its reduced human its the sex as the victorians used to say and from the point of view of the lex julia and the point of view of mr malthus and the point of view of biologists and saints and artists and everyone who deals in feeling and emotionand from the point of view of all us poor specialists smothered up in our clothes and restrictionsthe future of the sex is the centre of the whole problem of the human future about which you are concerned all this great worldstate of your mans imagination is going to be wrecked by us if you ignore us we women are going to be the goths and huns of another decline and fall we are going to sit in the conspicuous places of the world and loot all your patient accumulations we are going to abolish your offspring and turn the princes among you into undignified slaves because you see specialized as we are we are not quite specialized we are specialized under duress and at the first glimpse of a chance we abandon our cradles and drop our pots and pans and go for the vast and elegant side possibilitiesof our specialization out we come looking for the fun the men are having dress us feed us play with us well pay you in excitementtremendous excitement the state indeed all your little triumphs of science and economy all your little accumulations of wealth that you think will presently make the struggle for life an old story and the millennium possiblewe spend and all your dreams of brotherhoodwe will set you by the ears we hold ourselves up as my little christian nephewsphilips boysdo some coveted object and say quis and the whole brotherhood shouts ego to the challenge back you go into individualism at the word and all your brotherhood crumbles to dust again  how are you going to remedy it how are you going to protect that great state of your dreams from this anticitizenship of sex you give no hint  you are planning nothing stephen nothing to meet this you are fighting with an army all looting and undisciplined frantic with the private jealousies that centre about us feuds cuts expulsions revenges and you are giving out orders for an army of saints you treat us as a negligible quantity and we are about as negligible as a fire in the woodwork of a house that is being built  i read what i have written stephen and i perceive i have the makings of a fine scold in me perhaps under happier conditions i should certainly have scolded you constantly continually never did a man so need scolding and like any selfrespecting woman i see that i use half my words in the wrong meanings in order to emphasize my point of course when i write woman in all that has gone before i dont mean woman it is a womans privilege to talk or write incomprehensibly and insist upon being understood so that i expect you already to understand that what i mean isnt that men are creative and unselfish and brotherly and so forth and that women are spoiling and going to spoil the gamealthough and notwithstanding that is exactly what i have writtenbut that humans are creative and unselfish et cetera and so forth and that it is their sexual egotistical passionate side which is ever so much bigger relatively in a woman than in a man and that is why i wrote as i did which is going to upset your noble and beautiful applecart but it is not only that by nature we are more largely and gravely and importantly sexual than men but that men have shifted the responsibility for attraction and passion upon us and made us pay in servitude and restriction and blame for the common defect of the species so that you see really i was right all along in writing of this as though it was women when it wasnt and i hope now it is unnecessary for me to make my meaning clearer than it is now and always has been in this matter and so resuming our discourse stephen which only my sense of your invincible literalness would ever have interrupted what are you going to do with us  i gather from a hint rather than accept as a statement that you propose to give us votes  stephendo you really think that we are going to bring anything to bear upon public affairs worth having i know something of the contemporary feminine intelligence justin makes no serious objection to a large and various circle of women friends and over my little sittingroom fire in the winter and in my corners of our various gardens in the summer and in walks over the heather at martens and in scotland there are great talks and confessions of love of mental freedom of ambitions and belief and unbeliefmore particularly of unbelief i have sometimes thought of compiling a dictionary of unbelief a great list of the things that a number of sweet submissive valueaboverubies wives have told me they did not believe in it would amaze their husbands beyond measure the state of mind of women about these things stephen is dreadfuli mean about all these questionsyou know what i mean the bold striving spirits do air their views a little and always in a way that makes one realize how badly they need airingbut most of the nicer women are very chary of talk they have to be drawn out a hint of opposition makes them start back or prevaricate and i see them afterwards with their husbands pretty silken furry feathery jewelled silences all their suppression doesnt keep them orthodox it only makes them furtive and crumpled and creased in their mindsin just the way that things get crumpled and creased if they are always being shoved back into a drawer you have only to rout about in their minds for a bit they pretend at first to be quite correct and then out comes the nasty little courage of the darkness sometimes there is even an apologetic titter they are quite emancipated they say i have misunderstood them their emancipation is like those horrid white lizards that grow in the kentucky caves out of the sunlight they tell you they dont see why they shouldnt do this or thatmean things underhand things cheap vicious sensual things are there i wonder the same dreadful little caverns in men i doubt it and then comes a situation that really tries their quality think of the quandary i got into with you stephen and for my sex im rather a daring person the way in which i went so farand then ran away i had a kind of excusein my illness that illness such a queer untimely feminine illness  were all to pieces stephen thats what brought down rome the women went to pieces then and the women are going to pieces today whats the good of having your legions in the grampians and marching up to philae while the wives are talking treason in your houses its no good telling us to go back to the ancient virtues the ancient virtues havent kept the ancient virtues in an advanced state of decay is what was the matter with rome and what is the matter with us you cant tell a woman to go back to the spinningwheel and the kitchen and the cradle when you have powerlooms french cooks hotels restaurants and modern nurseries weve overflowed weve got to go on to a lot of new virtues and in all the prospect before mei cant descry one clear simple thing to do  but im running on i want to know stephen why youve got nothing to say about all this it must have been staring you in the face ever since i spent my very considerable superfluous energies in wrecking your career because you know i wrecked it stephen i knew i was wrecking it and i wrecked it i knew exactly what i was doing all the time i had meant to be so fine a thing for you a mothering friend to have that dear consecutive kindly mind of yours steadying mine to have seen you grow to power over men me helping me admiring it was to have been so fine so fine didnt i urge you to marry rachel make you talk of her dont you remember that and one day when i saw you thinking of rachel saw a kind of pride in your eyessuddenly i couldnt stand it i went to my room after you had gone and thought of you and her until i wanted to scream i couldnt bear it it was intolerable i was violent to my toilet things i broke a handglass your dignified selfish selfcontrolled mary smashed a silver handmirror i never told you that you know what followed i pounced on you and took you wasnt ia soft and scented hawk was either of us better than some creature of instinct that does what it does because it must it was like a gust of madnessand i cared i found no more for your career than i cared for any other little thing for honor for rachel for justin that stood between us  my dear wasnt all that time all that heat and hunger of desire all that secret futility of passion the very essence of the situation between men and women now we are all trying most desperately to be human beings to walk erect to work togetherwhat was your phrasein a multitudinous unity to share what you call a common collective thought that shall rule mankind and this tremendous force which seizes us and says to us make that other being yours bodily yours mentally yours wholly yoursat any price no matter the price bars all our unifications it splits the whole world into couples watching each other until all our laws all our customs seem the servants of that it is the passion of the body swamping the brain its an ape that has seized a gun a beautiful modern gun here am i justins captive and he mine he mine because at the first escapade of his i get my liberty here are we two i and you barred for ever from the sight of one another and i and you writingi at any ratein spite of the illconcealed resentment of my partner were just two peeping through our bars of a universal multitude everywhere this prison of sex have you ever thought just all that it means when every woman in the world goes dressed in a costume to indicate her sex her cardinal fact so that she dare not even mount a bicycle in knickerbockers she has her hair grown long to its longest because yours is short and everything conceivable is done to emphasize and remind us and you of the fundamental trouble between us as if there was need of reminding stephen is there no way out of this is there no way at all because if there is not then i had rather go back to the hareem than live as i do now imprisoned in glasswith all of life in sight of me and none in reach i had rather justin beat me into submission and mental tranquillity and that i bore him an annualprobably deciduouschild i can understand so well now that feminine attitude that implies well if i must have a master then the more master the better perhaps that is the way that nature will not let us poor humans get away from sex and i am merelywhat is itan abnormalitywith whiskers of enquiry sprouting from my mind yet i dont feel like that  im pouring into these letters stephen the concentrated venom of years of brooding my heart is black with rebellion against my lot and against the lot of woman i have been given life and a fine position in the world i made one fatal blunder in marrying to make these things secure and now i can do nothing with it all and i have nothing to do with it it astounds me to think of the size of our establishments stephen of the extravagant way in which whole counties and great countries pay tribute to pile up the gigantic heap of wealth upon which we two lead our lives of futile entanglement in this place alone there are fourteen gardeners and garden helps and this is not one of our garden places three weeks ago i spent a thousand pounds on clothes in one great week of shopping and our yearly expenditure upon personal effect upon our magnificence and our margins cannot be greatly less than fortyfive thousand pounds i walk about our house and gardens i take one of the carriages or one of the automobiles and go to some large pointless gathering of hundreds and thousands and thousands of pounds and we walk about and say empty little things and the servants dont laugh at us the butlers dont laugh at us the people in the street tolerate us it has an effect of collective insanity you know the story of one of those dear barons of the cinque portsa decent plumberbody from rye or winchelseaone of the sixor eightwho claimed the privilege of carrying the canopy over the kingshe is speaking of king edwards coronation of coursehow that he was discovered suddenly to be speaking quite audibly to the sacred presence so near to him it is very remarkablewe should be here your majestyvery remarkable and then he subsidedhappily unheardinto hopeless embarrassment that is exactly how i feel stephen i feel i cant stand it much longer that presently i shall splutter and spoil the procession  perhaps i dont properly estimate our position in the fabric but i cant get away from the feeling that everything in social life leads up to thisto usthe ridiculous canopy if so then the universe meansnothing its blowing great forms and shapes as a swamp blows bubbles a little while ago it was megatheriums and plesiosauriumsif thats the name for themand now it is countryhouses and motorcars and coronation festivals and in the endit is all nonsense stephen it is utter nonsense  if it isnt nonsense tell me what it is for me at any rate its nonsense and for every intelligent woman about mefor i talk to some of them we indulge in seditious whisperings and witand there isnt one who seems to have been able to get to anything solider than i have done each of us has had her little fling at maternityabout as much as a washerwoman does in her odd time every two or three yearsand that is our uttermost reality all the resttrimmings we go about the world stephen dressing and meeting each other with immense ceremony we have our seasonal movements in relation to the ritual of politics and sport we travel south for the budget and north for the grouse we play games to amuse the men who keep usnot a woman would play a game for its own sakewe dabble with social reform and politics for which few of us care a rap except as an occupation we discover artists or musicians or lecturers as though we cared we try to believe in lovers or still harder try to believe in old or new religions and most of usi dontdo our best to give the gratifications and exercise the fascinations that are expected of us  something has to be done for women stephen we are the heart of life birth and begetting the home where the future grows and your schemes ignore us and slide about over the superficialities of things we are spoiling the whole process of progress we are turning all the achievements of mankind to nothingness men invent create do miracles with the world and we translate it all into shopping into a glitter of dresses and households into an immense parade of pride and excitement we excite men we stir them to get us and keep us men turn from their ideas of brotherhood to elaborate our separate cages  i am justins wife not a thing in my heavens or my earth that is not subordinated to that  something has to be done for women stephen somethingurgentlyand nothing is done until that is done some release from their intolerable subjection to sex so that for us everything else in life respect freedom social standing is entirely secondary to that but what has to be done we women do not know our efforts to know are among the most desolating of spectacles i read the papers of those suffrage women the effect is more like agitated geese upon a common than anything human has a right to be thats why i turn to you years ago i felt and now i know there is about you a simplicity of mind a foolishness of faith that is stronger and greater than the cleverness of any woman alive you are one of those strange men who take high and sweeping viewsas larks soar it isnt that you yourself are high and sweeping no but still i turn to you in the old days i used to turn to you and shake your mind and make you think about things you seemed too sluggish to think about without my clamor once do you remember at martens i shook you by the ears and when i made you think you thought as i could never do think nowabout women  stephen there are moments when it seems to me that this futility of women this futility of mens effort through women is a fated futility in the very nature of things we may be saddled with it as we are with all the animal infirmities we have with appendixes and suchlike things inside of us and the passions and rages of apes and a taili believe we have a tail curled away somewhere havent we perhaps mankind is so constituted that badly as they get along now they couldnt get along at all if they let women go free and have their own way with life perhaps you cant have two sexes loose together you must shut up one ive a horrible suspicion that all these antisuffrage men like lord cromer and sir ray lankester must know a lot about life that i do not know and that other man sir somethingorother wright who said plainly that men cannot work side by side with women because they get excited and yet you know women have had glimpses of a freedom that was not mischievous i could have been happy as a lady abbessi must have space and dignity stephenand those women had things in their hands as no women have things in their hands today they came to the house of lords but they lost all that was there some sort of natural selection  stephen you were made to answer my mind and if you cannot do it nobody can what is your outlook for women are we to go back to seclusion or will it be possible to minimize sex if you are going to minimize sex how are you going to do it suppression there is plenty of suppression now increase or diminish the pains and penalties my nephew philips boy philip christian was explaining to me the other day that if you boil water in an open bowl it just boils away and that if you boil it in a corked bottle it bangs everything to pieces and you have he says to look out but i feel thats a bad image boilingwater isnt frantically jealous and men and women are but still suppose suppose you trained people not to make such an awful fuss about things now you train them to make as much fuss as possible  oh bother it all stephen wheres your mind in these matters why havent you tackled these things why do you leave it to me to dig these questions into youlike opening a reluctant oyster arent they patent you up and answer them stephenor this correspondence will become abusive   § 5  it was true that i did ignore or minimize sexual questions as much as i could i was forced now to think why i did this that carried me back to those old days of passion memories i had never stirred for many years and i wrote to mary that there was indeed no reason but a reasonable fear that in fact i had dismissed them because they had been beyond my patience and selfcontrol because i could not think very much about them without an egotistical reversion to the bitterness of my own case and in avoiding them i was only doing what the great bulk of men in business and men in affairs find themselves obliged to do they train themselves not to think of the rights and wrongs of sexual life not to tolerate liberties even in their private imaginations they know it is like carrying a torch into a powder magazine they feel they cannot trust their own minds beyond the experience tested usages and conventions of the ages because they know how many of those who have ventured further have been blinded by mists and clouds of rhetoric lost in inexplicable puzzles and wrecked disastrously there in those half explored and altogether unsettled hinterlands lurk desires that sting like adders and hatreds cruel as hell  and then i went oni do not clearly remember now the exact line of argument i adoptedto urge upon her that our insoluble puzzles were not necessarily insoluble puzzles for the world at large that no one soldier fights anything but a partial battle and that it wasnt an absolute condemnation of me to declare that i went on living and working for social construction with the cardinal riddles of social order so far as they affected her unsolved wasnt i at any rate preparing apparatus for that huge effort at solution that mankind must ultimately make wasnt this dredging out and deepening of the channels of thought about the best that we could hope to do at the present time seeing that to launch a keel of speculation prematurely was only to strand oneself among hopeless reefs and confusions better prepare for a voyage tomorrow than sail to destruction today  whatever i put in that forgotten part of my letter was put less strikingly than my first admissions and anyhow it was upon these that mary pounced to the disregard of any other point there you are she wrote with something like elation there is a tiger in the garden and you wont talk or think about it for fear of growing excited that is my grievance against so much historical and political and social discussion its hopeless futility because of its hopeless omissions you plan the worlds future taking the women and children for granted with egotistical sex as you call it a prowling monster upsetting everything you do  but i will not give you that particular letter in its order nor its successors altogether she wrote me twentytwo letters and i one or two more than that number to her anda thing almost inevitable in a discussion by correspondencethere is a lot of overlapping and recapitulation those letters spread over a space of nearly two and a half years again and again she insists upon the monstrous exaggeration of the importance of sex in human life and of the need of some reduction of its importance and she makes the boldest experimental suggestions for the achievement of that end but she comes slowly to recognize that there is a justification for an indirect attack that sex and the position of women do not constitute the primary problem in that bristling system of riddles that lies like a hostile army across the path of mankind and she realized too that through art through science and literature and the whole enquiring and creative side of mans nature lies the path by which those positions are to be outflanked and those eternallooking impossibles and inconceivables overcome here is a fragmentsaturated with the essence of her thought threequarters of her earlier letters are variations on this theme  what you call social order stephen all the arrangements seem to me to be built on subjection to sex even more than they are built as you say on labor subjection and this is an age of release you say it is an age of release for the workers and they know it and so do the women just as much wild hopes indeed the workers hopes are nothing to the womens it is not only the workers who are saying let us go free manage things differently so that we may have our lives relieved from this intolerable burthen of constant toil but the women also are saying let us go free they are demanding release just as much from their intolerable endless specialization as females the tramp on the roads who wont work the swindler and the exploiter who contrive not to work the strikers who throw down their tools no longer for twopences and sixpences as you say but because their way of living is no longer tolerable to them and we women who dont bear children or work or help we are all in one movement together we are part of the general strike i have been a striker all my life we are doing nothingby the hundred thousand your old social machine is working without us and in spite of us it carries us along with it and we are sand in the bearings im not a wheel stephen im grit what you say about the reactionaries and suppressionists who would stifle the complaints of labor and crush out its struggles to be free is exactly true about the reactionaries and suppressionists who would stifle the discussion of the womans position and crush out her hopes of emancipation  and here is a page of the peculiar doubt that was as characteristic of her as the quick changes of her eyes it gives just that pessimistic touch that tempered her valiant adventurousness that gave a color at last to the tragedy of her death  have you ever thought stephen that perhaps these repressionist people are righter than you arethat if the worker gets free he wont work and that if the woman gets free she wont furl her sex and stop disturbing things suppose she is wicked as a sex suppose she will trade on her power of exciting imaginative men a lot of these new women run with the hare and hunt with the hounds beguile some poor innocent of a man to ruin them and then call in fathers brother husbands friends chivalry all the rest of it and make the best of both sides of a sex suppose we go on behaving like that after weve got all our emancipations suppose that the liberation of common people simply means loafing no discipline nothing being done an end to labor and the beginning of nothing to replace it and that the liberation of women simply means the elaboration of mischief suppose that it is so suppose you are just tumbling the contents of the grate into the middle of the room then all this emancipation is a decay even as conservativeminded people sayits none the less a decay because we want itand the only thing to stop it is to stop it and to have more discipline and more suppression and say to women and the common people back to the sterner virtues back to servitude i wish i hadnt these reactionary streaks in my thoughts but i have and there you are  and then towards the second year her letters began to break away from her preoccupation with her position as a woman and to take up new aspects of life more general aspects of life altogether it had an effect not of her having exhausted the subject but as if despairing of a direct solution she turned deliberately to the relief of other considerations she ceased to question her own life and taking that for granted wrote more largely of less tangible things she remembered that she had said that life if it was no more than its present appearances was utter nonsense she went back to that one says things like that she wrote and not for a moment does one believe it i grumble at my life i seem to be always weakly and fruitlessly fighting my life and i love it i would not be willingly deadfor anything id rather be an old matchwoman selling matches on a freezing night in the streets than be dead nothing nonsensical ever held me so tightly or kept me so interested i suppose really i am full of that very same formless faith on which you rely but with me its not only shapeless but intangible i nibble at religion i am immensely attracted i stand in the doorway only when they come out to persuade me to come in i am like a shy child and i go away the temples beguile me and the music but not the men i feel i want to join it and they say join us they arelike vergers such small things such dreadful little arguing men they dont let you come in they want you to say they are right all the really religious people seem to be outside nowadays and all the pretending cheating atheistical vain and limited people within  but the beautiful things religion gives the beauty do you know saint pauls stephen latterly i have been there time after time it is the most beautiful interior in all the world so great so sombrely dignified so perfectly balancedand filled with such wonderful music brimming with music just as crystal water brims in a bowl of crystal the other day i went there up into a little gallery high up under the dome to hear bachs passion music the st matthew passion one hangs high and far above the little multitudes below the whiterobed singers the whiterobed musicians ranks and ranks the great organ the rows and rows and rows of congregation receding this way that way into the haze of the aisle and the transepts and out of it all streams the sound and the singing it pours up past you like a river a river that rushes upward to some great sea some unknown sea the whole place is music and singing i hang on to the railings stephen and weepi have to weepand i wonder and wonder  one prays then as naturally as one drinks when one is thirsty and cold water comes to hand i dont know whom i pray to but i prayof course i pray latterly stephen i have been reading devotional works and trying to catch that music again i never dodefinitely never but at times i put down the book and it seems to me that surely a moment ago i heard it that if i sit very still in a moment i shall hear it again and i can feel it is there i know it is there like a bats cry pitched too high for my ears i know it is there just as i should still know there was poetry somewhere if some poor toothless idiot with no roof to his mouth and no knowledge of any but the commonest words tried to read shelley to me  i wish i could pray with you stephen i wish i could kneel down somewhere with you of all people and pray   § 6  presently our correspondence fell away the gaps between our letters lengthened out we never wrote regularly because for that there must be a free exchange upon daily happenings and neither of us cared to dwell too closely on our immediate lives we had a regard for one another that left our backgrounds vague and shadowy she had made her appeal across the sundering silences to me and i had answered and we had poured out certain things from our minds we could not go on discussing i was a very busy man now and she did not write except on my replies  for a gap of nearly four months neither of us had anything to say in a letter at all i think that in time our correspondence might have altogether died away then she wrote again in a more familiar strain to tell me of certain definite changes of relationship and outlook she said that the estrangement between herself and justin had increased during the past year that they were going to live practically apart she for the most part in the surrey house where her two children lived with their governesses and maids but also she meant to snatch weeks and seasons for travel upon that they had been disputing for some time i know it is well with the children she wrote why should i be in perpetual attendance i do nothing for them except an occasional kiss or halfanhours romping why should one pretend justin and i have wrangled over this question of going away for weeks but at last feminine persistence has won i am going to travel in my own fashion and see the world with periodic appearances at his side in london and scotland we have agreed at least on one thing and that is upon a companion she is to be my secretary in title my moral guarantor in fact and her name which is her crowning glory is stella summersley satchel she is blonde erect huffymannered and thoroughly up to both sides of her work i partly envy her independence and rectitudepartly only its odd and quite inconsistent of me that i dont envy her altogether in theory i insist that a woman should not have charmit is our undoing but when i meet one without it  i shall also trail a maid but i guess that young woman will learn what it is to be left behind in half the cities of europe before i have done with her i always lose my maids they are so much more passive and forgettable than luggageabroad that is and justin usually in the old days used to remember about them and his valet used to see after thema most attentive man justin cannot he says have his wife abroad with merely a companion people would talk maid it must be as well and so in a week or less i shall start unusually tailormade for south germany and all that jolly country companioned and maided i shall trampon the feet god has given mein stout boots miss summersley satchel marches i understand like the british infantry but on a vegetarian basisfancy calling your nourishment a basisthe maid and so forth by Èilgut   § 7  after the letter containing that announcement she wrote to me twice again once from oban and then after a long interval from siena the former was a scornfully minute description of the english at their holidays and how the conversation went among the women after dinner they are like a row of japanese lanterns all blown out long ago and swinging about in a wind she wrotean extravagant image that yet conveys something of the large empty unilluminating effect of a sort of social intercourse very vividly in the second letter she was concerned chiefly with the natural beauty of italy and how latterly she had thrice wept at beautiful things and what this mystery of beauty could be that had such power over her emotions  all up the hillside before the window as i write the herbage is thick with anemones they arent scattered evenly and anyhow amongst the other things but in little clusters and groups that die away and begin again like the repetitions of an air in some musical composition i have been sitting and looking at them for the better part of an hour loving them more and then more and the sweet sunlight that is on them and in among them how marvellous are these things stephen all these little exquisite things that are so abundant in the world the gleaming lights and blossoms the drifting scents at times these things bring me to weeping i cant help it it is as if god who is so stern and high so terrible to all our appeals took pity for a moment and saw fit to speak very softly and tenderly  that was the last letter i was ever to have from her     chapter the eleventh  the last meeting   § 1  in the summer of 1911 immediately after the coronation of king george there came one of those storms of international suspicion that ever and again threaten europe with war it seems to have been brewed by some german adepts at weltpolitik those privileged makers of giant bombs who sit at the ears of foreign ministers suggesting idiotic wickedness and it was brewed with a sublime ignorance of nearly every reality in the case a german warship without a word of notice seized agadir on the atlantic coast of morocco within the regions reserved to french influence an english demand for explanations was uncivilly disregarded and england and france and presently germany began vigorous preparations for war all over the world it was supposed that germany had at last flung down the gauntlet in england the war party was only too eager to grasp what it considered to be a magnificent opportunity heaven knows what the germans had hoped or intended by their remarkable coup the amazing thing to note is that they were not prepared to fight they had not even the necessary money ready and they could not get it they had perhaps never intended to fight and the autumn saw the danger disperse again into diplomatic bickerings and insincerely pacific professions but in the high summer the danger had not dispersed and in common with every reasonable man i found myself under the shadow of an impending catastrophe that would have been none the less gigantic and tragic because it was an imbecility it was an occasion when everyone needs must act however trivially disproportionate his action may be to the danger i cabled gidding who was in america to get together whatever influences were available there upon the side of pacific intervention and i set such british organs as i could control or approach in the same direction it seemed probable that italy would be drawn into any conflict that might ensue it happened that there was to be a conference of peace societies in milan early in september and thither i decided to go in the not very certain hope that out of that assemblage some form of european protest might be evolved  that august i was very much run down i had been staying in london through almost intolerably hot weather to attend a races congress that had greatly disappointed me i dont know particularly now why i had been disappointed nor how far the feeling was due to my being generally run down by the pressure of detailed work and the stress of thinking about large subjects in little scraps of time but i know that a kind of despair came over me as i sat and looked at that multicolored assembly and heard in succession the heavy platitudes of white men the slick thin cleverness of hindoos the richtoned florid rhetoric of negroes i lost sight of any germ of splendid possibility in all those people and saw all too plainly the vanity the jealousy the selfinterests that show up so harshly against the professions of every altruistic movement it seemed all such a windy business against the firm prejudices the vast accumulated interests that grind race against race we had no common purpose at all at that conference no proposal to hold us together so much of it was like bleating on a hillside  i wanted a holiday badly and then came this war crisis and i felt unable to go away for any length of time even bleating it seemed to me was better than acquiescence in a crime against humanity so to get heart to bleat at milan i snatched at ten days in the swiss mountains en route a tour with some taciturn guide involving a few middling climbs and glacier excursions seemed the best way of recuperating i had never had any time for switzerland since my first exile there years ago i took the advice of a man in the club whose name i now forgetif ever i knew it a dark man with a scarand went up to the schwarzegg hut above grindelwald and over the strahlegg to the grimsel i had never been up into the central mass of the bernese oberland before and i was amazed and extraordinarily delighted by the vast lonely beauty of those interminable uplands of ice i wished i could have lingered up there but that is the tragedy of those sunlit desolations one may not stay one sees and exclaims and then looks at a watch i wonder no one has ever taken an arctic equipment up into that wilderness and had a good healing spell of lonely exaltation i found the descent from the strahlegg as much of a climb as i was disposed to undertake for an hour we were coming down frozen snow that wasnt so much a slope as a slightly inclined precipice  from the grimsel i went over the rhone glacier to the inn on the furka pass and then paying off my guide and becoming frankly a pedestrian i made my way round by the schöllenen gorge to goeschenen and over the susten joch to the susten pass and stein meaning to descend to meiringen  but i still had four days before i went on to italy and so i decided to take one more mountain i slept at the stein inn and started in the morning to do that agreeable first mountain of all the titlis whose shining genial head attracted me i did not think a guide necessary but a boy took me up by a track near gadmen and left me to my siegfried map some way up the great ridge of rocks that overlooks the engstlen alp i a little overestimated my mountaineering and it came about that i was benighted while i was still high above the joch pass on my descent some of this was steep and needed caution i had to come down slowly with my folding lantern in which a reluctant candle went out at regular intervals and i did not reach the little inn at engstlen alp until long after eleven at night by that time i was very tired and hungry  they told me i was lucky to get a room only one stood vacant i should certainly not have enjoyed sleeping on a billiard table after my days work and i ate a hearty supper smoked for a time meditated emptily and went wearily to bed  but i could not sleep usually i am a good sleeper but ever and again when i have been working too closely or overexerting myself i have spells of wakefulness and that night after perhaps an hours heavy slumber i became thinly alert and very weary in body and spirit and i do not think i slept again the pain in my leg that the panther had torn had been revived by the days exertion for the greater part of my life insomnia has not been disagreeable to me in the night in the stillness one has a kind of detachment from reality one floats there without light without weight feeling very little of ones body one has a certain disembodiment and one can achieve a magnanimity of thought forgiveness and selfforgetfulness that are impossible while the body clamors upon ones senses but that night because i suppose i was so profoundly fatigued i was melancholy and despondent i could feel again the weight of the great beast upon me as he clawed me down and i clungdesperately in that interminable instant before he lost his hold  yes i was extraordinarily wretched that night i was filled with selfcontempt and selfdisgust i felt that i was utterly weak and vain and all the pretensions and effort of my life mere florid fruitless pretensions and nothing more i had lost all control over my mind things that had seemed secondary before became primary difficult things became impossible things i had been greatly impeded and irritated in london by the manoeuvres of a number of people who were anxious to make capital out of the crisis selfadvertising people who wanted at any cost to be lifted into a position of unique protest you see that unfortunate nobel prize has turned the advocacy of peace into a highly speculative profession the qualification for the winner is so vaguely defined that a vast multitude of voluntary idealists has been created and a still greater number diverted from the unendowed pursuit of human welfare in other directions such a man as myself who is known to command a considerable publicity is necessarily a prey to those moral entrepreneurs all sorts of ridiculous and petty incidents had forced this side of public effort upon me but hitherto i had been able to say with a laugh or sigh as the case warranted so much is dear old humanity and all of us and to remember the great residuum of nobility that remained now that last saving consideration refused to be credible i lay with my body and my mind in pain thinking these people over thinking myself over too with the rest of my associates thinking drearily and weakly recalling spites dishonesties and vanities feuds and absurdities until i was near persuaded that all my dreams of wider human understandings of great ends beyond the immediate aims and passions of common everyday lives could be at best no more than the refuge of shy and weak and ineffective people from the failure of their personal lives  we idealists are not jolly people not honest simple people the strain tells upon us even to ourselves we are unappetizing arent the burly bellowing fellows after all righter with their simple natural hostility to everything foreign their valiant hatred of everything unlike themselves their contempt for aspiring weakness their beer and lush sentiment their heretodayandgonetomorrow conviviality and fellowship good fellows while we others lost in filmy speculations in moonandstar snaring and the chase of dreams stumble where even they walk upright  you know i have never quite believed in myself never quite believed in my work or my religion so it has always been with me and always i suppose will be i know i am purblind i know i do not see my way clearly nor very far i have to do with things imperfectly apprehended i cannot cheat my mind away from these convictions i have a sort of hesitation of the soul as other men have a limp in their gait god i suppose has a need for lame men god i suppose has a need for blind men and fearful and doubting men and does not intend life to be altogether swallowed up in staring sight some things are to be reached best by a hearing that is not distracted by any clearer senses but so it is with me and this is the innermost secret i have to tell you  i go valiantly for the most part i know but despair is always near to me in the common hours of my life it is as near as a shark may be near a sleeper in a ship the thin effectual plank of my deliberate faith keeps me secure but in these rare distresses of the darkness the plank seems to become transparent to be on the verge of dissolution a sense of life as of an abyssmal flood full of cruelty densely futile blackly aimless penetrates my defences  i dont think i can call these stumblings from conviction unbelief the limping man walks for all his limping and i go on in spite of my falls though he slay me yet will i trust in him  i fell into an inconsecutive review of my life under this light that touched every endeavor with the pale tints of failure and as that flow of melancholy reflection went on it was shot more and more frequently with thoughts of mary it was not a discursive thinking about mary but a definite fixed direction of thought towards her i had not so thought of her for many years i wanted her i felt to come to me and help me out of this distressful pit into which my spirit had fallen i believed she could i perceived our separation as an irreparable loss she had a harder clearer quality than i a more assured courage a readier surer movement of the mind always she had lift for me and then i had a curious impression that i had heard her voice calling my name as one might call out in ones sleep i dismissed it as an illusion and then i heard it again so clearly that i sat up and listenedbreathless  mixed up with all this was the intolerable uproar and talking of a little cascade not fifty yards from the hotel it is curious how distressing that clamor of running water which is so characteristic of the alpine night can become at last those sounds can take the likeness of any voice whatever the water i decided had called to me and now it mocked and laughed at me  the next morning i descended at some late hour by swiss reckoning and discovered two ladies in the morning sunlight awaiting breakfast at a little green table one rose slowly at the sight of me and stood and surveyed me with a glad amazement   § 2  there she stood real and solid a little unfamiliar in her tweeds and with her shining eyes intimate and unforgettable as though i had never ceased to see them for all those intervening years and bracing us both and holding back our emotion was quite unmistakably miss summersley satchel a blonde businesslike young woman with a stumpy nose very cruelly corrugated and inflamed by a pincenez that savagely did much more than its duty by its name she remained seated tilting her chair a little pushing herself back from the table and regarding meintelligently  it was one of those moments in life when one is taken unawares i think our common realization of the need of masking the reality of our encounter the hasty search in our minds for some plausible face upon this meeting must have been very obvious to the lady who observed us marys first thought was for a pseudonym mine was to make it plain we met by accident  its mrstephen said mary  its you  dropped out of the sky  from over there i was benighted and go there late  very late  one gleam of lightand a yawning waiter or i should have had to break windows and then i meet you  then for a moment or so we were silent with our sense of the immense gravity of this position growing upon us a little towheaded waiterboy appeared with their coffee and rolls on a tray poised high on his hand  youll have your coffee out here with us said mary  where else said i as though there was no conceivable alternative and told the towheaded waiter  belatedly mary turned to introduce me to her secretary my friend miss summersley satchel mrstephen miss satchel and i bowed to each other and agreed that the lake was very beautiful in the morning light mr stephen said mary in entirely unnecessary explanation is an old friend of my mothers and i havent seen him for years how is mrs stephenand the children  i answered briefly and began to tell of my climb down the titlis i addressed myself with unnecessary explicitness to miss satchel i did perhaps overaccentuate the extreme fortuitousness of my appearance from where i stood the whole course of the previous day after i had come over the shoulder was visible it seemed a soft little shining pathway to the top but the dangers of the descent had a romantic intensification in the morning light the rule of the game said i is that one stops and waits for daylight i wonder if anyone keeps that rule  we talked for a time of mountains i still standing a little aloof until my coffee came miss summersley satchel produced that frequent and most unpleasant byeproduct of a british education an intelligent interest in etymology i wonder she said with a brow of ruffled omniscience and eyeing me rather severely with a magnified eye why it is called titlis there must be some reason  presently miss satchel was dismissed indoors on a transparent excuse and mary and i were alone together we eyed one another gravely perhaps all the more gravely because of the wild excitement that was quickening our pulse and breathing and thrilling through our nerves she pushed back the plate before her and put her dear elbows on the table and dropped her chin between her hands in an attitude that seemed all made of little memories  i suppose she said something of this kind was bound to happen  she turned her eyes to the mountains shining in the morning light im glad it has happened in a beautiful place it might have beenanywhere  last night i said i was thinking of you and wanting to hear your voice again i thought i did  i too i wonderif we had some dim perception  she scanned my face stephen youre not much changed youre looking well but your eyestheyre dogtired eyes have you been working too hard  a conferencewhat did you call them oncea carnegieish conference in london hot weather and fussing work and endless hours of weak grey dusty speeches and perhaps that clamber over there yesterday was too much it was too much in india i damaged a leg i had meant to rest here for a day  wellrest here  with you  why not now you are here  but after all weve promised  its none of our planning stephen  it seems to me i ought to go right onso soon as breakfast is over  she weighed that with just the same still pause the same quiet moment of lips and eyes that i recalled so well it was as things had always been between us that she should make her decision first and bring me to it  it isnt natural she decided with the sun rising and the day still freshly beginning that you should go or that i should go ive wanted to meet you like this and talk about thingsten thousand times and as for me stephen i wont go and i wont let you go if i can help it not this morning anyhow no go later in the day if you will and let us two take this one talk that god himself has given us weve not planned it its his doing not ours  i sat yielding i am not so sure of gods participation i said but i know i am very tired and glad to be with you i cant tell you how glad so glad i think i should weep if i tried to say it  three four five hours perhapseven if people know is it so much worse than thirty minutes weve broken the rules already weve been flung together its not our doing stephen a little while longeradds so little to the offence and means to us  yes i said butif justin knows  he wont  your companion  there was the briefest moment of reflection shes discretion itself she said  still  if hes going to know the harm is done we may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb and he wont know no one will know  the people here  nobodys here not a soul who matters i doubt if they know my name no one ever talks to me  i sat in the bright sunshine profoundly enervated and quite convinced but still maintaining out of mere indolence a show of hesitation  you take the good things god sends you stephenas i do you stay and talk with me now before the curtain falls again weve tired of letters you stay and talk to me  here we are stephen and its the one chance that is ever likely to come to us in all our lives well keep the point of honor and you shall go today but dont lets drive the point of honor into the quick go easy stephen old friend my dear my dear what has happened to you have you forgotten of course is it possible for you to go mute with so much that we can say and these mountains and this sunlight  i looked up to see her with her elbows on the table and her hands clasped under her chin that face close to mine her dear blue eyes watching me and her lips a little apart  no other human being has ever had that effect upon me so that i seem to feel the life and stir in that other body more than i feel my own   § 3  from the moment when i confessed my decision to stay we gave no further thought to the rightfulness or wisdom of spending the next few hours together we thought only of those hours things lent themselves to us we stood up and walked out in front of the hotel and there moored to a stake at the edge of the water was a little leaky punt the one vessel on the engstlen see we would take food with us as we decided and row out there to where the vast cliffs came sheer from the water out of earshot or interference and talk for all the time we had and i remember now how mary stood and called to miss satchels window to tell her of this intention and how i discovered again that exquisite slender grace i knew so well  you know the very rowing out from the shore had in it something sweet and incredible it was as if we were but dreaming together and might at any moment awaken again countless miles and a thousand things apart i rowed slowly with those clumsy swiss oars that one must thrust forward breaking the smooth crystal of the lake and she sat sideways looking forward saying very little and with much the same sense i think of enchantment and unreality and i saw now for the first time as i watched her over my oars that her face was changed she was graver and i thought stronger than the mary i had known  even now i can still doubt if that boat and lake were real and yet i remember even minute and irrelevant details of the days impressions with an extraordinary and exquisite vividness perhaps it is that very luminous distinctness which distinguishes these events from the common experiences of life and puts them so above the quality of things that are ordinarily real  we rowed slowly past a great headland and into the bay at the upper end of the water we had not realized at first that we could row beyond the range of the hotel windows the rock that comes out of the lake is a clear dead white when it is dry and very faintly tinted but when it is wetted it lights warmly with flashes and blotches of color and is seen to be full of the most exquisite and delicate veins it splinters vertically and goes up in cliffs very high and sculptured with a quality almost of porcelain that at a certain level suddenly become more rude and massive and begin to overhang under the cliffs the water is very deep and bluegreen and runs here and there into narrow clefts this place where we landed was a kind of beach left by the recession of the ice all the rocks immediately about us were iceworn and the place was paved with iceworn boulders two huge bluffs put their foreheads together above us and hid the glacier from us but one could feel the near presence of ice in the air out between them boiled a little torrent and spread into a hundred intercommunicating channels amidst the great pebbles and those pebbles were covered by a network of marvellously gnarled and twisted stems bearing little leaves and blossoms a network at once very ancient and very fresh giving a peculiar gentleness and richness to the alpine severity that had dwarfed and tangled them it was astounding that any plant could find nourishment among those stones the great headland with patches of yellowish old snow still lingering here and there upon its upper masses had crept insensibly between us and the remote hotel and now hid it altogether there was nothing to remind us of the world that had separated us except that old and leaky boat we had drawn up upon the stones at the limpid waters edge  it is as if we had come out of life together she whispered giving a voice to my thought  she sat down upon a boulder and i sat on a lower slab a yard or so away and we looked at one another its still unreal she said  i felt awkward and at a loss as i sat there before her as a man unused to drawingrooms might feel in the presence of a strange hostess  you are so you i said so altogether my nearest thingand so strange too so far off that i feelshy  im shy i repeated i feel that if i speak loudly all this will vanish  i looked about me but surely this is the most beautiful place in the whole world is it indeed in the world  stephen my dear she began presently what a strange thing life is strange the disproportions the things that will not fit together the little things that eat us up and the beautiful things that might save us and dont save us dont seem indeed to have any meaning in regard to ordinary sensible affairs this beauty  do you remember stephen how long ago in the old park you and i talked about immortality and you said then you did not want to know anything of what comes after life even now do you want to know you are too busy and i am not busy enough i want to be sure not only to know but to know that it is so that this lifeno not this life but that life is only the bleak twilight of the morning i think deathjust dead deathafter the life i have had is the most impossible of ends you dont wantparticularly i want to passionately i want to live againout of this body stephen and all that it carves with it to be freeas beautiful things are free to be free as this is freean exquisite clean freedom  i cant believe that the life of this earth is all that there is for usor why should we ever think it strange why should we still find the ordinary matteroffact things of everyday strange we dobecause they arentus eating stuffing into ourselves thin slices of what were queer little hot and eager beasts the perpetual need to do such things and all the mad fury of sex stephen we dont live we suffocate in our living bodies they storm and rage and snatch it isnt us stephen really it cant be us its all so excessiveif it is anything more than the first furious rush into existence of beings that will go ongo on at last to quite beautiful real things like this perhaps today the world is beautiful indeed with the sun shining and love shining and you my dear so near to me its so incredible that you and i must part today its as ifsomeone told me the sun was a little mad its so perfectly natural to be with you again  her voice sank she leant a little forward towards me stephen suppose that you and i were dead today suppose that when you imagined you were climbing yesterday you died suppose that yesterday you died and that you just thought you were still climbing as you made your way to me perhaps you are dead up there on the mountain and i am lying dead in my room in this hotel and this is the great beginning  stephen i am talking nonsense because i am so happy to be with you here   § 4  for a time we said very little then irregularly disconnectedly we began to tell each other things about ourselves  the substance of our lives seemed strangely objective that day we had as it were come to one another clean out of our common conditions she told me of her troubles and her secret weaknesses we bared our spirits and confessed both of us had the same tale of mean and angry and hasty impulses both of us could find kindred inconsistencies both had an exalted assurance that the other would understand completely and forgive and love she talked for the most part she talked much more than i with a sort of wonder at the things that had happened to her and for long spaces we did not talk at all nor feel the need of talking and what seems very strange to me now seeing that we had been impassioned lovers we never kissed we never kissed at all i do not even remember that i thought of kissing her we had a shyness between us that kept us a little apart and i cannot remember that we ever touched one another except that for a time she took me and led me by the hand towards a little place of starry flowers that had drawn her eyes and which she wished me to see already for us two our bodies were dead and gone we were shy shy of any contact we were a little afraid of one another there was a kind of awe between us that we had met again  and in that strange and beautiful place her fancy that we were dead together had a fitness that i cannot possibly convey to you i cannot give you by any writing the light and the sweet freshness of that high desolation you would need to go there what was lovely in our talk being said in that setting would seem but a rambling discourse were i to write it downas i believe that even now i could write it downword for word almost every thought of it so fresh does it remain with me  my dear some moments are eternal it seems to me that as i write to tell you of this i am telling you not of something that happened two years ago but of a thing immortal it is as if i and mary were together there holding the realities of our lives before us as though they were little sorry tales written in books upon our knees   § 5  it was still in the early afternoon that we came down again across the meandering icewater streams to our old boat and pushed off and rowed slowly out of that magic corner back to everyday again  little we knew to what it was we rowed  as we glided across the water and rounded the headland and came slowly into view of the hotel again mary was reminded of our parting and for a little while she was disposed to make me remain if you could stay a little longer she saidanother day if any harm is done its done  it has been beautiful i said this meeting its just as ifwhen i was so jaded and discouraged that i could have put my work aside and despaired altogethersome power had said have you forgotten the friendship i gave you  but we shall have had our time weve metweve seen one another weve heard one another weve hurt no one  you will go  today before sunset isnt it right that i should go  stay she whispered with a light in her eyes  no i dare not  she did not speak for a long time  of course she said at last youre right you only saidi would have said it for you if you had not youre so right stephen i suppose poor silly little things that if you stayed we should certainly begin making love to each other it would benecessary we should fence about a little and then there it would be no barrierto stop us and neither of us wants it to happen it isnt what we want you would become urgent i suppose and i should becoquettish in spite of ourselves that power would make us puppets as if already we hadnt made love i could find it in my heart now stephen i could make you stay  oh why are we so tormented stephen in the next world we shall meet and this will trouble us no longer the love will be thereoh the love will be there like something that has at last got itself fully born got itself free from some queer clinging seedcase  we shall be rid of jealousy stephen that inflammation of the mind that bitterness that pitiless sore so that i shant be tormented by the thought of rachel and she will be able to tolerate me she was so sweet and wonderful a girlwith those dark eyes and ive never done her justicenever nor she me i snatched you from her i snatched you  someday we shall be different all this putting oneself round another person like a fence against everyone else almost against everything else its so wicked so fierce  its so possible to be different sometimes now sometimes for long parts of a day i have no base passions at alleven in this life to be like that always but i cant see clearly how these things can be one dreams of them in a kind of luminous mist and if one looks directly at them they vanish again   § 6  and at last we came to the landing and moored the little boat and walked up the winding path to the hotel the dull pain of separation was already upon us  i think we had forgotten miss summersley satchel altogether but she appeared as we sat down to tea at that same table at which we had breakfasted and joined us as a matter of course conceivably she found the two animated friends of the morning had become rather taciturn indeed there came a lapse of silence so portentous that i roused myself to effort and told her all over again as i realized afterwards the difficulties that had benighted me upon titlis then miss satchel regaled mary with some particulars of the various comings and goings of the hotel i became anxious to end this tension and went into the inn to pay my bill and get my knapsack when i came out mary stood up  ill come just a little way with you stephen she said and i could have fancied the glasses of the companion flashed to hear the surname of the morning reappear a christian name in the afternoon  is that woman behind us safe i asked breaking the silence as we went up the mountainside  mary looked over her shoulder for a contemplative second  shes always beendiscretion itself  we thought no more of miss satchel  this parting said mary is the worst of the price we have to pay now it comes to the end there seem a thousand things one hasnt said  and presently she came back to that we shant remember this so much perhaps it was there we met over there in the sunlightamong those rocks i supposeperhapswe managed to say something  as the ascent grew steeper it became clear that if i was to reach the melch see inn by nightfall our moment for parting had come and with a well and a whitelipped smile and a glance at the arguseyed hotel she held out her hand to me i shall live on this brother stephen she said for years  i too i answered  it was wonderful to stand and face her there and see her real and living with the warm sunlight on her and her face one glowing tenderness we clasped hands all the warm life of our hands met and clung and parted  i went on alone up the winding pathit zigzags up the mountainside in full sight of the hotel for the better part of an hourclimbing steadily higher and looking back and looking back until she was just a little strip of whitethat halted and seemed to wave to me i waved back and found myself weeping you fool i said to myself go on and it was by an effort that i kept on my way instead of running back to her again presently the curvature of the slope came up between us and hid her altogether hid the hotel hid the lakes and the cliffs  it seemed to me that i could not possibly see her any more it was as if i knew that sun had set for ever   § 7  i lay at the melch see inn that night and rose betimes and started down that wild grey gorge in the early morning light i walked to sachseln caught an early train to lucerne and went on in the afternoon to como and there i stayed in the sunshine taking a boat and rowing alone far up the lake and lying in it thinking of love and friendship and the accidents and significance of my life and for the most part not thinking at all but feeling feeling the glow of our meeting and the finality of our separation as one feels the clear glow of a sunset when the wind rises and the cold night draws near everything was pervaded by the sense of her just over those mountains i thought is mary i was alone in my boat but her presence filled the sky it seemed to me that at any moment i could go to her and the last vestige of any cloud between us for anything we had done or failed to do in these crises of distress and separation had vanished and gone altogether  in the afternoon i wrote to rachel i had not written to her for three days and even now i told her nothing of my meeting with mary i had not written partly because i could not decide whether i should tell her of that or not in the end i tried to hide it from her it seemed a little thing in regard to her a thing that could not hurt her a thing as detached from her life and as inconsecutive as a dream in my head  three days later i reached milan a day before the formal opening of the peace congress but i found a telegram had come that morning to the poste restante to banish all thought of my pacific mission from my mind it came from paris and its blue ribbon of text ran        come back at once to london justin has been told of our meeting      and is resolved upon divorce will do all in my power to explain      and avert but feel you should know at once   there are some things so monstrously destructive to all we hold dear that for a time it is impossible to believe them i remember now that as i read that amazing communication throughat the first reading it was a little difficult to understand because the italian operator had guessed at one or two of the words no real sense of its meaning came to me that followed sluggishly i felt as one might feel when one opens some offensive anonymous letter or hears some preposterous threat  what nonsense i said faintheartedly i stood for a time at my bedroom window trying to shake this fact altogether off my mind but it stayed and became more and more real suddenly with a start i perceived it was real i had to do things forthwith  i rang the bell and asked for an orario i shant want these rooms i have to go back to england i said yesi have had bad news    § 8  weve only got to explain i told myself a hundred times during that long sleepless journey the thundering wheels so close beneath my head echoed explain oh yes explain explain explain  and something a voice to which i would not listen urged suppose they do not choose to believe what you explain  when i sat face to face with maxwell hartington my solicitor in his inksplashed dirty yellowgrained room with its rows of black tin boxes i could no longer ignore that possibility maxwell hartington sat back in his chair after his fashion listening to my story breathing noisily through his open mouth perspiring little beads and looking more out of condition than ever i never knew a man so winesodden and so sharpwitted  thats all very well stratton he said between ourselves very unfortunate and all that sort of thing but it doesnt satisfy justin evidently and weve got to put a different look on it if we can before we go before a jury you see he seemed to be considering and rejecting unpalatable phrases they wont understand  but i said after all a mere chance of the same hotel there must be more evidence than that  you spent the night in adjacent rooms he said dryly  adjacent rooms i cried  he regarded me for a moment with something bordering on admiration didnt you know he said  no  theyve routed that out you were sleeping with your two heads within a yard of one another anyhow thirtysix you had and she had thirtyseven  but i said and stopped  maxwell hartingtons admiration gave place i think to a slight resentment at my sustained innocence and lady mary changed rooms with her secretary two nights beforeto be near the vacant room the secretary went into number 12 on the floor belowa larger room at thirteen francs a day and one not exposed to the early daylight  he turned over a paper on his desk you didnt know of course he said but what i want to haveand his voice grew wrathfulis sure evidence that you didnt know no jury on earth is going to believe you didnt know no jury whyhis mask droppedno man on earth is going to believe a yarn like that if thats all you have stratton   § 9  our london house was not shut uptwo servants were there on boardwages against the possibility of such a temporary return as i was now makingrachel was away with you three children at cromingham i had not told her i was returning to london and i had put up at one of my clubs until i had had a second interview with maxwell hartington i still would not let myself think that it was possible that mary and i would fail with our explanations we had the common confidence of habitually unchallenged people that our word would be accepted i had hoped indeed to get the whole affair settled and abolished without anything of it coming to rachels ears then at my leisure i should be able to tell her exactly how things had come about but each day made it clearer that things were not going to be settled that the monstrous and the incredible was going to happen and that justin had set his mind implacably upon a divorce my sense of complete innocence had already been shaken by maxwell hartington i had come to perceive that we had been amazingly indiscreet i was beginning to think we had been criminally indiscreet  i saw maxwell hartington for a second time and it became clear to me i must abandon any hope of keeping things further from rachel i took my luggage round to my house to the great astonishment of the two servantsthey had supposed of course that i was in italyand then went down on the heels of a telegram to rachel i forget the wording of that telegram but it was as little alarming as possible i think i said something about back in london for documents shall try to get down to you i did not specify any particular train or indeed state definitely that i was coming that day  i had never been to cromingham before i went to the house you occupied on the esplanade and learnt that you were all upon the beach i walked along the seawall scrutinizing the various bright groups of children and nursemaids and holiday people that were scattered over the sands it was a day of blazing sunshine and between the bright sky and the silver drabs of the sand stretched the low levels of a sea that had its customary greengrey touched for once with something of the sapphire glow of the mediterranean here and there were gay little umbrella tents or canvas shelters and a bather or so and pink and white wading children broke the dazzling edge of foam and i sought you with a kind of reluctance as though finding you would bring nearer the black irrational disaster that hung over us all  and when i found you at last you were all radiantly happy and healthy the prettiest of families and only your mother was touched with any gravity deeper than the joy of sunshine and sea you and mademoiselle potinin those days her ministrations were just beginningwere busy constructing a great seawall that should really and truly stop the advancing tide rachel two was a little apart making with infinite contentment an endless multitude of conical sand pies with her little tin pail margaret a pink inarticulate lump scrabbled in the warm sand under jessicas care your mother sat and watched youthoughtfully and before any of you knew that i was there my shadow fell across you all  you accepted my appearance when i ought to have been in italy with the unquestioning confidence with which you still take all my comings and goings for you italy america any place is just round the corner i was kissed with affection but haste and you got back to your sandworks as speedily as possible i inspected rachel twos moundsshe was giving them the names of her various aunts and unclesand patted the crowing margaret who ignored me rachel had sprung to her feet and kissed me and now hovered radiant over me as i caressed you youngsters it was all so warm so real that for an instant the dark threat that hung over us all vanished from my skies to return with the force of a blow  and what has brought you back said rachel i had expected a month of widowhood what can have brought you back  the dancing gladness in her eyes vanished swiftly as she waited for an answer to her question she caught the note of tragedy from my face why have you come back from italy she asked in an altered voice  rachel i said taking her arm with a desolating sense of the futility in my gesture of protection let us walk along the beach i want to tell you something something rather complicated  is there going to be war stephen she asked abruptly  it seemed then that this question which merely concerned the welfare of a hundred million people or so and pain destruction and disaster beyond measure was the most trivial of digressions  no i said i havent thought about the war  but i thoughtyou were thinking of nothing else  this has put it out of my head its something something disastrous to us  something has happened to our money  i wish that was all  then what is it her mind flashed out it has something to do with mary justin  how did you know that  i guessed  well it is you seein switzerland we met  you met  by accident she had been staying at the hotel on engstlen alp  you slept there cried rachel  i didnt know she was in the hotel until the next day  and then you came away  that day  but you talked together  yes  and for some reason you never told me stephen you never told me and you met but why is this disaster  because justin knows and he means to divorce herand it may be he will succeed  rachels face had become white for some time she said nothing then slowly and if he had not known and done thati should never have known  i had no answer to make to that it was true rachels face was very still and her eyes stared at the situation laid bare to her  when you began she choked presently when she wrotei knewi felt  she ceased for fear she might weep and for a time we walked in silence  i suppose she said desperately at last he will get his divorce  i am afraid he will  theres no evidenceyou didnt  no  and i never dreamt  then her passion tore at her stephen my dear she wept you didnt you didnt stephen indeed you didnt did you you kept faith with me as a husband should it was an accidenta real accidentand there was no planning for you to meet together it was as you say ive never doubted your word everive never doubted you  well at any rate i could answer that plainly and i did  and you know stephen she said i believe you and i cant believe you my heart is tormented why did you write to her why did you two write and go on writing and why did you tell me nothing of that meeting i believe you because i cant do anything but believe you it would kill me not to believe you in a thing that came so near to us and yet there it is like a knife being twisted in my heartthat you met should i have known of your meeting stephenever i know im talking badly for you but this thing strikes me suddenly out of this clear beautiful sky and the children thereso happy in the sunshine i was so happy so happy with you coming it will mean shames and lawcourts and newspapers losses of friends losses of money and freedom my mother and my people and you and all the work you do people will never forget it never forgive it they will say you promised if she had never written if she had kept to her bargain  we should still have met  stephen stephen you must bear with me  this is a thing i said that falls as you say out of the sky it seemed so naturalfor her to write and the meeting  it is like some tremendous disaster of nature i do not feel i have deserved it it isirrational but there it is little rachel of my heart and we have to face it whatever happens we have to go on it doesnt alter the work we have to do if it clips our wingswe have to hop along with clipped wings for youi wish it could spare you and sheshe too is a victim rachel  she need not have written said rachel she need not have written and then if you had met  she could not go on with that  it is so hard i said to ask you to be just to herand me i wish i could have come to you and married youwithout all that legacyof things remembered i was what i was one cant shake off a thing in ones blood and besidesbesides  i stopped helplessly   § 10  and then mary came herself to tell me there would be no divorce  she came to me unexpectedly i had returned to town that evening and next morning as i was sitting down in my study to answer some unimportant questions maxwell hartington had sent me my parlormaid appeared can you speak she asked to lady mary justin  i stood up to receive my visitor  she came in a tall dark figure and stood facing me in silence until the door had closed behind her her face was white and drawn and very grave she stooped a little i could see she had had no sleep never before had i seen her face marked by pain and she hesitated my dear i said why have you come to me  i put a chair for her and she sat down  for a moment she controlled herself with difficulty she put her hand over her eyes she seemed on the verge of bitter weeping  i came she said at last i came i had to come  to see you  i sat down in a chair beside her  it wasnt wise i said butnever mind you look so tired my dear  she sat quite still for a little while  then she moved her arm as though she felt for me blindly and i put my arms about her and drew her head to my shoulder and she wept  i knew she sobbed if i came to you  presently her weeping was over  get me a little cold water stephen she said let me have a little cold water on my face ive got my courage now again just theni was down too low yescold water because i want to tell youthings you will be glad to hear  you see stephen she saidand now all her selfpossession had returned there mustnt be a divorce ive thought it all out and there neednt be a divorce  neednt be  no  what do you mean  i can stop it  but how  i can stop it i can manage i can make a bargain its very sweet dear stephen to be here talking to you again  she stood up  sit at your desk my dear she said im all right now that water was good how good cold things can be sit down at your desk and let me sit here and then i will talk to you ive had such a time my dear ah  she paused and stuck her elbows on the desk and looked me in the eyes and suddenly that sweet frank smile of hers swept like sunshine across the wintry desolation of her face weve both been having a time she said this odd little worldits battered us with its fists for such a little and we were both so ridiculously happy do you remember it the rocks and the sunshine and all those twisted and tangled little plants and how the boat leaked and you baled it out and the parting and how you trudged up that winding path away from me a grey figure that stopped and waveda little figuresuch a virtuous figure and then this storm this awful hullabaloo lawyers curses threats and stella summersley satchel like a fury of denunciation what hatred that woman has hidden from me it must have accumulated its terrible to think stephen how much i must have tried her oh how far away those alps are now stephen like something in another life and here we areamong the consequences  butyou were saying we could stop the divorce  yes we can i can but i wanted to see youbefore i did somehow i dont feel lonely with you i had to see you its good to see you  she looked me in the face her tired eyes lit with a gleam of her former humor  have you thought she asked of all that will happen if there is a divorce  i mean to fight every bit of it  theyll beat you  well see that  but they will and then  why should one meet disaster half way  stephen she said what will happen to you when i am not here to make you look at things because i shant be here not within reach of you there are times when i feel like a mother to you never more than now  and then with rapid touches she began to picture the disaster before me she pictured the court and our ineffectual denials she made me realize the storm of hostility that was bound to burst over us and think of me she said stripped i shall be and outcast  not while i live  but what can you do for me you will have rachel how can you stand by me you cant be cruel to rachel you know you cant be cruel to rachel look me in the face stephen tell me yes then how can you stand by me  somehow i cried foolishly and stopped  theyll use me to break your back with costs and damages therell be those children of yours to think of  my god i cried aloud why do you torment me havent i thought enough of those things havent i seen the ruin and the shame the hopeless trap mens trust in me gone my work scattered and ended again my children growing up to hear this and that exaggeration of our story and you all the bravery of your life scattered and wasted the thing will pursue us all cling to us it will be all the rest of our lives for us  i covered my face with my hands  when i looked up her face was white and still and full of a strange tenderness i wouldnt have you stepheni wouldnt have you be cruel to rachel i just wanted to knowsomething but were wandering were talking nonsense because as i said there need be no divorce there will be no divorce at all thats what i came to tell you i shall have to payin a way stephen not impossibly dont think it is anything impossible  then she bit her lips and sat still  my dear i whispered if we had taken one another at the beginning  but she went on with her own thoughts  you love those little children of yours she said and that trusting girlwife of course you love them theyre yours oh theyre so deeplyyours yours  oh my dear dont torture me i do love them but i love you too  no she said not as you do them  i made a movement of protest  no she said whitely radiant with a serenity i had never seen before in her face you love me with your brain with your soul if you like i know my poor bleeding stephenarent those tears there dont mind my seeing them stephen poor dear poor dear you love them with your inmost heart why should you mind that i see you do all my life ive been wrong stephen and now i know too late its the things we own we love the things we buy with our lives always i have been hard ive been a little hard stephen my dear i loved you always i have loved you and always i have tried to keep myself its too late i dont know why i am talking like this but you see i can make a bargain nowits not an impossible bargainand save you and save your wife and save your children  but how i said still doubting  never mind how stephen dont ask me how now nothing very difficult easy but i shall write you no more letterssee youno more never and thats why i had to come you see why i was able to come to you just to see you and say goodbye to you and take leave of you dear love that i threw away and loved too late  she bit her lip and faced me there a sweet flushed living thing with a tear coursing down her cheek and her mouth now firm and steady  you can stop this divorce i said but how mary  no dont ask me how at a price its a bargain no no dont think thata bargain with justin but not degrading dont my dear let the thought of it distress you i have to give earnests never dear never through all the dusty rest of life again will you and i speak together never even if we come face to face once moreno word  mary i said what is it you have to do you speak as if what is it justin demands  no do not ask me that tell meyou see weve so much to talk about stephentell me of all you are going to do everything because ive got to make a great vow of renunciationof you not to think againnot even to think of you again no no im not even to look

everyone tell me stephenthat i want to believe thattremendously dont be modest now that will be cruel i want to believe that i am at last to do something that is worth doing something not fruitless  are you to go into seclusion i asked suddenly to be a nun  it is something like that she said very like that but i have promisedpracticallynot to tell you that tell me your soul stephen now give me something i may keep in my mind throughthrough all those years of waiting  but where i cried what years of waiting  in a lonely place my dearamong mountains high and away very beautiful but lonely a lake great rocks yeslike that place so odd i shall have so much time to think and i shall have no papersno news i mustnt talk to you of that dont let me talk to you of that i want to hear about this world this world i am going to leave and how you think you are going on fighting in the hot and dusty struggleto make the world cool and kind and reasonable to train minds better to broaden ideas  all those things you believe in all those things you believe in and stick toeven when they are dull now i am leaving it i begin to see how fine it isto fight as you want to fight a tiresome inglorious lifelong fight you really believe stephen   § 11  and then suddenly i read her purpose  mary i cried and stood up and laid my hand upon her arm tell me what is it you mean to do what do you mean to do  she looked up at me defensively and for a moment neither of us spoke  mary i said and could not say what was in my thoughts  you are wrong she lied at last  she stood up too and faced me i held her shoulder and looked into her eyes  the gong of my little clock broke the silence  i must go stephen she said i did not see how the time was slipping by  i began to entreat her and she to deny you dont understand she said you dont understand stepheni had hoped you would understand you see lifenot as i see it i wantedall sorts of splendid things and youbegin to argue you are shocked you refuse to understand no no take your hands off me stephen dear and let me go let me go  but i said stupid and persistent what are you going to do  ive told you stephen ive told you as much as i can tell you and you thinkthis foolish thing as though i could do that stephen if i promise will you let me go   § 12  my mind leaps from that to the moment in the afternoon when torn by intolerable distresses and anxiety i knocked and rang and again knocked at the door of the house she occupied in south street with the intention of making one last appeal to her to liveif indeed it was death she had in mind i had let her go from me and instantly a hundred neglected things had come into my head i could go away with her i could threaten to die with her it seemed to me that nothing in all the world mattered if only i could thrust back the dark hand of death to which she had so manifestly turned i knew i knew all along that her extorted promise would not bind her i knew and i let the faintest shadow of uncertainty weaken and restrain me and i went to her too late i saw instantly that i was too late when the door opened and showed me the scared face of a young footman whose eyes were red with tears  are you doctor he asked of my silence  i want i said i must speak to lady mary  he was wordless for a moment sheshe died sir he said shes died suddenly his face quivered he was blubbering he couldnt say anything more he stood snivelling in the doorway  for some moments i remained confronting him as if i would dispute his words some things the mind contests in the face of invincible conviction one wants to thrust back time     chapter the twelfth  the arraignment of jealousy   § 1  i sit here in this graciously proportioned little room which i shall leave for ever next week for already your mother begins to pack for england again i look out upon the neat french garden that i have watched the summer round and before me is the pile of manuscript that has grown here the story of my friendship and love for mary and of its tragic end and of all the changes of my beliefs and purposes that have arisen out of that i had meant it to be the story of my life but how little of my life is in it it gives at most certain acute points certain salient aspects i begin to realize for the first time how thin and suggestive and sketchy a thing any novel or biography must be how we must simplify how little can we convey the fullness of life the glittering interests the interweaving secondary aspects the dawns and dreams and double refractions of experience even mary of whom i have labored to tell you seems not so much expressed as hidden beneath these corrected sheets she who was so abundantly living who could love like a burst of sunshine and give herself as god gives the world is she here at all in this pile of industrious inexpert writing  life is so much fuller than any book can be all this story can be read i suppose in a couple of hours or so but i have been living and reflecting upon and reconsidering the substance of it for over forty years i do not see how this book can give you any impression but that of a career all strained upon the frame of one tragic relationship yet no life unless it is a very short young life can have that simplicity of all the many things i have found beautiful and wonderful mary was the most wonderful to me she is in my existence like a sunlit lake seen among mountains of all the edges by which life has wrought me she was the keenest nevertheless she was not all my life nor the form of all my life for a time after her death i could endure nothing of my home i could not bear the presence of your mother or you i hated the possibility of consolation i went away into italy and it was only by an enormous effort that i could resume my interest in that scheme of work to which my life is given but it is manifest i still live i live and work and feel and share beauty  it seems to me more and more as i live longer that most poetry and most literature and particularly the literature of the past is discordant with the vastness and variety the reserves and resources and recuperations of life as we live it today it is the expression of life under cruder and more rigid conditions than ours lived by people who loved and hated more naïvely aged sooner and died younger than we do solitary persons and single events dominated them as they do not dominate us we range wider last longer and escape more and more from intensity towards understanding and already this astounding blow begins to take its place among other events as a thing strange and terrible indeed but related to all the strangeness and mystery of life part of the universal mysteries of despair and futility and death that have troubled my consciousness since childhood for a time the death of mary obscured her life for me but now her living presence is more in my mind again i begin to see that it is the reality of her existence and not the accidents of her end that matter most it signifies less that she should have flung out of life when it seemed that her living could only have meant disaster to herself and to all she loved than that all her life should have been hampered and restricted through all her life this brave and fine and beautiful being was for the most part of her possibilities wasted in a splendid setting magnificently wasted if you will but wasted   § 2  it was that idea of waste that dominated my mind in a strange interview i had with justin for it became necessary for me to see justin in order that we should stamp out the whispers against her that followed her death he had made it seem an accidental death due to an overdose of the narcotic she employed but he had not been able to obliterate altogether the beginnings of his divorce proceedings there had been talk on the part of clerks and possible witnesses but of all that i need not tell you here what matters is that justin and i could meet without hatred or violence i met a justin greyhaired and it seemed to me physically shrunken more than ever slowspeaking with his habit of attentive silences more marked and that dark scar spread beyond his brows  we had come to our parting we had done our business with an affectation of emotional aloofness and then suddenly he gripped me by the arm stratton he said we two we killed her we tore her to pieces between us  i made no answer to this outbreak  we tore her to pieces he repeated its so damned silly one gets angrylike an animal  i became grotesquely anxious to assure him that indeed she and i had been as they say innocent throughout our last day together you were wrong in all that i said she kept her faith with you we never planned to meet and when we met if we had been brother and sister indeed there was nothing  i suppose he said i ought to be glad of that but now it doesnt seem to matter very much we killed her what does that matter to me now   § 3  and it is upon this effect of sweet and beautiful possibilities caught in the net of animal jealousies and thoughtless motives and ancient rigid institutions that i would end this writing in mary it seems to me i found both womanhood and fellowship i found what many have dreamt of love and friendship freely given and i could do nothing but clutch at her to make her my possession i would not permit her to live except as a part of my life i see her now and understand her better than when she was alive i recall things that she said and wrote and it is clear to me clearer perhaps than it ever was to her that she with her resentment at being in any sense property her selfreliant thought her independence of standard was the very prototype of that sisterlover who must replace the seductive and abject womanhood owned mastered and deceiving who waste the world today and she was owned she was mastered she was forced into concealment what alternative was there for her what alternative is there for any woman she might perhaps have kept her freedom by some illpaid work and at the price of every other impulse in her swift and eager nature she might have become one of those poor neuters an independent woman life was made impossible for her and she was forced to die according to the fate of all untimely things she was destroyed not merely by the unconsidered undisciplined passions of her husband and her lover but by the vast tradition that sustains and enforces the subjugation of her sex what i had from her and what she was is but a mere intimation of all that she and i might have made of each other and the world  and perhaps in this story i have said enough for you to understand why mary has identified herself with something worldwide has added to herself a symbolical value and why it is i find in the whole crowded spectacle of mankind a quality that is also hers a sense of fine things entangled and stifled and unable to free themselves from the ancient limiting jealousies which law and custom embody for i know that a growing multitude of men and women outwear the ancient ways the bloodstained organized jealousies of religious intolerance the delusions of nationality and cult and race that black hatred which simple people and young people and common people cherish against all that is not in the likeness of themselves cease to be the undisputed ruling forces of our collective life we want to emancipate our lives from this slavery and these stupidities from dull hatreds and suspicion the ripening mind of our race tires of these boorish and brutish and childish things a spirit that is like hers arises and increases in human affairs a spirit that demands freedom and gracious living as our inheritance too long deferred and i who loved her so blindly and narrowly now love her spirit with a dawning understanding  i will not be content with that compromise of jealousies which is the established life of humanity today i give myself and if i can i will give you to the destruction of jealousy and of the forms and shelters and instruments of jealousy both in my own self and in the thought and laws and usage of the world   the end
