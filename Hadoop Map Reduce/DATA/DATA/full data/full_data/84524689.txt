84524689	the cruise of the snark     chapter iforeword    it began in the swimming pool at glen ellen  between swims it was our wont to come out and lie in the sand and let our skins breathe the warm air and soak in the sunshine  roscoe was a yachtsman  i had followed the sea a bit  it was inevitable that we should talk about boats  we talked about small boats and the seaworthiness of small boats  we instanced captain slocum and his three years voyage around the world in the spray  we asserted that we were not afraid to go around the world in a small boat say forty feet long  we asserted furthermore that we would like to do it  we asserted finally that there was nothing in this world wed like better than a chance to do it  let us do it we said    in fun  then i asked charmian privily if shed really care to do it and she said that it was too good to be true  the next time we breathed our skins in the sand by the swimming pool i said to roscoe let us do it  i was in earnest and so was he for he said  when shall we start  i had a house to build on the ranch also an orchard a vineyard and several hedges to plant and a number of other things to do  we thought we would start in four or five years  then the lure of the adventure began to grip us  why not start at once  wed never be younger any of us  let the orchard vineyard and hedges be growing up while we were away  when we came back they would be ready for us and we could live in the barn while we built the house  so the trip was decided upon and the building of the snark began we named her the snark because we could not think of any other name this information is given for the benefit of those who otherwise might think there is something occult in the name  our friends cannot understand why we make this voyage  they shudder and moan and raise their hands  no amount of explanation can make them comprehend that we are moving along the line of least resistance that it is easier for us to go down to the sea in a small ship than to remain on dry land just as it is easier for them to remain on dry land than to go down to the sea in the small ship this state of mind comes of an undue prominence of the ego  they cannot get away from themselves  they cannot come out of themselves long enough to see that their line of least resistance is not necessarily everybody elses line of least resistance  they make of their own bundle of desires likes and dislikes a yardstick wherewith to measure the desires likes and dislikes of all creatures  this is unfair  i tell them so  but they cannot get away from their own miserable egos long enough to hear me  they think i am crazy  in return i am sympathetic  it is a state of mind familiar to me  we are all prone to think there is something wrong with the mental processes of the man who disagrees with us  the ultimate word is i like  it lies beneath philosophy and is twined about the heart of life  when philosophy has maundered ponderously for a month telling the individual what he must do the individual says in an instant i like and does something else and philosophy goes glimmering  it is i like that makes the drunkard drink and the martyr wear a hair shirt that makes one man a reveller and another man an anchorite that makes one man pursue fame another gold another love and another god  philosophy is very often a mans way of explaining his own i like  but to return to the snark and why i for one want to journey in her around the world  the things i like constitute my set of values  the thing i like most of all is personal achievementnot achievement for the worlds applause but achievement for my own delight  it is the old i did it  i did it  with my own hands i did it  but personal achievement with me must be concrete  id rather win a waterfight in the swimming pool or remain astride a horse that is trying to get out from under me than write the great american novel  each man to his liking  some other fellow would prefer writing the great american novel to winning the waterfight or mastering the horse  possibly the proudest achievement of my life my moment of highest living occurred when i was seventeen  i was in a threemasted schooner off the coast of japan  we were in a typhoon  all hands had been on deck most of the night  i was called from my bunk at seven in the morning to take the wheel  not a stitch of canvas was set  we were running before it under bare poles yet the schooner fairly tore along  the seas were all of an eighth of a mile apart and the wind snatched the whitecaps from their summits filling the air so thick with driving spray that it was impossible to see more than two waves at a time  the schooner was almost unmanageable rolling her rail under to starboard and to port veering and yawing anywhere between southeast and southwest and threatening when the huge seas lifted under her quarter to broach to  had she broached to she would ultimately have been reported lost with all hands and no tidings  i took the wheel  the sailingmaster watched me for a space  he was afraid of my youth feared that i lacked the strength and the nerve  but when he saw me successfully wrestle the schooner through several bouts he went below to breakfast  fore and aft all hands were below at breakfast  had she broached to not one of them would ever have reached the deck  for forty minutes i stood there alone at the wheel in my grasp the wildly careering schooner and the lives of twentytwo men  once we were pooped  i saw it coming and halfdrowned with tons of water crushing me i checked the schooners rush to broach to  at the end of the hour sweating and played out i was relieved  but i had done it  with my own hands i had done my trick at the wheel and guided a hundred tons of wood and iron through a few million tons of wind and waves  my delight was in that i had done itnot in the fact that twenty two men knew i had done it  within the year over half of them were dead and gone yet my pride in the thing performed was not diminished by half  i am willing to confess however that i do like a small audience  but it must be a very small audience composed of those who love me and whom i love  when i then accomplish personal achievement i have a feeling that i am justifying their love for me  but this is quite apart from the delight of the achievement itself  this delight is peculiarly my own and does not depend upon witnesses  when i have done some such thing i am exalted  i glow all over  i am aware of a pride in myself that is mine and mine alone  it is organic  every fibre of me is thrilling with it  it is very natural  it is a mere matter of satisfaction at adjustment to environment  it is success  life that lives is life successful and success is the breath of its nostrils  the achievement of a difficult feat is successful adjustment to a sternly exacting environment  the more difficult the feat the greater the satisfaction at its accomplishment  thus it is with the man who leaps forward from the springboard out over the swimming pool and with a backward halfrevolution of the body enters the water head first  once he leaves the springboard his environment becomes immediately savage and savage the penalty it will exact should he fail and strike the water flat  of course the man does not have to run the risk of the penalty  he could remain on the bank in a sweet and placid environment of summer air sunshine and stability  only he is not made that way  in that swift midair moment he lives as he could never live on the bank  as for myself id rather be that man than the fellows who sit on the bank and watch him  that is why i am building the snark  i am so made  i like that is all  the trip around the world means big moments of living  bear with me a moment and look at it  here am i a little animal called a mana bit of vitalized matter one hundred and sixtyfive pounds of meat and blood nerve sinew bones and brainall of it soft and tender susceptible to hurt fallible and frail  i strike a light backhanded blow on the nose of an obstreperous horse and a bone in my hand is broken  i put my head under the water for five minutes and i am drowned  i fall twenty feet through the air and i am smashed  i am a creature of temperature  a few degrees one way and my fingers and ears and toes blacken and drop off  a few degrees the other way and my skin blisters and shrivels away from the raw quivering flesh  a few additional degrees either way and the life and the light in me go out  a drop of poison injected into my body from a snake and i cease to movefor ever i cease to move  a splinter of lead from a rifle enters my head and i am wrapped around in the eternal blackness  fallible and frail a bit of pulsating jellylike lifeit is all i am  about me are the great natural forcescolossal menaces titans of destruction unsentimental monsters that have less concern for me than i have for the grain of sand i crush under my foot  they have no concern at all for me  they do not know me  they are unconscious unmerciful and unmoral  they are the cyclones and tornadoes lightning flashes and cloudbursts tiderips and tidal waves undertows and waterspouts great whirls and sucks and eddies earthquakes and volcanoes surfs that thunder on rockribbed coasts and seas that leap aboard the largest crafts that float crushing humans to pulp or licking them off into the sea and to deathand these insensate monsters do not know that tiny sensitive creature all nerves and weaknesses whom men call jack london and who himself thinks he is all right and quite a superior being  in the maze and chaos of the conflict of these vast and draughty titans it is for me to thread my precarious way  the bit of life that is i will exult over them  the bit of life that is i in so far as it succeeds in baffling them or in bitting them to its service will imagine that it is godlike  it is good to ride the tempest and feel godlike  i dare to assert that for a finite speck of pulsating jelly to feel godlike is a far more glorious feeling than for a god to feel godlike  here is the sea the wind and the wave  here are the seas the winds and the waves of all the world  here is ferocious environment  and here is difficult adjustment the achievement of which is delight to the small quivering vanity that is i  i like i am so made  it is my own particular form of vanity that is all  there is also another side to the voyage of the snark  being alive i want to see and all the world is a bigger thing to see than one small town or valley  we have done little outlining of the voyage only one thing is definite and that is that our first port of call will be honolulu  beyond a few general ideas we have no thought of our next port after hawaii  we shall make up our minds as we get nearer in a general way we know that we shall wander through the south seas take in samoa new zealand tasmania australia new guinea borneo and sumatra and go on up through the philippines to japan  then will come korea china india the red sea and the mediterranean  after that the voyage becomes too vague to describe though we know a number of things we shall surely do and we expect to spend from one to several months in every country in europe  the snark is to be sailed  there will be a gasolene engine on board but it will be used only in case of emergency such as in bad water among reefs and shoals where a sudden calm in a swift current leaves a sailingboat helpless  the rig of the snark is to be what is called the ketch  the ketch rig is a compromise between the yawl and the schooner  of late years the yawl rig has proved the best for cruising  the ketch retains the cruising virtues of the yawl and in addition manages to embrace a few of the sailing virtues of the schooner  the foregoing must be taken with a pinch of salt  it is all theory in my head  ive never sailed a ketch nor even seen one  the theory commends itself to me  wait till i get out on the ocean then ill be able to tell more about the cruising and sailing qualities of the ketch  as originally planned the snark was to be forty feet long on the waterline  but we discovered there was no space for a bathroom and for that reason we have increased her length to fortyfive feet her greatest beam is fifteen feet  she has no house and no hold there is six feet of headroom and the deck is unbroken save for two companionways and a hatch forard  the fact that there is no house to break the strength of the deck will make us feel safer in case great seas thunder their tons of water down on board  a large and roomy cockpit sunk beneath the deck with high rail and self bailing will make our roughweather days and nights more comfortable  there will be no crew  or rather charmian roscoe and i are the crew  we are going to do the thing with our own hands  with our own hands were going to circumnavigate the globe  sail her or sink her with our own hands well do it  of course there will be a cook and a cabinboy  why should we stew over a stove wash dishes and set the table  we could stay on land if we wanted to do those things  besides weve got to stand watch and work the ship  and also ive got to work at my trade of writing in order to feed us and to get new sails and tackle and keep the snark in efficient working order  and then theres the ranch ive got to keep the vineyard orchard and hedges growing  when we increased the length of the snark in order to get space for a bathroom we found that all the space was not required by the bathroom  because of this we increased the size of the engine seventy horsepower our engine is and since we expect it to drive us along at a nineknot clip we do not know the name of a river with a current swift enough to defy us  we expect to do a lot of inland work  the smallness of the snark makes this possible  when we enter the land out go the masts and on goes the engine  there are the canals of china and the yangtse river  we shall spend months on them if we can get permission from the government  that will be the one obstacle to our inland voyaginggovernmental permission  but if we can get that permission there is scarcely a limit to the inland voyaging we can do  when we come to the nile why we can go up the nile  we can go up the danube to vienna up the thames to london and we can go up the seine to paris and moor opposite the latin quarter with a bowline out to notre dame and a sternline fast to the morgue  we can leave the mediterranean and go up the rhone to lyons there enter the saone cross from the saone to the maine through the canal de bourgogne and from the marne enter the seine and go out the seine at havre  when we cross the atlantic to the united states we can go up the hudson pass through the erie canal cross the great lakes leave lake michigan at chicago gain the mississippi by way of the illinois river and the connecting canal and go down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico  and then there are the great rivers of south america  well know something about geography when we get back to california  people that build houses are often sore perplexed but if they enjoy the strain of it ill advise them to build a boat like the snark just consider for a moment the strain of detail  take the engine what is the best kind of enginethe two cycle three cycle four cycle  my lips are mutilated with all kinds of strange jargon my mind is mutilated with still stranger ideas and is footsore and weary from travelling in new and rocky realms of thoughtignition methods shall it be makeandbreak or jumpspark  shall dry cells or storage batteries be used  a storage battery commends itself but it requires a dynamo  how powerful a dynamo  and when we have installed a dynamo and a storage battery it is simply ridiculous not to light the boat with electricity  then comes the discussion of how many lights and how many candlepower  it is a splendid idea  but electric lights will demand a more powerful storage battery which in turn demands a more powerful dynamo  and now that weve gone in for it why not have a searchlight  it would be tremendously useful  but the searchlight needs so much electricity that when it runs it will put all the other lights out of commission  again we travel the weary road in the quest after more power for storage battery and dynamo  and then when it is finally solved some one asks what if the engine breaks down and we collapse  there are the sidelights the binnacle light and the anchor light  our very lives depend upon them  so we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well  but we are not done with that engine yet  the engine is powerful we are two small men and a small woman  it will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand  let the engine do it  and then comes the problem of how to convey power forard from the engine to the winch  and by the time all this is settled we redistribute the allotments of space to the engineroom galley bathroom staterooms and cabin and begin all over again  and when we have shifted the engine i send off a telegram of gibberish to its makers at new york something like this  togglejoint abandoned change thrustbearing accordingly distance from forward side of flywheel to face of stern post sixteen feet six inches  just potter around in quest of the best steering gear or try to decide whether you will set up your rigging with oldfashioned lanyards or with turnbuckles if you want strain of detail  shall the binnacle be located in front of the wheel in the centre of the beam or shall it be located to one side in front of the wheel theres room right there for a library of seadog controversy  then theres the problem of gasolene fifteen hundred gallons of itwhat are the safest ways to tank it and pipe it and which is the best fireextinguisher for a gasolene fire  then there is the pretty problem of the lifeboat and the stowage of the same  and when that is finished come the cook and cabinboy to confront one with nightmare possibilities  it is a small boat and well be packed close together  the servantgirl problem of landsmen pales to insignificance  we did select one cabinboy and by that much were our troubles eased  and then the cabinboy fell in love and resigned  and in the meanwhile how is a fellow to find time to study navigationwhen he is divided between these problems and the earning of the money wherewith to settle the problems  neither roscoe nor i know anything about navigation and the summer is gone and we are about to start and the problems are thicker than ever and the treasury is stuffed with emptiness  well anyway it takes years to learn seamanship and both of us are seamen  if we dont find the time well lay in the books and instruments and teach ourselves navigation on the ocean between san francisco and hawaii  there is one unfortunate and perplexing phase of the voyage of the snark  roscoe who is to be my conavigator is a follower of one cyrus r teed  now cyrus r teed has a different cosmology from the one generally accepted and roscoe shares his views  wherefore roscoe believes that the surface of the earth is concave and that we live on the inside of a hollow sphere  thus though we shall sail on the one boat the snark roscoe will journey around the world on the inside while i shall journey around on the outside  but of this more anon  we threaten to be of the one mind before the voyage is completed  i am confident that i shall convert him into making the journey on the outside while he is equally confident that before we arrive back in san francisco i shall be on the inside of the earth  how he is going to get me through the crust i dont know but roscoe is ay a masterful man   psthat engine  while weve got it and the dynamo and the storage battery why not have an icemachine  ice in the tropics it is more necessary than bread  here goes for the icemachine now i am plunged into chemistry and my lips hurt and my mind hurts and how am i ever to find the time to study navigation    chapter iithe inconceivable and monstrous    spare no money i said to roscoe  let everything on the snark be of the best  and never mind decoration  plain pine boards is good enough finishing for me  but put the money into the construction let the snark be as staunch and strong as any boat afloat  never mind what it costs to make her staunch and strong you see that she is made staunch and strong and ill go on writing and earning the money to pay for it  and i did    as well as i could for the snark ate up money faster than i could earn it  in fact every little while i had to borrow money with which to supplement my earnings  now i borrowed one thousand dollars now i borrowed two thousand dollars and now i borrowed five thousand dollars  and all the time i went on working every day and sinking the earnings in the venture  i worked sundays as well and i took no holidays  but it was worth it  every time i thought of the snark i knew she was worth it  for know gentle reader the staunchness of the snark  she is fortyfive feet long on the waterline  her garboard strake is three inches thick her planking two and onehalf inches thick her deck planking two inches thick and in all her planking there are no butts  i know for i ordered that planking especially from puget sound  then the snark has four watertight compartments which is to say that her length is broken by three watertight bulkheads thus no matter how large a leak the snark may spring only one compartment can fill with water  the other three compartments will keep her afloat anyway and besides will enable us to mend the leak  there is another virtue in these bulkheads  the last compartment of all in the very stern contains six tanks that carry over one thousand gallons of gasolene  now gasolene is a very dangerous article to carry in bulk on a small craft far out on the wide ocean  but when the six tanks that do not leak are themselves contained in a compartment hermetically sealed off from the rest of the boat the danger will be seen to be very small indeed  the snark is a sailboat  she was built primarily to sail  but incidentally as an auxiliary a seventyhorsepower engine was installed  this is a good strong engine  i ought to know  i paid for it to come out all the way from new york city  then on deck above the engine is a windlass  it is a magnificent affair  it weighs several hundred pounds and takes up no end of deckroom  you see it is ridiculous to hoist up anchor by handpower when there is a seventyhorsepower engine on board  so we installed the windlass transmitting power to it from the engine by means of a gear and castings specially made in a san francisco foundry  the snark was made for comfort and no expense was spared in this regard  there is the bathroom for instance small and compact it is true but containing all the conveniences of any bathroom upon land  the bathroom is a beautiful dream of schemes and devices pumps and levers and seavalves  why in the course of its building i used to lie awake nights thinking about that bathroom and next to the bathroom come the lifeboat and the launch  they are carried on deck and they take up what little space might have been left us for exercise  but then they beat life insurance and the prudent man even if he has built as staunch and strong a craft as the snark will see to it that he has a good lifeboat as well and ours is a good one  it is a dandy  it was stipulated to cost one hundred and fifty dollars and when i came to pay the bill it turned out to be three hundred and ninetyfive dollars  that shows how good a lifeboat it is  i could go on at great length relating the various virtues and excellences of the snark but i refrain  i have bragged enough as it is and i have bragged to a purpose as will be seen before my tale is ended  and please remember its title the inconceivable and monstrous  it was planned that the snark should sail on october 1 1906  that she did not so sail was inconceivable and monstrous  there was no valid reason for not sailing except that she was not ready to sail and there was no conceivable reason why she was not ready  she was promised on november first on november fifteenth on december first and yet she was never ready  on december first charmian and i left the sweet clean sonoma country and came down to live in the stifling citybut not for long oh no only for two weeks for we would sail on december fifteenth and i guess we ought to know for roscoe said so and it was on his advice that we came to the city to stay two weeks  alas the two weeks went by four weeks went by six weeks went by eight weeks went by and we were farther away from sailing than ever  explain it  whome  i cant  it is the one thing in all my life that i have backed down on  there is no explaining it if there were id do it  i who am an artisan of speech confess my inability to explain why the snark was not ready  as i have said and as i must repeat it was inconceivable and monstrous  the eight weeks became sixteen weeks and then one day roscoe cheered us up by saying  if we dont sail before april first you can use my head for a football  two weeks later he said im getting my head in training for that match  never mind charmian and i said to each other think of the wonderful boat it is going to be when it is completed  whereat we would rehearse for our mutual encouragement the manifold virtues and excellences of the snark  also i would borrow more money and i would get down closer to my desk and write harder and i refused heroically to take a sunday off and go out into the hills with my friends  i was building a boat and by the eternal it was going to be a boat and a boat spelled out all in capitalsboa t and no matter what it cost i didnt care  so long as it was a boat  and oh there is one other excellence of the snark upon which i must brag namely her bow  no sea could ever come over it  it laughs at the sea that bow does it challenges the sea it snorts defiance at the sea  and withal it is a beautiful bow the lines of it are dreamlike i doubt if ever a boat was blessed with a more beautiful and at the same time a more capable bow  it was made to punch storms  to touch that bow is to rest ones hand on the cosmic nose of things  to look at it is to realize that expense cut no figure where it was concerned  and every time our sailing was delayed or a new expense was tacked on we thought of that wonderful bow and were content  the snark is a small boat  when i figured seven thousand dollars as her generous cost i was both generous and correct  i have built barns and houses and i know the peculiar trait such things have of running past their estimated cost  this knowledge was mine was already mine when i estimated the probable cost of the building of the snark at seven thousand dollars  well she cost thirty thousand  now dont ask me please  it is the truth  i signed the cheques and i raised the money  of course there is no explaining it inconceivable and monstrous is what it is as you will agree i know ere my tale is done  then there was the matter of delay  i dealt with fortyseven different kinds of union men and with one hundred and fifteen different firms  and not one union man and not one firm of all the union men and all the firms ever delivered anything at the time agreed upon nor ever was on time for anything except payday and billcollection  men pledged me their immortal souls that they would deliver a certain thing on a certain date as a rule after such pledging they rarely exceeded being three months late in delivery  and so it went and charmian and i consoled each other by saying what a splendid boat the snark was so staunch and strong also we would get into the small boat and row around the snark and gloat over her unbelievably wonderful bow  think i would say to charmian of a gale off the china coast and of the snark hove to that splendid bow of hers driving into the storm  not a drop will come over that bow  shell be as dry as a feather and well be all below playing whist while the gale howls  and charmian would press my hand enthusiastically and exclaim its worth every bit of itthe delay and expense and worry and all the rest  oh what a truly wonderful boat  whenever i looked at the bow of the snark or thought of her water tight compartments i was encouraged  nobody else however was encouraged  my friends began to make bets against the various sailing dates of the snark  mr wiget who was left behind in charge of our sonoma ranch was the first to cash his bet  he collected on new years day 1907  after that the bets came fast and furious  my friends surrounded me like a gang of harpies making bets against every sailing date i set  i was rash and i was stubborn  i bet and i bet and i continued to bet and i paid them all  why the womenkind of my friends grew so brave that those among them who never bet before began to bet with me  and i paid them too  never mind said charmian to me just think of that bow and of being hove to on the china seas  you see i said to my friends when i paid the latest bunch of wagers neither trouble nor cash is being spared in making the snark the most seaworthy craft that ever sailed out through the golden gatethat is what causes all the delay  in the meantime editors and publishers with whom i had contracts pestered me with demands for explanations  but how could i explain to them when i was unable to explain to myself or when there was nobody not even roscoe to explain to me  the newspapers began to laugh at me and to publish rhymes anent the snarks departure with refrains like not yet but soon  and charmian cheered me up by reminding me of the bow and i went to a banker and borrowed five thousand more  there was one recompense for the delay however  a friend of mine who happens to be a critic wrote a roast of me of all i had done and of all i ever was going to do and he planned to have it published after i was out on the ocean  i was still on shore when it came out and he has been busy explaining ever since  and the time continued to go by  one thing was becoming apparent namely that it was impossible to finish the snark in san francisco she had been so long in the building that she was beginning to break down and wear out  in fact she had reached the stage where she was breaking down faster than she could be repaired  she had become a joke  nobody took her seriously least of all the men who worked on her  i said we would sail just as she was and finish building her in honolulu  promptly she sprang a leak that had to be attended to before we could sail  i started her for the boatways  before she got to them she was caught between two huge barges and received a vigorous crushing  we got her on the ways and part way along the ways spread and dropped her through sternfirst into the mud  it was a pretty tangle a job for wreckers not boatbuilders there are two high tides every twentyfour hours and at every high tide night and day for a week there were two steam tugs pulling and hauling on the snark  there she was stuck fallen between the ways and standing on her stern  next and while still in that predicament we started to use the gears and castings made in the local foundry whereby power was conveyed from the engine to the windlass  it was the first time we ever tried to use that windlass the castings had flaws they shattered asunder the gears ground together and the windlass was out of commission  following upon that the seventyhorsepower engine went out of commission  this engine came from new york so did its bedplate there was a flaw in the bedplate there were a lot of flaws in the bedplate and the seventyhorsepower engine broke away from its shattered foundations reared up in the air smashed all connections and fastenings and fell over on its side  and the snark continued to stick between the spread ways and the two tugs continued to haul vainly upon her  never mind said charmian think of what a staunch strong boat she is  yes said i and of that beautiful bow  so we took heart and went at it again  the ruined engine was lashed down on its rotten foundation the smashed castings and cogs of the power transmission were taken down and stored awayall for the purpose of taking them to honolulu where repairs and new castings could be made  somewhere in the dim past the snark had received on the outside one coat of white paint  the intention of the colour was still evident however when one got it in the right light  the snark had never received any paint on the inside  on the contrary she was coated inches thick with the grease and tobaccojuice of the multitudinous mechanics who had toiled upon her  never mind we said the grease and filth could be planed off and later when we fetched honolulu the snark could be painted at the same time as she was being rebuilt  by main strength and sweat we dragged the snark off from the wrecked ways and laid her alongside the oakland city wharf  the drays brought all the outfit from home the books and blankets and personal luggage  along with this everything else came on board in a torrent of confusionwood and coal water and watertanks vegetables provisions oil the lifeboat and the launch all our friends all the friends of our friends and those who claimed to be their friends to say nothing of some of the friends of the friends of the friends of our crew  also there were reporters and photographers and strangers and cranks and finally and over all clouds of coaldust from the wharf  we were to sail sunday at eleven and saturday afternoon had arrived  the crowd on the wharf and the coaldust were thicker than ever  in one pocket i carried a chequebook a fountainpen a dater and a blotter in another pocket i carried between one and two thousand dollars in paper money and gold  i was ready for the creditors cash for the small ones and cheques for the large ones and was waiting only for roscoe to arrive with the balances of the accounts of the hundred and fifteen firms who had delayed me so many months  and then   and then the inconceivable and monstrous happened once more  before roscoe could arrive there arrived another man  he was a united states marshal  he tacked a notice on the snarks brave mast so that all on the wharf could read that the snark had been libelled for debt  the marshal left a little old man in charge of the snark and himself went away  i had no longer any control of the snark nor of her wonderful bow  the little old man was now her lord and master and i learned that i was paying him three dollars a day for being lord and master  also i learned the name of the man who had libelled the snark  it was sellers the debt was two hundred and thirtytwo dollars and the deed was no more than was to be expected from the possessor of such a name  sellers  ye gods  sellers  but who under the sun was sellers  i looked in my chequebook and saw that two weeks before i had made him out a cheque for five hundred dollars  other chequebooks showed me that during the many months of the building of the snark i had paid him several thousand dollars  then why in the name of common decency hadnt he tried to collect his miserable little balance instead of libelling the snark i thrust my hands into my pockets and in one pocket encountered the chequehook and the dater and the pen and in the other pocket the gold money and the paper money  there was the wherewithal to settle his pitiful account a few score of times and overwhy hadnt he given me a chance  there was no explanation it was merely the inconceivable and monstrous  to make the matter worse the snark had been libelled late saturday afternoon and though i sent lawyers and agents all over oakland and san francisco neither united states judge nor united states marshal nor mr sellers nor mr sellers attorney nor anybody could be found  they were all out of town for the weekend  and so the snark did not sail sunday morning at eleven  the little old man was still in charge and he said no  and charmian and i walked out on an opposite wharf and took consolation in the snarks wonderful bow and thought of all the gales and typhoons it would proudly punch  a bourgeois trick i said to charmian speaking of mr sellers and his libel a petty traders panic  but never mind our troubles will cease when once we are away from this and out on the wide ocean  and in the end we sailed away on tuesday morning april 23 1907 we started rather lame i confess  we had to hoist anchor by hand because the power transmission was a wreck  also what remained of our seventyhorsepower engine was lashed down for ballast on the bottom of the snark  but what of such things  they could be fixed in honolulu and in the meantime think of the magnificent rest of the boat  it is true the engine in the launch wouldnt run and the lifeboat leaked like a sieve but then they werent the snark they were mere appurtenances  the things that counted were the watertight bulkheads the solid planking without butts the bath room devicesthey were the snark  and then there was greatest of all that noble windpunching bow  we sailed out through the golden gate and set our course south toward that part of the pacific where we could hope to pick up with the northeast trades  and right away things began to happen  i had calculated that youth was the stuff for a voyage like that of the snark and i had taken three youthsthe engineer the cook and the cabinboy  my calculation was only twothirds off i had forgotten to calculate on seasick youth and i had two of them the cook and the cabin boy  they immediately took to their bunks and that was the end of their usefulness for a week to come  it will be understood from the foregoing that we did not have the hot meals we might have had nor were things kept clean and orderly down below  but it did not matter very much anyway for we quickly discovered that our box of oranges had at some time been frozen that our box of apples was mushy and spoiling that the crate of cabbages spoiled before it was ever delivered to us had to go overboard instanter that kerosene had been spilled on the carrots and that the turnips were woody and the beets rotten while the kindling was dead wood that wouldnt burn and the coal delivered in rotten potatosacks had spilled all over the deck and was washing through the scuppers  but what did it matter  such things were mere accessories  there was the boatshe was all right wasnt she  i strolled along the deck and in one minute counted fourteen butts in the beautiful planking ordered specially from puget sound in order that there should be no butts in it  also that deck leaked and it leaked badly  it drowned roscoe out of his bunk and ruined the tools in the engineroom to say nothing of the provisions it ruined in the galley  also the sides of the snark leaked and the bottom leaked and we had to pump her every day to keep her afloat  the floor of the galley is a couple of feet above the inside bottom of the snark and yet i have stood on the floor of the galley trying to snatch a cold bite and been wet to the knees by the water churning around inside four hours after the last pumping  then those magnificent watertight compartments that cost so much time and moneywell they werent watertight after all  the water moved free as the air from one compartment to another furthermore a strong smell of gasolene from the after compartment leads me to suspect that some one or more of the halfdozen tanks there stored have sprung a leak  the tanks leak and they are not hermetically sealed in their compartment  then there was the bathroom with its pumps and levers and seavalvesit went out of commission inside the first twenty hours  powerful iron levers broke off short in ones hand when one tried to pump with them  the bathroom was the swiftest wreck of any portion of the snark  and the ironwork on the snark no matter what its source proved to be mush  for instance the bedplate of the engine came from new york and it was mush so were the casting and gears for the windlass that came from san francisco  and finally there was the wrought iron used in the rigging that carried away in all directions when the first strains were put upon it  wrought iron mind you and it snapped like macaroni  a gooseneck on the gaff of the mainsail broke short off  we replaced it with the gooseneck from the gaff of the storm trysail and the second gooseneck broke short off inside fifteen minutes of use and mind you it had been taken from the gaff of the storm trysail upon which we would have depended in time of storm  at the present moment the snark trails her mainsail like a broken wing the gooseneck being replaced by a rough lashing  well see if we can get honest iron in honolulu  man had betrayed us and sent us to sea in a sieve but the lord must have loved us for we had calm weather in which to learn that we must pump every day in order to keep afloat and that more trust could be placed in a wooden toothpick than in the most massive piece of iron to be found aboard  as the staunchness and the strength of the snark went glimmering charmian and i pinned our faith more and more to the snarks wonderful bow  there was nothing else left to pin to  it was all inconceivable and monstrous we knew but that bow at least was rational  and then one evening we started to heave to  how shall i describe it  first of all for the benefit of the tyro let me explain that heaving to is that sea manoeuvre which by means of short and balanced canvas compels a vessel to ride bowon to wind and sea  when the wind is too strong or the sea is too high a vessel of the size of the snark can heave to with ease whereupon there is no more work to do on deck  nobody needs to steer  the lookout is superfluous  all hands can go below and sleep or play whist  well it was blowing half of a small summer gale when i told roscoe wed heave to  night was coming on  i had been steering nearly all day and all hands on deck roscoe and bert and charmian were tired while all hands below were seasick  it happened that we had already put two reefs in the big mainsail  the flyingjib and the jib were taken in and a reef put in the forestaysail  the mizzen was also taken in  about this time the flying jibboom buried itself in a sea and broke short off  i started to put the wheel down in order to heave to  the snark at the moment was rolling in the trough  she continued rolling in the trough  i put the spokes down harder and harder  she never budged from the trough  the trough gentle reader is the most dangerous position all in which to lay a vessel  i put the wheel hard down and still the snark rolled in the trough  eight points was the nearest i could get her to the wind  i had roscoe and bert come in on the mainsheet  the snark rolled on in the trough now putting her rail under on one side and now under on the other side  again the inconceivable and monstrous was showing its grizzly head it was grotesque impossible  i refused to believe it  under doublereefed mainsail and singlereefed staysail the snark refused to heave to  we flattened the mainsail down  it did not alter the snarks course a tenth of a degree  we slacked the mainsail off with no more result  we set a storm trysail on the mizzen and took in the mainsail  no change  the snark roiled on in the trough that beautiful bow of hers refused to come up and face the wind  next we took in the reefed staysail  thus the only bit of canvas left on her was the storm trysail on the mizzen  if anything would bring her bow up to the wind that would  maybe you wont believe me when i say it failed but i do say it failed  and i say it failed because i saw it fail and not because i believe it failed i dont believe it did fail  it is unbelievable and i am not telling you what i believe i am telling you what i saw  now gentle reader what would you do if you were on a small boat rolling in the trough of the sea a trysail on that small boats stern that was unable to swing the bow up into the wind  get out the seaanchor  its just what we did  we had a patent one made to order and warranted not to dive  imagine a hoop of steel that serves to keep open the mouth of a large conical canvas bag and you have a seaanchor  well we made a line fast to the seaanchor and to the bow of the snark and then dropped the seaanchor overboard  it promptly dived  we had a tripping line on it so we tripped the seaanchor and hauled it in  we attached a big timber as a float and dropped the seaanchor over again  this time it floated  the line to the bow grew taut  the trysail on the mizzen tended to swing the bow into the wind but in spite of this tendency the snark calmly took that seaanchor in her teeth and went on ahead dragging it after her still in the trough of the sea  and there you are  we even took in the trysail hoisted the full mizzen in its place and hauled the full mizzen down flat and the snark wallowed in the trough and dragged the seaanchor behind her  dont believe me  i dont believe it myself  i am merely telling you what i saw  now i leave it to you  who ever heard of a sailingboat that wouldnt heave tothat wouldnt heave to with a seaanchor to help it  out of my brief experience with boats i know i never did  and i stood on deck and looked on the naked face of the inconceivable and monstrousthe snark that wouldnt heave to  a stormy night with broken moonlight had come on  there was a splash of wet in the air and up to windward there was a promise of rainsqualls and then there was the trough of the sea cold and cruel in the moonlight in which the snark complacently rolled  and then we took in the seaanchor and the mizzen hoisted the reefed staysail ran the snark off before it and went belownot to the hot meal that should have awaited us but to skate across the slush and slime on the cabin floor where cook and cabinboy lay like dead men in their bunks and to lie down in our own bunks with our clothes on ready for a call and to listen to the bilgewater spouting kneehigh on the galley floor  in the bohemian club of san francisco there are some crack sailors i know because i heard them pass judgment on the snark during the process of her building  they found only one vital thing the matter with her and on this they were all agreed namely that she could not run  she was all right in every particular they said except that id never be able to run her before it in a stiff wind and sea her lines they explained enigmatically it is the fault of her lines  she simply cannot be made to run that is all  well i wish id only had those crack sailors of the bohemian club on board the snark the other night for them to see for themselves their one vital unanimous judgment absolutely reversed  run  it is the one thing the snark does to perfection  run  she ran with a seaanchor fast forard and a full mizzen flattened down aft  run  at the present moment as i write this we are bowling along before it at a sixknot clip in the northeast trades  quite a tidy bit of sea is running  there is nobody at the wheel the wheel is not even lashed and is set over a halfspoke weather helm  to be precise the wind is northeast the snarks mizzen is furled her mainsail is over to starboard her headsheets are hauled flat  and the snarks course is southsouthwest  and yet there are men who have sailed the seas for forty years and who hold that no boat can run before it without being steered  theyll call me a liar when they read this its what they called captain slocum when he said the same of his spray  as regards the future of the snark im all at sea  i dont know if i had the money or the credit id build another snark that would heave to  but i am at the end of my resources  ive got to put up with the present snark or quitand i cant quit  so i guess ill have to try to get along with heaving the snark to stern first  i am waiting for the next gale to see how it will work  i think it can be done  it all depends on how her stern takes the seas  and who knows but that some wild morning on the china sea some gray beard skipper will stare rub his incredulous eyes and stare again at the spectacle of a weird small craft very much like the snark hove to sternfirst and riding out the gale  ps  on my return to california after the voyage i learned that the snark was fortythree feet on the waterline instead of forty five  this was due to the fact that the builder was not on speaking terms with the tapeline or twofoot rule    chapter iiiadventure    no adventure is not dead and in spite of the steam engine and of thomas cook  son  when the announcement of the contemplated voyage of the snark was made young men of roving disposition proved to be legion and young women as wellto say nothing of the elderly men and women who volunteered for the voyage  why among my personal friends there were at least half a dozen who regretted their recent or imminent marriages and there was one marriage i know of that almost failed to come off because of the snark   every mail to me was burdened with the letters of applicants who were suffocating in the manstifled towns and it soon dawned upon me that a twentieth century ulysses required a corps of stenographers to clear his correspondence before setting sail  no adventure is certainly not deadnot while one receives letters that begin  there is no doubt that when you read this soulplea from a female stranger in new york city etc and wherein one learns a little farther on that this female stranger weighs only ninety pounds wants to be cabinboy and yearns to see the countries of the world  the possession of a passionate fondness for geography was the way one applicant expressed the wanderlust that was in him while another wrote i am cursed with an eternal yearning to be always on the move consequently this letter to you  but best of all was the fellow who said he wanted to come because his feet itched  there were a few who wrote anonymously suggesting names of friends and giving said friends qualifications but to me there was a hint of something sinister in such proceedings and i went no further in the matter  with two or three exceptions all the hundreds that volunteered for my crew were very much in earnest  many of them sent their photographs  ninety per cent offered to work in any capacity and ninetynine per cent offered to work without salary contemplating your voyage on the snark said one and notwithstanding its attendant dangers to accompany you in any capacity whatever would be the climax of my ambitions  which reminds me of the young fellow who was seventeen years old and ambicious and who at the end of his letter earnestly requested but please do not let this git into the papers or magazines quite different was the one who said i would be willing to work like hell and not demand pay  almost all of them wanted me to telegraph at their expense my acceptance of their services and quite a number offered to put up a bond to guarantee their appearance on sailing date  some were rather vague in their own minds concerning the work to be done on the snark as for instance the one who wrote  i am taking the liberty of writing you this note to find out if there would be any possibility of my going with you as one of the crew of your boat to make sketches and illustrations  several unaware of the needful work on a small craft like the snark offered to serve as one of them phrased it as assistant in filing materials collected for books and novels  thats what one gets for being prolific  let me give my qualifications for the job wrote one  i am an orphan living with my uncle who is a hot revolutionary socialist and who says a man without the red blood of adventure is an animated dishrag  said another  i can swim some though i dont know any of the new strokes  but what is more important than strokes the water is a friend of mine  if i was put alone in a sailboat i could get her anywhere i wanted to go was the qualification of a thirdand a better qualification than the one that follows i have also watched the fishboats unload  but possibly the prize should go to this one who very subtly conveys his deep knowledge of the world and life by saying  my age in years is twentytwo  then there were the simple straightout homely and unadorned letters of young boys lacking in the felicities of expression it is true but desiring greatly to make the voyage  these were the hardest of all to decline and each time i declined one it seemed as if i had struck youth a slap in the face  they were so earnest these boys they wanted so much to go  i am sixteen but large for my age said one and another seventeen but large and healthy i am as strong at least as the average boy of my size said an evident weakling  not afraid of any kind of work was what many said while one in particular to lure me no doubt by inexpensiveness wrote  i can pay my way to the pacific coast so that part would probably be acceptable to you  going around the world is the one thing i want to do said one and it seemed to be the one thing that a few hundred wanted to do  i have no one who cares whether i go or not was the pathetic note sounded by another  one had sent his photograph and speaking of it said im a homelylooking sort of a chap but looks dont always count and i am confident that the lad who wrote the following would have turned out all right  my age is 19 years but i am rather small and consequently wont take up much room but im tough as the devil  and there was one thirteenyearold applicant that charmian and i fell in love with and it nearly broke our hearts to refuse him  but it must not be imagined that most of my volunteers were boys on the contrary boys constituted a very small proportion  there were men and women from every walk in life  physicians surgeons and dentists offered in large numbers to come along and like all the professional men offered to come without pay to serve in any capacity and to pay even for the privilege of so serving  there was no end of compositors and reporters who wanted to come to say nothing of experienced valets chefs and stewards  civil engineers were keen on the voyage lady companions galore cropped up for charmian while i was deluged with the applications of would be private secretaries  many high school and university students yearned for the voyage and every trade in the working class developed a few applicants the machinists electricians and engineers being especially strong on the trip  i was surprised at the number who in musty law offices heard the call of adventure and i was more than surprised by the number of elderly and retired sea captains who were still thralls to the sea  several young fellows with millions coming to them later on were wild for the adventure as were also several county superintendents of schools  fathers and sons wanted to come and many men with their wives to say nothing of the young woman stenographer who wrote  write immediately if you need me  i shall bring my typewriter on the first train  but the best of all is the followingobserve the delicate way in which he worked in his wife  i thought i would drop you a line of inquiry as to the possibility of making the trip with you am 24 years of age married and broke and a trip of that kind would be just what we are looking for  come to think of it for the average man it must be fairly difficult to write an honest letter of selfrecommendation  one of my correspondents was so stumped that he began his letter with the words this is a hard task and after vainly trying to describe his good points he wound up with it is a hard job writing about ones self  nevertheless there was one who gave himself a most glowing and lengthy character and in conclusion stated that he had greatly enjoyed writing it  but suppose this  your cabinboy could run your engine could repair it when out of order  suppose he could take his turn at the wheel could do any carpenter or machinist work  suppose he is strong healthy and willing to work  would you not rather have him than a kid that gets seasick and cant do anything but wash dishes it was letters of this sort that i hated to decline  the writer of it selftaught in english had been only two years in the united states and as he said i am not wishing to go with you to earn my living but i wish to learn and see  at the time of writing to me he was a designer for one of the big motor manufacturing companies he had been to sea quite a bit and had been used all his life to the handling of small boats  i have a good position but it matters not so with me as i prefer travelling wrote another  as to salary look at me and if i am worth a dollar or two all right and if i am not nothing said  as to my honesty and character i shall be pleased to show you my employers  never drink no tobacco but to be honest i myself after a little more experience want to do a little writing  i can assure you that i am eminently respectable but find other respectable people tiresome  the man who wrote the foregoing certainly had me guessing and i am still wondering whether or not hed have found me tiresome or what the deuce he did mean  i have seen better days than what i am passing through today wrote an old salt but i have seen them a great deal worse also  but the willingness to sacrifice on the part of the man who wrote the following was so touching that i could not accept  i have a father a mother brothers and sisters dear friends and a lucrative position and yet i will sacrifice all to become one of your crew  another volunteer i could never have accepted was the finicky young fellow who to show me how necessary it was that i should give him a chance pointed out that to go in the ordinary boat be it schooner or steamer would be impracticable for i would have to mix among and live with the ordinary type of seamen which as a rule is not a clean sort of life  then there was the young fellow of twentysix who had run through the gamut of human emotions and had done everything from cooking to attending stanford university and who at the present writing was a vaquero on a fiftyfivethousandacre range  quite in contrast was the modesty of the one who said i am not aware of possessing any particular qualities that would be likely to recommend me to your consideration  but should you be impressed you might consider it worth a few minutes time to answer otherwise theres always work at the trade  not expecting but hoping i remain etc  but i have held my head in both my hands ever since trying to figure out the intellectual kinship between myself and the one who wrote  long before i knew of you i had mixed political economy and history and deducted therefrom many of your conclusions in concrete  here in its way is one of the best as it is the briefest that i received  if any of the present company signed on for cruise happens to get cold feet and you need one more who understands boating engines etc would like to hear from you etc  here is another brief one  point blank would like to have the job of cabinboy on your trip around the world or any other job on board am nineteen years old weigh one hundred and forty pounds and am an american  and here is a good one from a man a little over five feet long when i read about your manly plan of sailing around the world in a small boat with mrs london i was so much rejoiced that i felt i was planning it myself and i thought to write you about filling either position of cook or cabinboy myself but for some reason i did not do it and i came to denver from oakland to join my friends business last month but everything is worse and unfavourable  but fortunately you have postponed your departure on account of the great earthquake so i finally decided to propose you to let me fill either of the positions  i am not very strong being a man of a little over five feet long although i am of sound health and capability  i think i can add to your outfit an additional method of utilizing the power of the wind wrote a wellwisher which while not interfering with ordinary sails in light breezes will enable you to use the whole force of the wind in its mightiest blows so that even when its force is so great that you may have to take in every inch of canvas used in the ordinary way you may carry the fullest spread with my method  with my attachment your craft could not be upset  the foregoing letter was written in san francisco under the date of april 16 1906  and two days later on april 18 came the great earthquake  and thats why ive got it in for that earthquake for it made a refugee out of the man who wrote the letter and prevented us from ever getting together  many of my brother socialists objected to my making the cruise of which the following is typical  the socialist cause and the millions of oppressed victims of capitalism has a right and claim upon your life and services  if however you persist then when you swallow the last mouthful of salt chuck you can hold before sinking remember that we at least protested  one wanderer over the world who could if opportunity afforded recount many unusual scenes and events spent several pages ardently trying to get to the point of his letter and at last achieved the following  still i am neglecting the point i set out to write you about  so will say at once that it has been stated in print that you and one or two others are going to take a cruize around the world a little fifty or sixtyfoot boat  i therefore cannot get myself to think that a man of your attainments and experience would attempt such a proceeding which is nothing less than courting death in that way  and even if you were to escape for some time your whole person and those with you would be bruised from the ceaseless motion of a craft of the above size even if she were padded a thing not usual at sea  thank you kind friend thank you for that qualification a thing not usual at sea  nor is this friend ignorant of the sea  as he says of himself i am not a landlubber and i have sailed every sea and ocean  and he winds up his letter with  although not wishing to offend it would be madness to take any woman outside the bay even in such a craft  and yet at the moment of writing this charmian is in her state room at the typewriter martin is cooking dinner tochigi is setting the table roscoe and bert are caulking the deck and the snark is steering herself some five knots an hour in a rattling good seaand the snark is not padded either  seeing a piece in the paper about your intended trip would like to know if you would like a good crew as there is six of us boys all good sailor men with good discharges from the navy and merchant service all true americans all between the ages of 20 and 22 and at present are employed as riggers at the union iron works and would like very much to sail with youit was letters like this that made me regret the boat was not larger  and here writes the one woman in all the worldoutside of charmian for the cruise  if you have not succeeded in getting a cook i would like very much to take the trip in that capacity  i am a woman of fifty healthy and capable and can do the work for the small company that compose the crew of the snark  i am a very good cook and a very good sailor and something of a traveller and the length of the voyage if of ten years duration would suit me better than one  references etc  some day when i have made a lot of money im going to build a big ship with room in it for a thousand volunteers  they will have to do all the work of navigating that boat around the world or theyll stay at home  i believe that theyll work the boat around the world for i know that adventure is not dead  i know adventure is not dead because i have had a long and intimate correspondence with adventure    chapter ivfinding ones way about    but our friends objected how dare you go to sea without a navigator on board  youre not a navigator are you  i had to confess that i was not a navigator that i had never looked through a sextant in my life and that i doubted if i could tell a sextant from a nautical almanac  and when they asked if roscoe was a navigator i shook my head  roscoe resented this  he had glanced at the epitome bought for our voyage knew how to use logarithm tables had seen a sextant at some time and what of this and of his seafaring ancestry he concluded that he did know navigation but roscoe was wrong i still insist  when a young boy he came from maine to california by way of the isthmus of panama and that was the only time in his life that he was out of sight of land  he had never gone to a school of navigation nor passed an examination in the same nor had he sailed the deep sea and learned the art from some other navigator  he was a san francisco bay yachtsman where land is always only several miles away and the art of navigation is never employed  so the snark started on her long voyage without a navigator  we beat through the golden gate on april 23 and headed for the hawaiian islands twentyone hundred seamiles away as the gull flies  and the outcome was our justification  we arrived  and we arrived furthermore without any trouble as you shall see that is without any trouble to amount to anything  to begin with roscoe tackled the navigating  he had the theory all right but it was the first time he had ever applied it as was evidenced by the erratic behaviour of the snark  not but what the snark was perfectly steady on the sea the pranks she cut were on the chart on a day with a light breeze she would make a jump on the chart that advertised a wet sail and a flowing sheet and on a day when she just raced over the ocean she scarcely changed her position on the chart  now when ones boat has logged six knots for twentyfour consecutive hours it is incontestable that she has covered one hundred and fortyfour miles of ocean  the ocean was all right and so was the patent log as for speed one saw it with his own eyes therefore the thing that was not all right was the figuring that refused to boost the snark along over the chart  not that this happened every day but that it did happen  and it was perfectly proper and no more than was to be expected from a first attempt at applying a theory  the acquisition of the knowledge of navigation has a strange effect on the minds of men  the average navigator speaks of navigation with deep respect  to the layman navigation is a deed and awful mystery which feeling has been generated in him by the deep and awful respect for navigation that the layman has seen displayed by navigators  i have known frank ingenuous and modest young men open as the day to learn navigation and at once betray secretiveness reserve and selfimportance as if they had achieved some tremendous intellectual attainment  the average navigator impresses the layman as a priest of some holy rite  with bated breath the amateur yachtsman navigator invites one in to look at his chronometer  and so it was that our friends suffered such apprehension at our sailing without a navigator  during the building of the snark roscoe and i had an agreement something like this  ill furnish the books and instruments i said and do you study up navigation now  ill be too busy to do any studying  then when we get to sea you can teach me what you have learned  roscoe was delighted  furthermore roscoe was as frank and ingenuous and modest as the young men i have described but when we got out to sea and he began to practise the holy rite while i looked on admiringly a change subtle and distinctive marked his bearing  when he shot the sun at noon the glow of achievement wrapped him in lambent flame  when he went below figured out his observation and then returned on deck and announced our latitude and longitude there was an authoritative ring in his voice that was new to all of us  but that was not the worst of it he became filled with incommunicable information  and the more he discovered the reasons for the erratic jumps of the snark over the chart and the less the snark jumped the more incommunicable and holy and awful became his information  my mild suggestions that it was about time that i began to learn met with no hearty response with no offers on his part to help me  he displayed not the slightest intention of living up to our agreement  now this was not roscoes fault he could not help it  he had merely gone the way of all the men who learned navigation before him  by an understandable and forgivable confusion of values plus a loss of orientation he felt weighted by responsibility and experienced the possession of power that was like unto that of a god  all his life roscoe had lived on land and therefore in sight of land  being constantly in sight of land with landmarks to guide him he had managed with occasional difficulties to steer his body around and about the earth  now he found himself on the sea wide stretching bounded only by the eternal circle of the sky  this circle looked always the same  there were no landmarks  the sun rose to the east and set to the west and the stars wheeled through the night  but who may look at the sun or the stars and say my place on the face of the earth at the present moment is four and threequarter miles to the west of joness cash store of smithersville or i know where i am now for the little dipper informs me that boston is three miles away on the second turning to the right  and yet that was precisely what roscoe did  that he was astounded by the achievement is putting it mildly  he stood in reverential awe of himself he had performed a miraculous feat  the act of finding himself on the face of the waters became a rite and he felt himself a superior being to the rest of us who knew not this rite and were dependent on him for being shepherded across the heaving and limitless waste the briny highroad that connects the continents and whereon there are no milestones  so with the sextant he made obeisance to the sungod he consulted ancient tomes and tables of magic characters muttered prayers in a strange tongue that sounded like indexerrorparallaxrefraction made cabalistic signs on paper added and carried one and then on a piece of holy script called the graili mean the charthe placed his finger on a certain space conspicuous for its blankness and said here we are when we looked at the blank space and asked and where is that he answered in the ciphercode of the higher priesthood 311547 north 133530 west  and we said oh and felt mighty small  so i aver it was not roscoes fault  he was like unto a god and he carried us in the hollow of his hand across the blank spaces on the chart  i experienced a great respect for roscoe this respect grew so profound that had he commanded kneel down and worship me i know that i should have flopped down on the deck and yammered but one day there came a still small thought to me that said this is not a god this is roscoe a mere man like myself  what he has done i can do  who taught him  himself  go you and do likewisebe your own teacher  and right there roscoe crashed and he was high priest of the snark no longer  i invaded the sanctuary and demanded the ancient tomes and magic tables also the prayer wheelthe sextant i mean  and now in simple language  i shall describe how i taught myself navigation  one whole afternoon i sat in the cockpit steering with one hand and studying logarithms with the other  two afternoons two hours each i studied the general theory of navigation and the particular process of taking a meridian altitude  then i took the sextant worked out the index error and shot the sun  the figuring from the data of this observation was childs play  in the epitome and the nautical almanac were scores of cunning tables all worked out by mathematicians and astronomers  it was like using interest tables and lightningcalculator tables such as you all know  the mystery was mystery no longer  i put my finger on the chart and announced that that was where we were  i was right too or at least i was as right as roscoe who selected a spot a quarter of a mile away from mine  even he was willing to split the distance with me  i had exploded the mystery and yet such was the miracle of it i was conscious of new power in me and i felt the thrill and tickle of pride  and when martin asked me in the same humble and respectful way i had previously asked roscoe as to where we were it was with exaltation and spiritual chestthrowing that i answered in the ciphercode of the higher priesthood and heard martins self abasing and worshipful oh  as for charmian i felt that in a new way i had proved my right to her and i was aware of another feeling namely that she was a most fortunate woman to have a man like me  i couldnt help it  i tell it as a vindication of roscoe and all the other navigators  the poison of power was working in me  i was not as other menmost other men i knew what they did not know the mystery of the heavens that pointed out the way across the deep  and the taste of power i had received drove me on  i steered at the wheel long hours with one hand and studied mystery with the other  by the end of the week teaching myself i was able to do divers things  for instance i shot the north star at night of course got its altitude corrected for index error dip etc and found our latitude  and this latitude agreed with the latitude of the previous noon corrected by dead reckoning up to that moment proud  well i was even prouder with my next miracle  i was going to turn in at nine oclock  i worked out the problem self instructed and learned what star of the first magnitude would be passing the meridian around halfpast eight  this star proved to be alpha crucis  i had never heard of the star before  i looked it up on the star map  it was one of the stars of the southern cross what thought i have we been sailing with the southern cross in the sky of nights and never known it  dolts that we are  gudgeons and moles  i couldnt believe it  i went over the problem again and verified it  charmian had the wheel from eight till ten that evening  i told her to keep her eyes open and look due south for the southern cross  and when the stars came out there shone the southern cross low on the horizon  proud  no medicine man nor high priest was ever prouder  furthermore with the prayerwheel i shot alpha crucis and from its altitude worked out our latitude  and still furthermore i shot the north star too and it agreed with what had been told me by the southern cross  proud  why the language of the stars was mine and i listened and heard them telling me my way over the deep  proud  i was a worker of miracles  i forgot how easily i had taught myself from the printed page  i forgot that all the work and a tremendous work too had been done by the masterminds before me the astronomers and mathematicians who had discovered and elaborated the whole science of navigation and made the tables in the epitome  i remembered only the everlasting miracle of it that i had listened to the voices of the stars and been told my place upon the highway of the sea  charmian did not know martin did not know tochigi the cabinboy did not know  but i told them  i was gods messenger  i stood between them and infinity  i translated the high celestial speech into terms of their ordinary understanding  we were heavendirected and it was i who could read the signpost of the skyi  i  and now in a cooler moment i hasten to blab the whole simplicity of it to blab on roscoe and the other navigators and the rest of the priesthood all for fear that i may become even as they secretive immodest and inflated with selfesteem  and i want to say this now  any young fellow with ordinary gray matter ordinary education and with the slightest trace of the studentmind can get the books and charts and instruments and teach himself navigation now i must not be misunderstood  seamanship is an entirely different matter  it is not learned in a day nor in many days it requires years  also navigating by dead reckoning requires long study and practice  but navigating by observations of the sun moon and stars thanks to the astronomers and mathematicians is childs play  any average young fellow can teach himself in a week and yet again i must not be misunderstood  i do not mean to say that at the end of a week a young fellow could take charge of a fifteenthousandton steamer driving twenty knots an hour through the brine racing from land to land fair weather and foul clear sky or cloudy steering by degrees on the compass card and making landfalls with most amazing precision  but what i do mean is just this  the average young fellow i have described can get into a staunch sailboat and put out across the ocean without knowing anything about navigation and at the end of the week he will know enough to know where he is on the chart  he will be able to take a meridian observation with fair accuracy and from that observation with ten minutes of figuring work out his latitude and longitude and carrying neither freight nor passengers being under no press to reach his destination he can jog comfortably along and if at any time he doubts his own navigation and fears an imminent landfall he can heave to all night and proceed in the morning  joshua slocum sailed around the world a few years ago in a thirty sevenfoot boat all by himself  i shall never forget in his narrative of the voyage where he heartily indorsed the idea of young men in similar small boats making similar voyage  i promptly indorsed his idea and so heartily that i took my wife along  while it certainly makes a cooks tour look like thirty cents on top of that amid on top of the fun and pleasure it is a splendid education for a young manoh not a mere education in the things of the world outside of lands and peoples and climates but an education in the world inside an education in ones self a chance to learn ones own self to get on speaking terms with ones soul  then there is the training and the disciplining of it first naturally the young fellow will learn his limitations and next inevitably he will proceed to press back those limitations and he cannot escape returning from such a voyage a bigger and better man  and as for sport it is a kings sport taking ones self around the world doing it with ones own hands depending on no one but ones self and at the end back at the startingpoint contemplating with inner vision the planet rushing through space and saying i did it with my own hands i did it  i went clear around that whirling sphere and i can travel alone without any nurse of a seacaptain to guide my steps across the seas  i may not fly to other stars but of this star i myself am master  as i write these lines i lift my eyes and look seaward  i am on the beach of waikiki on the island of oahu  far in the azure sky the tradewind clouds drift low over the bluegreen turquoise of the deep sea  nearer the sea is emerald and light olivegreen  then comes the reef where the water is all slaty purple flecked with red  still nearer are brighter greens and tans lying in alternate stripes and showing where sandbeds lie between the living coral banks  through and over and out of these wonderful colours tumbles and thunders a magnificent surf  as i say i lift my eyes to all this and through the white crest of a breaker suddenly appears a dark figure erect a manfish or a seagod on the very forward face of the crest where the top falls over and down driving in toward shore buried to his loins in smoking spray caught up by the sea and flung landward bodily a quarter of a mile  it is a kanaka on a surfboard  and i know that when i have finished these lines i shall be out in that riot of colour and pounding surf trying to bit those breakers even as he and failing as he never failed but living life as the best of us may live it  and the picture of that coloured sea and that flying seagod kanaka becomes another reason for the young man to go west and farther west beyond the baths of sunset and still west till he arrives home again  but to return  please do not think that i already know it all  i know only the rudiments of navigation  there is a vast deal yet for me to learn  on the snark there is a score of fascinating books on navigation waiting for me  there is the dangerangle of lecky there is the line of sumner which when you know least of all where you are shows most conclusively where you are and where you are not  there are dozens and dozens of methods of finding ones location on the deep and one can work years before he masters it all in all its fineness  even in the little we did learn there were slips that accounted for the apparently antic behaviour of the snark  on thursday may 16 for instance the trade wind failed us  during the twentyfour hours that ended friday at noon by dead reckoning we had not sailed twenty miles  yet here are our positions at noon for the two days worked out from our observations  thursday  20 degrees 57 minutes  9 seconds n          152 degrees 40 minutes 30 seconds w friday    21 degrees 15 minutes 33 seconds n          154 degrees 12 minutes            w  the difference between the two positions was something like eighty miles  yet we knew we had not travelled twenty miles  now our figuring was all right  we went over it several times  what was wrong was the observations we had taken  to take a correct observation requires practice and skill and especially so on a small craft like the snark  the violently moving boat and the closeness of the observers eye to the surface of the water are to blame  a big wave that lifts up a mile off is liable to steal the horizon away  but in our particular case there was another perturbing factor  the sun in its annual march north through the heavens was increasing its declination  on the 19th parallel of north latitude in the middle of may the sun is nearly overhead  the angle of arc was between eightyeight and eightynine degrees  had it been ninety degrees it would have been straight overhead  it was on another day that we learned a few things about taking the altitude of the almost perpendicular sun  roscoe started in drawing the sun down to the eastern horizon and he stayed by that point of the compass despite the fact that the sun would pass the meridian to the south  i on the other hand started in to draw the sun down to southeast and strayed away to the southwest  you see we were teaching ourselves  as a result at twentyfive minutes past twelve by the ships time i called twelve oclock by the sun  now this signified that we had changed our location on the face of the world by twenty five minutes which was equal to something like six degrees of longitude or three hundred and fifty miles  this showed the snark had travelled fifteen knots per hour for twentyfour consecutive hoursand we had never noticed it  it was absurd and grotesque but roscoe still looking east averred that it was not yet twelve oclock  he was bent on giving us a twentyknot clip  then we began to train our sextants rather wildly all around the horizon and wherever we looked there was the sun puzzlingly close to the skyline sometimes above it and sometimes below it  in one direction the sun was proclaiming morning in another direction it was proclaiming afternoon  the sun was all rightwe knew that therefore we were all wrong  and the rest of the afternoon we spent in the cockpit reading up the matter in the books and finding out what was wrong  we missed the observation that day but we didnt the next  we had learned  and we learned well better than for a while we thought we had  at the beginning of the second dogwatch one evening charmian and i sat down on the forecastlehead for a rubber of cribbage  chancing to glance ahead i saw cloudcapped mountains rising from the sea we were rejoiced at the sight of land but i was in despair over our navigation  i thought we had learned something yet our position at noon plus what we had run since did not put us within a hundred miles of land  but there was the land fading away before our eyes in the fires of sunset  the land was all right  there was no disputing it  therefore our navigation was all wrong  but it wasnt  that land we saw was the summit of haleakala the house of the sun the greatest extinct volcano in the world  it towered ten thousand feet above the sea and it was all of a hundred miles away we sailed all night at a sevenknot clip and in the morning the house of the sun was still before us and it took a few more hours of sailing to bring it abreast of us  that island is maui we said verifying by the chart  that next island sticking out is molokai where the lepers are  and the island next to that is oahu there is makapuu head now  well be in honolulu tomorrow  our navigation is all right    chapter vthe first landfall    it will not be so monotonous at sea i promised my fellowvoyagers on the snark  the sea is filled with life  it is so populous that every day something new is happening  almost as soon as we pass through the golden gate and head south well pick up with the flying fish  well be having them fried for breakfast  well be catching bonita and dolphin and spearing porpoises from the bowsprit  and then there are the sharkssharks without end  we passed through the golden gate and headed south  we dropped the mountains of california beneath the horizon and daily the surf grew warmer  but there were no flying fish no bonita and dolphin  the ocean was bereft of life  never had i sailed on so forsaken a sea always before in the same latitudes had i encountered flying fish  never mind i said  wait till we get off the coast of southern california  then well pick up the flying fish  we came abreast of southern california abreast of the peninsula of lower california abreast of the coast of mexico and there were no flying fish  nor was there anything else  no life moved  as the days went by the absence of life became almost uncanny  never mind i said  when we do pick up with the flying fish well pick up with everything else  the flying fish is the staff of life for all the other breeds  everything will come in a bunch when we find the flying fish  when i should have headed the snark southwest for hawaii i still held her south  i was going to find those flying fish  finally the time came when if i wanted to go to honolulu i should have headed the snark due west instead of which i kept her south  not until latitude 19 degrees did we encounter the first flying fish  he was very much alone  i saw him  five other pairs of eager eyes scanned the sea all day but never saw another  so sparse were the flying fish that nearly a week more elapsed before the last one on board saw his first flying fish  as for the dolphin bonita porpoise and all the other hordes of lifethere werent any  not even a shark broke surface with his ominous dorsal fin  bert took a dip daily under the bowsprit hanging on to the stays and dragging his body through the water  and daily he canvassed the project of letting go and having a decent swim  i did my best to dissuade him  but with him i had lost all standing as an authority on sea life  if there are sharks he demanded why dont they show up  i assured him that if he really did let go and have a swim the sharks would promptly appear  this was a bluff on my part  i didnt believe it  it lasted as a deterrent for two days  the third day the wind fell calm and it was pretty hot  the snark was moving a knot an hour  bert dropped down under the bowsprit and let go  and now behold the perversity of things  we had sailed across two thousand miles and more of ocean and had met with no sharks within five minutes after bert finished his swim the fin of a shark was cutting the surface in circles around the snark  there was something wrong about that shark  it bothered me  it had no right to be there in that deserted ocean  the more i thought about it the more incomprehensible it became  but two hours later we sighted land and the mystery was cleared up  he had come to us from the land and not from the uninhabited deep  he had presaged the landfall  he was the messenger of the land  twentyseven days out from san francisco we arrived at the island of oahu territory of hawaii  in the early morning we drifted around diamond head into full view of honolulu and then the ocean burst suddenly into life  flying fish cleaved the air in glittering squadrons  in five minutes we saw more of them than during the whole voyage  other fish large ones of various sorts leaped into the air  there was life everywhere on sea and shore  we could see the masts and funnels of the shipping in the harbour the hotels and bathers along the beach at waikiki the smoke rising from the dwellinghouses high up on the volcanic slopes of the punch bowl and tantalus  the customhouse tug was racing toward us and a big school of porpoises got under our bow and began cutting the most ridiculous capers  the port doctors launch came charging out at us and a big sea turtle broke the surface with his back and took a look at us  never was there such a burgeoning of life  strange faces were on our decks strange voices were speaking and copies of that very mornings newspaper with cable reports from all the world were thrust before our eyes  incidentally we read that the snark and all hands had been lost at sea and that she had been a very unseaworthy craft anyway  and while we read this information a wireless message was being received by the congressional party on the summit of haleakala announcing the safe arrival of the snark  it was the snarks first landfalland such a landfall  for twenty seven days we had been on the deserted deep and it was pretty hard to realize that there was so much life in the world  we were made dizzy by it  we could not take it all in at once  we were like awakened rip van winkles and it seemed to us that we were dreaming on one side the azure sea lapped across the horizon into the azure sky on the other side the sea lifted itself into great breakers of emerald that fell in a snowy smother upon a white coral beach beyond the beach green plantations of sugarcane undulated gently upward to steeper slopes which in turn became jagged volcanic crests drenched with tropic showers and capped by stupendous masses of tradewind clouds  at any rate it was a most beautiful dream the snark turned and headed directly in toward the emerald surf till it lifted and thundered on either hand and on either hand scarce a biscuittoss away the reef showed its long teeth pale green and menacing  abruptly the land itself in a riot of olivegreens of a thousand hues reached out its arms and folded the snark in  there was no perilous passage through the reef no emerald surf and azure sea nothing but a warm soft land a motionless lagoon and tiny beaches on which swam darkskinned tropic children  the sea had disappeared  the snarks anchor rumbled the chain through the hawsepipe and we lay without movement on a lineless level floor  it was all so beautiful and strange that we could not accept it as real  on the chart this place was called pearl harbour but we called it dream harbour  a launch came off to us in it were members of the hawaiian yacht club come to greet us and make us welcome with true hawaiian hospitality to all they had  they were ordinary men flesh and blood and all the rest but they did not tend to break our dreaming our last memories of men were of united states marshals and of panicky little merchants with rusty dollars for souls who in a reeking atmosphere of soot and coaldust laid grimy hands upon the snark and held her back from her world adventure  but these men who came to meet us were clean men  a healthy tan was on their cheeks and their eyes were not dazzled and bespectacled from gazing overmuch at glittering dollarheaps  no they merely verified the dream  they clinched it with their unsmirched souls  so we went ashore with them across a level flashing sea to the wonderful green land  we landed on a tiny wharf and the dream became more insistent for know that for twentyseven days we had been rocking across the ocean on the tiny snark  not once in all those twentyseven days had we known a moments rest a moments cessation from movement  this ceaseless movement had become ingrained  body and brain we had rocked and rolled so long that when we climbed out on the tiny wharf kept on rocking and rolling this naturally we attributed to the wharf  it was projected psychology  i spraddled along the wharf and nearly fell into the water  i glanced at charmian and the way she walked made me sad the wharf had all the seeming of a ships deck  it lifted tilted heaved and sank and since there were no handrails on it it kept charmian and me busy avoiding falling in  i never saw such a preposterous little wharf  whenever i watched it closely it refused to roll but as soon as i took my attention off from it away it went just like the snark  once i caught it in the act just as it upended and i looked down the length of it for two hundred feet and for all the world it was like the deck of a ship ducking into a huge headsea  at last however supported by our hosts we negotiated the wharf and gained the land  but the land was no better  the very first thing it did was to tilt up on one side and far as the eye could see i watched it tilt clear to its jagged volcanic backbone and i saw the clouds above tilt too  this was no stable firmfounded land else it would not cut such capers  it was like all the rest of our landfall unreal  it was a dream  at any moment like shifting vapour it might dissolve away  the thought entered my head that perhaps it was my fault that my head was swimming or that something i had eaten had disagreed with me  but i glanced at charmian and her sad walk and even as i glanced i saw her stagger and bump into the yachtsman by whose side she walked  i spoke to her and she complained about the antic behaviour of the land  we walked across a spacious wonderful lawn and down an avenue of royal palms and across more wonderful lawn in the gracious shade of stately trees  the air was filled with the songs of birds and was heavy with rich warm fragranceswafture from great lilies and blazing blossoms of hibiscus and other strange gorgeous tropic flowers  the dream was becoming almost impossibly beautiful to us who for so long had seen naught but the restless salty sea charmian reached out her hand and clung to mefor support against the ineffable beauty of it thought i  but no  as i supported her i braced my legs while the flowers and lawns reeled and swung around me  it was like an earthquake only it quickly passed without doing any harm  it was fairly difficult to catch the land playing these tricks  as long as i kept my mind on it nothing happened  but as soon as my attention was distracted away it went the whole panorama swinging and heaving and tilting at all sorts of angles  once however i turned my head suddenly and caught that stately line of royal palms swinging in a great arc across the sky but it stopped just as soon as i caught it and became a placid dream again  next we came to a house of coolness with great sweeping veranda where lotuseaters might dwell  windows and doors were wide open to the breeze and the songs and fragrances blew lazily in and out the walls were hung with tapacloths  couches with grasswoven covers invited everywhere and there was a grand piano that played i was sure nothing more exciting than lullabies  servants japanese maids in native costumedrifted around and about noiselessly like butterflies  everything was preternaturally cool here was no blazing down of a tropic sun upon an unshrinking sea it was too good to be true  but it was not real  it was a dream dwelling  i knew for i turned suddenly and caught the grand piano cavorting in a spacious corner of the room  i did not say anything for just then we were being received by a gracious woman a beautiful madonna clad in flowing white and shod with sandals who greeted us as though she had known us always  we sat at table on the lotuseating veranda served by the butterfly maids and ate strange foods and partook of a nectar called poi but the dream threatened to dissolve  it shimmered and trembled like an iridescent bubble about to break  i was just glancing out at the green grass and stately trees and blossoms of hibiscus when suddenly i felt the table move  the table and the madonna across from me and the veranda of the lotuseaters the scarlet hibiscus the greensward and the treesall lifted and tilted before my eyes and heaved and sank down into the trough of a monstrous sea  i gripped my chair convulsively and held on  i had a feeling that i was holding on to the dream as well as the chair  i should not have been surprised had the sea rushed in and drowned all that fairyland and had i found myself at the wheel of the snark just looking up casually from the study of logarithms  but the dream persisted  i looked covertly at the madonna and her husband  they evidenced no perturbation  the dishes had not moved upon the table  the hibiscus and trees and grass were still there  nothing had changed i partook of more nectar and the dream was more real than ever  will you have some iced tea asked the madonna and then her side of the table sank down gently and i said yes to her at an angle of fortyfive degrees  speaking of sharks said her husband up at niihau there was a man  and at that moment the table lifted and heaved and i gazed upward at him at an angle of fortyfive degrees  so the luncheon went on and i was glad that i did not have to bear the affliction of watching charmian walk  suddenly however a mysterious word of fear broke from the lips of the lotuseaters ah ah thought i now the dream goes glimmering  i clutched the chair desperately resolved to drag back to the reality of the snark some tangible vestige of this lotus land  i felt the whole dream lurching and pulling to be gone  just then the mysterious word of fear was repeated  it sounded like reporters  i looked and saw three of them coming across the lawn  oh blessed reporters then the dream was indisputably real after all  i glanced out across the shining water and saw the snark at anchor and i remembered that i had sailed in her from san francisco to hawaii and that this was pearl harbour and that even then i was acknowledging introductions and saying in reply to the first question yes we had delightful weather all the way down    chapter via royal sport    that is what it is a royal sport for the natural kings of earth the grass grows right down to the water at waikiki beach and within fifty feet of the everlasting sea  the trees also grow down to the salty edge of things and one sits in their shade and looks seaward at a majestic surf thundering in on the beach to ones very feet half a mile out where is the reef the whiteheaded combers thrust suddenly skyward out of the placid turquoiseblue and come rolling in to shore  one after another they come a mile long with smoking crests the white battalions of the infinite army of the sea  and one sits and listens to the perpetual roar and watches the unending procession and feels tiny and fragile before this tremendous force expressing itself in fury and foam and sound  indeed one feels microscopically small and the thought that one may wrestle with this sea raises in ones imagination a thrill of apprehension almost of fear  why they are a mile long these bullmouthed monsters and they weigh a thousand tons and they charge in to shore faster than a man can run  what chance  no chance at all is the verdict of the shrinking ego and one sits and looks and listens and thinks the grass and the shade are a pretty good place in which to be  and suddenly out there where a big smoker lifts skyward rising like a seagod from out of the welter of spume and churning white on the giddy toppling overhanging and downfalling precarious crest appears the dark head of a man  swiftly he rises through the rushing white  his black shoulders his chest his loins his limbsall is abruptly projected on ones vision  where but the moment before was only the wide desolation and invincible roar is now a man erect fullstatured not struggling frantically in that wild movement not buried and crushed and buffeted by those mighty monsters but standing above them all calm and superb poised on the giddy summit his feet buried in the churning foam the salt smoke rising to his knees and all the rest of him in the free air and flashing sunlight and he is flying through the air flying forward flying fast as the surge on which he stands  he is a mercurya brown mercury  his heels are winged and in them is the swiftness of the sea  in truth from out of the sea he has leaped upon the back of the sea and he is riding the sea that roars and bellows and cannot shake him from its back  but no frantic outreaching and balancing is his  he is impassive motionless as a statue carved suddenly by some miracle out of the seas depth from which he rose  and straight on toward shore he flies on his winged heels and the white crest of the breaker  there is a wild burst of foam a long tumultuous rushing sound as the breaker falls futile and spent on the beach at your feet and there at your feet steps calmly ashore a kanaka burnt golden and brown by the tropic sun several minutes ago he was a speck a quarter of a mile away  he has bitted the bullmouthed breaker and ridden it in and the pride in the feat shows in the carriage of his magnificent body as he glances for a moment carelessly at you who sit in the shade of the shore he is a kanakaand more he is a man a member of the kingly species that has mastered matter and the brutes and lorded it over creation  and one sits and thinks of tristrams last wrestle with the sea on that fatal morning and one thinks further to the fact that that kanaka has done what tristram never did and that he knows a joy of the sea that tristram never knew  and still further one thinks  it is all very well sitting here in cool shade of the beach but you are a man one of the kingly species and what that kanaka can do you can do yourself  go to  strip off your clothes that are a nuisance in this mellow clime  get in and wrestle with the sea wing your heels with the skill and power that reside in you bit the seas breakers master them and ride upon their backs as a king should  and that is how it came about that i tackled surfriding  and now that i have tackled it more than ever do i hold it to be a royal sport  but first let me explain the physics of it  a wave is a communicated agitation  the water that composes the body of a wave does not move  if it did when a stone is thrown into a pond and the ripples spread away in an ever widening circle there would appear at the centre an ever increasing hole  no the water that composes the body of a wave is stationary  thus you may watch a particular portion of the oceans surface and you will see the sane water rise and fall a thousand times to the agitation communicated by a thousand successive waves  now imagine this communicated agitation moving shoreward  as the bottom shoals the lower portion of the wave strikes land first and is stopped  but water is fluid and the upper portion has not struck anything wherefore it keeps on communicating its agitation keeps on going  and when the top of the wave keeps on going while the bottom of it lags behind something is bound to happen  the bottom of the wave drops out from under and the top of the wave falls over forward and down curling and cresting and roaring as it does so  it is the bottom of a wave striking against the top of the land that is the cause of all surfs  but the transformation from a smooth undulation to a breaker is not abrupt except where the bottom shoals abruptly  say the bottom shoals gradually for from quarter of a mile to a mile then an equal distance will be occupied by the transformation  such a bottom is that off the beach of waikiki and it produces a splendid surf riding surf  one leaps upon the back of a breaker just as it begins to break and stays on it as it continues to break all the way in to shore  and now to the particular physics of surfriding  get out on a flat board six feet long two feet wide and roughly oval in shape  lie down upon it like a small boy on a coaster and paddle with your hands out to deep water where the waves begin to crest  lie out there quietly on the board  sea after sea breaks before behind and under and over you and rushes in to shore leaving you behind when a wave crests it gets steeper  imagine yourself on your hoard on the face of that steep slope  if it stood still you would slide down just as a boy slides down a hill on his coaster but you object the wave doesnt stand still  very true but the water composing the wave stands still and there you have the secret  if ever you start sliding down the face of that wave youll keep on sliding and youll never reach the bottom  please dont laugh  the face of that wave may be only six feet yet you can slide down it a quarter of a mile or half a mile and not reach the bottom  for see since a wave is only a communicated agitation or impetus and since the water that composes a wave is changing every instant new water is rising into the wave as fast as the wave travels  you slide down this new water and yet remain in your old position on the wave sliding down the still newer water that is rising and forming the wave  you slide precisely as fast as the wave travels  if it travels fifteen miles an hour you slide fifteen miles an hour  between you and shore stretches a quarter of mile of water  as the wave travels this water obligingly heaps itself into the wave gravity does the rest and down you go sliding the whole length of it  if you still cherish the notion while sliding that the water is moving with you thrust your arms into it and attempt to paddle you will find that you have to be remarkably quick to get a stroke for that water is dropping astern just as fast as you are rushing ahead  and now for another phase of the physics of surfriding  all rules have their exceptions  it is true that the water in a wave does not travel forward  but there is what may be called the send of the sea  the water in the overtoppling crest does move forward as you will speedily realize if you are slapped in the face by it or if you are caught under it and are pounded by one mighty blow down under the surface panting and gasping for half a minute  the water in the top of a wave rests upon the water in the bottom of the wave but when the bottom of the wave strikes the land it stops while the top goes on  it no longer has the bottom of the wave to hold it up  where was solid water beneath it is now air and for the first time it feels the grip of gravity and down it falls at the same time being torn asunder from the lagging bottom of the wave and flung forward  and it is because of this that riding a surfboard is something more than a mere placid sliding down a hill  in truth one is caught up and hurled shoreward as by some titans hand  i deserted the cool shade put on a swimming suit and got hold of a surfboard  it was too small a board  but i didnt know and nobody told me  i joined some little kanaka boys in shallow water where the breakers were well spent and smalla regular kindergarten school  i watched the little kanaka boys  when a likelylooking breaker came along they flopped upon their stomachs on their boards kicked like mad with their feet and rode the breaker in to the beach  i tried to emulate them  i watched them tried to do everything that they did and failed utterly  the breaker swept past and i was not on it  i tried again and again  i kicked twice as madly as they did and failed  half a dozen would be around  we would all leap on our boards in front of a good breaker  away our feet would churn like the sternwheels of river steamboats and away the little rascals would scoot while i remained in disgrace behind  i tried for a solid hour and not one wave could i persuade to boost me shoreward  and then arrived a friend alexander hume ford a globe trotter by profession bent ever on the pursuit of sensation and he had found it at waikiki  heading for australia he had stopped off for a week to find out if there were any thrills in surfriding and he had become wedded to it  he had been at it every day for a month and could not yet see any symptoms of the fascination lessening on him  he spoke with authority  get off that board he said  chuck it away at once  look at the way youre trying to ride it  if ever the nose of that board hits bottom youll be disembowelled  here take my board  its a mans size  i am always humble when confronted by knowledge  ford knew  he showed me how properly to mount his board  then he waited for a good breaker gave me a shove at the right moment and started me in  ah delicious moment when i felt that breaker grip and fling me  on i dashed a hundred and fifty feet and subsided with the breaker on the sand  from that moment i was lost  i waded back to ford with his board  it was a large one several inches thick and weighed all of seventyfive pounds  he gave me advice much of it he had had no one to teach him and all that he had laboriously learned in several weeks he communicated to me in half an hour  i really learned by proxy  and inside of half an hour i was able to start myself and ride in  i did it time after time and ford applauded and advised  for instance he told me to get just so far forward on the board and no farther  but i must have got some farther for as i came charging in to land that miserable board poked its nose down to bottom stopped abruptly and turned a somersault at the same time violently severing our relations  i was tossed through the air like a chip and buried ignominiously under the downfalling breaker  and i realized that if it hadnt been for ford id have been disembowelled  that particular risk is part of the sport ford says  maybe hell have it happen to him before he leaves waikiki and then i feel confident his yearning for sensation will be satisfied for a time  when all is said and done it is my steadfast belief that homicide is worse than suicide especially if in the former case it is a woman  ford saved me from being a homicide  imagine your legs are a rudder he said  hold them close together and steer with them  a few minutes later i came charging in on a comber  as i neared the beach there in the water up to her waist dead in front of me appeared a woman  how was i to stop that comber on whose back i was  it looked like a dead woman  the board weighed seventyfive pounds i weighed a hundred and sixtyfive  the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour  the board and i constituted a projectile  i leave it to the physicists to figure out the force of the impact upon that poor tender woman  and then i remembered my guardian angel ford  steer with your legs rang through my brain  i steered with my legs i steered sharply abruptly with all my legs and with all my might  the board sheered around broadside on the crest  many things happened simultaneously the wave gave me a passing buffet a light tap as the taps of waves go but a tap sufficient to knock me off the board and smash me down through the rushing water to bottom with which i came in violent collision and upon which i was rolled over and over  i got my head out for a breath of air and then gained my feet  there stood the woman before me  i felt like a hero  i had saved her life  and she laughed at me  it was not hysteria  she had never dreamed of her danger  anyway i solaced myself it was not i but ford that saved her and i didnt have to feel like a hero  and besides that legsteering was great  in a few minutes more of practice i was able to thread my way in and out past several bathers and to remain on top my breaker instead of going under it  tomorrow ford said i am going to take you out into the blue water  i looked seaward where he pointed and saw the great smoking combers that made the breakers i had been riding look like ripples  i dont know what i might have said had i not recollected just then that i was one of a kingly species  so all that i did say was all right ill tackle them tomorrow  the water that rolls in on waikiki beach is just the same as the water that laves the shores of all the hawaiian islands and in ways especially from the swimmers standpoint it is wonderful water  it is cool enough to be comfortable while it is warm enough to permit a swimmer to stay in all day without experiencing a chill under the sun or the stars at high noon or at midnight in midwinter or in midsummer it does not matter when it is always the same temperaturenot too warm not too cold just right  it is wonderful water salt as old ocean itself pure and crystalclear when the nature of the water is considered it is not so remarkable after all that the kanakas are one of the most expert of swimming races  so it was next morning when ford came along that i plunged into the wonderful water for a swim of indeterminate length  astride of our surfboards or rather flat down upon them on our stomachs we paddled out through the kindergarten where the little kanaka boys were at play  soon we were out in deep water where the big smokers came roaring in  the mere struggle with them facing them and paddling seaward over them and through them was sport enough in itself  one had to have his wits about him for it was a battle in which mighty blows were struck on one side and in which cunning was used on the other sidea struggle between insensate force and intelligence  i soon learned a bit  when a breaker curled over my head for a swift instant i could see the light of day through its emerald body then down would go my head and i would clutch the board with all my strength  then would come the blow and to the onlooker on shore i would be blotted out  in reality the board and i have passed through the crest and emerged in the respite of the other side  i should not recommend those smashing blows to an invalid or delicate person  there is weight behind them and the impact of the driven water is like a sandblast  sometimes one passes through half a dozen combers in quick succession and it is just about that time that he is liable to discover new merits in the stable land and new reasons for being on shore  out there in the midst of such a succession of big smoky ones a third man was added to our party one freeth  shaking the water from my eyes as i emerged from one wave and peered ahead to see what the next one looked like i saw him tearing in on the back of it standing upright on his board carelessly poised a young god bronzed with sunburn  we went through the wave on the back of which he rode  ford called to him  he turned an airspring from his wave rescued his board from its maw paddled over to us and joined ford in showing me things  one thing in particular i learned from freeth namely how to encounter the occasional breaker of exceptional size that rolled in  such breakers were really ferocious and it was unsafe to meet them on top of the board  but freeth showed me so that whenever i saw one of that calibre rolling down on me i slid off the rear end of the board and dropped down beneath the surface my arms over my head and holding the board thus if the wave ripped the board out of my hands and tried to strike me with it a common trick of such waves there would be a cushion of water a foot or more in depth between my head and the blow  when the wave passed i climbed upon the board and paddled on  many men have been terribly injured i learn by being struck by their boards  the whole method of surfriding and surffighting learned is one of nonresistance  dodge the blow that is struck at you  dive through the wave that is trying to slap you in the face  sink down feet first deep under the surface and let the big smoker that is trying to smash you go by far overhead  never be rigid  relax yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you when the undertow catches you and drags you seaward along the bottom dont struggle against it  if you do you are liable to be drowned for it is stronger than you  yield yourself to that undertow  swim with it not against it and you will find the pressure removed  and swimming with it fooling it so that it does not hold you swim upward at the same time  it will be no trouble at all to reach the surface  the man who wants to learn surfriding must be a strong swimmer and he must be used to going under the water  after that fair strength and commonsense are all that is required  the force of the big comber is rather unexpected  there are mixups in which board and rider are torn apart and separated by several hundred feet  the surfrider must take care of himself  no matter how many riders swim out with him he cannot depend upon any of them for aid  the fancied security i had in the presence of ford and freeth made me forget that it was my first swim out in deep water among the big ones  i recollected however and rather suddenly for a big wave came in and away went the two men on its back all the way to shore i could have been drowned a dozen different ways before they got back to me  one slides down the face of a breaker on his surfboard but he has to get started to sliding  board and rider must be moving shoreward at a good rate before the wave overtakes them  when you see the wave coming that you want to ride in you turn tail to it and paddle shoreward with all your strength using what is called the windmill stroke  this is a sort of spurt performed immediately in front of the wave  if the board is going fast enough the wave accelerates it and the board begins its quarterofamile slide  i shall never forget the first big wave i caught out there in the deep water  i saw it coming turned my back on it and paddled for dear life  faster and faster my board went till it seemed my arms would drop off  what was happening behind me i could not tell  one cannot look behind and paddle the windmill stroke  i heard the crest of the wave hissing and churning and then my board was lifted and flung forward  i scarcely knew what happened the first half minute  though i kept my eyes open i could not see anything for i was buried in the rushing white of the crest  but i did not mind i was chiefly conscious of ecstatic bliss at having caught the wave at the end of the halfminute however i began to see things and to breathe  i saw that three feet of the nose of my board was clear out of water and riding on the air  i shifted my weight forward and made the nose come down  then i lay quite at rest in the midst of the wild movement and watched the shore and the bathers on the beach grow distinct  i didnt cover quite a quarter of a mile on that wave because to prevent the board from diving i shifted my weight back but shifted it too far and fell down the rear slope of the wave  it was my second day at surfriding and i was quite proud of myself  i stayed out there four hours and when it was over i was resolved that on the morrow id come in standing up  but that resolution paved a distant place  on the morrow i was in bed  i was not sick but i was very unhappy and i was in bed  when describing the wonderful water of hawaii i forgot to describe the wonderful sun of hawaii  it is a tropic sun and furthermore in the first part of june it is an overhead sun  it is also an insidious deceitful sun  for the first time in my life i was sunburned unawares  my arms shoulders and back had been burned many times in the past and were tough but not so my legs  and for four hours i had exposed the tender backs of my legs at right angles to that perpendicular hawaiian sun  it was not until after i got ashore that i discovered the sun had touched me  sunburn at first is merely warm after that it grows intense and the blisters come out  also the joints where the skin wrinkles refuse to bend  that is why i spent the next day in bed  i couldnt walk and that is why today i am writing this in bed  it is easier to than not to  but tomorrow ah tomorrow i shall be out in that wonderful water and i shall come in standing up even as ford and freeth  and if i fail tomorrow i shall do it the next day or the next  upon one thing i am resolved  the snark shall not sail from honolulu until i too wing my heels with the swiftness of the sea and become a sunburned skinpeeling mercury    chapter viithe lepers of molokai    when the snark sailed along the windward coast of molokai on her way to honolulu i looked at the chart then pointed to a lowlying peninsula backed by a tremendous cliff varying from two to four thousand feet in height and said  the pit of hell the most cursed place on earth  i should have been shocked if at that moment i could have caught a vision of myself a month later ashore in the most cursed place on earth and having a disgracefully good time along with eight hundred of the lepers who were likewise having a good time  their good time was not disgraceful but mine was for in the midst of so much misery it was not meet for me to have a good time  that is the way i felt about it and my only excuse is that i couldnt help having a good time  for instance in the afternoon of the fourth of july all the lepers gathered at the racetrack for the sports  i had wandered away from the superintendent and the physicians in order to get a snapshot of the finish of one of the races  it was an interesting race and partisanship ran high  three horses were entered one ridden by a chinese one by an hawaiian and one by a portuguese boy  all three riders were lepers so were the judges and the crowd  the race was twice around the track  the chinese and the hawaiian got away together and rode neck and neck the portuguese boy toiling along two hundred feet behind  around they went in the same positions halfway around on the second and final lap the chinese pulled away and got one length ahead of the hawaiian  at the same time the portuguese boy was beginning to crawl up  but it looked hopeless the crowd went wild  all the lepers were passionate lovers of horseflesh  the portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer  i went wild too  they were on the home stretch  the portuguese boy passed the hawaiian  there was a thunder of hoofs a rush of the three horses bunched together the jockeys plying their whips and every last onlooker bursting his throat or hers with shouts and yells  nearer nearer inch by inch the portuguese boy crept up and passed yes passed winning by a head from the chinese  i came to myself in a group of lepers  they were yelling tossing their hats and dancing around like fiends  so was i  when i came to i was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically  by golly the boy wins  the boy wins  i tried to check myself  i assured myself that i was witnessing one of the horrors of molokai and that it was shameful for me under such circumstances to be so lighthearted and lightheaded  but it was no use  the next event was a donkeyrace and it was just starting so was the fun  the last donkey in was to win the race and what complicated the affair was that no rider rode his own donkey  they rode one anothers donkeys the result of which was that each man strove to make the donkey he rode beat his own donkey ridden by some one else naturally only men possessing very slow or extremely obstreperous donkeys had entered them for the race  one donkey had been trained to tuck in its legs and lie down whenever its rider touched its sides with his heels  some donkeys strove to turn around and come back others developed a penchant for the side of the track where they stuck their heads over the railing and stopped while all of them dawdled  halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider  when all the rest of the donkeys had crossed the wire that particular donkey was still arguing  he won the race though his rider lost it and came in on foot  and all the while nearly a thousand lepers were laughing uproariously at the fun  anybody in my place would have joined with them in having a good time  all the foregoing is by way of preamble to the statement that the horrors of molokai as they have been painted in the past do not exist  the settlement has been written up repeatedly by sensationalists and usually by sensationalists who have never laid eyes on it  of course leprosy is leprosy and it is a terrible thing but so much that is lurid has been written about molokai that neither the lepers nor those who devote their lives to them have received a fair deal  here is a case in point  a newspaper writer who of course had never been near the settlement vividly described superintendent mcveigh crouching in a grass hut and being besieged nightly by starving lepers on their knees wailing for food  this hairraising account was copied by the press all over the united states and was the cause of many indignant and protesting editorials  well i lived and slept for five days in mr mcveighs grass hut which was a comfortable wooden cottage by the way and there isnt a grass house in the whole settlement and i heard the lepers wailing for foodonly the wailing was peculiarly harmonious and rhythmic and it was accompanied by the music of stringed instruments violins guitars ukuleles and banjos  also the wailing was of various sorts  the leper brass band wailed and two singing societies wailed and lastly a quintet of excellent voices wailed  so much for a lie that should never have been printed  the wailing was the serenade which the glee clubs always give mr mcveigh when he returns from a trip to honolulu  leprosy is not so contagious as is imagined  i went for a weeks visit to the settlement and i took my wife alongall of which would not have happened had we had any apprehension of contracting the disease  nor did we wear long gauntleted gloves and keep apart from the lepers  on the contrary we mingled freely with them and before we left knew scores of them by sight and name  the precautions of simple cleanliness seem to be all that is necessary on returning to their own houses after having been among and handling lepers the nonlepers such as the physicians and the superintendent merely wash their faces and hands with mildly antiseptic soap and change their coats  that a leper is unclean however should be insisted upon and the segregation of lepers from what little is known of the disease should be rigidly maintained  on the other hand the awful horror with which the leper has been regarded in the past and the frightful treatment he has received have been unnecessary and cruel  in order to dispel some of the popular misapprehensions of leprosy i want to tell something of the relations between the lepers and nonlepers as i observed them at molokai  on the morning after our arrival charmian and i attended a shoot of the kalaupapa rifle club and caught our first glimpse of the democracy of affliction and alleviation that obtains  the club was just beginning a prize shoot for a cup put up by mr mcveigh who is also a member of the club as also are dr goodhue and dr hollmann the resident physicians who by the way live in the settlement with their wives  all about us in the shooting booth were the lepers lepers and nonlepers were using the same guns and all were rubbing shoulders in the confined space  the majority of the lepers were hawaiians  sitting beside me on a bench was a norwegian  directly in front of me in the stand was an american a veteran of the civil war who had fought on the confederate side  he was sixty five years of age but that did not prevent him from running up a good score  strapping hawaiian policemen lepers khakiclad were also shooting as were portuguese chinese and kokuasthe latter are native helpers in the settlement who are nonlepers  and on the afternoon that charmian and i climbed the twothousandfoot pali and looked our last upon the settlement the superintendent the doctors and the mixture of nationalities and of diseased and non diseased were all engaged in an exciting baseball game  not so was the leper and his greatly misunderstood and feared disease treated during the middle ages in europe  at that time the leper was considered legally and politically dead  he was placed in a funeral procession and led to the church where the burial service was read over him by the officiating clergyman  then a spadeful of earth was dropped upon his chest and he was deadliving dead  while this rigorous treatment was largely unnecessary nevertheless one thing was learned by it  leprosy was unknown in europe until it was introduced by the returning crusaders whereupon it spread slowly until it had seized upon large numbers of the people  obviously it was a disease that could be contracted by contact  it was a contagion and it was equally obvious that it could be eradicated by segregation  terrible and monstrous as was the treatment of the leper in those days the great lesson of segregation was learned by its means leprosy was stamped out  and by the same means leprosy is even now decreasing in the hawaiian islands  but the segregation of the lepers on molokai is not the horrible nightmare that has been so often exploited by yellow writers  in the first place the leper is not torn ruthlessly from his family  when a suspect is discovered he is invited by the board of health to come to the kalihi receiving station at honolulu his fare and all expenses are paid for him  he is first passed upon by microscopical examination by the bacteriologist of the board of health  if the bacillus leprae is found the patient is examined by the board of examining physicians five in number  if found by them to be a leper he is so declared which finding is later officially confirmed by the board of health and the leper is ordered straight to molokai  furthermore during the thorough trial that is given his case the patient has the right to be represented by a physician whom he can select and employ for himself  nor after having been declared a leper is the patient immediately rushed off to molokai he is given ample time weeks and even months sometimes during which he stays at kalihi and winds up or arranges all his business affairs  at molokai in turn he may be visited by his relatives business agents etc though they are not permitted to eat and sleep in his house  visitors houses kept clean are maintained for this purpose  i saw an illustration of the thorough trial given the suspect when i visited kalihi with mr pinkham president of the board of health the suspect was an hawaiian seventy years of age who for thirty four years had worked in honolulu as a pressman in a printing office  the bacteriologist had decided that he was a leper the examining board had been unable to make up its mind and that day all had come out to kalihi to make another examination  when at molokai the declared leper has the privilege of re examination and patients are continually coming back to honolulu for that purpose  the steamer that took me to molokai had on board two returning lepers both young women one of whom had come to honolulu to settle up some property she owned and the other had come to honolulu to see her sick mother  both had remained at kalihi for a month  the settlement of molokai enjoys a far more delightful climate than even honolulu being situated on the windward side of the island in the path of the fresh northeast trades  the scenery is magnificent on one side is the blue sea on the other the wonderful wall of the pali receding here and there into beautiful mountain valleys  everywhere are grassy pastures over which roam the hundreds of horses which are owned by the lepers  some of them have their own carts rigs and traps  in the little harbour of kalaupapa lie fishing boats and a steam launch all of which are privately owned and operated by lepers  their bounds upon the sea are of course determined  otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring  their fish they sell to the board of health and the money they receive is their own  while i was there one nights catch was four thousand pounds  and as these men fish others farm  all trades are followed  one leper a pure hawaiian is the boss painter  he employs eight men and takes contracts for painting buildings from the board of health he is a member of the kalaupapa rifle club where i met him and i must confess that he was far better dressed than i  another man similarly situated is the boss carpenter  then in addition to the board of health store there are little privately owned stores where those with shopkeepers souls may exercise their peculiar instincts  the assistant superintendent mr waiamau a finely educated and able man is a pure hawaiian and a leper  mr bartlett who is the present storekeeper is an american who was in business in honolulu before he was struck down by the disease  all that these men earn is that much in their own pockets  if they do not work they are taken care of anyway by the territory given food shelter clothes and medical attendance  the board of health carries on agriculture stockraising and dairying for local use and employment at fair wages is furnished to all that wish to work they are not compelled to work however for they are the wards of the territory  for the young and the very old and the helpless there are homes and hospitals  major lee an american and long a marine engineer for the inter island steamship company i met actively at work in the new steam laundry where he was busy installing the machinery  i met him often afterwards and one day he said to me  give us a good breeze about how we live here  for heavens sake write us up straight  put your foot down on this chamberofhorrors rot and all the rest of it  we dont like being misrepresented weve got some feelings  just tell the world how we really are in here  man after man that i met in the settlement and woman after woman in one way or another expressed the same sentiment  it was patent that they resented bitterly the sensational and untruthful way in which they have been exploited in the past  in spite of the fact that they are afflicted by disease the lepers form a happy colony divided into two villages and numerous country and seaside homes of nearly a thousand souls  they have six churches a young mens christian association building several assembly halls a band stand a racetrack baseball grounds shooting ranges an athletic club numerous glee clubs and two brass bands  they are so contented down there mr pinkham told me that you cant drive them away with a shotgun  this i later verified for myself  in january of this year eleven of the lepers on whom the disease after having committed certain ravages showed no further signs of activity were brought back to honolulu for reexamination  they were loath to come and on being asked whether or not they wanted to go free if found clean of leprosy one and all answered back to molokai  in the old days before the discovery of the leprosy bacillus a small number of men and women suffering from various and wholly different diseases were adjudged lepers and sent to molokai  years afterward they suffered great consternation when the bacteriologists declared that they were not afflicted with leprosy and never had been  they fought against being sent away from molokai and in one way or another as helpers and nurses they got jobs from the board of health and remained  the present jailer is one of these men declared to be a nonleper he accepted on salary the charge of the jail in order to escape being sent away  at the present moment in honolulu there is a bootblack  he is an american negro  mr mcveigh told me about him  long ago before the bacteriological tests he was sent to molokai as a leper  as a ward of the state he developed a superlative degree of independence and fomented much petty mischief  and then one day after having been for years a perennial source of minor annoyances the bacteriological test was applied and he was declared a nonleper  ah ha chortled mr mcveigh  now ive got you  out you go on the next steamer and good riddance  but the negro didnt want to go  immediately he married an old woman in the last stages of leprosy and began petitioning the board of health for permission to remain and nurse his sick wife there was no one he said pathetically who could take care of his poor wife as well as he could  but they saw through his game and he was deported on the steamer and given the freedom of the world but he preferred molokai  landing on the leeward side of molokai he sneaked down the pali one night and took up his abode in the settlement  he was apprehended tried and convicted of trespass sentenced to pay a small fine and again deported on the steamer with the warning that if he trespassed again he would be fined one hundred dollars and be sent to prison in honolulu  and now when mr mcveigh comes up to honolulu the bootblack shines his shoes for him and says  say boss i lost a good home down there  yes sir i lost a good home  then his voice sinks to a confidential whisper as he says say boss cant i go back  cant you fix it for me so as i can go back  he had lived nine years on molokai and he had had a better time there than he has ever had before and after on the outside  as regards the fear of leprosy itself nowhere in the settlement among lepers or nonlepers did i see any sign of it  the chief horror of leprosy obtains in the minds of those who have never seen a leper and who do not know anything about the disease  at the hotel at waikiki a lady expressed shuddering amazement at my having the hardihood to pay a visit to the settlement  on talking with her i learned that she had been born in honolulu had lived there all her life and had never laid eyes on a leper  that was more than i could say of myself in the united states where the segregation of lepers is loosely enforced and where i have repeatedly seen lepers on the streets of large cities  leprosy is terrible there is no getting away from that but from what little i know of the disease and its degree of contagiousness i would by far prefer to spend the rest of my days in molokai than in any tuberculosis sanatorium  in every city and county hospital for poor people in the united states or in similar institutions in other countries sights as terrible as those in molokai can be witnessed and the sum total of these sights is vastly more terrible  for that matter if it were given me to choose between being compelled to live in molokai for the rest of my life or in the east end of london the east side of new york or the stockyards of chicago i would select molokai without debate  i would prefer one year of life in molokai to five years of life in the above mentioned cesspools of human degradation and misery  in molokai the people are happy  i shall never forget the celebration of the fourth of july i witnessed there  at six oclock in the morning the horribles were out dressed fantastically astride horses mules and donkeys their own property and cutting capers all over the settlement  two brass bands were out as well then there were the pau riders thirty or forty of them hawaiian women all superb horsewomen dressed gorgeously in the old native riding costume and dashing about in twos and threes and groups  in the afternoon charmian and i stood in the judges stand and awarded the prizes for horsemanship and costume to the pau riders  all about were the hundreds of lepers with wreaths of flowers on heads and necks and shoulders looking on and making merry  and always over the brows of hills and across the grassy level stretches appearing and disappearing were the groups of men and women gaily dressed on galloping horses horses and riders flowerbedecked and flowergarlanded singing and laughing and riding like the wind and as i stood in the judges stand and looked at all this there came to my recollection the lazar house of havana where i had once beheld some two hundred lepers prisoners inside four restricted walls until they died  no there are a few thousand places i wot of in this world over which i would select molokai as a place of permanent residence  in the evening we went to one of the leper assembly halls where before a crowded audience the singing societies contested for prizes and where the night wound up with a dance  i have seen the hawaiians living in the slums of honolulu and having seen them i can readily understand why the lepers brought up from the settlement for reexamination shouted one and all back to molokai  one thing is certain  the leper in the settlement is far better off than the leper who lies in hiding outside  such a leper is a lonely outcast living in constant fear of discovery and slowly and surely rotting away  the action of leprosy is not steady  it lays hold of its victim commits a ravage and then lies dormant for an indeterminate period  it may not commit another ravage for five years or ten years or forty years and the patient may enjoy uninterrupted good health  rarely however do these first ravages cease of themselves  the skilled surgeon is required and the skilled surgeon cannot be called in for the leper who is in hiding for instance the first ravage may take the form of a perforating ulcer in the sole of the foot  when the bone is reached necrosis sets in  if the leper is in hiding he cannot be operated upon the necrosis will continue to eat its way up the bone of the leg and in a brief and horrible time that leper will die of gangrene or some other terrible complication  on the other hand if that same leper is in molokai the surgeon will operate upon the foot remove the ulcer cleanse the bone and put a complete stop to that particular ravage of the disease  a month after the operation the leper will be out riding horseback running foot races swimming in the breakers or climbing the giddy sides of the valleys for mountain apples  and as has been stated before the disease lying dormant may not again attack him for five ten or forty years  the old horrors of leprosy go back to the conditions that obtained before the days of antiseptic surgery and before the time when physicians like dr goodhue and dr hollmann went to live at the settlement  dr goodhue is the pioneer surgeon there and too much praise cannot be given him for the noble work he has done  i spent one morning in the operating room with him and of the three operations he performed two were on men newcomers who had arrived on the same steamer with me  in each case the disease had attacked in one spot only  one had a perforating ulcer in the ankle well advanced and the other man was suffering from a similar affliction well advanced under his arm  both cases were well advanced because the man had been on the outside and had not been treated  in each case  dr goodhue put an immediate and complete stop to the ravage and in four weeks those two men will be as well and ablebodied as they ever were in their lives  the only difference between them and you or me is that the disease is lying dormant in their bodies and may at any future time commit another ravage  leprosy is as old as history  references to it are found in the earliest written records  and yet today practically nothing more is known about it than was known then  this much was known then namely that it was contagious and that those afflicted by it should be segregated  the difference between then and now is that today the leper is more rigidly segregated and more humanely treated  but leprosy itself still remains the same awful and profound mystery  a reading of the reports of the physicians and specialists of all countries reveals the baffling nature of the disease  these leprosy specialists are unanimous on no one phase of the disease  they do not know  in the past they rashly and dogmatically generalized they generalize no longer  the one possible generalization that can be drawn from all the investigation that has been made is that leprosy is feebly contagious  but in what manner it is feebly contagious is not known  they have isolated the bacillus of leprosy  they can determine by bacteriological examination whether or not a person is a leper but they are as far away as ever from knowing how that bacillus finds its entrance into the body of a non leper  they do not know the length of time of incubation  they have tried to inoculate all sorts of animals with leprosy and have failed  they are baffled in the discovery of a serum wherewith to fight the disease  and in all their work as yet they have found no clue no cure  sometimes there have been blazes of hope theories of causation and much heralded cures but every time the darkness of failure quenched the flame  a doctor insists that the cause of leprosy is a longcontinued fish diet and he proves his theory voluminously till a physician from the highlands of india demands why the natives of that district should therefore be afflicted by leprosy when they have never eaten fish nor all the generations of their fathers before them  a man treats a leper with a certain kind of oil or drug announces a cure and five ten or forty years afterwards the disease breaks out again  it is this trick of leprosy lying dormant in the body for indeterminate periods that is responsible for many alleged cures  but this much is certain  as yet there has been no authentic case of a cure  leprosy is feebly contagious but how is it contagious  an austrian physician has inoculated himself and his assistants with leprosy and failed to catch it  but this is not conclusive for there is the famous case of the hawaiian murderer who had his sentence of death commuted to life imprisonment on his agreeing to be inoculated with the bacillus leprae  some time after inoculation leprosy made its appearance and the man died a leper on molokai  nor was this conclusive for it was discovered that at the time he was inoculated several members of his family were already suffering from the disease on molokai  he may have contracted the disease from them and it may have been well along in its mysterious period of incubation at the time he was officially inoculated  then there is the case of that hero of the church father damien who went to molokai a clean man and died a leper  there have been many theories as to how he contracted leprosy but nobody knows  he never knew himself  but every chance that he ran has certainly been run by a woman at present living in the settlement who has lived there many years who has had five leper husbands and had children by them and who is today as she always has been free of the disease  as yet no light has been shed upon the mystery of leprosy  when more is learned about the disease a cure for it may be expected once an efficacious serum is discovered and leprosy because it is so feebly contagious will pass away swiftly from the earth  the battle waged with it will be short and sharp  in the meantime how to discover that serum or some other unguessed weapon  in the present it is a serious matter  it is estimated that there are half a million lepers not segregated in india alone  carnegie libraries rockefeller universities and many similar benefactions are all very well but one cannot help thinking how far a few thousands of dollars would go say in the leper settlement of molokai  the residents there are accidents of fate scapegoats to some mysterious natural law of which man knows nothing isolated for the welfare of their fellows who else might catch the dread disease even as they have caught it nobody knows how  not for their sakes merely but for the sake of future generations a few thousands of dollars would go far in a legitimate and scientific search after a cure for leprosy for a serum or for some undreamed discovery that will enable the medical world to exterminate the bacillus leprae theres the place for your money you philanthropists    chapter viiithe house of the sun    there are hosts of people who journey like restless spirits round and about this earth in search of seascapes and landscapes and the wonders and beauties of nature  they overrun europe in armies they can be met in droves and herds in florida and the west indies at the pyramids and on the slopes and summits of the canadian and american rockies but in the house of the sun they are as rare as live and wriggling dinosaurs  haleakala is the hawaiian name for the house of the sun  it is a noble dwelling situated on the island of maui but so few tourists have ever peeped into it much less entered it that their number may be practically reckoned as zero  yet i venture to state that for natural beauty and wonder the naturelover may see dissimilar things as great as haleakala but no greater while he will never see elsewhere anything more beautiful or wonderful  honolulu is six days steaming from san francisco maui is a nights run on the steamer from honolulu and six hours more if he is in a hurry can bring the traveller to kolikoli which is ten thousand and thirtytwo feet above the sea and which stands hard by the entrance portal to the house of the sun  yet the tourist comes not and haleakala sleeps on in lonely and unseen grandeur  not being tourists we of the snark went to haleakala  on the slopes of that monster mountain there is a cattle ranch of some fifty thousand acres where we spent the night at an altitude of two thousand feet  the next morning it was boots and saddles and with cowboys and packhorses we climbed to ukulele a mountain ranch house the altitude of which fiftyfive hundred feet gives a severely temperate climate compelling blankets at night and a roaring fireplace in the livingroom  ukulele by the way is the hawaiian for jumping flea as it is also the hawaiian for a certain musical instrument that may be likened to a young guitar  it is my opinion that the mountain ranchhouse was named after the young guitar  we were not in a hurry and we spent the day at ukulele learnedly discussing altitudes and barometers and shaking our particular barometer whenever any ones argument stood in need of demonstration  our barometer was the most graciously acquiescent instrument i have ever seen  also we gathered mountain raspberries large as hens eggs and larger gazed up the pasture covered lava slopes to the summit of haleakala fortyfive hundred feet above us and looked down upon a mighty battle of the clouds that was being fought beneath us ourselves in the bright sunshine  every day and every day this unending battle goes on  ukiukiu is the name of the tradewind that comes raging down out of the north east and hurls itself upon haleakala  now haleakala is so bulky and tall that it turns the northeast tradewind aside on either hand so that in the lee of haleakala no tradewind blows at all  on the contrary the wind blows in the counter direction in the teeth of the northeast trade  this wind is called naulu  and day and night and always ukiukiu and naulu strive with each other advancing retreating flanking curving curling and turning and twisting the conflict made visible by the cloudmasses plucked from the heavens and hurled back and forth in squadrons battalions armies and great mountain ranges  once in a while ukiukiu in mighty gusts flings immense cloudmasses clear over the summit of haleakala whereupon naulu craftily captures them lines them up in new battleformation and with them smites back at his ancient and eternal antagonist  then ukiukiu sends a great cloudarmy around the easternside of the mountain  it is a flanking movement well executed  but naulu from his lair on the leeward side gathers the flanking army in pulling and twisting and dragging it hammering it into shape and sends it charging back against ukiukiu around the western side of the mountain  and all the while above and below the main battlefield high up the slopes toward the sea ukiukiu and naulu are continually sending out little wisps of cloud in ragged skirmish line that creep and crawl over the ground among the trees and through the canyons and that spring upon and capture one another in sudden ambuscades and sorties  and sometimes ukiukiu or naulu abruptly sending out a heavy charging column captures the ragged little skirmishers or drives them skyward turning over and over in vertical whirls thousands of feet in the air  but it is on the western slopes of haleakala that the main battle goes on  here naulu masses his heaviest formations and wins his greatest victories  ukiukiu grows weak toward late afternoon which is the way of all tradewinds and is driven backward by naulu naulus generalship is excellent  all day he has been gathering and packing away immense reserves  as the afternoon draws on he welds them into a solid column sharppointed miles in length a mile in width and hundreds of feet thick  this column he slowly thrusts forward into the broad battlefront of ukiukiu and slowly and surely ukiukiu weakening fast is split asunder  but it is not all bloodless  at times ukiukiu struggles wildly and with fresh accessions of strength from the limitless northeast smashes away half a mile at a time of naulus column and sweeps it off and away toward west maui  sometimes when the two charging armies meet end on a tremendous perpendicular whirl results the cloudmasses locked together mounting thousands of feet into the air and turning over and over  a favourite device of ukiukiu is to send a low squat formation densely packed forward along the ground and under naulu  when ukiukiu is under he proceeds to buck  naulus mighty middle gives to the blow and bends upward but usually he turns the attacking column back upon itself and sets it milling  and all the while the ragged little skirmishers stray and detached sneak through the trees and canyons crawl along and through the grass and surprise one another with unexpected leaps and rushes while above far above serene and lonely in the rays of the setting sun haleakala looks down upon the conflict  and so the night  but in the morning after the fashion of tradewinds ukiukiu gathers strength and sends the hosts of naulu rolling back in confusion and rout  and one day is like another day in the battle of the clouds where ukiukiu and naulu strive eternally on the slopes of haleakala  again in the morning it was boots and saddles cowboys and packhorses and the climb to the top began  one packhorse carried twenty gallons of water slung in fivegallon bags on either side for water is precious and rare in the crater itself in spite of the fact that several miles to the north and east of the craterrim more rain comes down than in any other place in the world  the way led upward across countless lava flows without regard for trails and never have i seen horses with such perfect footing as that of the thirteen that composed our outfit  they climbed or dropped down perpendicular places with the sureness and coolness of mountain goats and never a horse fell or baulked  there is a familiar and strange illusion experienced by all who climb isolated mountains  the higher one climbs the more of the earths surface becomes visible and the effect of this is that the horizon seems uphill from the observer  this illusion is especially notable on haleakala for the old volcano rises directly from the sea without buttresses or connecting ranges  in consequence as fast as we climbed up the grim slope of haleakala still faster did haleakala ourselves and all about us sink down into the centre of what appeared a profound abyss  everywhere far above us towered the horizon  the ocean sloped down from the horizon to us  the higher we climbed the deeper did we seem to sink down the farther above us shone the horizon and the steeper pitched the grade up to that horizontal line where sky and ocean met  it was weird and unreal and vagrant thoughts of simms hole and of the volcano through which jules verne journeyed to the centre of the earth flitted through ones mind  and then when at last we reached the summit of that monster mountain which summit was like the bottom of an inverted cone situated in the centre of an awful cosmic pit we found that we were at neither top nor bottom  far above us was the heaventowering horizon and far beneath us where the top of the mountain should have been was a deeper deep the great crater the house of the sun  twentythree miles around stretched the dizzy wells of the crater  we stood on the edge of the nearly vertical western wall and the floor of the crater lay nearly half a mile beneath  this floor broken by lavaflows and cindercones was as red and fresh and uneroded as if it were but yesterday that the fires went out the cindercones the smallest over four hundred feet in height and the largest over nine hundred seemed no more than puny little sand hills so mighty was the magnitude of the setting  two gaps thousands of feet deep broke the rim of the crater and through these ukiukiu vainly strove to drive his fleecy herds of tradewind clouds  as fast as they advanced through the gaps the heat of the crater dissipated them into thin air and though they advanced always they got nowhere  it was a scene of vast bleakness and desolation stern forbidding fascinating  we gazed down upon a place of fire and earthquake the tieribs of earth lay bare before us  it was a workshop of nature still cluttered with the raw beginnings of worldmaking here and there great dikes of primordial rock had thrust themselves up from the bowels of earth straight through the molten surface ferment that had evidently cooled only the other day  it was all unreal and unbelievable  looking upward far above us in reality beneath us floated the cloudbattle of ukiukiu and naulu  and higher up the slope of the seeming abyss above the cloudbattle in the air and sky hung the islands of lanai and molokai  across the crater to the southeast still apparently looking upward we saw ascending first the turquoise sea then the white surfline of the shore of hawaii above that the belt of tradeclouds and next eighty miles away rearing their stupendous hulks out of the azure sky tipped with snow wreathed with cloud trembling like a mirage the peaks of mauna kea and mauna loa hung poised on the wall of heaven  it is told that long ago one maui the son of hina lived on what is now known as west maui  his mother hina employed her time in the making of kapas  she must have made them at night for her days were occupied in trying to dry the kapas  each morning and all morning she toiled at spreading them out in the sun  but no sooner were they out than she began taking them in in order to have them all under shelter for the night  for know that the days were shorter then than now  maui watched his mothers futile toil and felt sorry for her  he decided to do somethingoh no not to help her hang out and take in the kapas  he was too clever for that his idea was to make the sun go slower  perhaps he was the first hawaiian astronomer  at any rate he took a series of observations of the sun from various parts of the island  his conclusion was that the suns path was directly across haleakala  unlike joshua he stood in no need of divine assistance  he gathered a huge quantity of coconuts from the fibre of which he braided a stout cord and in one end of which he made a noose even as the cowboys of haleakala do to this day  next he climbed into the house of the sun and laid in wait  when the sun came tearing along the path bent on completing its journey in the shortest time possible the valiant youth threw his lariat around one of the suns largest and strongest beams  he made the sun slow down some also he broke the beam short off  and he kept on roping and breaking off beams till the sun said it was willing to listen to reason  maui set forth his terms of peace which the sun accepted agreeing to go more slowly thereafter  wherefore hina had ample time in which to dry her kapas and the days are longer than they used to be which last is quite in accord with the teachings of modern astronomy  we had a lunch of jerked beef and hard poi in a stone corral used of old time for the nightimpounding of cattle being driven across the island  then we skirted the rim for half a mile and began the descent into the crater  twentyfive hundred feet beneath lay the floor and down a steep slope of loose volcanic cinders we dropped the surefooted horses slipping and sliding but always keeping their feet  the black surface of the cinders when broken by the horses hoofs turned to a yellow ochre dust virulent in appearance and acid of taste that arose in clouds  there was a gallop across a level stretch to the mouth of a convenient blowhole and then the descent continued in clouds of volcanic dust winding in and out among cindercones brickred old rose and purplish black of colour  above us higher and higher towered the craterwalls while we journeyed on across innumerable lavaflows turning and twisting a devious way among the adamantine billows of a petrified sea  sawtoothed waves of lava vexed the surface of this weird ocean while on either hand arose jagged crests and spiracles of fantastic shape  our way led on past a bottomless pit and along and over the main stream of the latest lavaflow for seven miles  at the lower end of the crater was our camping spot in a small grove of olapa and kolea trees tucked away in a corner of the crater at the base of walls that rose perpendicularly fifteen hundred feet  here was pasturage for the horses but no water and first we turned aside and picked our way across a mile of lava to a known waterhole in a crevice in the craterwall  the waterhole was empty  but on climbing fifty feet up the crevice a pool was found containing half a dozen barrels of water  a pail was carried up and soon a steady stream of the precious liquid was running down the rock and filling the lower pool while the cowboys below were busy fighting the horses back for there was room for one only to drink at a time  then it was on to camp at the foot of the wall up which herds of wild goats scrambled and blatted while the tent arose to the sound of riflefiring  jerked beef hard poi and broiled kid were the menu  over the crest of the crater just above our heads rolled a sea of clouds driven on by ukiukiu  though this sea rolled over the crest unceasingly it never blotted out nor dimmed the moon for the heat of the crater dissolved the clouds as fast as they rolled in  through the moonlight attracted by the campfire came the crater cattle to peer and challenge  they were rolling fat though they rarely drank water the morning dew on the grass taking its place  it was because of this dew that the tent made a welcome bedchamber and we fell asleep to the chanting of hulas by the unwearied hawaiian cowboys in whose veins no doubt ran the blood of maui their valiant forebear  the camera cannot do justice to the house of the sun  the sublimated chemistry of photography may not lie but it certainly does not tell all the truth  the koolau gap may be faithfully reproduced just as it impinged on the retina of the camera yet in the resulting picture the gigantic scale of things would be missing those walls that seem several hundred feet in height are almost as many thousand that entering wedge of cloud is a mile and a half wide in the gap itself while beyond the gap it is a veritable ocean and that foreground of cindercone and volcanic ash mushy and colourless in appearance is in truth gorgeoushued in brick red terracotta rose yellow ochre and purplish black  also words are a vain thing and drive to despair  to say that a crater wall is two thousand feet high is to say just precisely that it is two thousand feet high but there is a vast deal more to that craterwall than a mere statistic  the sun is ninetythree millions of miles distant but to mortal conception the adjoining county is farther away  this frailty of the human brain is hard on the sun it is likewise hard on the house of the sun  haleakala has a message of beauty and wonder for the human soul that cannot be delivered by proxy  kolikoli is six hours from kahului kahului is a nights run from honolulu honolulu is six days from san francisco and there you are  we climbed the craterwalls put the horses over impossible places rolled stones and shot wild goats  i did not get any goats  i was too busy rolling stones  one spot in particular i remember where we started a stone the size of a horse  it began the descent easy enough rolling over wobbling and threatening to stop but in a few minutes it was soaring through the air two hundred feet at a jump  it grew rapidly smaller until it struck a slight slope of volcanic sand over which it darted like a startled jackrabbit kicking up behind it a tiny trail of yellow dust  stone and dust diminished in size until some of the party said the stone had stopped  that was because they could not see it any longer  it had vanished into the distance beyond their ken  others saw it rolling farther oni know i did and it is my firm conviction that that stone is still rolling  our last day in the crater ukiukiu gave us a taste of his strength he smashed naulu back all along the line filled the house of the sun to overflowing with clouds and drowned us out  our raingauge was a pint cup under a tiny hole in the tent  that last night of storm and rain filled the cup and there was no way of measuring the water that spilled over into the blankets  with the raingauge out of business there was no longer any reason for remaining so we broke camp in the wetgray of dawn and plunged eastward across the lava to the kaupo gap  east maui is nothing more or less than the vast lava stream that flowed long ago through the kaupo gap and down this stream we picked our way from an altitude of six thousand five hundred feet to the sea  this was a days work in itself for the horses but never were there such horses  safe in the bad places never rushing never losing their heads as soon as they found a trail wide and smooth enough to run on they ran  there was no stopping them until the trail became bad again and then they stopped of themselves  continuously for days they had performed the hardest kind of work and fed most of the time on grass foraged by themselves at night while we slept and yet that day they covered twentyeight legbreaking miles and galloped into hana like a bunch of colts  also there were several of them reared in the dry region on the leeward side of haleakala that had never worn shoes in all their lives  day after day and all day long unshod they had travelled over the sharp lava with the extra weight of a man on their backs and their hoofs were in better condition than those of the shod horses  the scenery between vieirass where the kaupo gap empties into the sea and lana which we covered in half a day is well worth a week or month but wildly beautiful as it is it becomes pale and small in comparison with the wonderland that lies beyond the rubber plantations between hana and the honomanu gulch  two days were required to cover this marvellous stretch which lies on the windward side of haleakala  the people who dwell there call it the ditch country an unprepossessing name but it has no other nobody else ever comes there  nobody else knows anything about it with the exception of a handful of men whom business has brought there nobody has heard of the ditch country of maui  now a ditch is a ditch assumably muddy and usually traversing uninteresting and monotonous landscapes  but the nahiku ditch is not an ordinary ditch  the windward side of haleakala is serried by a thousand precipitous gorges down which rush as many torrents each torrent of which achieves a score of cascades and waterfalls before it reaches the sea  more rain comes down here than in any other region in the world  in 1904 the years downpour was four hundred and twenty inches  water means sugar and sugar is the backbone of the territory of hawaii wherefore the nahiku ditch which is not a ditch but a chain of tunnels  the water travels underground appearing only at intervals to leap a gorge travelling high in the air on a giddy flume and plunging into and through the opposing mountain  this magnificent waterway is called a ditch and with equal appropriateness can cleopatras barge be called a boxcar  there are no carriage roads through the ditch country and before the ditch was built or bored rather there was no horsetrail hundreds of inches of rain annually on fertile soil under a tropic sun means a steaming jungle of vegetation  a man on foot cutting his way through might advance a mile a day but at the end of a week he would be a wreck and he would have to crawl hastily back if he wanted to get out before the vegetation overran the passage way he had cut  oshaughnessy was the daring engineer who conquered the jungle and the gorges ran the ditch and made the horsetrail  he built enduringly in concrete and masonry and made one of the most remarkable waterfarms in the world  every little runlet and dribble is harvested and conveyed by subterranean channels to the main ditch  but so heavily does it rain at times that countless spillways let the surplus escape to the sea  the horsetrail is not very wide  like the engineer who built it it dares anything  where the ditch plunges through the mountain it climbs over and where the ditch leaps a gorge on a flume the horsetrail takes advantage of the ditch and crosses on top of the flume  that careless trail thinks nothing of travelling up or down the faces of precipices  it gouges its narrow way out of the wall dodging around waterfalls or passing under them where they thunder down in white fury while straight overhead the wall rises hundreds of feet and straight beneath it sinks a thousand  and those marvellous mountain horses are as unconcerned as the trail  they foxtrot along it as a matter of course though the footing is slippery with rain and they will gallop with their hind feet slipping over the edge if you let them  i advise only those with steady nerves and cool heads to tackle the nahiku ditch trail  one of our cowboys was noted as the strongest and bravest on the big ranch  he had ridden mountain horses all his life on the rugged western slopes of haleakala  he was first in the horsebreaking and when the others hung back as a matter of course he would go in to meet a wild bull in the cattlepen  he had a reputation  but he had never ridden over the nahiku ditch  it was there he lost his reputation  when he faced the first flume spanning a hairraising gorge narrow without railings with a bellowing waterfall above another below and directly beneath a wild cascade the air filled with driving spray and rocking to the clamour and rush of sound and motionwell that cowboy dismounted from his horse explained briefly that he had a wife and two children and crossed over on foot leading the horse behind him  the only relief from the flumes was the precipices and the only relief from the precipices was the flumes except where the ditch was far under ground in which case we crossed one horse and rider at a time on primitive logbridges that swayed and teetered and threatened to carry away  i confess that at first i rode such places with my feet loose in the stirrups and that on the sheer walls i saw to it by a definite conscious act of will that the foot in the outside stirrup overhanging the thousand feet of fall was exceedingly loose  i say at first for as in the crater itself we quickly lost our conception of magnitude so on the nahiku ditch we quickly lost our apprehension of depth  the ceaseless iteration of height and depth produced a state of consciousness in which height and depth were accepted as the ordinary conditions of existence and from the horses back to look sheer down four hundred or five hundred feet became quite commonplace and nonproductive of thrills  and as carelessly as the trail and the horses we swung along the dizzy heights and ducked around or through the waterfalls  and such a ride  falling water was everywhere  we rode above the clouds under the clouds and through the clouds and every now and then a shaft of sunshine penetrated like a searchlight to the depths yawning beneath us or flashed upon some pinnacle of the craterrim thousands of feet above  at every turn of the trail a waterfall or a dozen waterfalls leaping hundreds of feet through the air burst upon our vision  at our first nights camp in the keanae gulch we counted thirtytwo waterfalls from a single viewpoint  the vegetation ran riot over that wild land  there were forests of koa and kolea trees and candlenut trees and then there were the trees called ohiaai which bore red mountain apples mellow and juicy and most excellent to eat  wild bananas grew everywhere clinging to the sides of the gorges and overborne by their great bunches of ripe fruit falling across the trail and blocking the way  and over the forest surged a sea of green life the climbers of a thousand varieties some that floated airily in lacelike filaments from the tallest branches others that coiled and wound about the trees like huge serpents and one the eiei that was for all the world like a climbing palm swinging on a thick stem from branch to branch and tree to tree and throttling the supports whereby it climbed  through the sea of green lofty treeferns thrust their great delicate fronds and the lehua flaunted its scarlet blossoms  underneath the climbers in no less profusion grew the warmcoloured strangelymarked plants that in the united states one is accustomed to seeing preciously conserved in hot houses  in fact the ditch country of maui is nothing more nor less than a huge conservatory  every familiar variety of fern flourishes and more varieties that are unfamiliar from the tiniest maidenhair to the gross and voracious staghorn the latter the terror of the woodsmen interlacing with itself in tangled masses five or six feet deep and covering acres  never was there such a ride  for two days it lasted when we emerged into rolling country and along an actual wagonroad came home to the ranch at a gallop  i know it was cruel to gallop the horses after such a long hard journey but we blistered our hands in vain effort to hold them in  thats the sort of horses they grow on haleakala  at the ranch there was great festival of cattle driving branding and horsebreaking  overhead ukiukiu and naulu battled valiantly and far above in the sunshine towered the mighty summit of haleakala    chapter ixa pacific traverse    sandwich islands to tahitithere is great difficulty in making this passage across the trades  the whalers and all others speak with great doubt of fetching tahiti from the sandwich islands capt  bruce says that a vessel should keep to the northward until she gets a start of wind before bearing for her destination  in his passage between them in november 1837 he had no variables near the line in coming south and never could make easting on either tack though he endeavoured by every means to do so  so say the sailing directions for the south pacific ocean and that is all they say  there is not a word more to help the weary voyager in making this long traversenor is there any word at all concerning the passage from hawaii to the marquesas which lie some eight hundred miles to the northeast of tahiti and which are the more difficult to reach by just that much  the reason for the lack of directions is i imagine that no voyager is supposed to make himself weary by attempting so impossible a traverse  but the impossible did not deter the snarkprincipally because of the fact that we did not read that particular little paragraph in the sailing directions until after we had started  we sailed from hilo hawaii on october 7 and arrived at nukahiva in the marquesas on december 6  the distance was two thousand miles as the crow flies while we actually travelled at least four thousand miles to accomplish it thus proving for once and for ever that the shortest distance between two points is not always a straight line  had we headed directly for the marquesas we might have travelled five or six thousand miles  upon one thing we were resolved  we would not cross the line west of 130 degrees west longitude  for here was the problem  to cross the line to the west of that point if the southeast trades were well around to the southeast would throw us so far to leeward of the marquesas that a headbeat would be maddeningly impossible also we had to remember the equatorial current which moves west at a rate of anywhere from twelve to seventyfive miles a day  a pretty pickle indeed to be to leeward of our destination with such a current in our teeth  no not a minute nor a second west of 130 degrees west longitude would we cross the line  but since the southeast trades were to be expected five or six degrees north of the line which if they were well around to the southeast or south southeast would necessitate our sliding off toward south southwest we should have to hold to the eastward north of the line and north of the southeast trades until we gained at least 128 degrees west longitude  i have forgotten to mention that the seventyhorsepower gasolene engine as usual was not working and that we could depend upon wind alone  neither was the launch engine working  and while i am about it i may as well confess that the fivehorsepower which ran the lights fans and pumps was also on the sicklist  a striking title for a book haunts me waking and sleeping  i should like to write that book some day and to call it around the world with three gasolene engines and a wife  but i am afraid i shall not write it for fear of hurting the feelings of some of the young gentlemen of san francisco honolulu and hilo who learned their trades at the expense of the snarks engines  it looked easy on paper  here was hilo and there was our objective 128 degrees west longitude  with the northeast trade blowing we could travel a straight line between the two points and even slack our sheets off a goodly bit  but one of the chief troubles with the trades is that one never knows just where he will pick them up and just in what direction they will be blowing  we picked up the northeast trade right outside of hilo harbour but the miserable breeze was away around into the east  then there was the north equatorial current setting westward like a mighty river furthermore a small boat by the wind and bucking into a big headsea does not work to advantage  she jogs up and down and gets nowhere  her sails are full and straining every little while she presses her leerail under she flounders and bumps and splashes and that is all  whenever she begins to gather way she runs ker chug into a big mountain of water and is brought to a standstill so with the snark the resultant of her smallness of the trade around into the east and of the strong equatorial current was a long sag south  oh she did not go quite south  but the easting she made was distressing  on october 11 she made forty miles easting october 12 fifteen miles october 13 no easting october 14 thirty miles october 15 twentythree miles october 16 eleven miles and on october 17 she actually went to the westward four miles  thus in a week she made one hundred and fifteen miles easting which was equivalent to sixteen miles a day  but between the longitude of hilo and 128 degrees west longitude is a difference of twentyseven degrees or roughly sixteen hundred miles  at sixteen miles a day one hundred days would be required to accomplish this distance  and even then our objective l28 degrees west longitude was five degrees north of the line while nukahiva in the marquesas lay nine degrees south of the line and twelve degrees to the west  there remained only one thing to doto work south out of the trade and into the variables  it is true that captain bruce found no variables on his traverse and that he never could make easting on either tack  it was the variables or nothing with us and we prayed for better luck than he had had  the variables constitute the belt of ocean lying between the trades and the doldrums and are conjectured to be the draughts of heated air which rise in the doldrums flow high in the air counter to the trades and gradually sink down till they fan the surface of the ocean where they are found  and they are found where they are found for they are wedged between the trades and the doldrums which same shift their territory from day to day and month to month  we found the variables in 11 degrees north latitude and 11 degrees north latitude we hugged jealously  to the south lay the doldrums to the north lay the northeast trade that refused to blow from the northeast  the days came and went and always they found the snark somewhere near the eleventh parallel  the variables were truly variable  a light headwind would die away and leave us rolling in a calm for fortyeight hours  then a light headwind would spring up blow for three hours and leave us rolling in another calm for fortyeight hours  thenhurrahthe wind would come out of the west fresh beautifully fresh and send the snark along wing and wing her wake bubbling the logline straight astern  at the end of half an hour while we were preparing to set the spinnaker with a few sickly gasps the wind would die away  and so it went  we wagered optimistically on every favourable fan of air that lasted over five minutes but it never did any good  the fans faded out just the same  but there were exceptions  in the variables if you wait long enough something is bound to happen and we were so plentifully stocked with food and water that we could afford to wait  on october 26 we actually made one hundred and three miles of easting and we talked about it for days afterwards  once we caught a moderate gale from the south which blew itself out in eight hours but it helped us to seventyone miles of easting in that particular twentyfour hours  and then just as it was expiring the wind came straight out from the north the directly opposite quarter and fanned us along over another degree of easting  in years and years no sailing vessel has attempted this traverse and we found ourselves in the midst of one of the loneliest of the pacific solitudes  in the sixty days we were crossing it we sighted no sail lifted no steamers smoke above the horizon  a disabled vessel could drift in this deserted expanse for a dozen generations and there would be no rescue  the only chance of rescue would be from a vessel like the snark and the snark happened to be there principally because of the fact that the traverse had been begun before the particular paragraph in the sailing directions had been read  standing upright on deck a straight line drawn from the eye to the horizon would measure three miles and a half  thus seven miles was the diameter of the circle of the sea in which we had our centre  since we remained always in the centre and since we constantly were moving in some direction we looked upon many circles  but all circles looked alike  no tufted islets gray headlands nor glistening patches of white canvas ever marred the symmetry of that unbroken curve  clouds came and went rising up over the rim of the circle flowing across the space of it and spilling away and down across the opposite rim  the world faded as the procession of the weeks marched by  the world faded until at last there ceased to be any world except the little world of the snark freighted with her seven souls and floating on the expanse of the waters  our memories of the world the great world became like dreams of former lives we had lived somewhere before we came to be born on the snark  after we had been out of fresh vegetables for some time we mentioned such things in much the same way i have heard my father mention the vanished apples of his boyhood  man is a creature of habit and we on the snark had got the habit of the snark  everything about her and aboard her was as a matter of course and anything different would have been an irritation and an offence  there was no way by which the great world could intrude  our bell rang the hours but no caller ever rang it  there were no guests to dinner no telegrams no insistent telephone jangles invading our privacy  we had no engagements to keep no trains to catch and there were no morning newspapers over which to waste time in learning what was happening to our fifteen hundred million other fellowcreatures  but it was not dull  the affairs of our little world had to be regulated and unlike the great world our world had to be steered in its journey through space  also there were cosmic disturbances to be encountered and baffled such as do not afflict the big earth in its frictionless orbit through the windless void  and we never knew from moment to moment what was going to happen next  there were spice and variety enough and to spare  thus at four in the morning i relieve hermann at the wheel  eastnortheast he gives me the course  shes eight points off but she aint steering  small wonder  the vessel does not exist that can be steered in so absolute a calm  i had a breeze a little while agomaybe it will come back again hermann says hopefully ere he starts forward to the cabin and his bunk  the mizzen is in and fast furled  in the night what of the roll and the absence of wind it had made life too hideous to be permitted to go on rasping at the mast smashing at the tackles and buffeting the empty air into hollow outbursts of sound  but the big mainsail is still on and the staysail jib and flyingjib are snapping and slashing at their sheets with every roll  every star is out  just for luck i put the wheel hard over in the opposite direction to which it had been left by hermann and i lean back and gaze up at the stars  there is nothing else for me to do  there is nothing to be done with a sailing vessel rolling in a stark calm  then i feel a fan on my cheek faint so faint that i can just sense it ere it is gone  but another comes and another until a real and just perceptible breeze is blowing  how the snarks sails manage to feel it is beyond me but feel it they do as she does as well for the compass card begins slowly to revolve in the binnacle in reality it is not revolving at all  it is held by terrestrial magnetism in one place and it is the snark that is revolving pivoted upon that delicate cardboard device that floats in a closed vessel of alcohol  so the snark comes back on her course  the breath increases to a tiny puff  the snark feels the weight of it and actually heels over a trifle  there is flying scud overhead and i notice the stars being blotted out  walls of darkness close in upon me so that when the last star is gone the darkness is so near that it seems i can reach out and touch it on every side  when i lean toward it i can feel it loom against my face  puff follows puff and i am glad the mizzen is furled  phew that was a stiff one  the snark goes over and down until her leerail is buried and the whole pacific ocean is pouring in  four or five of these gusts make me wish that the jib and flyingjib were in  the sea is picking up the gusts are growing stronger and more frequent and there is a splatter of wet in the air  there is no use in attempting to gaze to windward the wall of blackness is within arms length  yet i cannot help attempting to see and gauge the blows that are being struck at the snark  there is something ominous and menacing up there to windward and i have a feeling that if i look long enough and strong enough i shall divine it  futile feeling  between two gusts i leave the wheel and run forward to the cabin companionway where i light matches and consult the barometer  2990 it reads  that sensitive instrument refuses to take notice of the disturbance which is humming with a deep throaty voice in the rigging  i get back to the wheel just in time to meet another gust the strongest yet well anyway the wind is abeam and the snark is on her course eating up easting  that at least is well  the jib and flyingjib bother me and i wish they were in  she would make easier weather of it and less risky weather likewise the wind snorts and stray raindrops pelt like birdshot  i shall certainly have to call all hands i conclude then conclude the next instant to hang on a little longer  maybe this is the end of it and i shall have called them for nothing  it is better to let them sleep  i hold the snark down to her task and from out of the darkness at right angles comes a deluge of rain accompanied by shrieking wind  then everything eases except the blackness and i rejoice in that i have not called the men  no sooner does the wind ease than the sea picks up  the combers are breaking now and the boat is tossing like a cork  then out of the blackness the gusts come harder and faster than before  if only i knew what was up there to windward in the blackness  the snark is making heavy weather of it and her leerail is buried oftener than not  more shrieks and snorts of wind  now if ever is the time to call the men  i will call them i resolve  then there is a burst of rain a slackening of the wind and i do not call  but it is rather lonely there at the wheel steering a little world through howling blackness  it is quite a responsibility to be all alone on the surface of a little world in time of stress doing the thinking for its sleeping inhabitants  i recoil from the responsibility as more gusts begin to strike and as a sea licks along the weather rail and splashes over into the cockpit  the salt water seems strangely warm to my body and is shot through with ghostly nodules of phosphorescent light  i shall surely call all hands to shorten sail  why should they sleep  i am a fool to have any compunctions in the matter  my intellect is arrayed against my heart  it was my heart that said let them sleep  yes but it was my intellect that backed up my heart in that judgment  let my intellect then reverse the judgment and while i am speculating as to what particular entity issued that command to my intellect the gusts die away  solicitude for mere bodily comfort has no place in practical seamanship i conclude sagely but study the feel of the next series of gusts and do not call the men  after all it is my intellect behind everything procrastinating measuring its knowledge of what the snark can endure against the blows being struck at her and waiting the call of all hands against the striking of still severer blows  daylight gray and violent steals through the cloudpall and shows a foaming sea that flattens under the weight of recurrent and increasing squalls  then comes the rain filling the windy valleys of the sea with milky smoke and further flattening the waves which but wait for the easement of wind and rain to leap more wildly than before  come the men on deck their sleep out and among them hermann his face on the broad grin in appreciation of the breeze of wind i have picked up  i turn the wheel over to warren and start to go below pausing on the way to rescue the galley stovepipe which has gone adrift  i am barefooted and my toes have had an excellent education in the art of clinging but as the rail buries itself in a green sea i suddenly sit down on the streaming deck  hermann goodnaturedly elects to question my selection of such a spot  then comes the next roll and he sits down suddenly and without premeditation  the snark heels over and down the rail takes it green and hermann and i clutching the precious stovepipe are swept down into the leescuppers  after that i finish my journey below and while changing my clothes grin with satisfactionthe snark is making easting  no it is not all monotony  when we had worried along our easting to 126 degrees west longitude we left the variables and headed south through the doldrums where was much calm weather and where taking advantage of every fan of air we were often glad to make a score of miles in as many hours  and yet on such a day we might pass through a dozen squalls and be surrounded by dozens more  and every squall was to be regarded as a bludgeon capable of crushing the snark  we were struck sometimes by the centres and sometimes by the sides of these squalls and we never knew just where or how we were to be hit  the squall that rose up covering half the heavens and swept down upon us as likely as not split into two squalls which passed us harmlessly on either side while the tiny innocent looking squall that appeared to carry no more than a hogshead of water and a pound of wind would abruptly assume cyclopean proportions deluging us with rain and overwhelming us with wind then there were treacherous squalls that went boldly astern and sneaked back upon us from a mile to leeward  again two squalls would tear along one on each side of us and we would get a fillip from each of them  now a gale certainly grows tiresome after a few hours but squalls never  the thousandth squall in ones experience is as interesting as the first one and perhaps a bit more so  it is the tyro who has no apprehension of them  the man of a thousand squalls respects a squall  he knows what they are  it was in the doldrums that our most exciting event occurred  on november 20 we discovered that through an accident we had lost over onehalf of the supply of fresh water that remained to us  since we were at that time fortythree days out from hilo our supply of fresh water was not large  to lose over half of it was a catastrophe  on close allowance the remnant of water we possessed would last twenty days  but we were in the doldrums there was no telling where the southeast trades were nor where we would pick them up  the handcuffs were promptly put upon the pump and once a day the water was portioned out  each of us received a quart for personal use and eight quarts were given to the cook  enters now the psychology of the situation  no sooner had the discovery of the water shortage been made than i for one was afflicted with a burning thirst  it seemed to me that i had never been so thirsty in my life  my little quart of water i could easily have drunk in one draught and to refrain from doing so required a severe exertion of will  nor was i alone in this  all of us talked water thought water and dreamed water when we slept  we examined the charts for possible islands to which to run in extremity but there were no such islands  the marquesas were the nearest and they were the other side of the line and of the doldrums too which made it even worse  we were in 3 degrees north latitude while the marquesas were 9 degrees south latitudea difference of over a thousand miles  furthermore the marquesas lay some fourteen degrees to the west of our longitude  a pretty pickle for a handful of creatures sweltering on the ocean in the heat of tropic calms  we rigged lines on either side between the main and mizzen riggings to these we laced the big deck awning hoisting it up aft with a sailing pennant so that any rain it might collect would run forward where it could be caught  here and there squalls passed across the circle of the sea  all day we watched them now to port or starboard and again ahead or astern  but never one came near enough to wet us  in the afternoon a big one bore down upon us  it spread out across the ocean as it approached and we could see it emptying countless thousands of gallons into the salt sea  extra attention was paid to the awning and then we waited  warren martin and hermann made a vivid picture  grouped together holding on to the rigging swaying to the roll they were gazing intently at the squall  strain anxiety and yearning were in every posture of their bodies  beside them was the dry and empty awning  but they seemed to grow limp and to droop as the squall broke in half one part passing on ahead the other drawing astern and going to leeward  but that night came rain  martin whose psychological thirst had compelled him to drink his quart of water early got his mouth down to the lip of the awning and drank the deepest draught i ever have seen drunk  the precious water came down in bucketfuls and tubfuls and in two hours we caught and stored away in the tanks one hundred and twenty gallons  strange to say in all the rest of our voyage to the marquesas not another drop of rain fell on board  if that squall had missed us the handcuffs would have remained on the pump and we would have busied ourselves with utilizing our surplus gasolene for distillation purposes  then there was the fishing  one did not have to go in search of it for it was there at the rail  a threeinch steel hook on the end of a stout line with a piece of white rag for bait was all that was necessary to catch bonitas weighing from ten to twentyfive pounds  bonitas feed on flyingfish wherefore they are unaccustomed to nibbling at the hook  they strike as gamely as the gamest fish in the sea and their first run is something that no man who has ever caught them will forget  also bonitas are the veriest cannibals  the instant one is hooked he is attacked by his fellows often and often we hauled them on board with fresh cleanbitten holes in them the size of teacups  one school of bonitas numbering many thousands stayed with us day and night for more than three weeks  aided by the snark it was great hunting for they cut a swath of destruction through the ocean half a mile wide and fifteen hundred miles in length  they ranged along abreast of the snark on either side pouncing upon the flying fish her forefoot scared up  since they were continually pursuing astern the flyingfish that survived for several flights they were always overtaking the snark and at any time one could glance astern and on the front of a breaking wave see scores of their silvery forms coasting down just under the surface  when they had eaten their fill it was their delight to get in the shadow of the boat or of her sails and a hundred or so were always to be seen lazily sliding along and keeping cool  but the poor flyingfish  pursued and eaten alive by the bonitas and dolphins they sought flight in the air where the swooping seabirds drove them back into the water  under heaven there was no refuge for them  flyingfish do not play when they essay the air it is a lifeanddeath affair with them  a thousand times a day we could lift our eyes and see the tragedy played out  the swift broken circling of a guny might attract ones attention  a glance beneath shows the back of a dolphin breaking the surface in a wild rush  just in front of its nose a shimmering palpitant streak of silver shoots from the water into the aira delicate organic mechanism of flight endowed with sensation power of direction and love of life  the guny swoops for it and misses and the flying fish gaining its altitude by rising kitelike against the wind turns in a halfcircle and skims off to leeward gliding on the bosom of the wind  beneath it the wake of the dolphin shows in churning foam  so he follows gazing upward with large eyes at the flashing breakfast that navigates an element other than his own  he cannot rise to so lofty occasion but he is a thoroughgoing empiricist and he knows sooner or later if not gobbled up by the guny that the flyingfish must return to the water  and then breakfast  we used to pity the poor winged fish  it was sad to see such sordid and bloody slaughter  and then in the night watches when a forlorn little flyingfish struck the mainsail and fell gasping and splattering on the deck we would rush for it just as eagerly just as greedily just as voraciously as the dolphins and bonitas  for know that flyingfish are most toothsome for breakfast  it is always a wonder to me that such dainty meat does not build dainty tissue in the bodies of the devourers  perhaps the dolphins and bonitas are coarserfibred because of the high speed at which they drive their bodies in order to catch their prey  but then again the flyingfish drive their bodies at high speed too  sharks we caught occasionally on large hooks with chainswivels bent on a length of small rope  and sharks meant pilotfish and remoras and various sorts of parasitic creatures  regular man eaters some of the sharks proved tigereyed and with twelve rows of teeth razorsharp  by the way we of the snark are agreed that we have eaten many fish that will not compare with baked shark smothered in tomato dressing  in the calms we occasionally caught a fish called hake by the japanese cook  and once on a spoonhook trolling a hundred yards astern we caught a snakelike fish over three feet in length and not more than three inches in diameter with four fangs in his jaw  he proved the most delicious fish delicious in meat and flavourthat we have ever eaten on board  the most welcome addition to our larder was a green seaturtle weighing a full hundred pounds and appearing on the table most appetizingly in steaks soups and stews and finally in a wonderful curry which tempted all hands into eating more rice than was good for them  the turtle was sighted to windward calmly sleeping on the surface in the midst of a huge school of curious dolphins  it was a deepsea turtle of a surety for the nearest land was a thousand miles away  we put the snark about and went back for him hermann driving the granes into his head and neck  when hauled aboard numerous remora were clinging to his shell and out of the hollows at the roots of his flippers crawled several large crabs it did not take the crew of the snark longer than the next meal to reach the unanimous conclusion that it would willingly put the snark about any time for a turtle  but it is the dolphin that is the king of deepsea fishes  never is his colour twice quite the same  swimming in the sea an ethereal creature of palest azure he displays in that one guise a miracle of colour  but it is nothing compared with the displays of which he is capable  at one time he will appear greenpale green deep green phosphorescent green at another time bluedeep blue electric blue all the spectrum of blue  catch him on a hook and he turns to gold yellow gold all gold  haul him on deck and he excels the spectrum passing through inconceivable shades of blues greens and yellows and then suddenly turning a ghostly white in the midst of which are bright blue spots and you suddenly discover that he is speckled like a trout  then back from white he goes through all the range of colours finally turning to a motherofpearl  for those who are devoted to fishing i can recommend no finer sport than catching dolphin  of course it must be done on a thin line with reel and pole  a no 7 oshaughnessy tarpon hook is just the thing baited with an entire flyingfish  like the bonita the dolphins fare consists of flyingfish and he strikes like lightning at the bait  the first warning is when the reel screeches and you see the line smoking out at right angles to the boat before you have time to entertain anxiety concerning the length of your line the fish rises into the air in a succession of leaps since he is quite certain to be four feet long or over the sport of landing so gamey a fish can be realized  when hooked he invariably turns golden  the idea of the series of leaps is to rid himself of the hook and the man who has made the strike must be of iron or decadent if his heart does not beat with an extra flutter when he beholds such gorgeous fish glittering in golden mail and shaking itself like a stallion in each midair leap  ware slack  if you dont on one of those leaps the hook will be flung out and twenty feet away  no slack and away he will go on another run culminating in another series of leaps  about this time one begins to worry over the line and to wish that he had had nine hundred feet on the reel originally instead of six hundred  with careful playing the line can be saved and after an hour of keen excitement the fish can be brought to gaff  one such dolphin i landed on the snark measured four feet and seven inches  hermann caught dolphins more prosaically  a handline and a chunk of sharkmeat were all he needed  his handline was very thick but on more than one occasion it parted and lost the fish  one day a dolphin got away with a lure of hermanns manufacture to which were lashed four oshaughnessy hooks  within an hour the same dolphin was landed with the rod and on dissecting him the four hooks were recovered  the dolphins which remained with us over a month deserted us north of the line and not one was seen during the remainder of the traverse  so the days passed  there was so much to be done that time never dragged  had there been little to do time could not have dragged with such wonderful seascapes and cloudscapesdawns that were like burning imperial cities under rainbows that arched nearly to the zenith sunsets that bathed the purple sea in rivers of rose coloured light flowing from a sun whose diverging heavenclimbing rays were of the purest blue  overside in the heat of the day the sea was an azure satiny fabric in the depths of which the sunshine focussed in funnels of light  astern deep down when there was a breeze bubbled a procession of milkyturquoise ghoststhe foam flung down by the hull of the snark each time she floundered against a sea  at night the wake was phosphorescent fire where the medusa slime resented our passing bulk while far down could be observed the unceasing flight of comets with long undulating nebulous tailscaused by the passage of the bonitas through the resentful medusa slime  and now and again from out of the darkness on either hand just under the surface larger phosphorescent organisms flashed up like electric lights marking collisions with the careless bonitas skurrying ahead to the good hunting just beyond our bowsprit  we made our easting worked down through the doldrums and caught a fresh breeze out of southbywest  hauled up by the wind on such a slant we would fetch past the marquesas far away to the westward but the next day on tuesday november 26 in the thick of a heavy squall the wind shifted suddenly to the southeast  it was the trade at last  there were no more squalls naught but fine weather a fair wind and a whirling log with sheets slacked off and with spinnaker and mainsail swaying and bellying on either side  the trade backed more and more until it blew out of the northeast while we steered a steady course to the southwest  ten days of this and on the morning of december 6 at five oclock we sighted land just where it ought to have been dead ahead  we passed to leeward of uahuka skirted the southern edge of nukahiva and that night in driving squalls and inky darkness fought our way in to an anchorage in the narrow bay of taiohae  the anchor rumbled down to the blatting of wild goats on the cliffs and the air we breathed was heavy with the perfume of flowers  the traverse was accomplished  sixty days from land to land across a lonely sea above whose horizons never rise the straining sails of ships    chapter xtypee    to the eastward uahuka was being blotted out by an evening rain squall that was fast overtaking the snark  but that little craft her big spinnaker filled by the southeast trade was making a good race of it  cape martin the southeasternmost point of nukuhiva was abeam and comptroller bay was opening up as we fled past its wide entrance where sail rock for all the world like the spritsail of a columbia river salmonboat was making brave weather of it in the smashing southeast swell  what do you make that out to be i asked hermann at the wheel  a fishingboat sir he answered after careful scrutiny  yet on the chart it was plainly marked sail rock  but we were more interested in the recesses of comptroller bay where our eyes eagerly sought out the three bights of land and centred on the midmost one where the gathering twilight showed the dim walls of a valley extending inland  how often we had pored over the chart and centred always on that midmost bight and on the valley it openedthe valley of typee  taipi the chart spelled it and spelled it correctly but i prefer typee and i shall always spell it typee  when i was a little boy i read a book spelled in that mannerherman melvilles typee and many long hours i dreamed over its pages  nor was it all dreaming  i resolved there and then mightily come what would that when i had gained strength and years i too would voyage to typee  for the wonder of the world was penetrating to my tiny consciousnessthe wonder that was to lead me to many lands and that leads and never pails  the years passed but typee was not forgotten  returned to san francisco from a seven months cruise in the north pacific i decided the time had come  the brig galilee was sailing for the marquesas but her crew was complete and i who was an ableseaman before the mast and young enough to be overweeningly proud of it was willing to condescend to ship as cabinboy in order to make the pilgrimage to typee  of course the galilee would have sailed from the marquesas without me for i was bent on finding another fayaway and another korykory  i doubt that the captain read desertion in my eye  perhaps even the berth of cabinboy was already filled  at any rate i did not get it  then came the rush of years filled brimming with projects achievements and failures but typee was not forgotten and here i was now gazing at its misty outlines till the squall swooped down and the snark dashed on into the driving smother  ahead we caught a glimpse and took the compass bearing of sentinel rock wreathed with pounding surf  then it too was effaced by the rain and darkness  we steered straight for it trusting to hear the sound of breakers in time to sheer clear  we had to steer for it  we had naught but a compass bearing with which to orientate ourselves and if we missed sentinel rock we missed taiohae bay and we would have to throw the snark up to the wind and lie off and on the whole nightno pleasant prospect for voyagers weary from a sixty days traverse of the vast pacific solitude and landhungry and fruit hungry and hungry with an appetite of years for the sweet vale of typee  abruptly with a roar of sound sentinel rock loomed through the rain dead ahead  we altered our course and with mainsail and spinnaker bellying to the squall drove past  under the lea of the rock the wind dropped us and we rolled in an absolute calm  then a puff of air struck us right in our teeth out of taiohae bay  it was in spinnaker up mizzen all sheets by the wind and we were moving slowly ahead heaving the lead and straining our eyes for the fixed red light on the ruined fort that would give us our bearings to anchorage  the air was light and baffling now east now west now north now south while from either hand came the roar of unseen breakers  from the looming cliffs arose the blatting of wild goats and overhead the first stars were peeping mistily through the ragged train of the passing squall  at the end of two hours having come a mile into the bay we dropped anchor in eleven fathoms  and so we came to taiohae  in the morning we awoke in fairyland  the snark rested in a placid harbour that nestled in a vast amphitheatre the towering vineclad walls of which seemed to rise directly from the water  far up to the east we glimpsed the thin line of a trail visible in one place where it scoured across the face of the wall  the path by which toby escaped from typee we cried  we were not long in getting ashore and astride horses though the consummation of our pilgrimage had to be deferred for a day  two months at sea barefooted all the time without space in which to exercise ones limbs is not the best preliminary to leather shoes and walking  besides the land had to cease its nauseous rolling before we could feel fit for riding goatlike horses over giddy trails  so we took a short ride to break in and crawled through thick jungle to make the acquaintance of a venerable mossgrown idol where had foregathered a german trader and a norwegian captain to estimate the weight of said idol and to speculate upon depreciation in value caused by sawing him in half  they treated the old fellow sacrilegiously digging their knives into him to see how hard he was and how deep his mossy mantle and commanding him to rise up and save them trouble by walking down to the ship himself in lieu of which nineteen kanakas slung him on a frame of timbers and toted him to the ship where battened down under hatches even now he is cleaving the south pacific hornward and toward europethe ultimate abidingplace for all good heathen idols save for the few in america and one in particular who grins beside me as i write and who barring shipwreck will grin somewhere in my neighbourhood until i die  and he will win out  he will be grinning when i am dust  also as a preliminary we attended a feast where one taiara tamarii the son of an hawaiian sailor who deserted from a whaleship commemorated the death of his marquesan mother by roasting fourteen whole hogs and inviting in the village  so we came along welcomed by a native herald a young girl who stood on a great rock and chanted the information that the banquet was made perfect by our presencewhich information she extended impartially to every arrival  scarcely were we seated however when she changed her tune while the company manifested intense excitement her cries became eager and piercing  from a distance came answering cries in mens voices which blended into a wild barbaric chant that sounded incredibly savage smacking of blood and war  then through vistas of tropical foliage appeared a procession of savages naked save for gaudy loincloths  they advanced slowly uttering deep guttural cries of triumph and exaltation  slung from young saplings carried on their shoulders were mysterious objects of considerable weight hidden from view by wrappings of green leaves  nothing but pigs innocently fat and roasted to a turn were inside those wrappings but the men were carrying them into camp in imitation of old times when they carried in longpig  now long pig is not pig  longpig is the polynesian euphemism for human flesh and these descendants of maneaters a kings son at their head brought in the pigs to table as of old their grandfathers had brought in their slain enemies  every now and then the procession halted in order that the bearers should have every advantage in uttering particularly ferocious shouts of victory of contempt for their enemies and of gustatory desire  so melville two generations ago witnessed the bodies of slain happar warriors wrapped in palmleaves carried to banquet at the ti  at another time at the ti he observed a curiously carved vessel of wood and on looking into it his eyes fell upon the disordered members of a human skeleton the bones still fresh with moisture and with particles of flesh clinging to them here and there  cannibalism has often been regarded as a fairy story by ultracivilized men who dislike perhaps the notion that their own savage forebears have somewhere in the past been addicted to similar practices  captain cook was rather sceptical upon the subject until one day in a harbour of new zealand he deliberately tested the matter  a native happened to have brought on board for sale a nice sundried head  at cooks orders strips of the flesh were cut away and handed to the native who greedily devoured them  to say the least captain cook was a rather thoroughgoing empiricist  at any rate by that act he supplied one ascertained fact of which science had been badly in need  little did he dream of the existence of a certain group of islands thousands of miles away where in subsequent days there would arise a curious suit at law when an old chief of maui would be charged with defamation of character because he persisted in asserting that his body was the living repository of captain cooks great toe  it is said that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the old chief was not the tomb of the navigators great toe and that the suit was dismissed  i suppose i shall not have the chance in these degenerate days to see any longpig eaten but at least i am already the possessor of a duly certified marquesan calabash oblong in shape curiously carved over a century old from which has been drunk the blood of two shipmasters  one of those captains was a mean man  he sold a decrepit whaleboat as good as new what of the fresh white paint to a marquesan chief  but no sooner had the captain sailed away than the whaleboat dropped to pieces  it was his fortune some time afterwards to be wrecked of all places on that particular island  the marquesan chief was ignorant of rebates and discounts but he had a primitive sense of equity and an equally primitive conception of the economy of nature and he balanced the account by eating the man who had cheated him  we started in the cool dawn for typee astride ferocious little stallions that pawed and screamed and bit and fought one another quite oblivious of the fragile humans on their backs and of the slippery boulders loose rocks and yawning gorges  the way led up an ancient road through a jungle of hau trees  on every side were the vestiges of a onetime dense population  wherever the eye could penetrate the thick growth glimpses were caught of stone walls and of stone foundations six to eight feet in height built solidly throughout and many yards in width and depth  they formed great stone platforms upon which at one time there had been houses but the houses and the people were gone and huge trees sank their roots through the platforms and towered over the underrunning jungle  these foundations are called paepaesthe pipis of melville who spelled phonetically  the marquesans of the present generation lack the energy to hoist and place such huge stones  also they lack incentive  there are plenty of paepaes to go around with a few thousand unoccupied ones left over  once or twice as we ascended the valley we saw magnificent paepaes bearing on their general surface pitiful little straw huts the proportions being similar to a voting booth perched on the broad foundation of the pyramid of cheops  for the marquesans are perishing and to judge from conditions at taiohae the one thing that retards their destruction is the infusion of fresh blood  a pure marquesan is a rarity  they seem to be all halfbreeds and strange conglomerations of dozens of different races  nineteen able labourers are all the trader at taiohae can muster for the loading of copra on shipboard and in their veins runs the blood of english american dane german french corsican spanish portuguese chinese hawaiian paumotan tahitian and easter islander  there are more races than there are persons but it is a wreckage of races at best  life faints and stumbles and gasps itself away  in this warm equable climea truly terrestrial paradisewhere are never extremes of temperature and where the air is like balm kept ever pure by the ozoneladen southeast trade asthma phthisis and tuberculosis flourish as luxuriantly as the vegetation  everywhere from the few grass huts arises the racking cough or exhausted groan of wasted lungs  other horrible diseases prosper as well but the most deadly of all are those that attack the lungs  there is a form of consumption called galloping which is especially dreaded  in two months time it reduces the strongest man to a skeleton under a gravecloth  in valley after valley the last inhabitant has passed and the fertile soil has relapsed to jungle  in melvilles day the valley of hapaa spelled by him happar was peopled by a strong and warlike tribe  a generation later it contained but two hundred persons  today it is an untenanted howling tropical wilderness  we climbed higher and higher in the valley our unshod stallions picking their steps on the disintegrating trail which led in and out through the abandoned paepaes and insatiable jungle  the sight of red mountain apples the ohias familiar to us from hawaii caused a native to be sent climbing after them  and again he climbed for cocoanuts  i have drunk the cocoanuts of jamaica and of hawaii but i never knew how delicious such draught could be till i drank it here in the marquesas  occasionally we rode under wild limes and orangesgreat trees which had survived the wilderness longer than the motes of humans who had cultivated them  we rode through endless thickets of yellowpollened cassiif riding it could be called for those fragrant thickets were inhabited by wasps  and such wasps  great yellow fellows the size of small canary birds darting through the air with behind them drifting a bunch of legs a couple of inches long  a stallion abruptly stands on his forelegs and thrusts his hind legs skyward  he withdraws them from the sky long enough to make one wild jump ahead and then returns them to their index position  it is nothing  his thick hide has merely been punctured by a flaming lance of wasp virility then a second and a third stallion and all the stallions begin to cavort on their forelegs over the precipitous landscape  swat  a whitehot poniard penetrates my cheek  swat again  i am stabbed in the neck  i am bringing up the rear and getting more than my share  there is no retreat and the plunging horses ahead on a precarious trail promise little safety  my horse overruns charmians horse and that sensitive creature freshstung at the psychological moment planks one of his hoofs into my horse and the other hoof into me  i thank my stars that he is not steelshod and halfarise from the saddle at the impact of another flaming dagger i am certainly getting more than my share and so is my poor horse whose pain and panic are only exceeded by mine  get out of the way  im coming i shout frantically dashing my cap at the winged vipers around me  on one side of the trail the landscape rises straight up  on the other side it sinks straight down  the only way to get out of my way is to keep on going  how that string of horses kept their feet is a miracle but they dashed ahead overrunning one another galloping trotting stumbling jumping scrambling and kicking methodically skyward every time a wasp landed on them  after a while we drew breath and counted our injuries  and this happened not once nor twice but time after time  strange to say it never grew monotonous  i know that i for one came through each brush with the undiminished zest of a man flying from sudden death  no the pilgrim from taiohae to typee will never suffer from ennui on the way  at last we arose above the vexation of wasps  it was a matter of altitude however rather than of fortitude  all about us lay the jagged backbones of ranges as far as the eye could see thrusting their pinnacles into the tradewind clouds  under us from the way we had come the snark lay like a tiny toy on the calm water of taiohae bay  ahead we could see the inshore indentation of comptroller bay  we dropped down a thousand feet and typee lay beneath us  had a glimpse of the gardens of paradise been revealed to me i could scarcely have been more ravished with the sightso said melville on the moment of his first view of the valley  he saw a garden  we saw a wilderness  where were the hundred groves of the breadfruit tree he saw  we saw jungle nothing but jungle with the exception of two grass huts and several clumps of cocoanuts breaking the primordial green mantle  where was the ti of mehevi the bachelors hall the palace where women were taboo and where he ruled with his lesser chieftains keeping the halfdozen dusty and torpid ancients to remind them of the valorous past  from the swift stream no sounds arose of maids and matrons pounding tapa  and where was the hut that old narheyo eternally builded  in vain i looked for him perched ninety feet from the ground in some tall cocoanut taking his morning smoke  we went down a zigzag trail under overarching matted jungle where great butterflies drifted by in the silence  no tattooed savage with club and javelin guarded the path and when we forded the stream we were free to roam where we pleased  no longer did the taboo sacred and merciless reign in that sweet vale  nay the taboo still did reign a new taboo for when we approached too near the several wretched native women the taboo was uttered warningly and it was well  they were lepers  the man who warned us was afflicted horribly with elephantiasis  all were suffering from lung trouble  the valley of typee was the abode of death and the dozen survivors of the tribe were gasping feebly the last painful breaths of the race  certainly the battle had not been to the strong for once the typeans were very strong stronger than the happars stronger than the taiohaeans stronger than all the tribes of nukuhiva  the word typee or rather taipi originally signified an eater of human flesh  but since all the marquesans were humanflesh eaters to be so designated was the token that the typeans were the humanflesh eaters par excellence  not alone to nukuhiva did the typean reputation for bravery and ferocity extend  in all the islands of the marquesas the typeans were named with dread  man could not conquer them  even the french fleet that took possession of the marquesas left the typeans alone  captain porter of the frigate essex once invaded the valley  his sailors and marines were reinforced by two thousand warriors of happar and taiohae  they penetrated quite a distance into the valley but met with so fierce a resistance that they were glad to retreat and get away in their flotilla of boats and warcanoes  of all inhabitants of the south seas the marquesans were adjudged the strongest and the most beautiful  melville said of them  i was especially struck by the physical strength and beauty they displayed    in beauty of form they surpassed anything i had ever seen  not a single instance of natural deformity was observable in all the throng attending the revels  every individual appeared free from those blemishes which sometimes mar the effect of an otherwise perfect form  but their physical excellence did not merely consist in an exemption from these evils nearly every individual of the number might have been taken for a sculptors model  mendana the discoverer of the marquesas described the natives as wondrously beautiful to behold  figueroa the chronicler of his voyage said of them  in complexion they were nearly white of good stature and finely formed  captain cook called the marquesans the most splendid islanders in the south seas  the men were described as in almost every instance of lofty stature scarcely ever less than six feet in height  and now all this strength and beauty has departed and the valley of typee is the abode of some dozen wretched creatures afflicted by leprosy elephantiasis and tuberculosis  melville estimated the population at two thousand not taking into consideration the small adjoining valley of hooumi  life has rotted away in this wonderful garden spot where the climate is as delightful and healthful as any to be found in the world  not alone were the typeans physically magnificent they were pure  their air did not contain the bacilli and germs and microbes of disease that fill our own air  and when the white men imported in their ships these various microorganisms or disease the typeans crumpled up and went down before them  when one considers the situation one is almost driven to the conclusion that the white race flourishes on impurity and corruption  natural selection however gives the explanation  we of the white race are the survivors and the descendants of the thousands of generations of survivors in the war with the micro organisms  whenever one of us was born with a constitution peculiarly receptive to these minute enemies such a one promptly died  only those of us survived who could withstand them  we who are alive are the immune the fitthe ones best constituted to live in a world of hostile microorganisms  the poor marquesans had undergone no such selection  they were not immune  and they who had made a custom of eating their enemies were now eaten by enemies so microscopic as to be invisible and against whom no war of dart and javelin was possible  on the other hand had there been a few hundred thousand marquesans to begin with there might have been sufficient survivors to lay the foundation for a new racea regenerated race if a plunge into a festering bath of organic poison can be called regeneration  we unsaddled our horses for lunch and after we had fought the stallions apartmine with several fresh chunks bitten out of his backand after we had vainly fought the sandflies we ate bananas and tinned meats washed down by generous draughts of cocoanut milk there was little to be seen  the jungle had rushed back and engulfed the puny works of man  here and there paipais were to be stumbled upon but there were no inscriptions no hieroglyphics no clues to the past they attestedonly dumb stones builded and carved by hands that were forgotten dust  out of the paipais grew great trees jealous of the wrought work of man splitting and scattering the stones back into the primeval chaos  we gave up the jungle and sought the stream with the idea of evading the sandflies  vain hope  to go in swimming one must take off his clothes  the sandflies are aware of the fact and they lurk by the river bank in countless myriads  in the native they are called the naunau which is pronounced nownow  they are certainly well named for they are the insistent present  there is no past nor future when they fasten upon ones epidermis and i am willing to wager that omer khayyam could never have written the rubaiyat in the valley of typeeit would have been psychologically impossible  i made the strategic mistake of undressing on the edge of a steep bank where i could dive in but could not climb out  when i was ready to dress i had a hundred yards walk on the bank before i could reach my clothes  at the first step fully ten thousand naunaus landed upon me  at the second step i was walking in a cloud  by the third step the sun was dimmed in the sky  after that i dont know what happened  when i arrived at my clothes i was a maniac  and here enters my grand tactical error  there is only one rule of conduct in dealing with naunaus  never swat them  whatever you do dont swat them  they are so vicious that in the instant of annihilation they eject their last atom of poison into your carcass  you must pluck them delicately between thumb and forefinger and persuade them gently to remove their proboscides from your quivering flesh it is like pulling teeth  but the difficulty was that the teeth sprouted faster than i could pull them so i swatted and so doing filled myself full with their poison  this was a week ago  at the present moment i resemble a sadly neglected smallpox convalescent  hooumi is a small valley separated from typee by a low ridge and thither we started when we had knocked our indomitable and insatiable ridinganimals into submission  as it was warrens mount after a mile run selected the most dangerous part of the trail for an exhibition that kept us all on the anxious seat for fully five minutes  we rode by the mouth of typee valley and gazed down upon the beach from which melville escaped  there was where the whaleboat lay on its oars close in to the surf and there was where karakoee the taboo kanaka stood in the water and trafficked for the sailors life  there surely was where melville gave fayaway the parting embrace ere he dashed for the boat  and there was the point of land from which mehevi and mowmow and their following swam off to intercept the boat only to have their wrists gashed by sheathknives when they laid hold of the gunwale though it was reserved for mowmow to receive the boathook full in the throat from melvilles hands  we rode on to hooumi  so closely was melville guarded that he never dreamed of the existence of this valley though he must continually have met its inhabitants for they belonged to typee we rode through the same abandoned paepaes but as we neared the sea we found a profusion of cocoanuts breadfruit trees and taro patches and fully a dozen grass dwellings  in one of these we arranged to pass the night and preparations were immediately put on foot for a feast  a young pig was promptly despatched and while he was being roasted among hot stones and while chickens were stewing in cocoanut milk i persuaded one of the cooks to climb an unusually tall cocoanut palm  the cluster of nuts at the top was fully one hundred and twentyfive feet from the ground but that native strode up to the tree seized it in both hands jackknived at the waist so that the soles of his feet rested flatly against the trunk and then he walked right straight up without stopping  there were no notches in the tree  he had no ropes to help him  he merely walked up the tree one hundred and twentyfive feet in the air and cast down the nuts from the summit  not every man there had the physical stamina for such a feat or the lungs rather for most of them were coughing their lives away  some of the women kept up a ceaseless moaning and groaning so badly were their lungs wasted  very few of either sex were fullblooded marquesans  they were mostly half breeds and threequarterbreeds of french english danish and chinese extraction  at the best these infusions of fresh blood merely delayed the passing and the results led one to wonder whether it was worth while  the feast was served on a broad paepae the rear portion of which was occupied by the house in which we were to sleep  the first course was raw fish and poipoi the latter sharp and more acrid of taste than the poi of hawaii which is made from taro  the poipoi of the marquesas is made from breadfruit  the ripe fruit after the core is removed is placed in a calabash and pounded with a stone pestle into a stiff sticky paste  in this stage of the process wrapped in leaves it can be buried in the ground where it will keep for years  before it can be eaten however further processes are necessary  a leafcovered package is placed among hot stones like the pig and thoroughly baked  after that it is mixed with cold water and thinned outnot thin enough to run but thin enough to be eaten by sticking ones first and second fingers into it  on close acquaintance it proves a pleasant and most healthful food and breadfruit ripe and well boiled or roasted  it is delicious breadfruit and taro are kingly vegetables the pair of them though the former is patently a misnomer and more resembles a sweet potato than anything else though it is not mealy like a sweet potato nor is it so sweet  the feast ended we watched the moon rise over typee  the air was like balm faintly scented with the breath of flowers  it was a magic night deathly still without the slightest breeze to stir the foliage and one caught ones breath and felt the pang that is almost hurt so exquisite was the beauty of it  faint and far could be heard the thin thunder of the surf upon the beach  there were no beds and we drowsed and slept wherever we thought the floor softest  near by a woman panted and moaned in her sleep and all about us the dying islanders coughed in the night    chapter xithe nature man    i first met him on market street in san francisco  it was a wet and drizzly afternoon and he was striding along clad solely in a pair of abbreviated kneetrousers and an abbreviated shirt his bare feet going slickslick through the pavementslush  at his heels trooped a score of excited gamins  every headand there were thousands turned to glance curiously at him as he went by  and i turned too never had i seen such lovely sunburn  he was all sunburn of the sort a blond takes on when his skin does not peel  his long yellow hair was burnt so was his beard which sprang from a soil unploughed by any razor  he was a tawny man a goldentawny man all glowing and radiant with the sun  another prophet thought i come up to town with a message that will save the world  a few weeks later i was with some friends in their bungalow in the piedmont hills overlooking san francisco bay  weve got him weve got him they barked  we caught him up a tree but hes all right now hell feed from the hand  come on and see him  so i accompanied them up a dizzy hill and in a rickety shack in the midst of a eucalyptus grove found my sunburned prophet of the city pavements  he hastened to meet us arriving in the whirl and blur of a handspring  he did not shake hands with us instead his greeting took the form of stunts  he turned more handsprings  he twisted his body sinuously like a snake until having sufficiently limbered up he bent from the hips and with legs straight and knees touching beat a tattoo on the ground with the palms of his hands  he whirligigged and pirouetted dancing and cavorting round like an inebriated ape  all the sunwarmth of his ardent life beamed in his face  i am so happy was the song without words he sang  he sang it all evening ringing the changes on it with an endless variety of stunts  a fool a fool  i met a fool in the forest thought i and a worthy fool he proved  between handsprings and whirligigs he delivered his message that would save the world  it was twofold  first let suffering humanity strip off its clothing and run wild in the mountains and valleys and second let the very miserable world adopt phonetic spelling  i caught a glimpse of the great social problems being settled by the city populations swarming naked over the landscape to the popping of shotguns the barking of ranchdogs and countless assaults with pitchforks wielded by irate farmers  the years passed and one sunny morning the snark poked her nose into a narrow opening in a reef that smoked with the crashing impact of the tradewind swell and beat slowly up papeete harbour  coming off to us was a boat flying a yellow flag  we knew it contained the port doctor  but quite a distance off in its wake was a tiny out rigger canoe that puzzled us  it was flying a red flag  i studied it through the glasses fearing that it marked some hidden danger to navigation some recent wreck or some buoy or beacon that had been swept away  then the doctor came on board  after he had examined the state of our health and been assured that we had no live rats hidden away in the snark i asked him the meaning of the red flag  oh that is darling was the answer  and then darling ernest darling flying the red flag that is indicative of the brotherhood of man hailed us  hello jack he called  hello charmian  he paddled swiftly nearer and i saw that he was the tawny prophet of the piedmont hills  he came over the side a sungod clad in a scarlet loincloth with presents of arcady and greeting in both his handsa bottle of golden honey and a leafbasket filled with great golden mangoes golden bananas specked with freckles of deeper gold golden pineapples and golden limes and juicy oranges minted from the same precious ore of sun and soil  and in this fashion under the southern sky i met once more darling the nature man  tahiti is one of the most beautiful spots in the world inhabited by thieves and robbers and liars also by several honest and truthful men and women  wherefore because of the blight cast upon tahitis wonderful beauty by the spidery human vermin that infest it i am minded to write not of tahiti but of the nature man  he at least is refreshing and wholesome  the spirit that emanates from him is so gentle and sweet that it would harm nothing hurt nobodys feelings save the feelings of a predatory and plutocratic capitalist  what does this red flag mean i asked  socialism of course  yes yes i know that i went on but what does it mean in your hands  why that ive found my message  and that you are delivering it to tahiti i demanded incredulously  sure he answered simply and later on i found that he was too  when we dropped anchor lowered a small boat into the water and started ashore the nature man joined us  now thought i i shall be pestered to death by this crank  waking or sleeping i shall never be quit of him until i sail away from here  but never in my life was i more mistaken  i took a house and went to live and work in it and the nature man never came near me  he was waiting for the invitation  in the meantime he went aboard the snark and took possession of her library delighted by the quantity of scientific books and shocked as i learned afterwards by the inordinate amount of fiction  the nature man never wastes time on fiction  after a week or so my conscience smote me and i invited him to dinner at a downtown hotel  he arrived looking unwontedly stiff and uncomfortable in a cotton jacket  when invited to peel it off he beamed his gratitude and joy and did so revealing his sungold skin from waist to shoulder covered only by a piece of fishnet of coarse twine and large of mesh  a scarlet loincloth completed his costume  i began my acquaintance with him that night and during my long stay in tahiti that acquaintance ripened into friendship  so you write books he said one day when tired and sweaty i finished my mornings work  i too write books he announced  aha thought i now at last is he going to pester me with his literary efforts  my soul was in revolt  i had not come all the way to the south seas to be a literary bureau  this is the book i write he explained smashing himself a resounding blow on the chest with his clenched fist  the gorilla in the african jungle pounds his chest till the noise of it can be heard half a mile away  a pretty good chest quoth i admiringly it would even make a gorilla envious  and then and later i learned the details of the marvellous book ernest darling had written  twelve years ago he lay close to death he weighed but ninety pounds and was too weak to speak  the doctors had given him up  his father a practising physician had given him up  consultations with other physicians had been held upon him  there was no hope for him  overstudy as a school teacher and as a university student and two successive attacks of pneumonia were responsible for his breakdown  day by day he was losing strength  he could extract no nutrition from the heavy foods they gave him nor could pellets and powders help his stomach to do the work of digestion  not only was he a physical wreck but he was a mental wreck  his mind was overwrought  he was sick and tired of medicine and he was sick and tired of persons  human speech jarred upon him  human attentions drove him frantic  the thought came to him that since he was going to die he might as well die in the open away from all the bother and irritation  and behind this idea lurked a sneaking idea that perhaps he would not die after all if only he could escape from the heavy foods the medicines and the wellintentioned persons who made him frantic  so ernest darling a bag of bones and a deathshead a perambulating corpse with just the dimmest flutter of life in it to make it perambulate turned his back upon men and the habitations of men and dragged himself for five miles through the brush away from the city of portland oregon  of course he was crazy  only a lunatic would drag himself out of his deathbed  but in the brush darling found what he was looking forrest nobody bothered him with beefsteaks and pork  no physicians lacerated his tired nerves by feeling his pulse nor tormented his tired stomach with pellets and powders  he began to feel soothed the sun was shining warm and he basked in it  he had the feeling that the sun shine was an elixir of health  then it seemed to him that his whole wasted wreck of a body was crying for the sun  he stripped off his clothes and bathed in the sunshine  he felt better  it had done him goodthe first relief in weary months of pain  as he grew better he sat up and began to take notice  all about him were the birds fluttering and chirping the squirrels chattering and playing  he envied them their health and spirits their happy carefree existence  that he should contrast their condition with his was inevitable and that he should question why they were splendidly vigorous while he was a feeble dying wraith of a man was likewise inevitable  his conclusion was the very obvious one namely that they lived naturally while he lived most unnaturally therefore if he intended to live he must return to nature  alone there in the brush he worked out his problem and began to apply it  he stripped off his clothing and leaped and gambolled about running on all fours climbing trees in short doing physical stuntsand all the time soaking in the sunshine  he imitated the animals  he built a nest of dry leaves and grasses in which to sleep at night covering it over with bark as a protection against the early fall rains  here is a beautiful exercise he told me once flapping his arms mightily against his sides i learned it from watching the roosters crow  another time i remarked the loud sucking intake with which he drank cocoanutmilk he explained that he had noticed the cows drinking that way and concluded there must be something in it  he tried it and found it good and thereafter he drank only in that fashion  he noted that the squirrels lived on fruits and nuts  he started on a fruitandnut diet helped out by bread and he grew stronger and put on weight  for three months he continued his primordial existence in the brush and then the heavy oregon rains drove him back to the habitations of men  not in three months could a ninety pound survivor of two attacks of pneumonia develop sufficient ruggedness to live through an oregon winter in the open  he had accomplished much but he had been driven in  there was no place to go but back to his fathers house and there living in close rooms with lungs that panted for all the air of the open sky he was brought down by a third attack of pneumonia  he grew weaker even than before  in that tottering tabernacle of flesh his brain collapsed  he lay like a corpse too weak to stand the fatigue of speaking too irritated and tired in his miserable brain to care to listen to the speech of others  the only act of will of which he was capable was to stick his fingers in his ears and resolutely to refuse to hear a single word that was spoken to him  they sent for the insanity experts  he was adjudged insane and also the verdict was given that he would not live a month  by one such mental expert he was carted off to a sanatorium on mt tabor  here when they learned that he was harmless they gave him his own way  they no longer dictated as to the food he ate so he resumed his fruits and nutsolive oil peanut butter and bananas the chief articles of his diet  as he regained his strength he made up his mind to live thenceforth his own life  if he lived like others according to social conventions he would surely die  and he did not want to die  the fear of death was one of the strongest factors in the genesis of the nature man  to live he must have a natural diet the open air and the blessed sunshine  now an oregon winter has no inducements for those who wish to return to nature so darling started out in search of a climate  he mounted a bicycle and headed south for the sunlands  stanford university claimed him for a year  here he studied and worked his way attending lectures in as scant garb as the authorities would allow and applying as much as possible the principles of living that he had learned in squirreltown  his favourite method of study was to go off in the hills back of the university and there to strip off his clothes and lie on the grass soaking in sunshine and health at the same time that he soaked in knowledge  but central california has her winters and the quest for a nature mans climate drew him on  he tried los angeles and southern california being arrested a few times and brought before the insanity commissions because forsooth his mode of life was not modelled after the mode of life of his fellowmen  he tried hawaii where unable to prove him insane the authorities deported him  it was not exactly a deportation  he could have remained by serving a year in prison  they gave him his choice  now prison is death to the nature man who thrives only in the open air and in gods sunshine  the authorities of hawaii are not to be blamed  darling was an undesirable citizen  any man is undesirable who disagrees with one  and that any man should disagree to the extent darling did in his philosophy of the simple life is ample vindication of the hawaiian authorities verdict of his undesirableness  so darling went thence in search of a climate which would not only be desirable but wherein he would not be undesirable  and he found it in tahiti the gardenspot of gardenspots  and so it was according to the narrative as given that he wrote the pages of his book  he wears only a loincloth and a sleeveless fishnet shirt his stripped weight is one hundred and sixtyfive pounds  his health is perfect  his eyesight that at one time was considered ruined is excellent  the lungs that were practically destroyed by three attacks of pneumonia have not only recovered but are stronger than ever before  i shall never forget the first time while talking to me that he squashed a mosquito  the stinging pest had settled in the middle of his back between his shoulders  without interrupting the flow of conversation without dropping even a syllable his clenched fist shot up in the air curved backward and smote his back between the shoulders killing the mosquito and making his frame resound like a bass drum  it reminded me of nothing so much as of horses kicking the woodwork in their stalls  the gorilla in the african jungle pounds his chest until the noise of it can be heard half a mile away he will announce suddenly and thereat beat a hairraising devils tattoo on his own chest  one day he noticed a set of boxinggloves hanging on the wall and promptly his eyes brightened  do you box i asked  i used to give lessons in boxing when i was at stanford was the reply  and there and then we stripped and put on the gloves  bang a long gorilla arm flashed out landing the gloved end on my nose  biff he caught me in a duck on the side of the head nearly knocking me over sidewise  i carried the lump raised by that blow for a week i ducked under a straight left and landed a straight right on his stomach  it was a fearful blow  the whole weight of my body was behind it and his body had been met as it lunged forward  i looked for him to crumple up and go down  instead of which his face beamed approval and he said that was beautiful  the next instant i was covering up and striving to protect myself from a hurricane of hooks jolts and uppercuts  then i watched my chance and drove in for the solar plexus  i hit the mark  the nature man dropped his arms gasped and sat down suddenly  ill be all right he said  just wait a moment  and inside thirty seconds he was on his feetay and returning the compliment for he hooked me in the solar plexus and i gasped dropped my hands and sat down just a trifle more suddenly than he had  all of which i submit as evidence that the man i boxed with was a totally different man from the poor ninetypound weight of eight years before who given up by physicians and alienists lay gasping his life away in a closed room in portland oregon  the book that ernest darling has written is a good book and the binding is good too  hawaii has wailed for years her need for desirable immigrants  she has spent much time and thought and money in importing desirable citizens and she has as yet nothing much to show for it  yet hawaii deported the nature man  she refused to give him a chance so it is to chasten hawaiis proud spirit that i take this opportunity to show her what she has lost in the nature man  when he arrived in tahiti he proceeded to seek out a piece of land on which to grow the food he ate  but land was difficult to findthat is inexpensive land  the nature man was not rolling in wealth  he spent weeks in wandering over the steep hills until high up the mountain where clustered several tiny canyons he found eighty acres of brushjungle which were apparently unrecorded as the property of any one  the government officials told him that if he would clear the land and till it for thirty years he would be given a title for it  immediately he set to work  and never was there such work  nobody farmed that high up  the land was covered with matted jungle and overrun by wild pigs and countless rats  the view of papeete and the sea was magnificent but the outlook was not encouraging  he spent weeks in building a road in order to make the plantation accessible  the pigs and the rats ate up whatever he planted as fast as it sprouted  he shot the pigs and trapped the rats  of the latter in two weeks he caught fifteen hundred  everything had to be carried up on his back  he usually did his packhorse work at night  gradually he began to win out  a grasswalled house was built  on the fertile volcanic soil he had wrested from the jungle and jungle beasts were growing five hundred cocoanut trees five hundred papaia trees three hundred mango trees many breadfruit trees and alligatorpear trees to say nothing of vines bushes and vegetables  he developed the drip of the hills in the canyons and worked out an efficient irrigation scheme ditching the water from canyon to canyon and paralleling the ditches at different altitudes his narrow canyons became botanical gardens  the arid shoulders of the hills where formerly the blazing sun had parched the jungle and beaten it close to earth blossomed into trees and shrubs and flowers  not only had the nature man become selfsupporting but he was now a prosperous agriculturist with produce to sell to the city dwellers of papeete  then it was discovered that his land which the government officials had informed him was without an owner really had an owner and that deeds descriptions etc were on record  all his work bade fare to be lost  the land had been valueless when he took it up and the owner a large landholder was unaware of the extent to which the nature man had developed it  a just price was agreed upon and darlings deed was officially filed  next came a more crushing blow  darlings access to market was destroyed  the road he had built was fenced across by triple barb wire fences  it was one of those jumbles in human affairs that is so common in this absurdest of social systems  behind it was the fine hand of the same conservative element that haled the nature man before the insanity commission in los angeles and that deported him from hawaii  it is so hard for selfsatisfied men to understand any man whose satisfactions are fundamentally different  it seems clear that the officials have connived with the conservative element for to this day the road the nature man built is closed nothing has been done about it while an adamant unwillingness to do anything about it is evidenced on every hand  but the nature man dances and sings along his way  he does not sit up nights thinking about the wrong which has been done him he leaves the worrying to the doers of the wrong  he has no time for bitterness  he believes he is in the world for the purpose of being happy and he has not a moment to waste in any other pursuit  the road to his plantation is blocked  he cannot build a new road for there is no ground on which he can build it  the government has restricted him to a wildpig trail which runs precipitously up the mountain  i climbed the trail with him and we had to climb with hands and feet in order to get up  nor can that wildpig trail be made into a road by any amount of toil less than that of an engineer a steamengine and a steel cable  but what does the nature man care  in his gentle ethics the evil men do him he requites with goodness  and who shall say he is not happier than they  never mind their pesky road he said to me as we dragged ourselves up a shelf of rock and sat down panting to rest  ill get an air machine soon and fool them  im clearing a level space for a landing stage for the airships and next time you come to tahiti you will alight right at my door  yes the nature man has some strange ideas besides that of the gorilla pounding his chest in the african jungle  the nature man has ideas about levitation  yes sir he said to me levitation is not impossible  and think of the glory of itlifting ones self from the ground by an act of will  think of it  the astronomers tell us that our whole solar system is dying that barring accidents it will all be so cold that no life can live upon it very well  in that day all men will be accomplished levitationists and they will leave this perishing planet and seek more hospitable worlds  how can levitation be accomplished  by progressive fasts yes i have tried them and toward the end i could feel myself actually getting lighter  the man is a maniac thought i  of course he added these are only theories of mine  i like to speculate upon the glorious future of man  levitation may not be possible but i like to think of it as possible  one evening when he yawned i asked him how much sleep he allowed himself  seven hours was the answer  but in ten years ill be sleeping only six hours and in twenty years only five hours  you see i shall cut off an hours sleep every ten years  then when you are a hundred you wont be sleeping at all i interjected  just that  exactly that  when i am a hundred i shall not require sleep  also i shall be living on air  there are plants that live on air you know  but has any man ever succeeded in doing it  he shook his head  i never heard of him if he did  but it is only a theory of mine this living on air  it would be fine wouldnt it  of course it may be impossiblemost likely it is  you see i am not unpractical  i never forget the present  when i soar ahead into the future i always leave a string by which to find my way back again  i fear me the nature man is a joker  at any rate he lives the simple life  his laundry bill cannot be large  up on his plantation he lives on fruit the labour cost of which in cash he estimates at five cents a day  at present because of his obstructed road and because he is head over heels in the propaganda of socialism he is living in town where his expenses including rent are twentyfive cents a day  in order to pay those expenses he is running a night school for chinese  the nature man is not bigoted  when there is nothing better to eat than meat he eats meat as for instance when in jail or on shipboard and the nuts and fruits give out  nor does he seem to crystallize into anything except sunburn  drop anchor anywhere and the anchor will dragthat is if your soul is a limitless fathomless sea and not dogpound he quoted to me then added  you see my anchor is always dragging  i live for human health and progress and i strive to drag my anchor always in that direction  to me the two are identical  dragging anchor is what has saved me  my anchor did not hold me to my deathbed  i dragged anchor into the brush and fooled the doctors  when i recovered health and strength i started by preaching and by example to teach the people to become nature men and nature women but they had deaf ears  then on the steamer coming to tahiti a quartermaster expounded socialism to me  he showed me that an economic square deal was necessary before men and women could live naturally  so i dragged anchor once more and now i am working for the cooperative commonwealth  when that arrives it will be easy to bring about nature living  i had a dream last night he went on thoughtfully his face slowly breaking into a glow  it seemed that twentyfive nature men and nature women had just arrived on the steamer from california and that i was starting to go with them up the wildpig trail to the plantation  ah me ernest darling sunworshipper and nature man there are times when i am compelled to envy you and your carefree existence i see you now dancing up the steps and cutting antics on the veranda your hair dripping from a plunge in the salt sea your eyes sparkling your sungilded body flashing your chest resounding to the devils own tattoo as you chant  the gorilla in the african jungle pounds his chest until the noise of it can be heard half a mile away  and i shall see you always as i saw you that last day when the snark poked her nose once more through the passage in the smoking reef outward bound and i waved goodbye to those on shore not least in goodwill and affection was the wave i gave to the golden sungod in the scarlet loincloth standing upright in his tiny outrigger canoe    chapter xiithe high seat of abundance    on the arrival of strangers every man endeavoured to obtain one as a friend and carry him off to his own habitation where he is treated with the greatest kindness by the inhabitants of the district they place him on a high seat and feed him with abundance of the finest foodpolynesian researches  the snark was lying at anchor at raiatea just off the village of uturoa  she had arrived the night before after dark and we were preparing to pay our first visit ashore  early in the morning i had noticed a tiny outrigger canoe with an impossible spritsail skimming the surface of the lagoon  the canoe itself was coffin shaped a mere dugout fourteen feet long a scant twelve inches wide and maybe twentyfour inches deep  it had no lines except in so far that it was sharp at both ends  its sides were perpendicular  shorn of the outrigger it would have capsized of itself inside a tenth of a second  it was the outrigger that kept it right side up  i have said that the sail was impossible  it was  it was one of those things not that you have to see to believe but that you cannot believe after you have seen it  the hoist of it and the length of its boom were sufficiently appalling but not content with that its artificer had given it a tremendous head  so large was the head that no common sprit could carry the strain of it in an ordinary breeze  so a spar had been lashed to the canoe projecting aft over the water  to this had been made fast a sprit guy  thus the foot of the sail was held by the mainsheet and the peak by the guy to the sprit  it was not a mere boat not a mere canoe but a sailing machine and the man in it sailed it by his weight and his nerveprincipally by the latter  i watched the canoe beat up from leeward and run in toward the village its sole occupant far out on the outrigger and luffing up and spilling the wind in the puffs  well i know one thing i announced i dont leave raiatea till i have a ride in that canoe  a few minutes later warren called down the companionway heres that canoe you were talking about  promptly i dashed on deck and gave greeting to its owner a tall slender polynesian ingenuous of face and with clear sparkling intelligent eyes  he was clad in a scarlet loincloth and a straw hat  in his hands were presentsa fish a bunch of greens and several enormous yams  all of which acknowledged by smiles which are coinage still in isolated spots of polynesia and by frequent repetitions of mauruuru which is the tahitian thank you i proceeded to make signs that i desired to go for a sail in his canoe  his face lighted with pleasure and he uttered the single word tahaa turning at the same time and pointing to the lofty cloud draped peaks of an island three miles awaythe island of tahaa  it was fair wind over but a headbeat back  now i did not want to go to tahaa  i had letters to deliver in raiatea and officials to see and there was charmian down below getting ready to go ashore by insistent signs i indicated that i desired no more than a short sail on the lagoon  quick was the disappointment in his face yet smiling was the acquiescence  come on for a sail i called below to charmian  but put on your swimming suit  its going to be wet  it wasnt real  it was a dream  that canoe slid over the water like a streak of silver  i climbed out on the outrigger and supplied the weight to hold her down while tehei pronounced tayhayee supplied the nerve  he too in the puffs climbed part way out on the outrigger at the same time steering with both hands on a large paddle and holding the mainsheet with his foot  ready about he called  i carefully shifted my weight inboard in order to maintain the equilibrium as the sail emptied  hard alee he called shooting her into the wind  i slid out on the opposite side over the water on a spar lashed across the canoe and we were full and away on the other tack  all right said tehei  those three phrases ready about hard alee and all right comprised teheis english vocabulary and led me to suspect that at some time he had been one of a kanaka crew under an american captain  between the puffs i made signs to him and repeatedly and interrogatively uttered the word sailor  then i tried it in atrocious french  marin conveyed no meaning to him nor did matelot  either my french was bad or else he was not up in it  i have since concluded that both conjectures were correct  finally i began naming over the adjacent islands  he nodded that he had been to them  by the time my quest reached tahiti he caught my drift his thoughtprocesses were almost visible and it was a joy to watch him think  he nodded his head vigorously  yes he had been to tahiti and he added himself names of islands such as tikihau rangiroa and fakarava thus proving that he had sailed as far as the paumotusundoubtedly one of the crew of a trading schooner  after our short sail when he had returned on board he by signs inquired the destination of the snark and when i had mentioned samoa fiji new guinea france england and california in their geographical sequence he said samoa and by gestures intimated that he wanted to go along  whereupon i was hard put to explain that there was no room for him  petit bateau finally solved it and again the disappointment in his face was accompanied by smiling acquiescence and promptly came the renewed invitation to accompany him to tahaa  charmian and i looked at each other  the exhilaration of the ride we had taken was still upon us  forgotten were the letters to raiatea the officials we had to visit  shoes a shirt a pair of trousers cigarettes matches and a book to read were hastily crammed into a biscuit tin and wrapped in a rubber blanket and we were over the side and into the canoe  when shall we look for you warren called as the wind filled the sail and sent tehei and me scurrying out on the outrigger  i dont know i answered  when we get back as near as i can figure it  and away we went  the wind had increased and with slacked sheets we ran off before it  the freeboard of the canoe was no more than two and a half inches and the little waves continually lapped over the side  this required bailing  now bailing is one of the principal functions of the vahine  vahine is the tahitian for woman and charmian being the only vahine aboard the bailing fell appropriately to her  tehei and i could not very well do it the both of us being perched part way out on the outrigger and busied with keeping the canoe bottomside down  so charmian bailed with a wooden scoop of primitive design and so well did she do it that there were occasions when she could rest off almost half the time  raiatea and tahaa are unique in that they lie inside the same encircling reef  both are volcanic islands ragged of skyline with heavenaspiring peaks and minarets  since raiatea is thirty miles in circumference and tahaa fifteen miles some idea may be gained of the magnitude of the reef that encloses them  between them and the reef stretches from one to two miles of water forming a beautiful lagoon  the huge pacific seas extending in unbroken lines sometimes a mile or half as much again in length hurl themselves upon the reef overtowering and falling upon it with tremendous crashes and yet the fragile coral structure withstands the shock and protects the land  outside lies destruction to the mightiest ship afloat  inside reigns the calm of untroubled water whereon a canoe like ours can sail with no more than a couple of inches of freeboard  we flew over the water  and such waterclear as the clearest springwater and crystalline in its clearness all intershot with a maddening pageant of colours and rainbow ribbons more magnificently gorgeous than any rainbow  jade green alternated with turquoise peacock blue with emerald while now the canoe skimmed over reddish purple pools and again over pools of dazzling shimmering white where pounded coral sand lay beneath and upon which oozed monstrous seaslugs  one moment we were above wondergardens of coral wherein coloured fishes disported fluttering like marine butterflies the next moment we were dashing across the dark surface of deep channels out of which schools of flying fish lifted their silvery flight and a third moment we were above other gardens of living coral each more wonderful than the last  and above all was the tropic tradewind sky with its fluffy clouds racing across the zenith and heaping the horizon with their soft masses  before we were aware we were close in to tahaa pronounced tahhah ah with equal accents and tehei was grinning approval of the vahines proficiency at bailing  the canoe grounded on a shallow shore twenty feet from land and we waded out on a soft bottom where big slugs curled and writhed under our feet and where small octopuses advertised their existence by their superlative softness when stepped upon  close to the beach amid cocoanut palms and banana trees erected on stilts built of bamboo with a grass thatched roof was teheis house  and out of the house came teheis vahine a slender mite of a woman kindly eyed and mongolian of featurewhen she was not north american indian  bihaura tehei called her but he did not pronounce it according to english notions of spelling  spelled bihaura it sounded like beeahoorah with every syllable sharply emphasized  she took charmian by the hand and led her into the house leaving tehei and me to follow  here by signlanguage unmistakable we were informed that all they possessed was ours  no hidalgo was ever more generous in the expression of giving while i am sure that few hidalgos were ever as generous in the actual practice  we quickly discovered that we dare not admire their possessions for whenever we did admire a particular object it was immediately presented to us  the two vahines according to the way of vahines got together in a discussion and examination of feminine fripperies while tehei and i manlike went over fishingtackle and wildpighunting to say nothing of the device whereby bonitas are caught on fortyfoot poles from double canoes  charmian admired a sewing basketthe best example she had seen of polynesian basketry it was hers  i admired a bonita hook carved in one piece from a pearlshell it was mine  charmian was attracted by a fancy braid of straw sennit thirty feet of it in a roll sufficient to make a hat of any design one wished the roll of sennit was hers  my gaze lingered upon a poipounder that dated back to the old stone days it was mine charmian dwelt a moment too long on a wooden poibowl canoeshaped with four legs all carved in one piece of wood it was hers  i glanced a second time at a gigantic cocoanut calabash it was mine then charmian and i held a conference in which we resolved to admire no morenot because it did not pay well enough but because it paid too well  also we were already racking our brains over the contents of the snark for suitable return presents  christmas is an easy problem compared with a polynesian givingfeast  we sat on the cool porch on bihauras best mats while dinner was preparing and at the same time met the villagers  in twos and threes and groups they strayed along shaking hands and uttering the tahitian word of greetingioarana pronounced yorahnah  the men big strapping fellows were in loincloths with here and there no shirt while the women wore the universal ahu a sort of adult pinafore that flows in graceful lines from the shoulders to the ground  sad to see was the elephantiasis that afflicted some of them  here would be a comely woman of magnificent proportions with the port of a queen yet marred by one arm four timesor a dozen timesthe size of the other  beside her might stand a sixfoot man erect mightymuscled bronzed with the body of a god yet with feet and calves so swollen that they ran together forming legs shapeless monstrous that were for all the world like elephant legs  no one seems really to know the cause of the south sea elephantiasis  one theory is that it is caused by the drinking of polluted water  another theory attributes it to inoculation through mosquito bites  a third theory charges it to predisposition plus the process of acclimatization  on the other hand no one that stands in finicky dread of it and similar diseases can afford to travel in the south seas  there will be occasions when such a one must drink water  there may be also occasions when the mosquitoes let up biting  but every precaution of the finicky one will be useless  if he runs barefoot across the beach to have a swim he will tread where an elephantiasis case trod a few minutes before if he closets himself in his own house yet every bit of fresh food on his table will have been subjected to the contamination be it flesh fish fowl or vegetable  in the public market at papeete two known lepers run stalls and heaven alone knows through what channels arrive at that market the daily supplies of fish fruit meat and vegetables  the only happy way to go through the south seas is with a careless poise without apprehension and with a christian sciencelike faith in the resplendent fortune of your own particular star  when you see a woman afflicted with elephantiasis wringing out cream from cocoanut meat with her naked hands drink and reflect how good is the cream forgetting the hands that pressed it out  also remember that diseases such as elephantiasis and leprosy do not seem to be caught by contact  we watched a raratongan woman with swollen distorted limbs prepare our cocoanut cream and then went out to the cookshed where tehei and bihaura were cooking dinner  and then it was served to us on a drygoods box in the house  our hosts waited until we were done and then spread their table on the floor  but our table  we were certainly in the high seat of abundance  first there was glorious raw fish caught several hours before from the sea and steeped the intervening time in limejuice diluted with water  then came roast chicken  two cocoanuts sharply sweet served for drink there were bananas that tasted like strawberries and that melted in the mouth and there was bananapoi that made one regret that his yankee forebears ever attempted puddings  then there was boiled yam boiled taro and roasted feis which last are nothing more or less than large mealy juicy redcoloured cooking bananas  we marvelled at the abundance and even as we marvelled a pig was brought on a whole pig a sucking pig swathed in green leaves and roasted upon the hot stones of a native oven the most honourable and triumphant dish in the polynesian cuisine  and after that came coffee black coffee delicious coffee native coffee grown on the hillsides of tahaa  teheis fishingtackle fascinated me and after we arranged to go fishing charmian and i decided to remain all night  again tehei broached samoa and again my petit bateau brought the disappointment and the smile of acquiescence to his face  bora bora was my next port  it was not so far away but that cutters made the passage back and forth between it and raiatea  so i invited tehei to go that far with us on the snark  then i learned that his wife had been born on bora bora and still owned a house there  she likewise was invited and immediately came the counter invitation to stay with them in their house in born bora  it was monday  tuesday we would go fishing and return to raiatea  wednesday we would sail by tahaa and off a certain point a mile away pick up tehei and bihaura and go on to bora bora  all this we arranged in detail and talked over scores of other things as well and yet tehei knew three phrases in english charmian and i knew possibly a dozen tahitian words and among the four of us there were a dozen or so french words that all understood  of course such polyglot conversation was slow but eked out with a pad a lead pencil the face of a clock charmian drew on the back of a pad and with ten thousand and one gestures we managed to get on very nicely  at the first moment we evidenced an inclination for bed the visiting natives with soft iaoranas faded away and tehei and bihaura likewise faded away  the house consisted of one large room and it was given over to us our hosts going elsewhere to sleep  in truth their castle was ours  and right here i want to say that of all the entertainment i have received in this world at the hands of all sorts of races in all sorts of places i have never received entertainment that equalled this at the hands of this brownskinned couple of tahaa  i do not refer to the presents the freehanded generousness the high abundance but to the fineness of courtesy and consideration and tact and to the sympathy that was real sympathy in that it was understanding  they did nothing they thought ought to be done for us according to their standards but they did what they divined we waited to be done for us while their divination was most successful  it would be impossible to enumerate the hundreds of little acts of consideration they performed during the few days of our intercourse  let it suffice for me to say that of all hospitality and entertainment i have known in no case was theirs not only not excelled but in no case was it quite equalled perhaps the most delightful feature of it was that it was due to no training to no complex social ideals but that it was the untutored and spontaneous outpouring from their hearts  the next morning we went fishing that is tehei charmian and i did in the coffinshaped canoe but this time the enormous sail was left behind  there was no room for sailing and fishing at the same time in that tiny craft  several miles away inside the reef in a channel twenty fathoms deep tehei dropped his baited hooks and rocksinkers  the bait was chunks of octopus flesh which he bit out of a live octopus that writhed in the bottom of the canoe  nine of these lines he set each line attached to one end of a short length of bamboo floating on the surface  when a fish was hooked the end of the bamboo was drawn under the water  naturally the other end rose up in the air bobbing and waving frantically for us to make haste  and make haste we did with whoops and yells and driving paddles from one signalling bamboo to another hauling up from the depths great glistening beauties from two to three feet in length  steadily to the eastward an ominous squall had been rising and blotting out the bright tradewind sky  and we were three miles to leeward of home  we started as the first windgusts whitened the water  then came the rain such rain as only the tropics afford where every tap and main in the sky is open wide and when to top it all the very reservoir itself spills over in blinding deluge well charmian was in a swimming suit i was in pyjamas and tehei wore only a loincloth  bihaura was on the beach waiting for us and she led charmian into the house in much the same fashion that the mother leads in the naughty little girl who has been playing in mudpuddles  it was a change of clothes and a dry and quiet smoke while kaikai was preparing  kaikai by the way is the polynesian for food or to eat or rather it is one form of the original root whatever it may have been that has been distributed far and wide over the vast area of the pacific  it is kai in the marquesas raratonga manahiki niue fakaafo tonga new zealand and vate  in tahiti to eat changes to amu in hawaii and samoa to ai in ban to kana in nina to kana in nongone to kaka and in new caledonia to ki but by whatsoever sound or symbol it was welcome to our ears after that long paddle in the rain  once more we sat in the high seat of abundance until we regretted that we had been made unlike the image of the giraffe and the camel  again when we were preparing to return to the snark the sky to windward turned black and another squall swooped down  but this time it was little rain and all wind  it blew hour after hour moaning and screeching through the palms tearing and wrenching and shaking the frail bamboo dwelling while the outer reef set no a mighty thundering as it broke the force of the swinging seas inside the reef the lagoon sheltered though it was was white with fury and not even teheis seamanship could have enabled his slender canoe to live in such a welter  by sunset the back of the squall had broken though it was still too rough for the canoe  so i had tehei find a native who was willing to venture his cutter across to raiatea for the outrageous sum of two dollars chili which is equivalent in our money to ninety cents  half the village was told off to carry presents with which tehei and bihaura speeded their parting guestscaptive chickens fishes dressed and swathed in wrappings of green leaves great golden bunches of bananas leafy baskets spilling over with oranges and limes alligator pears the butterfruit also called the avoca huge baskets of yams bunches of taro and cocoanuts and last of all large branches and trunks of treesfirewood for the snark  while on the way to the cutter we met the only white man on tahaa and of all men george lufkin a native of new england  eightysix years of age he was sixtyodd of which he said he had spent in the society islands with occasional absences such as the gold rush to eldorado in fortynine and a short period of ranching in california near tulare  given no more than three months by the doctors to live he had returned to his south seas and lived to eightysix and to chuckle over the doctors aforesaid who were all in their graves  feefee he had which is the native for elephantiasis and which is pronounced fayfay  a quarter of a century before the disease had fastened upon him and it would remain with him until he died  we asked him about kith and kin beside him sat a sprightly damsel of sixty his daughter  she is all i have he murmured plaintively and she has no children living  the cutter was a small slooprigged affair but large it seemed alongside teheis canoe  on the other hand when we got out on the lagoon and were struck by another heavy windsquall the cutter became liliputian while the snark in our imagination seemed to promise all the stability and permanence of a continent  they were good boatmen  tehei and bihaura had come along to see us home and the latter proved a good boatwoman herself  the cutter was well ballasted and we met the squall under full sail  it was getting dark the lagoon was full of coral patches and we were carrying on in the height of the squall we had to go about in order to make a short leg to windward to pass around a patch of coral no more than a foot under the surface  as the cutter filled on the other tack and while she was in that dead condition that precedes gathering way she was knocked flat  jibsheet and mainsheet were let go and she righted into the wind  three times she was knocked down and three times the sheets were flung loose before she could get away on that tack  by the time we went about again darkness had fallen  we were now to windward of the snark and the squall was howling  in came the jib and down came the mainsail all but a patch of it the size of a pillowslip  by an accident we missed the snark which was riding it out to two anchors and drove aground upon the inshore coral running the longest line on the snark by means of the launch and after an hours hard work we heaved the cutter off and had her lying safely astern  the day we sailed for bora bora the wind was light and we crossed the lagoon under power to the point where tehei and bihaura were to meet us  as we made in to the land between the coral banks we vainly scanned the shore for our friends  there was no sign of them  we cant wait i said  this breeze wont fetch us to bora bora by dark and i dont want to use any more gasolene than i have to  you see gasolene in the south seas is a problem  one never knows when he will be able to replenish his supply  but just then tehei appeared through the trees as he came down to the water  he had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it bihaura apparently was not ready  once aboard tehei informed us by signs that we must proceed along the land till we got opposite to his house  he took the wheel and conned the snark through the coral around point after point till we cleared the last point of all  cries of welcome went up from the beach and bihaura assisted by several of the villagers brought off two canoeloads of abundance  there were yams taro feis breadfruit cocoanuts oranges limes pineapples watermelons alligator pears pomegranates fish chickens galore crowing and cackling and laying eggs on our decks and a live pig that squealed infernally and all the time in apprehension of imminent slaughter  under the rising moon we came in through the perilous passage of the reef of bora bora and dropped anchor off vaitape village  bihaura with housewifely anxiety could not get ashore too quickly to her house to prepare more abundance for us  while the launch was taking her and tehei to the little jetty the sound of music and of singing drifted across the quiet lagoon  throughout the society islands we had been continually informed that we would find the bora borans very jolly  charmian and i went ashore to see and on the village green by forgotten graves on the beach found the youths and maidens dancing flowergarlanded and flowerbedecked with strange phosphorescent flowers in their hair that pulsed and dimmed and glowed in the moonlight  farther along the beach we came upon a huge grass house ovalshaped seventy feet in length where the elders of the village were singing himines  they too were flower garlanded and jolly and they welcomed us into the fold as little lost sheep straying along from outer darkness  early next morning tehei was on board with a string of freshcaught fish and an invitation to dinner for that evening  on the way to dinner we dropped in at the himine house  the same elders were singing with here or there a youth or maiden that we had not seen the previous night  from all the signs a feast was in preparation towering up from the floor was a mountain of fruits and vegetables flanked on either side by numerous chickens tethered by cocoanut strips  after several himines had been sung one of the men arose and made oration  the oration was made to us and though it was greek to us we knew that in some way it connected us with that mountain of provender  can it be that they are presenting us with all that charmian whispered  impossible i muttered back  why should they be giving it to us besides there is no room on the snark for it  we could not eat a tithe of it  the rest would spoil  maybe they are inviting us to the feast  at any rate that they should give all that to us is impossible  nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance  the orator by gestures unmistakable in detail presented every item in the mountain to us and next he presented it to us in toto  it was an embarrassing moment  what would you do if you lived in a hall bedroom and a friend gave you a white elephant our snark was no more than a hall bedroom and already she was loaded down with the abundance of tahaa  this new supply was too much  we blushed and stammered and mauruurud  we mauruurud with repeated nuis which conveyed the largeness and overwhelmingness of our thanks  at the same time by signs we committed the awful breach of etiquette of not accepting the present  the himine singers disappointment was plainly betrayed and that evening aided by tehei we compromised by accepting one chicken one bunch of bananas one bunch of taro and so on down the list  but there was no escaping the abundance  i bought a dozen chickens from a native out in the country and the following day he delivered thirteen chickens along with a canoeload of fruit  the french storekeeper presented us with pomegranates and lent us his finest horse  the gendarme did likewise lending us a horse that was the very apple of his eye  and everybody sent us flowers  the snark was a fruitstand and a greengrocers shop masquerading under the guise of a conservatory  we went around flowergarlanded all the time  when the himine singers came on board to sing the maidens kissed us welcome and the crew from captain to cabinboy lost its heart to the maidens of bora bora  tehei got up a big fishing expedition in our honour to which we went in a double canoe paddled by a dozen strapping amazons  we were relieved that no fish were caught else the snark would have sunk at her moorings  the days passed but the abundance did not diminish  on the day of departure canoe after canoe put off to us  tehei brought cucumbers and a young papaia tree burdened with splendid fruit  also for me he brought a tiny double canoe with fishing apparatus complete further he brought fruits and vegetables with the same lavishness as at tahaa  bihaura brought various special presents for charmian such as silkcotton pillows fans and fancy mats  the whole population brought fruits flowers and chickens  and bihaura added a live sucking pig  natives whom i did not remember ever having seen before strayed over the rail and presented me with such things as fishpoles fishlines and fishhooks carved from pearlshell  as the snark sailed out through the reef she had a cutter in tow this was the craft that was to take bihaura back to tahaabut not tehei  i had yielded at last and he was one of the crew of the snark  when the cutter cast off and headed east and the snarks bow turned toward the west tehei knelt down by the cockpit and breathed a silent prayer the tears flowing down his cheeks  a week later when martin got around to developing and printing he showed tehei some of the photographs  and that brownskinned son of polynesia gazing on the pictured lineaments of his beloved bihaura broke down in tears  but the abundance  there was so much of it  we could not work the snark for the fruit that was in the way  she was festooned with fruit  the lifeboat and launch were packed with it  the awning guys groaned under their burdens  but once we struck the full tradewind sea the disburdening began  at every roll the snark shook overboard a bunch or so of bananas and cocoanuts or a basket of limes  a golden flood of limes washed about in the leescuppers the big baskets of yams burst and pineapples and pomegranates rolled back and forth  the chickens had got loose and were everywhere roosting on the awnings fluttering and squawking out on the jibboom and essaying the perilous feat of balancing on the spinnakerboom  they were wild chickens accustomed to flight when attempts were made to catch them they flew out over the ocean circled about and came lack  sometimes they did not come back and in the confusion unobserved the little sucking pig got loose and slipped overboard  on the arrival of strangers every man endeavoured to obtain one as a friend and carry him off to his own habitation where he is treated with the greatest kindness by the inhabitants of the district  they place him on a high seat and feed him with abundance of the finest foods    chapter xiiithe stonefishing of bora bora    at five in the morning the conches began to blow  from all along the beach the eerie sounds arose like the ancient voice of war calling to the fishermen to arise and prepare to go forth  we on the snark likewise arose for there could be no sleep in that mad din of conches  also we were going stonefishing though our preparations were few  tautaitaora is the name for stonefishing tautai meaning a fishing instrument  and taora meaning thrown  but tautai taora in combination means stonefishing for a stone is the instrument that is thrown  stonefishing is in reality a fish drive similar in principle to a rabbitdrive or a cattledrive though in the latter affairs drivers and driven operate in the same medium while in the fishdrive the men must be in the air to breathe and the fish are driven through the water  it does not matter if the water is a hundred feet deep the men working on the surface drive the fish just the same  this is the way it is done  the canoes form in line one hundred to two hundred feet apart  in the bow of each canoe a man wields a stone several pounds in weight which is attached to a short rope he merely smites the water with the stone pulls up the stone and smites again  he goes on smiting  in the stern of each canoe another man paddles driving the canoe ahead and at the same time keeping it in the formation  the line of canoes advances to meet a second line a mile or two away the ends of the lines hurrying together to form a circle the far edge of which is the shore  the circle begins to contract upon the shore where the women standing in a long row out into the sea form a fence of legs which serves to break any rushes of the frantic fish  at the right moment when the circle is sufficiently small a canoe dashes out from shore dropping overboard a long screen of cocoanut leaves and encircling the circle thus reinforcing the palisade of legs  of course the fishing is always done inside the reef in the lagoon  tres jolie the gendarme said after explaining by signs and gestures that thousands of fish would be caught of all sizes from minnows to sharks and that the captured fish would boil up and upon the very sand of the beach  it is a most successful method of fishing while its nature is more that of an outing festival rather than of a prosaic foodgetting task  such fishing parties take place about once a month at bora bora and it is a custom that has descended from old time  the man who originated it is not remembered  they always did this thing but one cannot help wondering about that forgotten savage of the long ago into whose mind first flashed this scheme of easy fishing of catching huge quantities of fish without hook or net or spear one thing about him we can know  he was a radical  and we can be sure that he was considered featherbrained and anarchistic by his conservative tribesmen  his difficulty was much greater than that of the modern inventor who has to convince in advance only one or two capitalists  that early inventor had to convince his whole tribe in advance for without the cooperation of the whole tribe the device could not be tested  one can well imagine the nightly powwowings in that primitive island world when he called his comrades antiquated mossbacks and they called him a fool a freak and a crank and charged him with having come from kansas  heaven alone knows at what cost of grey hairs and expletives he must finally have succeeded in winning over a sufficient number to give his idea a trial  at any rate the experiment succeeded  it stood the test of truthit worked  and thereafter we can be confident there was no man to be found who did not know all along that it was going to work  our good friends tehei and bihaura who were giving the fishing in our honour had promised to come for us  we were down below when the call came from on deck that they were coming  we dashed up the companionway to be overwhelmed by the sight of the polynesian barge in which we were to ride  it was a long double canoe the canoes lashed together by timbers with an interval of water between and the whole decorated with flowers and golden grasses  a dozen flowercrowned amazons were at the paddles while at the stern of each canoe was a strapping steersman  all were garlanded with gold and crimson and orange flowers while each wore about the hips a scarlet pareu  there were flowers everywhere flowers flowers flowers without out end  the whole thing was an orgy of colour on the platform forward resting on the bows of the canoes tehei and bihaura were dancing  all voices were raised in a wild song or greeting  three times they circled the snark before coming alongside to take charmian and me on board  then it was away for the fishinggrounds a fivemile paddle dead to windward  everybody is jolly in bora bora is the saying throughout the society islands and we certainly found everybody jolly  canoe songs shark songs and fishing songs were sung to the dipping of the paddles all joining in on the swinging choruses  once in a while the cry mao was raised whereupon all strained like mad at the paddles  mao is shark and when the deepsea tigers appear the natives paddle for dear life for the shore knowing full well the danger they run of having their frail canoes overturned and of being devoured  of course in our case there were no sharks but the cry of mao was used to incite them to paddle with as much energy as if a shark were really after them  hoe  hoe was another cry that made us foam through the water  on the platform tehei and bihaura danced accompanied by songs and choruses or by rhythmic handclappings  at other times a musical knocking of the paddles against the sides of the canoes marked the accent  a young girl dropped her paddle leaped to the platform and danced a hula in the midst of which still dancing she swayed and bent and imprinted on our cheeks the kiss of welcome  some of the songs or himines were religious and they were especially beautiful the deep basses of the men mingling with the altos and thin sopranos of the women and forming a combination of sound that irresistibly reminded one of an organ  in fact kanaka organ is the scoffers description of the himine  on the other hand some of the chants or ballads were very barbaric having come down from pre christian times  and so singing dancing paddling these joyous polynesians took us to the fishing  the gendarme who is the french ruler of bora bora accompanied us with his family in a double canoe of his own paddled by his prisoners for not only is he gendarme and ruler but he is jailer as well and in this jolly land when anybody goes fishing all go fishing  a score of single canoes with outriggers paddled along with us  around a point a big sailingcanoe appeared running beautifully before the wind as it bore down to greet us  balancing precariously on the outrigger three young men saluted us with a wild rolling of drums  the next point half a mile farther on brought us to the place of meeting  here the launch which had been brought along by warren and martin attracted much attention  the bora borans could not see what made it go  the canoes were drawn upon the sand and all hands went ashore to drink cocoanuts and sing and dance  here our numbers were added to by many who arrived on foot from nearby dwellings and a pretty sight it was to see the flowercrowned maidens hand in hand and two by two arriving along the sands  they usually make a big catch allicot a halfcaste trader told us  at the finish the water is fairly alive with fish  it is lots of fun  of course you know all the fish will be yours  all i groaned for already the snark was loaded down with lavish presents by the canoeload of fruits vegetables pigs and chickens  yes every last fish allicot answered  you see when the surround is completed you being the guest of honour must take a harpoon and impale the first one  it is the custom  then everybody goes in with their hands and throws the catch out on the sand there will be a mountain of them  then one of the chiefs will make a speech in which he presents you with the whole kit and boodle but you dont have to take them all  you get up and make a speech selecting what fish you want for yourself and presenting all the rest back again  then everybody says you are very generous  but what would be the result if i kept the whole present i asked  it has never happened was the answer  it is the custom to give and give back again  the native minister started with a prayer for success in the fishing and all heads were bared  next the chief fishermen told off the canoes and allotted them their places  then it was into the canoes and away  no women however came along with the exception of bihaura and charmian  in the old days even they would have been tabooed  the women remained behind to wade out into the water and form the palisade of legs  the big double canoe was left on the beech and we went in the launch  half the canoes paddled off to leeward while we with the other half headed to windward a mile and a half until the end of our line was in touch with the reef  the leader of the drive occupied a canoe midway in our line  he stood erect a fine figure of an old man holding a flag in his hand  he directed the taking of positions and the forming of the two lines by blowing on a conch when all was ready he waved his flag to the right  with a single splash the throwers in every canoe on that side struck the water with their stones  while they were hauling them backa matter of a moment for the stones scarcely sank beneath the surfacethe flag waved to the left and with admirable precision every stone on that side struck the water  so it went back and forth right and left with every wave of the flag a long line of concussion smote the lagoon  at the same time the paddles drove the canoes forward and what was being done in our line was being done in the opposing line of canoes a mile and more away  on the bow of the launch tehei with eyes fixed on the leader worked his stone in unison with the others  once the stone slipped from the rope and the same instant tehei went overboard after it i do not know whether or not that stone reached the bottom but i do know that the next instant tehei broke surface alongside with the stone in his hand  i noticed this same accident occur several times among the nearby canoes but in each instance the thrower followed the stone and brought it back  the reef ends of our lines accelerated the shore ends lagged all under the watchful supervision of the leader until at the reef the two lines joined forming the circle  then the contraction of the circle began the poor frightened fish harried shoreward by the streaks of concussion that smote the water  in the same fashion elephants are driven through the jungle by motes of men who crouch in the long grasses or behind trees and make strange noises already the palisade of legs had been built  we could see the heads of the women in a long line dotting the placid surface of the lagoon  the tallest women went farthest out thus with the exception of those close inshore nearly all were up to their necks in the water  still the circle narrowed till canoes were almost touching  there was a pause  a long canoe shot out from shore following the line of the circle  it went as fast as paddles could drive  in the stern a man threw overboard the long continuous screen of cocoanut leaves  the canoes were no longer needed and overboard went the men to reinforce the palisade with their legs  for the screen was only a screen and not a net and the fish could dash through it if they tried  hence the need for legs that ever agitated the screen and for hands that splashed and throats that yelled  pandemonium reigned as the trap tightened  but no fish broke surface or collided against the hidden legs  at last the chief fisherman entered the trap  he waded around everywhere carefully  but there were no fish boiling up and out upon the sand  there was not a sardine not a minnow not a polly wog  something must have been wrong with that prayer or else and more likely as one grizzled fellow put it the wind was not in its usual quarter and the fish were elsewhere in the lagoon  in fact there had been no fish to drive  about once in five these drives are failures allicot consoled us  well it was the stonefishing that had brought us to bora bora and it was our luck to draw the one chance in five  had it been a raffle it would have been the other way about  this is not pessimism  nor is it an indictment of the plan of the universe  it is merely that feeling which is familiar to most fishermen at the empty end of a hard day    chapter xivthe amateur navigator    there are captains and captains and some mighty fine captains i know but the run of the captains on the snark has been remarkably otherwise  my experience with them has been that it is harder to take care of one captain on a small boat than of two small babies of course this is no more than is to be expected  the good men have positions and are not likely to forsake their onethousandto fifteenthousandton billets for the snark with her ten tons net the snark has had to cull her navigators from the beach and the navigator on the beach is usually a congenital inefficientthe sort of man who beats about for a fortnight trying vainly to find an ocean isle and who returns with his schooner to report the island sunk with all on board the sort of man whose temper or thirst for strong waters works him out of billets faster than he can work into them  the snark has had three captains and by the grace of god she shall have no more  the first captain was so senile as to be unable to give a measurement for a boomjaw to a carpenter  so utterly agedly helpless was he that he was unable to order a sailor to throw a few buckets of salt water on the snarks deck  for twelve days at anchor under an overhead tropic sun the deck lay dry  it was a new deck  it cost me one hundred and thirtyfive dollars to recaulk it  the second captain was angry  he was born angry  papa is always angry was the description given him by his halfbreed son the third captain was so crooked that he couldnt hide behind a corkscrew  the truth was not in him common honesty was not in him and he was as far away from fair play and squaredealing as he was from his proper course when he nearly wrecked the snark on the ring gold isles  it was at suva in the fijis that i discharged my third and last captain and took up gain the role of amateur navigator  i had essayed it once before under my first captain who out of san francisco jumped the snark so amazingly over the chart that i really had to find out what was doing  it was fairly easy to find out for we had a run of twentyone hundred miles before us  i knew nothing of navigation but after several hours of reading up and half an hours practice with the sextant i was able to find the snarks latitude by meridian observation and her longitude by the simple method known as equal altitudes  this is not a correct method  it is not even a safe method but my captain was attempting to navigate by it and he was the only one on board who should have been able to tell me that it was a method to be eschewed  i brought the snark to hawaii but the conditions favoured me  the sun was in northern declination and nearly overhead  the legitimate chronometersight method of ascertaining the longitude i had not heard ofyes i had heard of it  my first captain mentioned it vaguely but after one or two attempts at practice of it he mentioned it no more  i had time in the fijis to compare my chronometer with two other chronometers  two weeks previous at pago pago in samoa i had asked my captain to compare our chronometer with the chronometers on the american cruiser the annapolis  this he told me he had done of course he had done nothing of the sort and he told me that the difference he had ascertained was only a small fraction of a second he told it to me with finely simulated joy and with words of praise for my splendid timekeeper  i repeat it now with words of praise for his splendid and unblushing unveracity  for behold fourteen days later in suva i compared the chronometer with the one on the atua an australian steamer and found that mine was thirtyone seconds fast  now thirtyone seconds of time converted into arc equals seven and onequarter miles  that is to say if i were sailing west in the nighttime and my position according to my dead reckoning from my afternoon chronometer sight was shown to be seven miles off the land why at that very moment i would be crashing on the reef  next i compared my chronometer with captain wooleys  captain wooley the harbourmaster gives the time to suva firing a gun signal at twelve noon three times a week according to his chronometer mine was fiftynine seconds fast which is to say that sailing west i should be crashing on the reef when i thought i was fifteen miles off from it  i compromised by subtracting thirtyone seconds from the total of my chronometers losing error and sailed away for tanna in the new hebrides resolved when nosing around the land on dark nights to bear in mind the other seven miles i might be out according to captain wooleys instrument  tanna lay some six hundred miles west southwest from the fijis and it was my belief that while covering that distance i could quite easily knock into my head sufficient navigation to get me there  well i got there but listen first to my troubles  navigation is easy i shall always contend that but when a man is taking three gasolene engines and a wife around the world and is writing hard every day to keep the engines supplied with gasolene and the wife with pearls and volcanoes he hasnt much time left in which to study navigation  also it is bound to be easier to study said science ashore where latitude and longitude are unchanging in a house whose position never alters than it is to study navigation on a boat that is rushing along day and night toward land that one is trying to find and which he is liable to find disastrously at a moment when he least expects it  to begin with there are the compasses and the setting of the courses  we sailed from suva on saturday afternoon june 6 1908 and it took us till after dark to run the narrow reefridden passage between the islands of viti levu and mbengha  the open ocean lay before me  there was nothing in the way with the exception of vatu leile a miserable little island that persisted in poking up through the sea some twenty miles to the westsouthwest just where i wanted to go  of course it seemed quite simple to avoid it by steering a course that would pass it eight or ten miles to the north  it was a black night and we were running before the wind  the man at the wheel must be told what direction to steer in order to miss vatu leile  but what direction  i turned me to the navigation books  true course i lighted upon  the very thing what i wanted was the true course  i read eagerly on  the true course is the angle made with the meridian by a straight line on the chart drawn to connect the ships position with the place bound to  just what i wanted  the snarks position was at the western entrance of the passage between viti levu and mbengha  the immediate place she was bound to was a place on the chart ten miles north of vatu leile  i pricked that place off on the chart with my dividers and with my parallel rulers found that westbysouth was the true course  i had but to give it to the man at the wheel and the snark would win her way to the safety of the open sea  but alas and alack and lucky for me i read on  i discovered that the compass that trusty everlasting friend of the mariner was not given to pointing north  it varied  sometimes it pointed east of north sometimes west of north and on occasion it even turned tail on north and pointed south  the variation at the particular spot on the globe occupied by the snark was 9 degrees 40 minutes easterly well that had to be taken in to account before i gave the steering course to the man at the wheel  i read  the correct magnetic course is derived from the true course by applying to it the variation  therefore i reasoned if the compass points 9 degrees 40 minutes eastward of north and i wanted to sail due north i should have to steer 9 degrees 40 minutes westward of the north indicated by the compass and which was not north at all  so i added 9 degrees 40 minutes to the left of my westbysouth course thus getting my correct magnetic course and was ready once more to run to open sea  again alas and alack  the correct magnetic course was not the compass course  there was another sly little devil lying in wait to trip me up and land me smashing on the reefs of vatu leile  this little devil went by the name of deviation  i read  the compass course is the course to steer and is derived from the correct magnetic course by applying to it the deviation  now deviation is the variation in the needle caused by the distribution of iron on board of ship  this purely local variation i derived from the deviation card of my standard compass and then applied to the correct magnetic course  the result was the compass course  and yet not yet  my standard compass was amidships on the companionway  my steering compass was aft in the cockpit near the wheel  when the steering compass pointed westbysouth three quarterssouth the steering course the standard compass pointed westonehalfnorth which was certainly not the steering course  i kept the snark up till she was heading westbysouththreequarters south on the standard compass which gave on the steering compass southwestbywest  the foregoing operations constitute the simple little matter of setting a course  and the worst of it is that one must perform every step correctly or else he will hear breakers ahead some pleasant night a nice seabath and be given the delightful diversion of fighting his way to the shore through a horde of man eating sharks  just as the compass is tricky and strives to fool the mariner by pointing in all directions except north so does that guide post of the sky the sun persist in not being where it ought to be at a given time  this carelessness of the sun is the cause of more troubleat least it caused trouble for me  to find out where one is on the earths surface he must know at precisely the same time where the sun is in the heavens  that is to say the sun which is the timekeeper for men doesnt run on time  when i discovered this i fell into deep gloom and all the cosmos was filled with doubt  immutable laws such as gravitation and the conservation of energy became wobbly and i was prepared to witness their violation at any moment and to remain unastonished  for see if the compass lied and the sun did not keep its engagements why should not objects lose their mutual attraction and why should not a few bushel baskets of force be annihilated  even perpetual motion became possible and i was in a frame of mind prone to purchase keeley motor stock from the first enterprising agent that landed on the snarks deck  and when i discovered that the earth really rotated on its axis 366 times a year while there were only 365 sunrises and sunsets i was ready to doubt my own identity  this is the way of the sun  it is so irregular that it is impossible for man to devise a clock that will keep the suns time the sun accelerates and retards as no clock could be made to accelerate and retard  the sun is sometimes ahead of its schedule at other times it is lagging behind and at still other times it is breaking the speed limit in order to overtake itself or rather to catch up with where it ought to be in the sky  in this last case it does not slow down quick enough and as a result goes dashing ahead of where it ought to be  in fact only four days in a year do the sun and the place where the sun ought to be happen to coincide the remaining 361 days the sun is pothering around all over the shop  man being more perfect than the sun makes a clock that keeps regular time  also he calculates how far the sun is ahead of its schedule or behind  the difference between the suns position and the position where the sun ought to be if it were a decent selfrespecting sun man calls the equation of time  thus the navigator endeavouring to find his ships position on the sea looks in his chronometer to see where precisely the sun ought to be according to the greenwich custodian of the sun  then to that location he applies the equation of time and finds out where the sun ought to be and isnt  this latter location along with several other locations enables him to find out what the man from kansas demanded to know some years ago  the snark sailed from fiji on saturday june 6 and the next day sunday on the wide ocean out of sight of land i proceeded to endeavour to find out my position by a chronometer sight for longitude and by a meridian observation for latitude  the chronometer sight was taken in the morning when the sun was some 21 degrees above the horizon  i looked in the nautical almanac and found that on that very day june 7 the sun was behind time 1 minute and 26 seconds and that it was catching up at a rate of 1467 seconds per hour  the chronometer said that at the precise moment of taking the suns altitude it was twentyfive minutes after eight oclock at greenwich  from this date it would seem a schoolboys task to correct the equation of time  unfortunately i was not a schoolboy  obviously at the middle of the day at greenwich the sun was 1 minute and 26 seconds behind time  equally obviously if it were eleven oclock in the morning the sun would be 1 minute and 26 seconds behind time plus 1467 seconds  if it were ten oclock in the morning twice 1467 seconds would have to be added  and if it were 8  25 in the morning then 35 times 1467 seconds would have to be added  quite clearly then if instead of being 825 am it were 825 pm then 85 times 1467 seconds would have to be not added but subtracted for if at noon the sun were 1 minute and 26 seconds behind time and if it were catching up with where it ought to be at the rate of 1467 seconds per hour then at 825 pm it would be much nearer where it ought to be than it had been at noon  so far so good  but was that 825 of the chronometer am or pm  i looked at the snarks clock  it marked 89 and it was certainly am for i had just finished breakfast  therefore if it was eight in the morning on board the snark the eight oclock of the chronometer which was the time of the day at greenwich must be a different eight oclock from the snarks eight oclock  but what eight oclock was it  it cant be the eight oclock of this morning i reasoned therefore it must be either eight oclock this evening or eight oclock last night  it was at this juncture that i fell into the bottomless pit of intellectual chaos  we are in east longitude i reasoned therefore we are ahead of greenwich  if we are behind greenwich then today is yesterday if we are ahead of greenwich then yesterday is to day but if yesterday is today what under the sun is todayto morrow  absurd  yet it must be correct  when i took the sun this morning at 825 the suns custodians at greenwich were just arising from dinner last night  then correct the equation of time for yesterday says my logical mind  but today is today my literal mind insists  i must correct the sun for today and not for yesterday  yet today is yesterday urges my logical mind  thats all very well my literal mind continues if i were in greenwich i might be in yesterday  strange things happen in greenwich  but i know as sure as i am living that i am here now in today june 7 and that i took the sun here now today june 7  therefore i must correct the sun here now today june 7  bosh snaps my logical mind  lecky says  never mind what lecky says interrupts my literal mind  let me tell you what the nautical almanac says  the nautical almanac says that today june 7 the sun was 1 minute and 26 seconds behind time and catching up at the rate of 1467 seconds per hour  it says that yesterday june 6 the sun was 1 minute and 36 seconds behind time and catching up at the rate of 1566 seconds per hour  you see it is preposterous to think of correcting todays sun by yesterdays timetable  fool  idiot  back and forth they wrangle until my head is whirling around and i am ready to believe that i am in the day after the last week before next  i remembered a parting caution of the suva harbourmaster  in east longitude take from the nautical almanac the elements for the preceding day  then a new thought came to me  i corrected the equation of time for sunday and for saturday making two separate operations of it and lo when the results were compared there was a difference only of fourtenths of a second  i was a changed man  i had found my way out of the crypt  the snark was scarcely big enough to hold me and my experience  fourtenths of a second would make a difference of only onetenth of a milea cablelength  all went merrily for ten minutes when i chanced upon the following rhyme for navigators   greenwich time least longitude east greenwich best longitude west   heavens  the snarks time was not as good as greenwich time  when it was 8 25 at greenwich on board the snark it was only 89 greenwich time best longitude west  there i was  in west longitude beyond a doubt  silly cries my literal mind  you are 89 am and greenwich is 825 pm  very well answers my logical mind  to be correct 825 pm is really twenty hours and twentyfive minutes and that is certainly better than eight hours and nine minutes  no there is no discussion you are in west longitude  then my literal mind triumphs  we sailed from suva in the fijis didnt we it demands and logical mind agrees  and suva is in east longitude  again logical mind agrees  and we sailed west which would take us deeper into east longitude didnt we  therefore and you cant escape it we are in east longitude  greenwich time best longitude west chants my logical mind and you must grant that twenty hours and twentyfive minutes is better than eight hours and nine minutes  all right i break in upon the squabble well work up the sight and then well see  and work it up i did only to find that my longitude was 184 degrees west  i told you so snorts my logical mind  i am dumbfounded  so is my literal mind for several minutes  then it enounces  but there is no 184 degrees west longitude nor east longitude nor any other longitude  the largest meridian is 180 degrees as you ought to know very well  having got this far literal mind collapses from the brain strain logical mind is dumb flabbergasted and as for me i get a bleak and wintry look in my eyes and go around wondering whether i am sailing toward the china coast or the gulf of darien  then a thin small voice which i do not recognize coming from nowhere in particular in my consciousness says  the total number of degrees is 360  subtract the 184 degrees west longitude from 360 degrees and you will get 176 degrees east longitude  that is sheer speculation objects literal mind and logical mind remonstrates  there is no rule for it  darn the rules i exclaim  aint i here  the thing is selfevident i continue  184 degrees west longitude means a lapping over in east longitude of four degrees besides i have been in east longitude all the time  i sailed from fiji and fiji is in east longitude  now i shall chart my position and prove it by dead reckoning  but other troubles and doubts awaited me  here is a sample of one in south latitude when the sun is in northern declination chronometer sights may be taken early in the morning  i took mine at eight oclock  now one of the necessary elements in working up such a sight is latitude  but one gets latitude at twelve oclock noon by a meridian observation  it is clear that in order to work up my eight oclock chronometer sight i must have my eight oclock latitude  of course if the snark were sailing due west at six knots per hour for the intervening four hours her latitude would not change  but if she were sailing due south her latitude would change to the tune of twentyfour miles  in which case a simple addition or subtraction would convert the twelve oclock latitude into eight oclock latitude  but suppose the snark were sailing southwest  then the traverse tables must be consulted  this is the illustration  at eight am i took my chronometer sight  at the same moment the distance recorded on the log was noted  at twelve m when the sight for latitude was taken  i again noted the log which showed me that since eight oclock the snark had run 24 miles  her true course had been west 075 south i entered table i in the distance column on the page for 075 point courses and stopped at 24 the number of miles run opposite in the next two columns i found that the snark had made 35 miles of southing or latitude and that she had made 237 miles of westing  to find my eight oclock latitude was easy  i had but to subtract 35 miles from my noon latitude  all the elements being present i worked up my longitude  but this was my eight oclock longitude  since then and up till noon i had made 237 miles of westing  what was my noon longitude i followed the rule turning to traverse table no ii  entering the table according to rule and going through every detail according to rule i found the difference of longitude for the four hours to be 25 miles  i was aghast  i entered the table again according to rule i entered the table half a dozen times according to rule and every time found that my difference of longitude was 25 miles  i leave it to you gentle reader  suppose you had sailed 24 miles and that you had covered 35 miles of latitude then how could you have covered 25 miles of longitude  even if you had sailed due west 24 miles and not changed your latitude how could you have changed your longitude 25 miles  in the name of human reason how could you cover one mile more of longitude than the total number of miles you had sailed  it was a reputable traverse table being none other than bowditchs the rule was simple as navigators rules go i had made no error i spent an hour over it and at the end still faced the glaring impossibility of having sailed 24 miles in the course of which i changed my latitude 35 miles and my longitude 25 miles  the worst of it was that there was nobody to help me out  neither charmian nor martin knew as much as i knew about navigation  and all the time the snark was rushing madly along toward tanna in the new hebrides  something had to be done  how it came to me i know notcall it an inspiration if you will but the thought arose in me  if southing is latitude why isnt westing longitude  why should i have to change westing into longitude  and then the whole beautiful situation dawned upon me the meridians of longitude are 60 miles nautical apart at the equator  at the poles they run together  thus if i should travel up the 180 degrees meridian of longitude until i reached the north pole and if the astronomer at greenwich travelled up the 0 meridian of longitude to the north pole then at the north pole we could shake hands with each other though before we started for the north pole we had been some thousands of miles apart  again  if a degree of longitude was 60 miles wide at the equator and if the same degree at the point of the pole had no width then somewhere between the pole and the equator that degree would be half a mile wide and at other places a mile wide two miles wide ten miles wide thirty miles wide ay and sixty miles wide  all was plain again  the snark was in 19 degrees south latitude the world wasnt as big around there as at the equator  therefore every mile of westing at 19 degrees south was more than a minute of longitude for sixty miles were sixty miles but sixty minutes are sixty miles only at the equator  george francis train broke jules vernes record of around the world  but any man that wants can break george francis trains record  such a man would need only to go in a fast steamer to the latitude of cape horn and sail due east all the way around  the world is very small in that latitude and there is no land in the way to turn him out of his course  if his steamer maintained sixteen knots he would circumnavigate the globe in just about forty days  but there are compensations  on wednesday evening june 10 i brought up my noon position by dead reckoning to eight pm  then i projected the snarks course and saw that she would strike futuna one of the easternmost of the new hebrides a volcanic cone two thousand feet high that rose out of the deep ocean  i altered the course so that the snark would pass ten miles to the northward then i spoke to wada the cook who had the wheel every morning from four to six  wada san tomorrow morning your watch you look sharp on weather bow you see land  and then i went to bed  the die was cast  i had staked my reputation as a navigator  suppose just suppose that at daybreak there was no land  then where would my navigation be  and where would we be  and how would we ever find ourselves or find any land  i caught ghastly visions of the snark sailing for months through ocean solitudes and seeking vainly for land while we consumed our provisions and sat down with haggard faces to stare cannibalism in the face  i confess my sleep was not       like a summer sky that held the music of a lark   rather did i waken to the voiceless dark and listen to the creaking of the bulkheads and the rippling of the sea alongside as the snark logged steadily her six knots an hour  i went over my calculations again and again striving to find some mistake until my brain was in such fever that it discovered dozens of mistakes suppose instead of being sixty miles off futuna that my navigation was all wrong and that i was only six miles off  in which case my course would be wrong too and for all i knew the snark might be running straight at futuna  for all i knew the snark might strike futuna the next moment  i almost sprang from the bunk at that thought and though i restrained myself i know that i lay for a moment nervous and tense waiting for the shock  my sleep was broken by miserable nightmares  earthquake seemed the favourite affliction though there was one man with a bill who persisted in dunning me throughout the night  also he wanted to fight and charmian continually persuaded me to let him alone finally however the man with the everlasting dun ventured into a dream from which charmian was absent  it was my opportunity and we went at it gloriously all over the sidewalk and street until he cried enough  then i said now how about that bill  having conquered i was willing to pay  but the man looked at me and groaned  it was all a mistake he said the bill is for the house next door  that settled him for he worried my dreams no more and it settled me too for i woke up chuckling at the episode  it was three in the morning  i went up on deck  henry the rapa islander was steering  i looked at the log  it recorded fortytwo miles  the snark had not abated her sixknot gait and she had not struck futuna yet  at halfpast five i was again on deck  wada at the wheel had seen no land  i sat on the cockpit rail a prey to morbid doubt for a quarter of an hour  then i saw land a small high piece of land just where it ought to be rising from the water on the weatherbow  at six oclock i could clearly make it out to be the beautiful volcanic cone of futuna  at eight oclock when it was abreast i took its distance by the sextant and found it to be 93 miles away  and i had elected to pass it 10 miles away  then to the south aneiteum rose out of the sea to the north aniwa and dead ahead tanna  there was no mistaking tanna for the smoke of its volcano was towering high in the sky  it was forty miles away and by afternoon as we drew close never ceasing to log our six knots we saw that it was a mountainous hazy land with no apparent openings in its coastline  i was looking for port resolution though i was quite prepared to find that as an anchorage it had been destroyed  volcanic earthquakes had lifted its bottom during the last forty years so that where once the largest ships rode at anchor there was now by last reports scarcely space and depth sufficient for the snark  and why should not another convulsion since the last report have closed the harbour completely  i ran in close to the unbroken coast fringed with rocks awash upon which the crashing tradewind sea burst white and high  i searched with my glasses for miles but could see no entrance  i took a compass bearing of futuna another of aniwa and laid them off on the chart  where the two bearings crossed was bound to be the position of the snark  then with my parallel rulers i laid down a course from the snarks position to port resolution  having corrected this course for variation and deviation i went on deck and lo the course directed me towards that unbroken coastline of bursting seas  to my rapa islanders great concern i held on till the rocks awash were an eighth of a mile away  no harbour this place he announced shaking his head ominously  but i altered the course and ran along parallel with the coast charmian was at the wheel  martin was at the engine ready to throw on the propeller  a narrow silt of an opening showed up suddenly through the glasses i could see the seas breaking clear across henry the rapa man looked with troubled eyes so did tehei the tahaa man  no passage there said henry  we go there we finish quick sure  i confess i thought so too but i ran on abreast watching to see if the line of breakers from one side the entrance did not overlap the line from the other side  sure enough it did  a narrow place where the sea ran smooth appeared   charmian put down the wheel and steadied for the entrance  martin threw on the engine while all hands and the cook sprang to take in sail  a traders house showed up in the bight of the bay  a geyser on the shore a hundred yards away spouted a column of steam  to port as we rounded a tiny point the mission station appeared  three fathoms cried wada at the leadline  three fathoms two fathoms came in quick succession  charmian put the wheel down martin stopped the engine and the snark rounded to and the anchor rumbled down in three fathoms before we could catch our breaths a swarm of black tannese was alongside and aboardgrinning apelike creatures with kinky hair and troubled eyes wearing safetypins and claypipes in their slitted ears  and as for the rest wearing nothing behind and less than that before  and i dont mind telling that that night when everybody was asleep i sneaked up on deck looked out over the quiet scene and gloatedyes gloatedover my navigation    chapter xvcruising in the solomons    why not come along now said captain jansen to us at penduffryn on the island of guadalcanar  charmian and i looked at each other and debated silently for half a minute  then we nodded our heads simultaneously  it is a way we have of making up our minds to do things and a very good way it is when one has no temperamental tears to shed over the last tinof condensed milk when it has capsized  we are living on tinned goods these days and since mind is rumoured to be an emanation of matter our similes are naturally of the packinghouse variety  youd better bring your revolvers along and a couple of rifles said captain jansen  ive got five rifles aboard though the one mauser is without ammunition  have you a few rounds to spare  we brought our rifles on board several handfuls of mauser cartridges and wada and nakata the snarks cook and cabinboy respectively  wada and nakata were in a bit of a funk  to say the least they were not enthusiastic though never did nakata show the white feather in the face of danger  the solomon islands had not dealt kindly with them  in the first place both had suffered from solomon sores  so had the rest of us at the time i was nursing two fresh ones on a diet of corrosive sublimate but the two japanese had had more than their share  and the sores are not nice they may be described as excessively active ulcers  a mosquito bite a cut or the slightest abrasion serves for lodgment of the poison with which the air seems to be filled  immediately the ulcer commences to eat  it eats in every direction consuming skin and muscle with astounding rapidity  the pinpoint ulcer of the first day is the size of a dime by the second day and by the end of the week a silver dollar will not cover it  worse than the sores the two japanese had been afflicted with solomon island fever  each had been down repeatedly with it and in their weak convalescent moments they were wont to huddle together on the portion of the snark that happened to be nearest to faraway japan and to gaze yearningly in that direction  but worst of all they were now brought on board the minota for a recruiting cruise along the savage coast of malaita  wada who had the worse funk was sure that he would never see japan again and with bleak lacklustre eyes he watched our rifles and ammunition going on board the minota  he knew about the minota and her malaita cruises  he knew that she had been captured six months before on the malaita coast that her captain had been chopped to pieces with tomahawks and that according to the barbarian sense of equity on that sweet isle she owed two more heads  also a labourer on penduffryn plantation a malaita boy had just died of dysentery and wada knew that penduffryn had been put in the debt of malaita by one more head  furthermore in stowing our luggage away in the skippers tiny cabin he saw the axe gashes on the door where the triumphant bushmen had cut their way in  and finally the galley stove was without a pipesaid pipe having been part of the loot  the minota was a teakbuilt australian yacht ketchrigged long and lean with a deep finkeel and designed for harbour racing rather than for recruiting blacks  when charmian and i came on board we found her crowded  her double boats crew including substitutes was fifteen and she had a score and more of return boys whose time on the plantations was served and who were bound back to their bush villages  to look at they were certainly true headhunting cannibals  their perforated nostrils were thrust through with bone and wooden bodkins the size of leadpencils numbers of them had punctured the extreme meaty point of the nose from which protruded straight out spikes of turtleshell or of beads strung on stiff wire  a few had further punctured their noses with rows of holes following the curves of the nostrils from lip to point  each ear of every man had from two to a dozen holes in it holes large enough to carry wooden plugs three inches in diameter down to tiny holes in which were carried claypipes and similar trifles  in fact so many holes did they possess that they lacked ornaments to fill them and when the following day as we neared malaita we tried out our rifles to see that they were in working order there was a general scramble for the empty cartridges which were thrust forthwith into the many aching voids in our passengers ears  at the time we tried out our rifles we put up our barbed wire railings  the minota crowndecked without any house and with a rail six inches high was too accessible to boarders  so brass stanchions were screwed into the rail and a double row of barbed wire stretched around her from stem to stern and back again  which was all very well as a protection from savages but it was mighty uncomfortable to those on board when the minota took to jumping and plunging in a seaway  when one dislikes sliding down upon the lee rail barbed wire and when he dares not catch hold of the weather rail barbed wire to save himself from sliding and when with these various disinclinations he finds himself on a smooth flushdeck that is heeled over at an angle of fortyfive degrees some of the delights of solomon islands cruising may be comprehended  also it must be remembered the penalty of a fall into the barbed wire is more than the mere scratches for each scratch is practically certain to become a venomous ulcer  that caution will not save one from the wire was evidenced one fine morning when we were running along the malaita coast with the breeze on our quarter  the wind was fresh and a tidy sea was making  a black boy was at the wheel captain jansen mr jacobsen the mate charmian and i had just sat down on deck to breakfast  three unusually large seas caught us  the boy at the wheel lost his head  three times the minota was swept  the breakfast was rushed over the leerail  the knives and forks went through the scuppers a boy aft went clean overboard and was dragged back and our doughty skipper lay half inboard and half out jammed in the barbed wire  after that for the rest of the cruise our joint use of the several remaining eating utensils was a splendid example of primitive communism  on the eugenie however it was even worse for we had but one teaspoon among four of usbut the eugenie is another story  our first port was suu on the west coast of malaita  the solomon islands are on the fringe of things  it is difficult enough sailing on dark nights through reefspiked channels and across erratic currents where there are no lights to guide from northwest to southeast the solomons extend across a thousand miles of sea and on all the thousands of miles of coasts there is not one lighthouse but the difficulty is seriously enhanced by the fact that the land itself is not correctly charted  suu is an example  on the admiralty chart of malaita the coast at this point runs a straight unbroken line  yet across this straight unbroken line the minota sailed in twenty fathoms of water  where the land was alleged to be was a deep indentation  into this we sailed the mangroves closing about us till we dropped anchor in a mirrored pond captain jansen did not like the anchorage  it was the first time he had been there and suu had a bad reputation  there was no wind with which to get away in case of attack while the crew could be bushwhacked to a man if they attempted to tow out in the whaleboat it was a pretty trap if trouble blew up  suppose the minota went ashorewhat would you do i asked  shes not going ashore was captain jansens answer  but just in case she did i insisted  he considered for a moment and shifted his glance from the mate buckling on a revolver to the boats crew climbing into the whaleboat each man with a rifle  wed get into the whaleboat and get out of here as fast as godd let us came the skippers delayed reply  he explained at length that no white man was sure of his malaita crew in a tight place that the bushmen looked upon all wrecks as their personal property that the bushmen possessed plenty of snider rifles and that he had on board a dozen return boys for suu who were certain to join in with their friends and relatives ashore when it came to looting the minota  the first work of the whaleboat was to take the return boys and their tradeboxes ashore  thus one danger was removed  while this was being done a canoe came alongside manned by three naked savages  and when i say naked i mean naked  not one vestige of clothing did they have on unless noserings earplugs and shell armlets be accounted clothing  the head man in the canoe was an old chief oneeyed reputed to be friendly and so dirty that a boat scraper would have lost its edge on him  his mission was to warn the skipper against allowing any of his people to go ashore  the old fellow repeated the warning again that night  in vain did the whaleboat ply about the shores of the bay in quest of recruits  the bush was full of armed natives all willing enough to talk with the recruiter but not one would engage to sign on for three years plantation labour at six pounds per year  yet they were anxious enough to get our people ashore  on the second day they raised a smoke on the beach at the head of the bay  this being the customary signal of men desiring to recruit the boat was sent but nothing resulted  no one recruited nor were any of our men lured ashore  a little later we caught glimpses of a number of armed natives moving about on the beach  outside of these rare glimpses there was no telling how many might be lurking in the bush  there was no penetrating that primeval jungle with the eye  in the afternoon captain jansen charmian and i went dynamiting fish  each one of the boats crew carried a leeenfield  johnny the native recruiter had a winchester beside him at the steering sweep  we rowed in close to a portion of the shore that looked deserted  here the boat was turned around and backed in in case of attack the boat would be ready to dash away in all the time i was on malaita i never saw a boat land bow on  in fact the recruiting vessels use two boatsone to go in on the beach armed of course and the other to lie off several hundred feet and cover the first boat  the minota however being a small vessel did not carry a covering boat  we were close in to the shore and working in closer sternfirst when a school of fish was sighted  the fuse was ignited and the stick of dynamite thrown  with the explosion the surface of the water was broken by the flash of leaping fish  at the same instant the woods broke into life  a score of naked savages armed with bows and arrows spears and sniders burst out upon the shore  at the same moment our boats crew lifted their rifles  and thus the opposing parties faced each other while our extra boys dived over after the stunned fish  three fruitless days were spent at suu  the minota got no recruits from the bush and the bushmen got no heads from the minota  in fact the only one who got anything was wade and his was a nice dose of fever  we towed out with the whaleboat and ran along the coast to langa langa a large village of saltwater people built with prodigious labour on a lagoon sandbankliterally built up an artificial island reared as a refuge from the bloodthirsty bushmen here also on the shore side of the lagoon was binu the place where the minota was captured half a year previously and her captain killed by the bushmen  as we sailed in through the narrow entrance a canoe came alongside with the news that the manofwar had just left that morning after having burned three villages killed some thirty pigs and drowned a baby  this was the cambrian captain lewes commanding  he and i had first met in korea during the japaneserussian war and we had been crossing each ethers trail ever since without ever a meeting  the day the snark sailed into suva in the fijis we made out the cambrian going out  at vila in the new hebrides we missed each other by one day  we passed each other in the nighttime off the island of santo  and the day the cambrian arrived at tulagi we sailed from penduffryn a dozen miles away  and here at langa langa we had missed by several hours  the cambrian had come to punish the murderers of the minotas captain but what she had succeeded in doing we did not learn until later in the day when a mr abbot a missionary came alongside in his whaleboat  the villages had been burned and the pigs killed but the natives had escaped personal harm  the murderers had not been captured though the minotas flag and other of her gear had been recovered  the drowning of the baby had come about through a misunderstanding  chief johnny of binu had declined to guide the landing party into the bush nor could any of his men be induced to perform that office  whereupon captain lewes righteously indignant had told chief johnny that he deserved to have his village burned  johnnys beche de mer english did not include the word deserve  so his understanding of it was that his village was to be burned anyway  the immediate stampede of the inhabitants was so hurried that the baby was dropped into the water  in the meantime chief johnny hastened to mr abbot  into his hand he put fourteen sovereigns and requested him to go on board the cambrian and buy captain lewes off  johnnys village was not burned  nor did captain lewes get the fourteen sovereigns for i saw them later in johnnys possession when he boarded the minota  the excuse johnny gave me for not guiding the landing party was a big boil which he proudly revealed  his real reason however and a perfectly valid one though he did not state it was fear of revenge on the part of the bushmen  had he or any of his men guided the marines he could have looked for bloody reprisals as soon as the cambrian weighed anchor  as an illustration of conditions in the solomons johnnys business on board was to turn over for a tobacco consideration the sprit mainsail and jib of a whaleboat  later in the day a chief billy came on board and turned over for a tobacco consideration the mast and boom  this gear belonged to a whaleboat which captain jansen had recovered the previous trip of the minota  the whaleboat belonged to meringe plantation on the island of ysabel  eleven contract labourers malaita men and bushmen at that had decided to run away  being bushmen they knew nothing of salt water nor of the way of a boat in the sea  so they persuaded two natives of san cristoval saltwater men to run away with them  it served the san cristoval men right  they should have known better  when they had safely navigated the stolen boat to malaita they had their heads hacked off for their pains  it was this boat and gear that captain jansen had recovered  not for nothing have i journeyed all the way to the solomons  at last i have seen charmians proud spirit humbled and her imperious queendom of femininity dragged in the dust  it happened at langa langa ashore on the manufactured island which one cannot see for the houses  here surrounded by hundreds of unblushing naked men women and children we wandered about and saw the sights  we had our revolvers strapped on and the boats crew fully armed lay at the oars stern in but the lesson of the manofwar was too recent for us to apprehend trouble  we walked about everywhere and saw everything until at last we approached a large tree trunk that served as a bridge across a shallow estuary  the blacks formed a wall in front of us and refused to let us pass  we wanted to know why we were stopped  the blacks said we could go on  we misunderstood and started  explanations became more definite captain jansen and i being men could go on  but no mary was allowed to wade around that bridge much less cross it  mary is beche de mer for woman  charmian was a mary  to her the bridge was tambo which is the native for taboo  ah how my chest expanded at last my manhood was vindicated  in truth i belonged to the lordly sex  charmian could trapse along at our heels but we were men and we could go right over that bridge while she would have to go around by whaleboat  now i should not care to be misunderstood by what follows but it is a matter of common knowledge in the solomons that attacks of fever are often brought on by shock  inside half an hour after charmian had been refused the right of way she was being rushed aboard the minota packed in blankets and dosed with quinine  i dont know what kind of shock had happened to wada and nakata but at any rate they were down with fever as well  the solomons might be healthfuller  also during the attack of fever charmian developed a solomon sore it was the last straw  every one on the snark had been afflicted except her  i had thought that i was going to lose my foot at the ankle by one exceptionally malignant boring ulcer  henry and tehei the tahitian sailors had had numbers of them  wada had been able to count his by the score  nakata had had single ones three inches in length  martin had been quite certain that necrosis of his shinbone had set in from the roots of the amazing colony he elected to cultivate in that locality  but charmian had escaped  out of her long immunity had been bred contempt for the rest of us  her ego was flattered to such an extent that one day she shyly informed me that it was all a matter of pureness of blood  since all the rest of us cultivated the sores and since she did notwell anyway hers was the size of a silver dollar and the pureness of her blood enabled her to cure it after several weeks of strenuous nursing  she pins her faith to corrosive sublimate  martin swears by iodoform  henry uses limejuice undiluted  and i believe that when corrosive sublimate is slow in taking hold alternate dressings of peroxide of hydrogen are just the thing  there are white men in the solomons who stake all upon boracic acid and others who are prejudiced in favour of lysol  i also have the weakness of a panacea  it is california  i defy any man to get a solomon island sore in california  we ran down the lagoon from langa langa between mangrove swamps through passages scarcely wider than the minota and past the reef villages of kaloka and auki  like the founders of venice these saltwater men were originally refugees from the mainland  too weak to hold their own in the bush survivors of village massacres they fled to the sandbanks of the lagoon  these sandbanks they built up into islands  they were compelled to seek their provender from the sea and in time they became saltwater men  they learned the ways of the fish and the shellfish and they invented hooks and lines nets and fishtraps  they developed canoebodies  unable to walk about spending all their time in the canoes they became thickarmed and broadshouldered with narrow waists and frail spindly legs  controlling the seacoast they became wealthy trade with the interior passing largely through their hands  but perpetual enmity exists between them and the bushmen  practically their only truces are on marketdays which occur at stated intervals usually twice a week  the bushwomen and the saltwater women do the bartering  back in the bush a hundred yards away fully armed lurk the bushmen while to seaward in the canoes are the saltwater men  there are very rare instances of the marketday truces being broken  the bushmen like their fish too well while the saltwater men have an organic craving for the vegetables they cannot grow on their crowded islets  thirty miles from langa langa brought us to the passage between bassakanna island and the mainland  here at nightfall the wind left us and all night with the whaleboat towing ahead and the crew on board sweating at the sweeps we strove to win through  but the tide was against us  at midnight midway in the passage we came up with the eugenie a big recruiting schooner towing with two whaleboats  her skipper captain keller a sturdy young german of twentytwo came on board for a gam and the latest news of malaita was swapped back and forth  he had been in luck having gathered in twenty recruits at the village of fiu  while lying there one of the customary courageous killings had taken place the murdered boy was what is called a saltwater bushmanthat is a saltwater man who is half bushman and who lives by the sea but does not live on an islet  three bushmen came down to this man where he was working in his garden  they behaved in friendly fashion and after a time suggested kaikai  kaikai means food  he built a fire and started to boil some taro  while bending over the pot one of the bushmen shot him through the head  he fell into the flames whereupon they thrust a spear through his stomach turned it around and broke it off  my word said captain keller i dont want ever to be shot with a snider  spread  you could drive a horse and carriage through that hole in his head  another recent courageous killing i heard of on malaita was that of an old man  a bush chief had died a natural death  now the bushmen dont believe in natural deaths  no one was ever known to die a natural death  the only way to die is by bullet tomahawk or spear thrust  when a man dies in any other way it is a clear case of having been charmed to death  when the bush chief died naturally his tribe placed the guilt on a certain family  since it did not matter which one of the family was killed they selected this old man who lived by himself  this would make it easy  furthermore he possessed no snider  also he was blind  the old fellow got an inkling of what was coming and laid in a large supply of arrows three brave warriors each with a snider came down upon him in the night time  all night they fought valiantly with him  whenever they moved in the bush and made a noise or a rustle he discharged an arrow in that direction  in the morning when his last arrow was gone the three heroes crept up to him and blew his brains out  morning found us still vainly toiling through the passage  at last in despair we turned tail ran out to sea and sailed clear round bassakanna to our objective malu  the anchorage at malu was very good but it lay between the shore and an ugly reef and while easy to enter it was difficult to leave  the direction of the southeast trade necessitated a beat to windward the point of the reef was widespread and shallow while a current bore down at all times upon the point  mr caulfeild the missionary at malu arrived in his whaleboat from a trip down the coast  a slender delicate man he was enthusiastic in his work levelheaded and practical a true twentiethcentury soldier of the lord  when he came down to this station on malaita as he said he agreed to come for six months he further agreed that if he were alive at the end of that time he would continue on  six years had passed and he was still continuing on  nevertheless he was justified in his doubt as to living longer than six months  three missionaries had preceded him on malaita and in less than that time two had died of fever and the third had gone home a wreck  what murder are you talking about he asked suddenly in the midst of a confused conversation with captain jansen  captain jansen explained  oh thats not the one i have reference to quoth mr caulfeild thats old already  it happened two weeks ago  it was here at malu that i atoned for all the exulting and gloating i had been guilty of over the solomon sore charmian had collected at langa langa  mr caulfeild was indirectly responsible for my atonement  he presented us with a chicken which i pursued into the bush with a rifle  my intention was to clip off its head  i succeeded but in doing so fell over a log and barked my shin result  three solomon sores  this made five all together that were adorning my person  also captain jansen and nakata had caught garigari  literally translated garigari is scratchscratch  but translation was not necessary for the rest of us  the skippers and nakatas gymnastics served as a translation without words  no the solomon islands are not as healthy as they might be  i am writing this article on the island of ysabel where we have taken the snark to careen and clean her cooper  i got over my last attack of fever this morning and i have had only one free day between attacks  charmians are two weeks apart  wada is a wreck from fever  last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia  henry a strapping giant of a tahitian just up from his last dose of fever is dragging around the deck like a last years crabapple  both he and tehei have accumulated a praiseworthy display of solomon sores  also they have caught a new form of garigari a sort of vegetable poisoning like poison oak or poison ivy  but they are not unique in this  a number of days ago charmian martin and i went pigeonshooting on a small island and we have had a foretaste of eternal torment ever since  also on that small island martin cut the soles of his feet to ribbons on the coral whilst chasing a sharkat least so he says but from the glimpse i caught of him i thought it was the other way about  the coralcuts have all become solomon sores  before my last fever i knocked the skin off my knuckles while heaving on a line and i now have three fresh sores  and poor nakata  for three weeks he has been unable to sit down  he sat down yesterday for the first time and managed to stay down for fifteen minutes  he says cheerfully that he expects to be cured of his garigari in another month furthermore his garigari from too enthusiastic scratch scratching has furnished footholds for countless solomon sores still furthermore he has just come down with his seventh attack of fever  if i were king the worst punishment i could inflict on my enemies would be to banish them to the solomons  on second thought king or no king i dont think id have the heart to do it  recruiting plantation labourers on a small narrow yacht built for harbour sailing is not any too nice  the decks swarm with recruits and their families  the main cabin is packed with them  at night they sleep there  the only entrance to our tiny cabin is through the main cabin and we jam our way through them or walk over them nor is this nice  one and all they are afflicted with every form of malignant skin disease  some have ringworm others have bukua this latter is caused by a vegetable parasite that invades the skin and eats it away  the itching is intolerable  the afflicted ones scratch until the air is filled with fine dry flakes  then there are yaws and many other skin ulcerations  men come aboard with solomon sores in their feet so large that they can walk only on their toes or with holes in their legs so terrible that a fist could be thrust in to the bone  bloodpoisoning is very frequent and captain jansen with sheathknife and sail needle operates lavishly on one and all  no matter how desperate the situation after opening and cleansing he claps on a poultice of seabiscuit soaked in water  whenever we see a particularly horrible case we retire to a corner and deluge our own sores with corrosive sublimate  and so we live and eat and sleep on the minota taking our chance and pretending it is good  at suava another artificial island i had a second crow over charmian  a big fella marster belong suava which means the high chief of suava came on board  but first he sent an emissary to captain jansen for a fathom of calico with which to cover his royal nakedness  meanwhile he lingered in the canoe alongside  the regal dirt on his chest i swear was half an inch thick while it was a good wager that the underneath layers were anywhere from ten to twenty years of age  he sent his emissary on board again who explained that the big fella marster belong suava was condescendingly willing enough to shake hands with captain jansen and me and cadge a stick or so of trade tobacco but that nevertheless his highborn soul was still at so lofty an altitude that it could not sink itself to such a depth of degradation as to shake hands with a mere female woman  poor charmian  since her malaita experiences she has become a changed woman  her meekness and humbleness are appallingly becoming and i should not be surprised when we return to civilization and stroll along a sidewalk to see her take her station with bowed head a yard in the rear  nothing much happened at suava  bichu the native cook deserted the minota dragged anchor  it blew heavy squalls of wind and rain the mate mr jacobsen and wada were prostrated with fever  our solomon sores increased and multiplied  and the cockroaches on board held a combined fourth of july and coronation parade  they selected midnight for the time and our tiny cabin for the place they were from two to three inches long there were hundreds of them and they walked all over us  when we attempted to pursue them they left solid footing rose up in the air and fluttered about like hummingbirds  they were much larger than ours on the snark  but ours are young yet and havent had a chance to grow also the snark has centipedes big ones six inches long  we kill them occasionally usually in charmians bunk  ive been bitten twice by them both times foully while i was asleep  but poor martin had worse luck  after being sick in bed for three weeks the first day he sat up he sat down on one  sometimes i think they are the wisest who never go to carcassonne  later on we returned to malu picked up seven recruits hove up anchor and started to beat out the treacherous entrance  the wind was chopping about the current upon the ugly point of reef setting strong  just as we were on the verge of clearing it and gaining open sea the wind broke off four points  the minota attempted to go about but missed stays  two of her anchors had been lost at tulagi  her one remaining anchor was let go  chain was let out to give it a hold on the coral  her fin keel struck bottom and her main topmast lurched and shivered as if about to come down upon our heads  she fetched up on the slack of the anchors at the moment a big comber smashed her shoreward  the chain parted  it was our only anchor  the minota swung around on her heel and drove headlong into the breakers  bedlam reigned  all the recruits below bushmen and afraid of the sea dashed panicstricken on deck and got in everybodys way  at the same time the boats crew made a rush for the rifles  they knew what going ashore on malaita meantone hand for the ship and the other hand to fight off the natives  what they held on with i dont know and they needed to hold on as the minota lifted rolled and pounded on the coral  the bushmen clung in the rigging too witless to watch out for the topmast  the whaleboat was run out with a towline endeavouring in a puny way to prevent the minota from being flung farther in toward the reef while captain jansen and the mate the latter pallid and weak with fever were resurrecting a scrap anchor from out the ballast and rigging up a stock for it  mr caulfeild with his mission boys arrived in his whaleboat to help  when the minota first struck there was not a canoe in sight but like vultures circling down out of the blue canoes began to arrive from every quarter  the boats crew with rifles at the ready kept them lined up a hundred feet away with a promise of death if they ventured nearer  and there they clung a hundred feet away black and ominous crowded with men holding their canoes with their paddles on the perilous edge of the breaking surf  in the meantime the bushmen were flocking down from the hills armed with spears sniders arrows and clubs until the beach was massed with them to complicate matters at least ten of our recruits had been enlisted from the very bushmen ashore who were waiting hungrily for the loot of the tobacco and trade goods and all that we had on board  the minota was honestly built which is the first essential for any boat that is pounding on a reef  some idea of what she endured may be gained from the fact that in the first twentyfour hours she parted two anchorchains and eight hawsers  our boats crew was kept busy diving for the anchors and bending new lines  there were times when she parted the chains reinforced with hawsers  and yet she held together  tree trunks were brought from ashore and worked under her to save her keel and bilges but the trunks were gnawed and splintered and the ropes that held them frayed to fragments and still she pounded and held together  but we were luckier than the ivanhoe a big recruiting schooner which had gone ashore on malaita several months previously and been promptly rushed by the natives the captain and crew succeeded in getting away in the whaleboats and the bushmen and saltwater men looted her clean of everything portable  squall after squall driving wind and blinding rain smote the minota while a heavier sea was making  the eugenie lay at anchor five miles to windward but she was behind a point of land and could not know of our mishap  at captain jansens suggestion i wrote a note to captain keller asking him to bring extra anchors and gear to our aid  but not a canoe could be persuaded to carry the letter i offered half a case of tobacco but the blacks grinned and held their canoes bowon to the breaking seas  a half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds  in two hours even against the strong wind and sea a man could have carried the letter and received in payment what he would have laboured half a year for on a plantation  i managed to get into a canoe and paddle out to where mr caulfeild was running an anchor with his whaleboat  my idea was that he would have more influence over the natives  he called the canoes up to him and a score of them clustered around and heard the offer of half a case of tobacco  no one spoke  i know what you think the missionary called out to them  you think plenty tobacco on the schooner and youre going to get it  i tell you plenty rifles on schooner  you no get tobacco you get bullets  at last one man alone in a small canoe took the letter and started  waiting for relief work went on steadily on the minota her watertanks were emptied and spars sails and ballast started shoreward  there were lively times on board when the minota rolled one bilge down and then the other a score of men leaping for life and legs as the tradeboxes booms and eightypound pigs of iron ballast rushed across from rail to rail and back again  the poor pretty harbour yacht  her decks and running rigging were a raffle down below everything was disrupted  the cabin floor had been torn up to get at the ballast and rusty bilgewater swashed and splashed  a bushel of limes in a mess of flour and water charged about like so many sticky dumplings escaped from a halfcooked stew in the inner cabin nakata kept guard over our rifles and ammunition  three hours from the time our messenger started a whaleboat pressing along under a huge spread of canvas broke through the thick of a shrieking squall to windward  it was captain keller wet with rain and spray a revolver in belt his boats crew fully armed anchors and hawsers heaped high amidships coming as fast as wind could drivethe white man the inevitable white man coming to a white mans rescue  the vulture line of canoes that had waited so long broke and disappeared as quickly as it had formed  the corpse was not dead after all  we now had three whaleboats two plying steadily between the vessel and shore the other kept busy running out anchors rebending parted hawsers and recovering the lost anchors later in the afternoon after a consultation in which we took into consideration that a number of our boats crew as well as ten of the recruits belonged to this place we disarmed the boats crew this incidently gave them both hands free to work for the vessel the rifles were put in the charge of five of mr caulfeilds mission boys  and down below in the wreck of the cabin the missionary and his converts prayed to god to save the minota  it was an impressive scene the unarmed man of god praying with cloudless faith his savage followers leaning on their rifles and mumbling amens  the cabin walls reeled about them  the vessel lifted and smashed upon the coral with every sea  from on deck came the shouts of men heaving and toiling praying in another fashion with purposeful will and strength of arm  that night mr caulfeild brought off a warning  one of our recruits had a price on his head of fifty fathoms of shellmoney and forty pigs  baffled in their desire to capture the vessel the bushmen decided to get the head of the man  when killing begins there is no telling where it will end so captain jansen armed a whaleboat and rowed in to the edge of the beach  ugi one of his boats crew stood up and orated for him  ugi was excited  captain jansens warning that any canoe sighted that night would be pumped full of lead ugi turned into a bellicose declaration of war which wound up with a peroration somewhat to the following effect  you kill my captain i drink his blood and die with him  the bushmen contented themselves with burning an unoccupied mission house and sneaked back to the bush  the next day the eugenie sailed in and dropped anchor  three days and two nights the minota pounded on the reef but she held together and the shell of her was pulled off at last and anchored in smooth water  there we said goodbye to her and all on board and sailed away on the eugenie bound for florida island 1    chapter xvibeche de mer english    given a number of white traders a wide area of land and scores of savage languages and dialects the result will be that the traders will manufacture a totally new unscientific but perfectly adequate language  this the traders did when they invented the chinook lingo for use over british columbia alaska and the northwest territory  so with the lingo of the krooboys of africa the pigeon english of the far east and the beche de mer of the westerly portion of the south seas  this latter is often called pigeon english but pigeon english it certainly is not  to show how totally different it is mention need be made only of the fact that the classic piecee of china has no place in it  there was once a sea captain who needed a dusky potentate down in his cabin  the potentate was on deck  the captains command to the chinese steward was hey boy you go topside catchee one piecee king  had the steward been a new hibridean or a solomon islander the command would have been  hey you fella boy go look m eye belong you along deck bring m me fella one big fella marster belong black man  it was the first white men who ventured through melanesia after the early explorers who developed beche de mer englishmen such as the beche de mer fishermen the sandalwood traders the pearl hunters and the labour recruiters  in the solomons for instance scores of languages and dialects are spoken  unhappy the trader who tried to learn them all for in the next group to which he might wander he would find scores of additional tongues  a common language was necessarya language so simple that a child could learn it with a vocabulary as limited as the intelligence of the savages upon whom it was to be used  the traders did not reason this out  beche do mer english was the product of conditions and circumstances function precedes organ and the need for a universal melanesian lingo preceded beche de mer english  beche de mer was purely fortuitous but it was fortuitous in the deterministic way  also from the fact that out of the need the lingo arose beche de mer english is a splendid argument for the esperanto enthusiasts  a limited vocabulary means that each word shall be overworked thus fella in beche de mer means all that piecee does and quite a bit more and is used continually in every possible connection another overworked word is belong  nothing stands alone everything is related  the thing desired is indicated by its relationship with other things  a primitive vocabulary means primitive expression thus the continuance of rain is expressed as rain he stop  sun he come up cannot possibly be misunderstood while the phrasestructure itself can be used without mental exertion in ten thousand different ways as for instance a native who desires to tell you that there are fish in the water and who says fish he stop  it was while trading on ysabel island that i learned the excellence of this usage  i wanted two or three pairs of the large clamshells measuring three feet across but i did not want the meat inside  also i wanted the meat of some of the smaller clams to make a chowder  my instruction to the natives finally ripened into the following you fella bring me fella big fella clamkaikai he no stop he walk about  you fella bring me fella small fella clamkaikai he stop  kaikai is the polynesian for food meat eating and to eat  but it would be hard to say whether it was introduced into melanesia by the sandalwood traders or by the polynesian westward drift  walk about is a quaint phrase  thus if one orders a solomon sailor to put a tackle on a boom he will suggest that fella boom he walk about too much  and if the said sailor asks for shore liberty he will state that it is his desire to walk about  or if said sailor be seasick he will explain his condition by stating belly belong me walk about too much  too much by the way does not indicate anything excessive  it is merely the simple superlative  thus if a native is asked the distance to a certain village his answer will be one of these four closeup long way little bit long way big bit or long way too much  long way too much does not mean that one cannot walk to the village it means that he will have to walk farther than if the village were a long way big bit  gammon is to lie to exaggerate to joke  mary is a woman  any woman is a mary  all women are marys  doubtlessly the first dim white adventurer whimsically called a native woman mary and of similar birth must have been many other words in beche de mer  the white men were all seamen and so capsize and sing out were introduced into the lingo  one would not tell a melanesian cook to empty the dishwater but he would tell him to capsize it  to sing out is to cry loudly to call out or merely to speak  singsing is a song  the native christian does not think of god calling for adam in the garden of eden in the natives mind god sings out for adam  savvee or catchee are practically the only words which have been introduced straight from pigeon english  of course pickaninny has happened along but some of its uses are delicious  having bought a fowl from a native in a canoe the native asked me if i wanted pickaninny stop along him fella  it was not until he showed me a handful of hens eggs that i understood his meaning  my word as an exclamation with a thousand significances could have arrived from nowhere else than old england  a paddle a sweep or an oar is called washee and washee is also the verb  here is a letter dictated by one peter a native trader at santa anna and addressed to his employer  harry the schooner captain started to write the letter but was stopped by peter at the end of the second sentence  thereafter the letter runs in peters own words for peter was afraid that harry gammoned too much and he wanted the straight story of his needs to go to headquarters   santa anna  trader peter has worked 12 months for your firm and has not received any pay yet  he hereby wants 12 pounds  at this point peter began dictation   harry he gammon along him all the time too much  i like him 6 tin biscuit 4 bag rice 24 tin bullamacow me like him 2 rifle me savvee look out along boat some place me go man he no good he kaikai along me  peter   bullamacow means tinned beef  this word was corrupted from the english language by the samoans and from them learned by the traders who carried it along with them into melanesia  captain cook and the other early navigators made a practice of introducing seeds plants and domestic animals amongst the natives  it was at samoa that one such navigator landed a bull and a cow  this is a bull and cow said he to the samoans  they thought he was giving the name of the breed and from that day to this beef on the hoof and beef in the tin is called bullamacow  a solomon islander cannot say fence so in beche de mer it becomes fennis store is sittore and box is bokkis  just now the fashion in chests which are known as boxes is to have a bellarrangement on the lock so that the box cannot be opened without sounding an alarm  a box so equipped is not spoken of as a mere box but as the bokkis belong bell  fright is the beche de mer for fear  if a native appears timid and one asks him the cause he is liable to hear in reply  me fright along you too much  or the native may be fright along storm or wild bush or haunted places  cross covers every form of anger  a man may be cross at one when he is feeling only petulant or he may be cross when he is seeking to chop off your head and make a stew out of you  a recruit after having toiled three years on a plantation was returned to his own village on malaita  he was clad in all kinds of gay and sportive garments  on his head was a top hat  he possessed a tradebox full of calico beads porpoise teeth and tobacco  hardly was the anchor down when the villagers were on board  the recruit looked anxiously for his own relatives but none was to be seen  one of the natives took the pipe out of his mouth  another confiscated the strings of beads from around his neck  a third relieved him of his gaudy loincloth and a fourth tried on the tophat and omitted to return it  finally one of them took his tradebox which represented three years toil and dropped it into a canoe alongside  that fella belong you the captain asked the recruit referring to the thief  no belong me was the answer  then why in jericho do you let him take the box the captain demanded indignantly  quoth the recruit me speak along him say bokkis he stop that fella he cross along mewhich was the recruits way of saying that the other man would murder him gods wrath when he sent the flood was merely a case of being cross along mankind  what name is the great interrogation of beche de mer  it all depends on how it is uttered  it may mean  what is your business what do you mean by this outrageous conduct  what do you want what is the thing you are after  you had best watch out i demand an explanation and a few hundred other things  call a native out of his house in the middle of the night and he is likely to demand what name you sing out along me  imagine the predicament of the germans on the plantations of bougainville island who are compelled to learn beche de mer english in order to handle the native labourers  it is to them an unscientific polyglot and there are no textbooks by which to study it  it is a source of unholy delight to the other white planters and traders to hear the german wrestling stolidly with the circumlocutions and shortcuts of a language that has no grammar and no dictionary  some years ago large numbers of solomon islanders were recruited to labour on the sugar plantations of queensland  a missionary urged one of the labourers who was a convert to get up and preach a sermon to a shipload of solomon islanders who had just arrived  he chose for his subject the fall of man and the address he gave became a classic in all australasia  it proceeded somewhat in the following manner  altogether you boy belong solomons you no savvee white man  me fella me savvee him  me fella me savvee talk along white man  before long time altogether no place he stop  god big fella marster belong

when we sailed from san francisco on the snark i knew as much about sickness as the admiral of the swiss navy knows about salt water and here at the start let me advise any one who meditates going to outoftheway tropic places  go to a firstclass druggistthe sort that have specialists on their salary list who know everything talk the matter over with such an one  note carefully all that he says  have a list made of all that he recommends  write out a cheque for the total cost and tear it up  i wish i had done the same  i should have been far wiser i know now if i had bought one of those readymade selfacting fool proof medicine chests such as are favoured by fourthrate ship masters  in such a chest each bottle has a number  on the inside of the lid is placed a simple table of directions  no 1 toothache no 2 smallpox no 3 stomachache no 4 cholera no 5 rheumatism and so on through the list of human ills  and i might have used it as did a certain venerable skipper who when no 3 was empty mixed a dose from no 1 and no 2 or when no 7 was all gone dosed his crew with 4 and 3 till 3 gave out when he used 5 and 2  so far with the exception of corrosive sublimate which was recommended as an antiseptic in surgical operations and which i have not yet used for that purpose my medicinechest has been useless  it has been worse than useless for it has occupied much space which i could have used to advantage  with my surgical instruments it is different  while i have not yet had serious use for them i do not regret the space they occupy the thought of them makes me feel good  they are so much life insurance only fairer than that last grim game one is not supposed to die in order to win  of course i dont know how to use them and what i dont know about surgery would set up a dozen quacks in prosperous practice  but needs must when the devil drives and we of the snark have no warning when the devil may take it into his head to drive ay even a thousand miles from land and twenty days from the nearest port  i did not know anything about dentistry but a friend fitted me out with forceps and similar weapons and in honolulu i picked up a book upon teeth  also in that subtropical city i managed to get hold of a skull from which i extracted the teeth swiftly and painlessly thus equipped i was ready though not exactly eager to tackle any tooth that get in my way  it was in nukuhiva in the marquesas that my first case presented itself in the shape of a little old chinese  the first thing i did was to got the buck fever and i leave it to any fairminded person if buck fever with its attendant heartpalpitations and armtremblings is the right condition for a man to be in who is endeavouring to pose as an old hand at the business  i did not fool the aged chinaman  he was as frightened as i and a bit more shaky  i almost forgot to be frightened in the fear that he would bolt  i swear if he had tried to that i would have tripped him up and sat on him until calmness and reason returned  i wanted that tooth  also martin wanted a snapshot of me getting it  likewise charmian got her camera  then the procession started we were stopping at what had been the clubhouse when stevenson was in the marquesas on the casco  on the veranda where he had passed so many pleasant hours the light was not goodfor snapshots i mean  i led on into the garden a chair in one hand the other hand filled with forceps of various sorts my knees knocking together disgracefully  the poor old chinaman came second and he was shaking too  charmian and martin brought up the rear armed with kodaks  we dived under the avocado trees threaded our way through the cocoanut palms and came on a spot that satisfied martins photographic eye  i looked at the tooth and then discovered that i could not remember anything about the teeth i had pulled from the skull five months previously  did it have one prong two prongs or three prongs what was left of the part that showed appeared very crumbly and i knew that i should have take hold of the tooth deep down in the gum it was very necessary that i should know how many prongs that tooth had  back to the house i went for the book on teeth  the poor old victim looked like photographs i had seen of fellowcountrymen of his criminals on their knees waiting the stroke of the beheading sword  dont let him get away i cautioned to martin  i want that tooth  i sure wont he replied with enthusiasm from behind his camera i want that photograph  for the first time i felt sorry for the chinaman  though the book did not tell me anything about pulling teeth it was all right for on one page i found drawings of all the teeth including their prongs and how they were set in the jaw  then came the pursuit of the forceps  i had seven pairs but was in doubt as to which pair i should use  i did not want any mistake  as i turned the hardware over with rattle and clang the poor victim began to lose his grip and to turn a greenish yellow around the gills  he complained about the sun but that was necessary for the photograph and he had to stand it  i fitted the forceps around the tooth and the patient shivered and began to wilt  ready i called to martin  all ready he answered  i gave a pull  ye gods  the tooth was loose  out it came on the instant  i was jubilant as i held it aloft in the forceps  put it back please oh put it back martin pleaded  you were too quick for me  and the poor old chinaman sat there while i put the tooth back and pulled over  martin snapped the camera  the deed was done elation  pride  no hunter was ever prouder of his first pronged buck than i was of that treepronged tooth  i did it  i did it with my of own hands and a pair of forceps i did it to say nothing of the forgotten memories of the dead mans skull  my next case was a tahitian sailor  he was a small man in a state of collapse from long days and nights of jumping toothache  i lanced the gums first  i didnt know how to lance them but i lanced them just the same  it was a long pull and a strong pull the man was a hero  he groaned and moaned and i thought he was going to faint  but he kept his mouth open and let me pull  and then it came  after that i was ready to meet all comersjust the proper state of mind for a waterloo  and it came  its name was tomi  he was a strapping giant of a heathen with a bad reputation  he was addicted to deeds of violence  among other things he had beaten two of his wives to death with his fists  his father and mother had been naked cannibals  when he sat down and i put the forceps into his mouth he was nearly as tall as i was standing up  big men prone to violence very often have a streak of fat in their makeup so i was doubtful of him  charmian grabbed one arm and warren grabbed the other  then the tug of war began  the instant the forceps closed down on the tooth his jaws closed down on the forceps  also both his hands flew up and gripped my pulling hand  i held on and he held on  charmian and warren held on  we wrestled all about the shop  it was three against one and my hold on an aching tooth was certainly a foul one but in spite of the handicap he got away with us  the forceps slipped off banging and grinding along against his upper teeth with a nervescraping sound  out of his month flew the forceps and he rose up in the air with a bloodcurdling yell  the three of us fell back  we expected to be massacred  but that howling savage of sanguinary reputation sank back in the chair  he held his head in both his hands and groaned and groaned and groaned  nor would he listen to reason  i was a quack  my painless toothextraction was a delusion and a snare and a low advertising dodge  i was so anxious to get that tooth that i was almost ready to bribe him  but that went against my professional pride and i let him depart with the tooth still intact the only case on record up to date of failure on my part when once i had got a grip  since then i have never let a tooth go by me  only the other day i volunteered to beat up three days to windward to pull a woman missionarys tooth  i expect before the voyage of the snark is finished to be doing bridge work and putting on gold crowns  i dont know whether they are yaws or nota physician in fiji told me they were and a missionary in the solomons told me they were not but at any rate i can vouch for the fact that they are most uncomfortable  it was my luck to ship in tahiti a frenchsailor who when we got to sea proved to be afflicted with a vile skin disease  the snark was too small and too much of a family party to permit retaining him on board but perforce until we could reach land and discharge him it was up to me to doctor him  i read up the books and proceeded to treat him taking care afterwards always to use a thorough antiseptic wash  when we reached tutuila far from getting rid of him the port doctor declared a quarantine against him and refused to allow him ashore  but at apia samoa i managed to ship him off on a steamer to new zealand  here at apia my ankles were badly bitten by mosquitoes and i confess to having scratched the bitesas i had a thousand times before  by the time i reached the island of savaii a small sore had developed on the hollow of my instep  i thought it was due to chafe and to acid fumes from the hot lava over which i tramped  an application of salve would cure itso i thought  the salve did heal it over whereupon an astonishing inflammation set in the new skin came off and a larger sore was exposed  this was repeated many times  each time new skin formed an inflammation followed and the circumference of the sore increased  i was puzzled and frightened all my life my skin had been famous for its healing powers yet here was something that would not heal  instead it was daily eating up more skin while it had eaten down clear through the skin and was eating up the muscle itself  by this time the snark was at sea on her way to fiji  i remembered the french sailor and for the first time became seriously alarmed four other similar sores had appearedor ulcers rather and the pain of them kept me awake at night  all my plans were made to lay up the snark in fiji and get away on the first steamer to australia and professional mds  in the meantime in my amateur md way i did my best  i read through all the medical works on board  not a line nor a word could i find descriptive of my affliction  i brought common horsesense to bear on the problem  here were malignant and excessively active ulcers that were eating me up there was an organic and corroding poison at work  two things i concluded must be done  first some agent must be found to destroy the poison  secondly the ulcers could not possibly heal from the outside in they must heal from the inside out  i decided to fight the poison with corrosive sublimate  the very name of it struck me as vicious  talk of fighting fire with fire  i was being consumed by a corrosive poison and it appealed to my fancy to fight it with another corrosive poison  after several days i alternated dressings of corrosive sublimate with dressings of peroxide of hydrogen  and behold by the time we reached fiji four of the five ulcers were healed while the remaining one was no bigger than a pea  i now felt fully qualified to treat yaws  likewise i had a wholesome respect for them  not so the rest of the crew of the snark  in their case seeing was not believing  one and all they had seen my dreadful predicament and all of them i am convinced had a subconscious certitude that their own superb constitutions and glorious personalities would never allow lodgment of so vile a poison in their carcasses as my anaemic constitution and mediocre personality had allowed to lodge in mine  at port resolution in the new hebrides martin elected to walk barefooted in the bush and returned on board with many cuts and abrasions especially on his shins  youd better be careful i warned him  ill mix up some corrosive sublimate for you to wash those cuts with  an ounce of prevention you know  but martin smiled a superior smile  though he did not say so  i nevertheless was given to understand that he was not as other men i was the only man he could possibly have had reference to and that in a couple of days his cuts would be healed  he also read me a dissertation upon the peculiar purity of his blood and his remarkable healing powers  i felt quite humble when he was done with me  evidently i was different from other men in so far as purity of blood was concerned  nakata the cabinboy while ironing one day mistook the calf of his leg for the ironingblock and accumulated a burn three inches in length and half an inch wide  he too smiled the superior smile when i offered him corrosive sublimate and reminded him of my own cruel experience  i was given to understand with all due suavity and courtesy that no matter what was the matter with my blood his numberone japanese portarthur blood was all right and scornful of the festive microbe  wada the cook took part in a disastrous landing of the launch when he had to leap overboard and fend the launch off the beach in a smashing surf  by means of shells and coral he cut his legs and feet up beautifully  i offered him the corrosive sublimate bottle once again i suffered the superior smile and was given to understand that his blood was the same blood that had licked russia and was going to lick the united states some day and that if his blood wasnt able to cure a few trifling cuts hed commit harikari in sheer disgrace  from all of which i concluded that an amateur md is without honour on his own vessel even if he has cured himself  the rest of the crew had begun to look upon me as a sort of mild monomaniac on the question of sores and sublimate  just because my blood was impure was no reason that i should think everybody elses was  i made no more overtures  time and microbes were with me and all i had to do was wait  i think theres some dirt in these cuts martin said tentatively after several days  ill wash them out and then theyll be all right he added after i had refused to rise to the bait  two more days passed but the cuts did not pass and i caught martin soaking his feet and legs in a pail of hot water  nothing like hot water he proclaimed enthusiastically  it beats all the dope the doctors ever put up  these sores will be all right in the morning  but in the morning he wore a troubled look and i knew that the hour of my triumph approached  i think i will try some of that medicine he announced later on in the day  not that i think itll do much good he qualified but ill just give it a try anyway  next came the proud blood of japan to beg medicine for its illustrious sores while i heaped coals of fire on all their houses by explaining in minute and sympathetic detail the treatment that should be given  nakata followed instructions implicitly and day by day his sores grew smaller  wada was apathetic and cured less readily  but martin still doubted and because he did not cure immediately he developed the theory that while doctors dope was all right it did not follow that the same kind of dope was efficacious with everybody  as for himself corrosive sublimate had no effect  besides how did i know that it was the right stuff  i had had no experience  just because i happened to get well while using it was not proof that it had played any part in the cure there were such things as coincidences  without doubt there was a dope that would cure the sores and when he ran across a real doctor he would find what that dope was and get some of it  about this time we arrived in the solomon islands  no physician would ever recommend the group for invalids or sanitoriums  i spent but little time there ere i really and for the first time in my life comprehended how frail and unstable is human tissue  our first anchorage was port mary on the island of santa anna  the one lone white man a trader came alongside  tom butler was his name and he was a beautiful example of what the solomons can do to a strong man  he lay in his whaleboat with the helplessness of a dying man no smile and little intelligence illumined his face  he was a sombre deathshead too far gone to grin  he too had yaws big ones  we were compelled to drag him over the rail of the snark  he said that his health was good that he had not had the fever for some time and that with the exception of his arm he was all right and trim  his arm appeared to be paralysed  paralysis he rejected with scorn  he had had it before and recovered  it was a common native disease on santa anna he said as he was helped down the companion ladder his dead arm dropping bumpbump from step to step  he was certainly the ghastliest guest we ever entertained and weve had not a few lepers and elephantiasis victims on board  martin inquired about yaws for here was a man who ought to know he certainly did know if we could judge by his scarred arms and legs and by the live ulcers that corroded in the midst of the scars oh one got used to yaws quoth tom butler  they were never really serious until they had eaten deep into the flesh  then they attacked the walls of the arteries the arteries burst and there was a funeral  several of the natives had recently died that way ashore  but what did it matter  if it wasnt yaws it was something else in the solomons  i noticed that from this moment martin displayed a swiftly increasing interest in his own yaws  dosings with corrosive sublimate were more frequent while in conversation he began to revert with growing enthusiasm to the clean climate of kansas and all other things kansan  charmian and i thought that california was a little bit of all right  henry swore by rapa and tehei staked all on bora bora for his own bloods sake while wada and nakata sang the sanitary paean of japan  one evening as the snark worked around the southern end of the island of ugi looking for a reputed anchorage a church of england missionary a mr drew bound in his whaleboat for the coast of san cristoval came alongside and stopped for dinner  martin his legs swathed in red cross bandages till they looked like a mummys turned the conversation upon yaws  yes said mr drew they were quite common in the solomons  all white men caught them  and have you had them martin demanded in the soul of him quite shocked that a church of england missionary could possess so vulgar an affliction  mr drew nodded his head and added that not only had he had them but at that moment he was doctoring several  what do you use on them martin asked like a flash  my heart almost stood still waiting the answer  by that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell  martin i could see was quite sure it was going to fall  and then the answero blessed answer  corrosive sublimate said mr drew  martin gave in handsomely ill admit and i am confident that at that moment if i had asked permission to pull one of his teeth he would not have denied me  all white men in the solomons catch yaws and every cut or abrasion practically means another yaw  every man i met had had them and nine out of ten had active ones  there was but one exception a young fellow who had been in the islands five months who had come down with fever ten days after he arrived and who had since then been down so often with fever that he had had neither time nor opportunity for yaws  every one on the snark except charmian came down with yaws  hers was the same egotism that japan and kansas had displayed  she ascribed her immunity to the pureness of her blood and as the days went by she ascribed it more often and more loudly to the pureness of her blood  privately i ascribed her immunity to the fact that being a woman she escaped most of the cuts and abrasions to which we hardworking men were subject in the course of working the snark around the world  i did not tell her so  you see i did not wish to bruise her ego with brutal facts  being an md if only an amateur one i knew more about the disease than she and i knew that time was my ally  but alas i abused my ally when it dealt a charming little yaw on the shin  so quickly did i apply antiseptic treatment that the yaw was cured before she was convinced that she had one  again as an md i was without honour on my own vessel and worse than that i was charged with having tried to mislead her into the belief that she had had a yaw  the pureness of her blood was more rampant than ever and i poked my nose into my navigation books and kept quiet  and then came the day  we were cruising along the coast of malaita at the time  whats that abaft your anklebone said i  nothing said she  all right said i but put some corrosive sublimate on it just the same  and some two or three weeks from now when it is well and you have a scar that you will carry to your grave just forget about the purity of your blood and your ancestral history and tell me what you think about yaws anyway  it was as large as a silver dollar that yaw and it took all of three weeks to heal  there were times when charmian could not walk because of the hurt of it and there were times upon times when she explained that abaft the anklebone was the most painful place to have a yaw  i explained in turn that never having experienced a yaw in that locality i was driven to conclude the hollow of the instep was the most painful place for yawculture  we left it to martin who disagreed with both of us and proclaimed passionately that the only truly painful place was the shin  no wonder horse racing is so popular  but yaws lose their novelty after a time  at the present moment of writing i have five yaws on my hands and three more on my shin charmian has one on each side of her right instep  tehei is frantic with his  martins latest shincultures have eclipsed his earlier ones  and nakata has several score casually eating away at his tissue  but the history of the snark in the solomons has been the history of every ship since the early discoverers  from the sailing directions i quote the following  the crews of vessels remaining any considerable time in the solomons find wounds and sores liable to change into malignant ulcers  nor on the question of fever were the sailing directions any more encouraging for in them i read  new arrivals are almost certain sooner or later to suffer from fever  the natives are also subject to it  the number of deaths among the whites in the year 1897 amounted to 9 among a population of 50  some of these deaths however were accidental  nakata was the first to come down with fever  this occurred at penduffryn  wada and henry followed him  charmian surrendered next  i managed to escape for a couple of months but when i was bowled over martin sympathetically joined me several days later out of the seven of us all told tehei is the only one who has escaped but his sufferings from nostalgia are worse than fever nakata as usual followed instructions faithfully so that by the end of his third attack he could take a two hours sweat consume thirty or forty grains of quinine and be weak but all right at the end of twentyfour hours  wada and henry however were tougher patients with which to deal in the first place wada got in a bad funk  he was of the firm conviction that his star had set and that the solomons would receive his bones  he saw that life about him was cheap  at penduffryn he saw the ravages of dysentery and unfortunately for him he saw one victim carried out on a strip of galvanized sheetiron and dumped without coffin or funeral into a hole in the ground  everybody had fever everybody had dysentery everybody had everything  death was common  here today and gone tomorrowand wada forgot all about today and made up his mind that tomorrow had come  he was careless of his ulcers neglected to sublimate them and by uncontrolled scratching spread them all over his body  nor would he follow instructions with fever and as a result would be down five days at a time when a day would have been sufficient  henry who is a strapping giant of a man was just as bad  he refused point blank to take quinine on the ground that years before he had had fever and that the pills the doctor gave him were of different size and colour from the quinine tablets i offered him  so henry joined wada  but i fooled the pair of them and dosed them with their own medicine which was faithcure  they had faith in their funk that they were going to die  i slammed a lot of quinine down their throats and took their temperature  it was the first time i had used my medicinechest thermometer and i quickly discovered that it was worthless that it had been produced for profit and not for service  if i had let on to my two patients that the thermometer did not work there would have been two funerals in short order their temperature i swear was 105 degrees  i solemnly made one and then the other smoke the thermometer allowed an expression of satisfaction to irradiate my countenance and joyfully told them that their temperature was 94 degrees  then i slammed more quinine down their throats told them that any sickness or weakness they might experience would be due to the quinine and left them to get well  and they did get well wada in spite of himself  if a man can die through a misapprehension is there any immorality in making him live through a misapprehension  commend me the white race when it comes to grit and surviving  one of our two japanese and both our tahitians funked and had to be slapped on the back and cheered up and dragged along by main strength toward life  charmian and martin took their afflictions cheerfully made the least of them and moved with calm certitude along the way of life  when wada and henry were convinced that they were going to die the funeral atmosphere was too much for tehei who prayed dolorously and cried for hours at a time  martin on the other hand cursed and got well and charmian groaned and made plans for what she was going to do when she got well again  charmian had been raised a vegetarian and a sanitarian  her aunt netta who brought her up and who lived in a healthful climate did not believe in drugs  neither did charmian  besides drugs disagreed with her  their effects were worse than the ills they were supposed to alleviate  but she listened to the argument in favour of quinine accepted it as the lesser evil and in consequence had shorter less painful and less frequent attacks of fever  we encountered a mr caulfeild a missionary whose two predecessors had died after less than six months residence in the solomons  like them he had been a firm believer in homeopathy until after his first fever whereupon unlike them he made a grand slide back to allopathy and quinine catching fever and carrying on his gospel work  but poor wada  the straw that broke the cooks back was when charmian and i took him along on a cruise to the cannibal island of malaita in a small yacht on the deck of which the captain had been murdered half a year before  kaikai means to eat and wada was sure he was going to be kaikaid  we went about heavily armed our vigilance was unremitting and when we went for a bath in the mouth of a freshwater stream black boys armed with rifles did sentry duty about us  we encountered english war vessels burning and shelling villages in punishment for murders  natives with prices on their heads sought shelter on board of us  murder stalked abroad in the land  in outoftheyway places we received warnings from friendly savages of impending attacks  our vessel owed two heads to malaita which were liable to be collected any time  then to cap it all we were wrecked on a reef and with rifles in one hand warned the canoes of wreckers off while with the other hand we toiled to save the ship  all of which was too much for wada who went daffy and who finally quitted the snark on the island of ysabel going ashore for good in a driving rainstorm between two attacks of fever while threatened with pneumonia  if he escapes being kai kaid and if he can survive sores and fever which are riotous ashore he can expect if he is reasonably lucky to get away from that place to the adjacent island in anywhere from six to eight weeks  he never did think much of my medicine despite the fact that i successfully and at the first trail pulled two aching teeth for him  the snark has been a hospital for months and i confess that we are getting used to it  at meringe lagoon where we careened and cleaned the snarks copper there were times when only one man of us was able to go into the water while the three white men on the plantation ashore were all down with fever  at the moment of writing this we are lost at sea somewhere northeast of ysabel and trying vainly to find lord howe island which is an atoll that cannot be sighted unless one is on top of it  the chronometer has gone wrong  the sun does not shine anyway nor can i get a star observation at night and we have had nothing but squalls and rain for days and days  the cook is gone  nakata who has been trying to be both cook and cabin boy is down on his back with fever martin is just up from fever and going down again  charmian whose fever has become periodical is looking up in her date book to find when the next attack will be  henry has begun to eat quinine in an expectant mood  and since my attacks hit me with the suddenness of bludgeonblows i do not know from moment to moment when i shall be brought down  by a mistake we gave our last flour away to some white men who did not have any flour  we dont know when well make land  our solomon sores are worse than ever and more numerous the corrosive sublimate was accidentally left ashore at penduffryn the peroxide of hydrogen is exhausted and i am experimenting with boracic acid lysol and antiphlogystine  at any rate if i fail in becoming a reputable md it wont be from lack of practice  ps  it is now two weeks since the foregoing was written and tehei the only immune on board has been down ten days with far severer fever than any of us and is still down  his temperature has been repeatedly as high as 104 and his pulse 115  ps  at sea between tasman atoll and manning straits  teheis attack developed into black water feverthe severest form of malarial fever which the doctorbook assures me is due to some outside infection as well  having pulled him through his fever i am now at my wits end for he has lost his wits altogether  i am rather recent in practice to take up the cure of insanity  this makes the second lunacy case on this short voyage  ps  some day i shall write a book for the profession and entitle it around the world on the hospital ship snark  even our pets have not escaped  we sailed from meringe lagoon with two an irish terrier and a white cockatoo  the terrier fell down the cabin companionway and lamed its nigh hind leg then repeated the manoeuvre and lamed its off fore leg  at the present moment it has but two legs to walk on  fortunately they are on opposite sides and ends so that she can still dot and carry two  the cockatoo was crushed under the cabin skylight and had to be killed  this was our first funeralthough for that matter the several chickens we had and which would have made welcome broth for the convalescents flew overboard and were drowned  only the cockroaches flourish  neither illness nor accident ever befalls them and they grow larger and more carnivorous day by day gnawing our fingernails and toenails while we sleep  ps  charmian is having another bout with fever  martin in despair has taken to horsedoctoring his yaws with bluestone and to blessing the solomons  as for me in addition to navigating doctoring and writing short stories i am far from well  with the exception of the insanity cases im the worst off on board  i shall catch the next steamer to australia and go on the operating table  among my minor afflictions i may mention a new and mysterious one  for the past week my hands have been swelling as with dropsy  it is only by a painful effort that i can close them a pull on a rope is excruciating  the sensations are like those that accompany severe chilblains  also the skin is peeling off both hands at an alarming rate besides which the new skin underneath is growing hard and thick  the doctorbook fails to mention this disease  nobody knows what it is  ps  well anyway ive cured the chronometer  after knocking about the sea for eight squally rainy days most of the time hove to i succeeded in catching a partial observation of the sun at midday  from this i worked up my latitude then headed by log to the latitude of lord howe and ran both that latitude and the island down together  here i tested the chronometer by longitude sights and found it something like three minutes out  since each minute is equivalent to fifteen miles the total error can be appreciated  by repeated observations at lord howe i rated the chronometer finding it to have a daily losing error of seventenths of a second  now it happens that a year ago when we sailed from hawaii that selfsame chronometer had that selfsame losing error of seventenths of a second  since that error was faithfully added every day and since that error as proved by my observations at lord howe has not changed then what under the sun made that chronometer all of a sudden accelerate and catch up with itself three minutes  can such things be  expert watchmakers say no but i say that they have never done any expert watchmaking and watchrating in the solomons that it is the climate is my only diagnosis  at any rate i have successfully doctored the chronometer even if i have failed with the lunacy cases and with martins yaws  ps  martin has just tried burnt alum and is blessing the solomons more fervently than ever  ps  between manning straits and pavuvu islands  henry has developed rheumatism in his back ten skins have peeled off my hands and the eleventh is now peeling while tehei is more lunatic than ever and day and night prays god not to kill him also nakata and i are slashing away at fever again  and finally up to date nakata last evening had an attack of ptomaine poisoning and we spent half the night pulling him through    back word    the snark was fortythree feet on the waterline and fiftyfive over all with fifteen feet beam tumblehome sides and seven feet eight inches draught  she was ketchrigged carrying flyingjib jib forestaysail mainsail mizzen and spinnaker  there were six feet of headroom below and she was crowndecked and flushdecked there were four alleged watertight compartments  a seventyhorse power auxiliary gasengine sporadically furnished locomotion at an approximate cost of twenty dollars per mile  a fivehorse power engine ran the pumps when it was in order and on two occasions proved capable of furnishing juice for the searchlight  the storage batteries worked four or five times in the course of two years  the fourteenfoot launch was rumoured to work at times but it invariably broke down whenever i stepped on board  but the snark sailed  it was the only way she could get anywhere she sailed for two years and never touched rock reef nor shoal she had no inside ballast her iron keel weighed five tons but her deep draught and high freeboard made her very stiff  caught under full sail in tropic squalls she buried her rail and deck many times but stubbornly refused to turn turtle  she steered easily and she could run day and night without steering closeby full andby and with the wind abeam  with the wind on her quarter and the sails properly trimmed she steered herself within two points and with the wind almost astern she required scarcely three points for selfsteering  the snark was partly built in san francisco  the morning her iron keel was to be cast was the morning of the great earthquake  then came anarchy  six months overdue in the building i sailed the shell of her to hawaii to be finished the engine lashed to the bottom building materials lashed on deck  had i remained in san francisco for completion id still be there  as it was partly built she cost four times what she ought to have cost  the snark was born unfortunately  she was libelled in san francisco had her cheques protested as fraudulent in hawaii and was fined for breach of quarantine in the solomons  to save themselves the newspapers could not tell the truth about her  when i discharged an incompetent captain they said i had beaten him to a pulp  when one young man returned home to continue at college it was reported that i was a regular wolf larsen and that my whole crew had deserted because i had beaten it to a pulp  in fact the only blow struck on the snark was when the cook was manhandled by a captain who had shipped with me under false pretences and whom i discharged in fiji  also charmian and i boxed for exercise but neither of us was seriously maimed  the voyage was our idea of a good time  i built the snark and paid for it and for all expenses  i contracted to write thirtyfive thousand words descriptive of the trip for a magazine which was to pay me the same rate i received for stories written at home promptly the magazine advertised that it was sending me especially around the world for itself  it was a wealthy magazine  and every man who had business dealings with the snark charged three prices because forsooth the magazine could afford it  down in the uttermost south sea isle this myth obtained and i paid accordingly to this day everybody believes that the magazine paid for everything and that i made a fortune out of the voyage  it is hard after such advertising to hammer it into the human understanding that the whole voyage was done for the fun of it  i went to australia to go into hospital where i spent five weeks i spent five months miserably sick in hotels  the mysterious malady that afflicted my hands was too much for the australian specialists it was unknown in the literature of medicine  no case like it had ever been reported  it extended from my hands to my feet so that at times i was as helpless as a child  on occasion my hands were twice their natural size with seven dead and dying skins peeling off at the same time  there were times when my toenails in twentyfour hours grew as thick as they were long  after filing them off inside another twentyfour hours they were as thick as before  the australian specialists agreed that the malady was nonparasitic and that therefore it must be nervous  it did not mend and it was impossible for me to continue the voyage  the only way i could have continued it would have been by being lashed in my bunk for in my helpless condition unable to clutch with my hands i could not have moved about on a small rolling boat  also i said to myself that while there were many boats and many voyages i had but one pair of hands and one set of toenails  still further i reasoned that in my own climate of california i had always maintained a stable nervous equilibrium  so back i came  since my return i have completely recovered  and i have found out what was the matter with me  i encountered a book by lieutenant colonel charles e woodruff of the united states army entitled effects of tropical light on white men  then i knew  later i met colonel woodruff and learned that he had been similarly afflicted  himself an army surgeon seventeen army surgeons sat on his case in the philippines and like the australian specialists confessed themselves beaten  in brief i had a strong predisposition toward the tissuedestructiveness of tropical light i was being torn to pieces by the ultraviolet rays just as many experimenters with the xray have been torn to pieces  in passing i may mention that among the other afflictions that jointly compelled the abandonment of the voyage was one that is variously called the healthy mans disease european leprosy and biblical leprosy  unlike true leprosy nothing is known of this mysterious malady  no doctor has ever claimed a cure for a case of it though spontaneous cures are recorded  it comes they know not how  it is they know not what  it goes they know not why without the use of drugs merely by living in the wholesome california climate my silvery skin vanished  the only hope the doctors had held out to me was a spontaneous cure and such a cure was mine  a last word  the test of the voyage  it is easy enough for me or any man to say that it was enjoyable  but there is a better witness the one woman who made it from beginning to end  in hospital when i broke the news to charmian that i must go back to california the tears welled into her eyes  for two days she was wrecked and broken by the knowledge that the happy happy voyage was abandoned  glen ellen california  april 7 1911    footnotes  1 to point out that we of the snark are not a crowd of weaklings which might be concluded from our divers afflictions i quote the following which i gleaned verbatim from the eugenies log and which may be considered as a sample of solomon islands cruising  ulava thursday march 12 1908  boat went ashore in the morning  got two loads ivory nut 4000 copra
