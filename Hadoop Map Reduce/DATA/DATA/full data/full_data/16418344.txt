16418344	fannys first play  by bernard shaw  1911    this text was taken from a printed volume containing the plays misalliance the dark lady of the sonnets fannys first play and the essay a treatise on parents and children  notes on the editing italicized text is delimited with underlines   punctuation and spelling retained as in the printed text shaw intentionally spelled many words according to a nonstandard system for example dont is given as dont without apostrophe dr is given as dr without a period at the end and shakespeare is given as shakespear no e at the end where several characters in the play are speaking at once i have indicated it with vertical bars  the pound currency symbol has been replaced by the word pounds      preface to fannys first play  fannys first play being but a potboiler needs no preface but its lesson is not i am sorry to say unneeded mere morality or the substitution of custom for conscience was once accounted a shameful and cynical thing people talked of right and wrong of honor and dishonor of sin and grace of salvation and damnation not of morality and immorality the word morality if we met it in the bible would surprise us as much as the word telephone or motor car nowadays we do not seem to know that there is any other test of conduct except morality and the result is that the young had better have their souls awakened by disgrace capture by the police and a months hard labor than drift along from their cradles to their graves doing what other people do for no other reason than that other people do it and knowing nothing of good and evil of courage and cowardice or indeed anything but how to keep hunger and concupiscence and fashionable dressing within the bounds of good taste except when their excesses can be concealed is it any wonder that i am driven to offer to young people in our suburbs the desperate advice do something that will get you into trouble but please do not suppose that i defend a state of things which makes such advice the best that can be given under the circumstances or that i do not know how difficult it is to find out a way of getting into trouble that will combine loss of respectability with integrity of selfrespect and reasonable consideration for other peoples feelings and interests on every point except their dread of losing their own respectability but when theres a will theres a way i hate to see dead people walking about it is unnatural and our respectable middle class people are all as dead as mutton out of the mouth of mrs knox i have delivered on them the judgment of her god  the critics whom i have lampooned in the induction to this play under the names of trotter vaughan and gunn will forgive me in fact mr trotter forgave me beforehand and assisted the makeup by which mr claude king so successfully simulated his personal appearance the critics whom i did not introduce were somewhat hurt as i should have been myself under the same circumstances but i had not room for them all so i can only apologize and assure them that i meant no disrespect  the concealment of the authorship if a secret de polichinelle can be said to involve concealment was a necessary part of the play in so far as it was effectual it operated as a measure of relief to those critics and playgoers who are so obsessed by my strained legendary reputation that they approach my plays in a condition which is really one of derangement and are quite unable to conceive a play of mine as anything but a trap baited with paradoxes and designed to compass their ethical perversion and intellectual confusion if it were possible i should put forward all my plays anonymously or hire some less disturbing person as bacon is said to have hired shakespear to father my plays for me  fannys first play was performed for the first time at the little theatre in the adelphi london on the afternoon of wednesday april 19th 1911     fannys first play     induction   the end of a saloon in an oldfashioned country house florence towers the property of count odowda has been curtained off to form a stage for a private theatrical performance a footman in grandiose spanish livery enters before the curtain on its op side   footman announcing mr cecil savoyard cecil savoyard comes in a middleaged man in evening dress and a furlined overcoat he is surprised to find nobody to receive him so is the footman oh beg pardon sir i thought the count was here he was when i took up your name he must have gone through the stage into the library this way sir he moves towards the division in the middle of the curtains  savoyard half a mo the footman stops when does the play begin halfpast eight  footman nine sir  savoyard oh good well will you telephone to my wife at the george that its not until nine  footman right sir mrs cecil savoyard sir  savoyard no mrs william tinkler dont forget  the footman mrs tinkler sir right sir the count comes in through the curtains here is the count sir announcing mr cecil savoyard sir he withdraws  count odowda a handsome man of fifty dressed with studied elegance a hundred years out of date advancing cordially to shake hands with his visitor pray excuse me mr savoyard i suddenly recollected that all the bookcases in the library were lockedin fact theyve never been opened since we came from veniceand as our literary guests will probably use the library a good deal i just ran in to unlock everything  savoyard oh you mean the dramatic critics myes i suppose theres a smoking room  the count my study is available an oldfashioned house you understand wont you sit down mr savoyard  savoyard thanks they sit savoyard looking at his hosts obsolete costume continues i had no idea you were going to appear in the piece yourself  the count i am not i wear this costume becausewell perhaps i had better explain the position if it interests you  savoyard certainly  the count well you see mr savoyard im rather a stranger in your world i am not i hope a modern man in any sense of the word im not really an englishman my family is irish ive lived all my life in italyin venice mostlymy very title is a foreign one i am a count of the holy roman empire  savoyard wheres that  the count at present nowhere except as a memory and an ideal savoyard inclines his head respectfully to the ideal but i am by no means an idealogue i am not content with beautiful dreams i want beautiful realities  savoyard hear hear im all with you therewhen you can get them  the count why not get them the difficulty is not that there are no beautiful realities mr savoyard the difficulty is that so few of us know them when we see them we have inherited from the past a vast treasure of beautyof imperishable masterpieces of poetry of painting of sculpture of architecture of music of exquisite fashions in dress in furniture in domestic decoration we can contemplate these treasures we can reproduce many of them we can buy a few inimitable originals we can shut out the nineteenth century  savoyard correcting him the twentieth  the count to me the century i shut out will always be the nineteenth century just as your national anthem will always be god save the queen no matter how many kings may succeed i found england befouled with industrialism well i did what byron did i simply refused to live in it you remember byrons words i am sure my bones would not rest in an english grave or my clay mix with the earth of that country i believe the thought would drive me mad on my deathbed could i suppose that any of my friends would be base enough to convey my carcase back to her soil i would not even feed her worms if i could help it  savoyard did byron say that  the count he did sir  savoyard it dont sound like him i saw a good deal of him at one time  the count you but how is that possible you are too young  savoyard i was quite a lad of course but i had a job in the original production of our boys  the count my dear sir not that byron lord byron the poet  savoyard oh i beg your pardon i thought you were talking of the byron so you prefer living abroad  the count i find england ugly and philistine well i dont live in it i find modern houses ugly i dont live in them i have a palace on the grand canal i find modern clothes prosaic i dont wear them except of course in the street my ears are offended by the cockney twang i keep out of hearing of it and speak and listen to italian i find beethovens music coarse and restless and wagners senseless and detestable i do not listen to them i listen to cimarosa to pergolesi to gluck and mozart nothing simpler sir  savoyard its all right when you can afford it  the count afford it my dear mr savoyard if you are a man with a sense of beauty you can make an earthly paradise for yourself in venice on 1500 pounds a year whilst our wretched vulgar industrial millionaires are spending twenty thousand on the amusements of billiard markers i assure you i am a poor man according to modern ideas but i have never had anything less than the very best that life has produced it is my good fortune to have a beautiful and lovable daughter and that girl sir has never seen an ugly sight or heard an ugly sound that i could spare her and she has certainly never worn an ugly dress or tasted coarse food or bad wine in her life she has lived in a palace and her perambulator was a gondola now you know the sort of people we are mr savoyard you can imagine how we feel here  savoyard rather out of it eh  the count out of it sir out of what  savoyard well out of everything  the count out of soot and fog and mud and east wind out of vulgarity and ugliness hypocrisy and greed superstition and stupidity out of all this and in the sunshine in the enchanted region of which great artists alone have had the secret in the sacred footsteps of byron of shelley of the brownings of turner and ruskin dont you envy me mr savoyard  savoyard some of us must live in england you know just to keep the place going besidesthough mind you i dont say it isnt all right from the high art point of view and all thatthree weeks of it would drive me melancholy mad however im glad you told me because it explains why it is you dont seem to know your way about much in england i hope by the way that everything has given satisfaction to your daughter  the count she seems quite satisfied she tells me that the actors you sent down are perfectly suited to their parts and very nice people to work with i understand she had some difficulties at the first rehearsals with the gentleman you call the producer because he hadnt read the play but the moment he found out what it was all about everything went smoothly  savoyard havnt you seen the rehearsals  the count oh no i havnt been allowed even to meet any of the company all i can tell you is that the hero is a frenchman savoyard is rather scandalized i asked her not to have an english hero that is all i know ruefully i havnt been consulted even about the costumes though there i think i could have been some use  savoyard puzzled but there arnt any costumes  the count seriously shocked what no costumes do you mean to say it is a modern play  savoyard i dont know i didnt read it i handed it to billy burjoycethe producer you knowand left it to him to select the company and so on but i should have had to order the costumes if there had been any there wernt  the count smiling as he recovers from his alarm i understand she has taken the costumes into her own hands she is an expert in beautiful costumes i venture to promise you mr savoyard that what you are about to see will be like a louis quatorze ballet painted by watteau the heroine will be an exquisite columbine her lover a dainty harlequin her father a picturesque pantaloon and the valet who hoodwinks the father and brings about the happiness of the lovers a grotesque but perfectly tasteful punchinello or mascarille or sganarelle  savoyard i see that makes three men and the clown and policeman will make five thats why you wanted five men in the company  the count my dear sir you dont suppose i mean that vulgar ugly silly senseless malicious and destructive thing the harlequinade of a nineteenth century english christmas pantomime what was it after all but a stupid attempt to imitate the success made by the genius of grimaldi a hundred years ago my daughter does not know of the existence of such a thing i refer to the graceful and charming fantasies of the italian and french stages of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries  savoyard oh i beg pardon i quite agree that harlequinades are rot theyve been dropped at all smart theatres but from what billy burjoyce told me i got the idea that your daughter knew her way about here and had seen a lot of plays he had no idea shed been away in venice all the time  the count oh she has not been i should have explained that two years ago my daughter left me to complete her education at cambridge cambridge was my own university and though of course there were no women there in my time i felt confident that if the atmosphere of the eighteenth century still existed anywhere in england it would be at cambridge about three months ago she wrote to me and asked whether i wished to give her a present on her next birthday of course i said yes and she then astonished and delighted me by telling me that she had written a play and that the present she wanted was a private performance of it with real actors and real critics  savoyard yes thats what staggered me it was easy enough to engage a company for a private performance its done often enough but the notion of having critics was new i hardly knew how to set about it they dont expect private engagements and so they have no agents besides i didnt know what to offer them i knew that they were cheaper than actors because they get long engagements forty years sometimes but thats no rule for a single job then theres such a lot of them on first nights they run away with all your stalls you cant find a decent place for your own mother it would have cost a fortune to bring the lot  the count of course i never dreamt of having them all only a few firstrate representative men  savoyard just so all you want is a few sample opinions out of a hundred notices you wont find more than four at the outside that say anything different well ive got just the right four for you and what do you think it has cost me  the count shrugging his shoulders i cannot guess  savoyard ten guineas and expenses i had to give flawner bannal ten he wouldnt come for less and he asked fifty i had to give it because if we hadnt had him we might just as well have had nobody at all  the count but what about the others if mr flannel  savoyard shocked flawner bannal  the count if mr bannal got the whole ten  savoyard oh i managed that as this is a highclass sort of thing the first man i went for was trotter  the count oh indeed i am very glad you have secured mr trotter i have read his playful impressions  savoyard well i was rather in a funk about him hes not exactly what i call approachable and he was a bit standoff at first but when i explained and told him your daughter  the count interrupting in alarm you did not say that the play was by her i hope  savoyard no thats been kept a dead secret i just said your daughter has asked for a real play with a real author and a real critic and all the rest of it the moment i mentioned the daughter i had him he has a daughter of his own wouldnt hear of payment offered to come just to please her quite human i was surprised  the count extremely kind of him  savoyard then i went to vaughan because he does music as well as the drama and you said you thought there would be music i told him trotter would feel lonely without him so he promised like a bird then i thought youd like one of the latest sort the chaps that go for the newest things and swear theyre oldfashioned so i nailed gilbert gunn the four will give you a representative team by the way looking at his watch theyll be here presently  the count before they come mr savoyard could you give me any hints about them that would help me to make a little conversation with them i am as you said rather out of it in england and i might unwittingly say something tactless  savoyard well let me see as you dont like english people i dont know that youll get on with trotter because hes thoroughly english never happy except when hes in paris and speaks french so unnecessarily well that everybody there spots him as an englishman the moment he opens his mouth very witty and all that pretends to turn up his nose at the theatre and says people make too much fuss about art the count is extremely indignant but thats only his modesty because art is his own line you understand mind you dont chaff him about aristotle  the count why should i chaff him about aristotle  savoyard well i dont know but its one of the recognized ways of chaffing him however youll get on with him all right hes a man of the world and a man of sense the one youll have to be careful about is vaughan  the count in what way may i ask  savoyard well vaughan has no sense of humor and if you joke with him hell think youre insulting him on purpose mind its not that he doesnt see a joke he does and it hurts him a comedy scene makes him sore all over he goes away black and blue and pitches into the play for all hes worth  the count but surely that is a very serious defect in a man of his profession  savoyard yes it is and no mistake but vaughan is honest and dont care a brass farthing what he says or whether it pleases anybody or not and you must have one man of that sort to say the things that nobody else will say  the count it seems to me to carry the principle of division of labor too far this keeping of the honesty and the other qualities in separate compartments what is mr gunns speciality if i may ask  savoyard gunn is one of the intellectuals  the count but arnt they all intellectuals  savoyard lord no heaven forbid you must be careful what you say about that i shouldnt like anyone to call me an intellectual i dont think any englishman would they dont count really you know but still its rather the thing to have them gunn is one of the young intellectuals he writes plays himself hes useful because he pitches into the older intellectuals who are standing in his way but you may take it from me that none of these chaps really matter flawner bannals your man bannal really represents the british playgoer when he likes a thing you may take your oath there are a hundred thousand people in london thatll like it if they can only be got to know about it besides bannals knowledge of the theatre is an inside knowledge we know him and he knows us he knows the ropes he knows his way about he knows what hes talking about  the count with a little sigh age and experience i suppose  savoyard age i should put him at twenty at the very outside myself its not an old mans job after all is it bannal may not ride the literary high horse like trotter and the rest but id take his opinion before any other in london hes the man in the street and thats what you want  the count i am almost sorry you didnt give the gentleman his full terms i should not have grudged the fifty guineas for a sound opinion he may feel shabbily treated  savoyard well let him it was a bit of side his asking fifty after all what is he only a pressman jolly good business for him to earn ten guineas hes done the same job often enough for half a quid i expect  fanny odowda comes precipitately through the curtains excited and nervous a girl of nineteen in a dress synchronous with her fathers  fanny papa papa the critics have come and one of them has a cocked hat and sword like a she notices savoyard oh i beg your pardon  the count this is mr savoyard your impresario my dear  fanny shaking hands how do you do  savoyard pleased to meet you miss odowda the cocked hat is all right trotter is a member of the new academic committee he induced them to go in for a uniform like the french academy and i asked him to wear it  the footman announcing mr trotter mr vaughan mr gunn mr flawner bannal the four critics enter trotter wears a diplomatic dress with sword and threecornered hat his age is about 50 vaughan is 40 gunn is 30 flawner bannal is 20 and is quite unlike the others they can be classed at sight as professional men bannal is obviously one of those unemployables of the business class who manage to pick up a living by a sort of courage which gives him cheerfulness conviviality and bounce and is helped out positively by a slight turn for writing and negatively by a comfortable ignorance and lack of intuition which hides from him all the dangers and disgraces that keep men of finer perception in check the count approaches them hospitably  savoyard count odowda gentlemen mr trotter  trotter looking at the counts costume have i the pleasure of meeting a confrere  the count no sir i have no right to my costume except the right of a lover of the arts to dress myself handsomely you are most welcome mr trotter trotter bows in the french manner  savoyard mr vaughan  the count how do you do mr vaughan  vaughan quite well thanks  savoyard mr gunn  the count delighted to make your acquaintance mr gunn  gunn very pleased  savoyard mr flawner bannal  the count very kind of you to come mr bannal  bannal dont mention it  the count gentlemen my daughter they all bow we are very greatly indebted to you gentlemen for so kindly indulging her whim the dressing bell sounds the count looks at his watch ah the dressing bell gentlemen as our play begins at nine i have had to put forward the dinner hour a little may i shew you to your rooms he goes out followed by all the men except trotter who going last is detained by fanny  fanny mr trotter i want to say something to you about this play  trotter no thats forbidden you must not attempt to souffler the critic  fanny oh i would not for the world try to influence your opinion  trotter but you do you are influencing me very shockingly you invite me to this charming house where im about to enjoy a charming dinner and just before the dinner im taken aside by a charming young lady to be talked to about the play how can you expect me to be impartial god forbid that i should set up to be a judge or do more than record an impression but my impressions can be influenced and in this case youre influencing them shamelessly all the time  fanny dont make me more nervous than i am already mr trotter if you knew how i feel  trotter naturally your first party your first appearance in england as hostess but youre doing it beautifully dont be afraid every nuance is perfect  fanny its so kind of you to say so mr trotter but that isnt whats the matter the truth is this play is going to give my father a dreadful shock  trotter nothing unusual in that im sorry to say half the young ladies in london spend their evenings making their fathers take them to plays that are not fit for elderly people to see  fanny oh i know all about that but you cant understand what it means to papa youre not so innocent as he is  trotter remonstrating my dear young lady  fanny i dont mean morally innocent everybody who reads your articles knows youre as innocent as a lamb  trotter what  fanny yes mr trotter ive seen a good deal of life since i came to england and i assure you that to me youre a mere baby a dear good wellmeaning delightful witty charming baby but still just a wee lamb in a world of wolves cambridge is not what it was in my fathers time  trotter well i must say  fanny just so thats one of our classifications in the cambridge fabian society  trotter classifications i dont understand  fanny we classify our aunts into different sorts and one of the sorts is the i must says  trotter i withdraw i must say i substitute blame my cats no i substitute blame my kittens observe miss odowda kittens i say again in the teeth of the whole cambridge fabian society kittens impertinent little kittens blame them smack them i guess what is on your conscience this play to which you have lured me is one of those in which members of fabian societies instruct their grandmothers in the art of milking ducks and you are afraid it will shock your father well i hope it will and if he consults me about it i shall recommend him to smack you soundly and pack you off to bed  fanny thats one of your prettiest literary attitudes mr trotter but it doesnt take me in you see im much more conscious of what you really are than you are yourself because weve discussed you thoroughly at cambridge and youve never discussed yourself have you  trotter i  fanny of course you havnt so you see its no good trottering at me  trotter trottering  fanny thats what we call it at cambridge  trotter if it were not so obviously a stage cliche i should say damn cambridge as it is i blame my kittens and now let me warn you if youre going to be a charming healthy young english girl you may coax me if youre going to be an unsexed cambridge fabian virago ill treat you as my intellectual equal as i would treat a man  fanny adoringly but how few men are your intellectual equals mr trotter  trotter im getting the worst of this  fanny oh no why do you say that  trotter may i remind you that the dinnerbell will ring presently  fanny what does it matter were both ready i havnt told you yet what i want you to do for me  trotter nor have you particularly predisposed me to do it except out of pure magnanimity what is it  fanny i dont mind this play shocking my father morally its good for him to be shocked morally its all that the young can do for the old to shock them and keep them up to date but i know that this play will shock him artistically and that terrifies me no moral consideration could make a breach between us he would forgive me for anything of that kind sooner or later but he never gives way on a point of art i darent let him know that i love beethoven and wagner and as to strauss if he heard three bars of elektra itd part us for ever now what i want you to do is this if hes very angryif he hates the play because its a modern playwill you tell him that its not my fault that its style and construction and so forth are considered the very highest art nowadays that the author wrote it in the proper way for repertory theatres of the most superior kindyou know the kind of plays i mean  trotter emphatically i think i know the sort of entertainments you mean but please do not beg a vital question by calling them plays i dont pretend to be an authority but i have at least established the fact that these productions whatever else they may be are certainly not plays  fanny the authors dont say they are  trotter warmly i am aware that one author who is i blush to say a personal friend of mine resorts freely to the dastardly subterfuge of calling them conversations discussions and so forth with the express object of evading criticism but im not to be disarmed by such tricks i say they are not plays dialogues if you will exhibitions of character perhaps especially the character of the author fictions possibly though a little decent reticence as to introducing actual persons and thus violating the sanctity of private life might not be amiss but plays no i say no not plays if you will not concede this point i cant continue our conversation i take this seriously its a matter of principle i must ask you miss odowda before we go a step further do you or do you not claim that these works are plays  fanny i assure you i dont  trotter not in any sense of the word  fanny not in any sense of the word i loathe plays  trotter disappointed that last remark destroys all the value of your admission you admire thesethese theatrical nondescripts you enjoy them  fanny dont you  trotter of course i do do you take me for a fool do you suppose i prefer popular melodramas have i not written most appreciative notices of them but i say theyre not plays theyre not plays i cant consent to remain in this house another minute if anything remotely resembling them is to be foisted on me as a play  fanny i fully admit that theyre not plays i only want you to tell my father that plays are not plays nowadaysnot in your sense of the word  trotter ah there you go again in my sense of the word you believe that my criticism is merely a personal impression that  fanny you always said it was  trotter pardon me not on this point if you had been classically educated  fanny but i have  trotter pooh cambridge if you had been educated at oxford you would know that the definition of a play has been settled exactly and scientifically for two thousand two hundred and sixty years when i say that these entertainments are not plays i dont mean in my sense of the word but in the sense given to it for all time by the immortal stagirite  fanny who is the stagirite  trotter shocked you dont know who the stagirite was  fanny sorry never heard of him  trotter and this is cambridge education well my dear young lady im delighted to find theres something you dont know and i shant spoil you by dispelling an ignorance which in my opinion is highly becoming to your age and sex so well leave it at that  fanny but you will promise to tell my father that lots of people write plays just like this onethat i havnt selected it out of mere heartlessness  trotter i cant possibly tell you what i shall say to your father about the play until ive seen the play but ill tell you what i shall say to him about you i shall say that youre a very foolish young lady that youve got into a very questionable set and that the sooner he takes you away from cambridge and its fabian society the better  fanny its so funny to hear you pretending to be a heavy father in cambridge we regard you as a bel esprit a wit an irresponsible a parisian immoralist tres chic  trotter i  fanny theres quite a trotter set  trotter well upon my word  fanny they go in for adventures and call you aramis  trotter they wouldnt dare  fanny you always make such delicious fun of the serious people your insouciance  trotter frantic stop talking french to me its not a proper language for a young girl great heavens how is it possible that a few innocent pleasantries should be so frightfully misunderstood ive tried all my life to be sincere and simple to be unassuming and kindly ive lived a blameless life ive supported the censorship in the face of ridicule and insult and now im told that im a centre of immoralism of modern minxism a trifler with the most sacred subjects a nietzschean perhaps a shavian  fanny do you mean you are really on the serious side mr trotter  trotter of course im on the serious side how dare you ask me such a question  fanny then why dont you play for it  trotter i do play for itshort of course of making myself ridiculous  fanny what not make yourself ridiculous for the sake of a good cause oh mr trotter thats vieux jeu  trotter shouting at her dont talk french i will not allow it  fanny but this dread of ridicule is so frightfully out of date the cambridge fabian society  trotter i forbid you to mention the fabian society to me  fanny its motto is you cannot learn to skate without making yourself ridiculous  trotter skate what has that to do with it  fanny thats not all it goes on the ice of life is slippery  trotter ice of life indeed you should be eating penny ices and enjoying yourself i wont hear another word  the count returns  the count were all waiting in the drawingroom my dear have you been detaining mr trotter all this time  trotter im so sorry i must have just a little brush up i he hurries out  the count my dear you should be in the drawingroom you should not have kept him here  fanny i know dont scold me i had something important to say to him  the count i shall ask him to take you in to dinner  fanny yes papa oh i hope it will go off well  the count yes love of course it will come along  fanny just one thing papa whilst were alone who was the stagirite  the count the stagirite do you mean to say you dont know  fanny havnt the least notion  the count the stagirite was aristotle by the way dont mention him to mr trotter  they go to the diningroom      the play     act i  in the diningroom of a house in denmark hill an elderly lady sits at breakfast reading the newspaper her chair is at the end of the oblong diningtable furthest from the fire there is an empty chair at the other end the fireplace is behind this chair and the door is next the fireplace between it and the corner an armchair stands beside the coalscuttle in the middle of the back wall is the sideboard parallel to the table the rest of the furniture is mostly diningroom chairs ranged against the walls and including a baby rockingchair on the ladys side of the room the lady is a placid person her husband mr robin gilbey not at all placid bursts violently into the room with a letter in his hand  gilbey grinding his teeth this is a nice thing this is a b  mrs gilbey cutting him short leave it at that please whatever it is bad language wont make it better  gilbey bitterly yes put me in the wrong as usual take your boys part against me he flings himself into the empty chair opposite her  mrs gilbey when he does anything right hes your son when he does anything wrong hes mine have you any news of him  gilbey ive a good mind not to tell you  mrs gilbey then dont i suppose hes been found thats a comfort at all events  gilbey no he hasnt been found the boy may be at the bottom of the river for all you care too agitated to sit quietly he rises and paces the room distractedly  mrs gilbey then what have you got in your hand  gilbey ive a letter from the monsignor grenfell from new york dropping us cutting us turning fiercely on her thats a nice thing isnt it  mrs gilbey what for  gilbey flinging away towards his chair how do i know what for  mrs gilbey what does he say  gilbey sitting down and grumblingly adjusting his spectacles this is what he says my dear mr gilbey the news about bobby had to follow me across the atlantic it did not reach me until today i am afraid he is incorrigible my brother as you may imagine feels that this last escapade has gone beyond the bounds and i think myself that bobby ought to be made to feel that such scrapes involve a certain degree of reprobation as you may imagine and we know no more about it than the babe unborn  mrs gilbey what else does he say  gilbey i think my brother must have been just a little to blame himself so between ourselves i shall with due and impressive formality forgive bobby later on but for the present i think it had better be understood that he is in disgrace and that we are no longer on visiting terms as ever yours sincerely his agitation masters him again thats a nice slap in the face to get from a man in his position this is what your son has brought on me  mrs gilbey well i think its rather a nice letter he as good as tells you hes only letting on to be offended for bobbys good  gilbey oh very well have the letter framed and hang it up over the mantelpiece as a testimonial  mrs gilbey dont talk nonsense rob you ought to be thankful to know that the boy is alive after his disappearing like that for nearly a week  gilbey nearly a week a fortnight you mean wheres your feelings woman it was fourteen days yesterday  mrs gilbey oh dont call it fourteen days rob as if the boy was in prison  gilbey how do you know hes not in prison its got on my nerves so that id believe even that  mrs gilbey dont talk silly rob bobby might get into a scrape like any other lad but hed never do anything low  juggins the footman comes in with a card on a salver he is a rather lowspirited man of thirtyfive or more of good appearance and address and iron selfcommand  juggins presenting the salver to mr gilbey lady wishes to see mr bobbys parents sir  gilbey pointing to mrs gilbey theres mr

comes in she is a young lady of hilarious disposition very tolerable good looks and killing clothes she is so affable and confidential that it is very difficult to keep her at a distance by any

amused no you dont tell me that old geezer has a brother a monsignor and youre catholics and i never knew it though ive known bobby ever so long but of course the last thing you find out about a person is their religion isnt it  mrs gilbey were not catholics but when the samuelses got an archdeacons son to form their boys mind mr gilbey thought bobby ought to have a chance too and the monsignor is a customer mr gilbey consulted him about bobby and he recommended a brother of his that was more sinned against than sinning  gilbey on tenderhooks she dont want to hear about that maria

no bobby takes him but holy joe likes it fairly laps it up like a kitten poor old dear well bobby says to me darling  mrs gilbey placidly why does he call you darling  dora oh everybody calls me darling its a sort of name ive got darling dora you know well he says darling if you can get holy joe to sprint a hundred yards ill stand you that squiffer with the gold keys  mrs gilbey does he call his tutor holy joe to his face gilbey clutches at his hair in his impatience  dora well what would he call him after all holy joe is holy joe and boys will be boys  mrs gilbey whats a squiffer  dora oh of course excuse my vulgarity a concertina theres one in a shop in green street ivory inlaid with gold keys and russia leather bellows and bobby knew i hankered after it but he couldnt afford it poor lad though i knew he just longed to give it to me  gilbey maria if you keep interrupting with silly questions i shall go out of my senses heres the boy in gaol and me disgraced for ever and all you care to know is what a squiffer is  dora well remember it has gold keys the man wouldnt take a penny less than 15 pounds for it it was a presentation one  gilbey shouting at her wheres my son whats happened to my son will you tell me that and stop cackling about your squiffer  dora oh aint we impatient well it does you credit old dear and you neednt fuss theres no disgrace bobby behaved like a perfect gentleman besides it was all my fault ill own it i took too much champagne i was not what you might call drunk but i was bright and a little beyond myself andill confess iti wanted to shew off before bobby because he was a bit taken by a woman on the stage and she was pretending to be game for anything you see youve brought bobby up too strict and when he gets loose theres no holding him he does enjoy life more than any lad i ever met  gilbey never you mind how hes been brought up thats my business tell me how hes been brought down thats yours  mrs gilbey oh dont be rude to the lady rob  dora im coming to it old dear dont you be so headstrong well it was a beautiful moonlight night and we couldnt get a cab on the nod so we started to walk very jolly you know arm in arm and dancing along singing and all that when we came into jamaica square there was a young copper on point duty at the corner i says to bob dearie boy is it a bargain about the squiffer if i make joe sprint for you anything you like darling says he i love you i put on my best company manners and stepped up to the copper if you please sir says i can you direct me to carrickmines square i was so genteel and talked so sweet that he fell to it like a bird i never heard of any such square in these parts he says then says i what a very silly little officer you must be and i gave his helmet a chuck behind that knocked it over his eyes and did a bunk  mrs gilbey did a what  dora a bunk holy joe did one too all right he sprinted faster than he ever did in college i bet the old dear he got clean off too just as he was overtaking me halfway down the square we heard the whistle and at the sound of it he drew away like a streak of lightning and that was the last i saw of him i was copped in the dock road myself rotten luck wasnt it i tried the innocent and genteel and all the rest but bobbys hat done me in  gilbey and what happened to the boy  dora only fancy he stopped to laugh at the copper he thought the copper would see the joke poor lamb he was arguing about it when the two that took me came along to find out what the whistle was for and brought me with them of course i swore id never seen him before in my life but there he was in my hat and i in his the cops were very spiteful and laid it on for all they were worth drunk and disorderly and assaulting the police and all that i got fourteen days without the option because you seewell the fact is id done it before and been warned bobby was a first offender and had the option but the dear boy had no money left and wouldnt give you away by telling his name and anyhow he couldnt have brought himself to buy himself off and leave me there so hes doing his time well it was two forty shillingses and ive only twentyeight shillings in the world if i pawn my clothes i shant be able to earn any more so i cant pay the fine and get him out but if youll stand 3 pounds ill stand one and thatll do it if youd like to be very kind and nice you could pay the lot but i cant deny that it was my fault so i wont press you  gilbey heartbroken my son in gaol  dora oh cheer up old dear it wont hurt him look at me after fourteen days of it im all the better for being kept a bit quiet you mustnt let it prey on your mind  gilbey the disgrace of it will kill me and it will leave a mark on him to the end of his life  dora not a bit of it dont you be afraid ive educated bobby a bit hes not the mollycoddle he was when you had him in hand  mrs gilbey indeed bobby is not a mollycoddle they wanted him to go in for singlestick at the young mens christian association but of course i couldnt allow that he might have had his eye knocked out  gilbey to dora angrily listen here you  dora oh aint we cross  gilbey i want none of your gaiety here this is a respectable household youve gone and got my poor innocent boy into trouble its the like of you thats the ruin of the like of him  dora so you always say you old dears but you know better bobby came to me i didnt come to him  gilbey would he have gone if you hadnt been there for him to go to tell me that you know why he went to you i suppose  dora charitably it was dull for him at home poor lad wasnt it  mrs gilbey oh no im at home on first thursdays and we have the knoxes to dinner every friday margaret knox and bobby are as good as engaged mr knox is my husbands partner mrs knox is very religious but shes quite cheerful we dine with them on tuesdays so thats two evenings pleasure every week  gilbey almost in tears we done what we could for the boy short of letting him go into temptations of all sorts he can do what he likes what more does he want  dora well old dear he wants me and thats about the long and short of it and i must say youre not very nice to me about it ive talked to him like a mother and tried my best to keep him straight but i dont deny i like a bit of fun myself and we both get a bit giddy when were lighthearted him and me is a pair im afraid  gilbey dont talk foolishness girl how could you and he be a pair you being what you are and he brought up as he has been with the example of a religious woman like mrs knox before his eyes i cant understand how he could bring himself to be seen in the street with you pitying himself i havnt deserved this ive done my duty as a father ive kept him sheltered angry with her creatures like you that take advantage of a childs innocence ought to be whipped through the streets  dora well whatever i may be im too much the lady to lose my temper and i dont think bobby would like me to tell you what i think of you for when i start giving people a bit of my mind i sometimes use language thats beneath me but i tell you once for all i must have the money to get bobby out and if you wont fork out ill hunt up holy joe he might get it off his brother the monsignor  gilbey you mind your own concerns my solicitor will do what is right ill not have you paying my sons fine as if you were anything to him  dora thats right youll get him out today wont you  gilbey its likely id leave my boy in prison isnt it  dora id like to know when theyll let him out  gilbey you would would you youre going to meet him at the prison door  dora well dont you think any woman would that had the feelings of a lady  gilbey bitterly oh yes i know here i must buy the lads salvation i suppose how much will you take to clear out and let him go  dora pitying him quite nice about it what good would that do old dear there are others you know  gilbey thats true i must send the boy himself away  dora where to  gilbey anywhere so long as hes out of the reach of you and your like  dora then im afraid youll have to send him out of the world old dear im sorry for you i really am though you mightnt believe it and i think your feelings do you real credit but i cant give him up just to let him fall into the hands of people i couldnt trust can i  gilbey beside himself rising wheres the police wheres the government wheres the church wheres respectability and right reason whats the good of them if i have to stand here and see you put my son in your pocket as if he was a chattel slave and you hardly out of gaol as a common drunk and disorderly whats the world coming to  dora it is a lottery isnt it old dear  mr gilbey rushes from the room distracted  mrs gilbey unruffled where did you buy that white lace i want some to match a collaret of my own and i cant get it at perry and johns  dora knagg and pantles one and fourpence its machine handmade  mrs gilbey i never give more than

telling me to mind my own business doesnt it well im off tootle loo charlie darling she kisses her hand to him and goes     act ii  on the afternoon of the same day mrs knox is writing notes in her drawingroom at a writingtable which stands against the wall anyone placed so as to see mrs knoxs left profile will have the door on the right and the window an the left both further away than mrs knox whose back is presented to an obsolete upright piano at the opposite side of the room the sofa is near the piano there is a small table in the middle of the room with some giltedged books and albums on it and chairs near it  mr knox comes in almost furtively a troubled man of fifty thinner harder and uglier than his partner gilbey gilbey being a soft stoutish man with white hair and thin smooth skin whilst knox has coarse black hair and blue jaws which no diligence in shaving can whiten mrs knox is a plain woman dressed without regard to fashion with thoughtful eyes and thoughtful ways that make an atmosphere of peace and some solemnity she is surprised to see her husband at home during business hours  mrs knox what brings you home at this hour have you heard anything  knox no have you  mrs knox no whats the matter  knox sitting down on the sofa i believe gilbey has found out  mrs knox what makes you think that  knox well i dont know i didnt like to tell you you have enough to worry you without that but gilbeys been very queer ever since it happened i cant keep my mind on business as i ought and i was depending on him but hes worse than me hes not looking after anything and he keeps out of my way his manners not natural he hasnt asked us to dinner and hes never said a word about our not asking him to dinner after all these years when weve dined every week as regular as clockwork it looks to me as if gilbeys trying to drop me socially well why should he do that if he hasnt heard  mrs knox i wonder bobby hasnt been near us either thats what i cant make out  knox oh thats nothing i told him margaret was down in cornwall with her aunt  mrs knox reproachfully jo she takes her handkerchief from the writingtable and cries a little  knox well i got to tell lies aint i you wont somebodys got to tell em  mrs knox putting away her handkerchief it only ends in our not knowing what to believe mrs gilbey told me bobby was in brighton for the sea air theres something queer about that gilbey would never let the boy loose by himself among the temptations of a gay place like brighton without his tutor and i saw the tutor in kensington high street the very day she told me  knox if the gilbeys have found out its all over between bobby and margaret and all over between us and them  mrs knox its all over between us and everybody when a girl runs away from home like that people know what to think of her and her parents  knox she had a happy respectable homeeverything  mrs knox interrupting him theres no use going over it all again jo if a girl hasnt happiness in herself she wont be happy anywhere youd better go back to the shop and try to keep your mind off it  knox rising restlessly i cant i keep fancying everybody knows it and is sniggering about it im at peace nowhere but here its a comfort to be with you its a torment to be with other people  mrs knox going to him and drawing her arm through his there jo there im sure id have you here always if i could but it cant be gods work must go on from day to day no matter what comes we must face our trouble and bear it  knox wandering to the window arm in arm with her just look at the people in the street going up and down as if nothing had happened it seems unnatural as if they all knew and didnt care  mrs knox if they knew jo thered be a crowd round the house looking up at us you shouldnt keep thinking about it  knox i know i shouldnt you have your religion amelia and im sure im glad it comforts you but it doesnt come to me that way ive worked hard to get a position and be respectable ive turned many a girl out of the shop for being half an hour late at night and heres my own daughter gone for a fortnight without word or sign except a telegram to say shes not dead and that were not to worry about her  mrs knox suddenly pointing to the street jo look  knox margaret with a man  mrs knox run down jo quick catch her save her  knox lingering shes shaking bands with him shes coming across to the door  mrs knox energetically do as i tell you catch the man before hes out of sight  knox rushes from the room mrs knox looks anxiously and excitedly from the window then she throws up the sash and leans out margaret knox comes in flustered and annoyed she is a strong springy girl of eighteen with large nostrils an audacious chin and a gaily resolute manner even peremptory on occasions like the present when she is annoyed  margaret mother mother  mrs knox draws in her head and confronts her daughter  mrs knox sternly well miss  margaret oh mother do go out and stop father making a scene in the street he rushed at him and said youre the man who took away my daughter loud enough for all the people to hear everybody stopped we shall have a crowd round the house do do something to stop him  knox returns with a goodlooking young marine officer  margaret oh monsieur duvallet im so sorryso ashamed mother this is monsieur duvallet who has been extremely kind to me monsieur duvallet my mother duvallet bows  knox a frenchman it only needed this  margaret much annoyed father do please be commonly civil to a gentleman who has been of the greatest service to me what will he think of us  duvallet debonair but its very natural i understand mr knoxs feelings perfectly he speaks english better than knox having learnt it on both sides of the atlantic  knox if ive made any mistake im ready to apologize but i want to know where my daughter has been for the last fortnight  duvallet she has been i assure you in a particularly safe place  knox will you tell me what place i can judge for myself how safe it was  margaret holloway gaol was that safe enough  knox and mrs knox holloway gaol  knox youve joined the suffragets  margaret no i wish i had i could have had the same experience in better company please sit down monsieur duvallet she sits between the table and the sofa mrs knox overwhelmed sits at the other side of the table knox remains standing in the middle of the room  duvallet sitting down on the sofa it was nothing an adventure nothing  margaret obdurately drunk and assaulting the police forty shillings or a month  mrs knox margaret who accused you of such a thing  margaret the policeman i assaulted  knox you mean to say that you did it  margaret i did i had that satisfaction at all events i knocked two of his teeth out  knox and you sit there coolly and tell me this  margaret well where do you want me to sit whats the use of saying things like that  knox my daughter in holloway gaol  margaret all the women in holloway are somebodys daughters really father you must make up your mind to it if you had sat in that cell for fourteen days making up your mind to it you would understand that im not in the humor to be gaped at while youre trying to persuade yourself that it cant be real these things really do happen to real people every day and you read about them in the papers and think its all right well theyve happened to me thats all  knox feebleforcible but they shouldnt have happened to you dont you know that  margaret they shouldnt happen to anybody i suppose but they do rising impatiently and really id rather go out and assault another policeman and go back to holloway than keep talking round and round it like this if youre going to turn me out of the house turn me out the sooner i go the better  duvallet rising quickly that is impossible mademoiselle your father has his position to consider to turn his daughter out of doors would ruin him socially  knox oh youve put her up to that have you and where did you come in may i ask  duvallet i came in at your invitationat your amiable insistence in fact not at my own but you need have no anxiety on my account i was concerned in the regrettable incident which led to your daughters incarceration i got a fortnight without the option of a fine on the ridiculous ground that i ought to have struck the policeman with my fist i should have done so with pleasure had i known but as it was i struck him on the ear with my boota magnificent moulinet i must sayand was informed that i had been guilty of an act of cowardice but that for the sake of the entente cordiale i should be dealt with leniently yet miss knox who used her fist got a month but with the option of a fine i did not know this until i was released when my first act was to pay the fine and here we are  mrs knox you ought to pay the gentleman the fine jo  knox reddening oh certainly he takes out some money  duvallet oh please it does not matter knox hands him two sovereigns if you insist he pockets them thank you  margaret im ever so much obliged to you monsieur duvallet  duvallet can i be of any further assistance mademoiselle  margaret i think you had better leave us to fight it out if you dont mind  duvallet perfectly madame bowmademoiselle bowmonsieur bowhe goes out  mrs knox dont ring jo see the gentleman out yourself  knox hastily sees duvallet out mother and daughter sit looking forlornly at one another without saying a word mrs knox slowly sits down margaret follows her example they look at one another again mr knox returns  knox shortly and sternly amelia this is your job to margaret i leave you to your mother i shall have my own say in the matter when i hear what you have to say to her he goes out solemn and offended  margaret with a bitter little laugh just what the suffraget said to me in holloway he throws the job on you  mrs knox reproachfully margaret  margaret you know its true  mrs knox margaret if youre going to be hardened about it theres no use my saying anything  margaret im not hardened mother but i cant talk nonsense about it you see its all real to me ive suffered it ive been shoved and bullied ive had my arms twisted ive been made scream with pain in other ways ive been flung into a filthy cell with a lot of other poor wretches as if i were a sack of coals being emptied into a cellar and the only difference between me and the others was that i hit back yes i did and i did worse i wasnt ladylike i cursed i called names i heard words that i didnt even know that i knew coming out of my mouth just as if somebody else had spoken them the policeman repeated them in court the magistrate said he could hardly believe it the policeman held out his hand with his two teeth in it that i knocked out i said it was all right that i had heard myself using those words quite distinctly and that i had taken the good conduct prize for three years running at school the poor old gentleman put me back for the missionary to find out who i was and to ascertain the state of my mind i wouldnt tell of course for your sakes at home here and i wouldnt say i was sorry or apologize to the policeman or compensate him or anything of that sort i wasnt sorry the one thing that gave me any satisfaction was getting in that smack on his mouth and i said so so the missionary reported that i seemed hardened and that no doubt i would tell who i was after a day in prison then i was sentenced so now you see im not a bit the sort of girl you thought me im not a bit the sort of girl i thought myself and i dont know what sort of person you really are or what sort of person father really is i wonder what he would say or do if he had an angry brute of a policeman twisting his arm with one hand and rushing him along by the nape of his neck with the other he couldnt whirl his leg like a windmill and knock a policeman down by a glorious kick on the helmet oh if theyd all fought as we two fought wed have beaten them  mrs knox but how did it all begin  margaret oh i dont know it was boatrace night they said  mrs knox boatrace night but what had you to do with the boat race you went to the great salvation festival at the albert hall with your aunt she put you into the bus that passes the door what made you get out of the bus  margaret i dont know the meeting got on my nerves somehow it was the singing i suppose you know i love singing a good swinging hymn and i felt it was ridiculous to go home in the bus after we had been singing so wonderfully about climbing up the golden stairs to heaven i wanted more musicmore happinessmore life i wanted some comrade who felt as i did i felt exalted it seemed mean to be afraid of anything after all what could anyone do to me against my will i suppose i was a little mad at all events i got out of the bus at piccadilly circus because there was a lot of light and excitement there i walked to leicester square and went into a great theatre  mrs knox horrified a theatre  margaret yes lots of other women were going in alone i had to pay five shillings  mrs knox aghast five shillings  margaret apologetically it was a lot it was very stuffy and i didnt like the people much because they didnt seem to be enjoying themselves but the stage was splendid and the music lovely i saw that frenchman monsieur duvallet standing against a barrier smoking a cigarette he seemed quite happy and he was nice and sailorlike i went and stood beside him hoping he would speak to me  mrs knox gasps margaret  margaret continuing he did just as if he had known me for years we got on together like old friends he asked me would i have some champagne and i said it would cost too much but that i would give anything for a dance i longed to join the people on the stage and dance with them one of them was the most beautiful dancer i ever saw he told me he had come there to see her and that when it was over we could go somewhere where there was dancing so we went to a place where there was a band in a gallery and the floor cleared for dancing very few people danced the women only wanted to shew off their dresses but we danced and danced until a lot of them joined in we got quite reckless and we had champagne after all i never enjoyed anything so much but at last it got spoilt by the oxford and cambridge students up for the boat race they got drunk and they began to smash things and the police came in then it was quite horrible the students fought with the police and the police suddenly got quite brutal and began to throw everybody downstairs they attacked the women who were not doing anything and treated them just as roughly as they had treated the students duvallet got indignant and remonstrated with a policeman who was shoving a woman though she was going quietly as fast as she could the policeman flung the woman through the door and then turned on duvallet it was then that duvallet swung his leg like a windmill and knocked the policeman down and then three policemen rushed at him and carried him out by the arms and legs face downwards two more attacked me and gave me a shove to the door that quite maddened me i just got in one good bang on the mouth of one of them all the rest was dreadful i was rushed through the streets to the police station they kicked me with their knees they twisted my arms they taunted and insulted me they called me vile names and i told them what i thought of them and provoked them to do their worst theres one good thing about being hard hurt it makes you sleep i slept in that filthy cell with all the other drunks sounder than i should have slept at home i cant describe how i felt next morning it was hideous but the police were quite jolly and everybody said it was a bit of english fun and talked about last years boatrace night when it had been a great deal worse i was black and blue and sick and wretched but the strange thing was that i wasnt sorry and im not sorry and i dont feel that i did anything wrong really she rises and stretches her arms with a large liberating breath now that its all over im rather proud of it though i know now that im not a lady but whether thats because were only shopkeepers or because nobodys really a lady except when theyre treated like ladies i dont know she throws herself into a corner of the sofa  mrs knox lost in wonder but how could you bring yourself to do it margaret im not blaming you i only want to know how could you bring yourself to do it  margaret i cant tell you i dont understand it myself the prayer meeting set me free somehow i should never have done it if it were not for the prayer meeting  mrs knox deeply horrified oh dont say such a thing as that i know that prayer can set us free though you could never understand me when i told you so but it sets us free for good not for evil  margaret then i suppose what i did was not evil or else i was set free for evil as well as good as father says you cant have anything both ways at once when i was at home and at school i was what you call good but i wasnt free and when i got free i was what most people would call not good but i see no harm in what i did though i see plenty in what other people did to me  mrs knox i hope you dont think yourself a heroine of romance  margaret oh no she sits down again at the table im a heroine of reality if you can call me a heroine at all and reality is pretty brutal pretty filthy when you come to grips with it yet its glorious all the same its so real and satisfactory  mrs knox i dont like this spirit in you margaret i dont like your talking to me in that tone  margaret its no use mother i dont care for you and papa any the less but i shall never get back to the old way of talking again ive made a sort of descent into hell  mrs knox margaret such a word  margaret you should have heard all the words that were flying round that night you should mix a little with people who dont know any other words but when i said that about a descent into hell i was not swearing i was in earnest like a preacher  mrs knox a preacher utters them in a reverent tone of voice  margaret i know the tone that shews they dont mean anything real to him they usent to mean anything real to me now hell is as real to me as a turnip and i suppose i shall always speak of it like that anyhow ive been there and it seems to me now that nothing is worth doing but redeeming people from it  mrs knox they are redeemed already if they choose to believe it  margaret whats the use of that if they dont choose to believe it you dont believe it yourself or you wouldnt pay policemen to twist their arms whats the good of pretending thats all our respectability is pretending pretending pretending thank heaven ive had it knocked out of me once for all  mrs knox greatly agitated margaret dont talk like that i cant bear to hear you talking wickedly i can bear to hear the children of this world talking vainly and foolishly in the language of this world but when i hear you justifying your wickedness in the words of grace its too horrible it sounds like the devil making fun of religion ive tried to bring you up to learn the happiness of religion ive waited for you to find out that happiness is within ourselves and doesnt come from outward pleasures ive prayed oftener than you think that you might be enlightened but if all my hopes and all my prayers are to come to this that you mix up my very words and thoughts with the promptings of the devil then i dont know what i shall do i dont indeed itll kill me  margaret you shouldnt have prayed for me to be enlightened if you didnt want me to be enlightened if the truth were known i suspect we all want our prayers to be answered only by halves the agreeable halves your prayer didnt get answered by halves mother youve got more than you bargained for in the way of enlightenment i shall never be the same again i shall never speak in the old way again ive been set free from this silly little hole of a house and all its pretences i know now that i am stronger than you and papa i havnt found that happiness of yours that is within yourself but ive found strength for good or evil i am set free and none of the things that used to hold me can hold me now  knox comes back unable to bear his suspense  knox how long more are you going to keep me waiting amelia do you think im made of iron whats the girl done what are we going to do  mrs knox shes beyond my control jo and beyond yours i cant even pray for her now for i dont know rightly what to pray for  knox dont talk nonsense

himself in front of it here where are you going  mrs knox rising you mustnt turn her out jo ill go with her if she goes  knox who wants to turn her out but is she going to ruin us to let everybody

you here on my kneesin the dust so to speaknot to let it out  margaret ill tell everybody  knox collapses in despair mrs knox tries to pray and cannot margaret stands inflexible     act iii  again in the gilbeys diningroom afternoon the table is not laid it is draped in its ordinary cloth with pen and ink an exercisebook and schoolbooks on it bobby gilbey is in the armchair crouching over the fire reading an illustrated paper he is a pretty youth of very suburban gentility strong and manly enough by nature but untrained and unsatisfactory his parents having imagined that domestic restriction is what they call bringing up he has learnt nothing from it except a habit of evading it by deceit  he gets up to ring the bell then resumes his crouch juggins answers the bell  bobby juggins  juggins sir  bobby morosely sarcastic sir be blowed  juggins cheerfully not at all sir  bobby im a gaolbird youre a respectable man  juggins that doesnt matter sir your father pays me to call you sir and as i take the money i keep my part of the bargain  bobby would you call me sir if you wernt paid to do it  juggins no sir  bobby ive been talking to dora about you  juggins indeed sir  bobby yes dora says your name cant be juggins and that you have the manners of a gentleman i always thought you hadnt any manners anyhow your manners are different from the manners of a gentleman in my set  juggins they would be sir  bobby you dont feel disposed to be communicative on the subject of doras notion i suppose  juggins no sir  bobby throwing his paper on the floor and lifting his knees over the arm of the chair so as to turn towards the footman it was part of your bargain that you were to valet me a bit wasnt it  juggins yes sir  bobby well can you tell me the proper way to get out of an engagement to a girl without getting into a row for breach of promise or behaving like a regular cad  juggins no sir you cant get out of an engagement without behaving like a cad if the lady wishes to hold you to it  bobby but it wouldnt be for her happiness to marry me when i dont really care for her  juggins women dont always marry for happiness sir they often marry because they wish to be married women and not old maids  bobby then what am i to do  juggins marry her sir or behave like a cad  bobby jumping up well i wont marry her thats flat what would you do if you were in my place  juggins i should tell the young lady that i found i couldnt fulfil my engagement  bobby but youd have to make some excuse you know i want to give it a gentlemanly turn to say im not worthy of her or something like that  juggins that is not a gentlemanly turn sir quite the contrary  bobby i dont see that at all do you mean that its not exactly true  juggins not at all sir  bobby i can say that no other girl can ever be to me what shes been that would be quite true because our circumstances have been rather exceptional and shell imagine i mean im fonder of her than i can ever be of anyone else you see juggins a gentleman has to think of a girls feelings  juggins if you wish to spare her feelings sir you can marry her if you hurt her feelings by refusing you had better not try to get credit for considerateness at the same time by pretending to spare them she wont like it and it will start an argument of which you will get the worse  bobby but you know im not really worthy of her  juggins probably she never supposed you were sir  bobby oh i say juggins you are a pessimist  juggins preparing to go anything else sir  bobby querulously you havnt been much use he wanders disconsolately across the room you generally put me up to the correct way of doing things  juggins i assure you sir theres no correct way of jilting its not correct in itself  bobby hopefully ill tell you what ill say i cant hold her to an engagement with a man whos been in quod thatll do it he seats himself on the table relieved and confident  juggins very dangerous sir no woman will deny herself the romantic luxury of selfsacrifice and forgiveness when they take the form of doing something agreeable shes almost sure to say that your misfortune will draw her closer to you  bobby what a nuisance i dont know what to do you know juggins your cool simpleminded way of doing it wouldnt go down in denmark hill  juggins i daresay not sir no doubt youd prefer to make it look like an act of selfsacrifice for her sake on your part or provoke her to break the engagement herself both plans have been tried repeatedly but never with success as far as my knowledge goes  bobby you have a devilish cool way of laying down the law you know in my class you have to wrap up things a bit denmark hill isnt camberwell you know  juggins i have noticed sir that denmark hill thinks that the higher you go in the social scale the less sincerity is allowed and that only tramps and riffraff are quite sincere thats a mistake tramps are often shameless but theyre never sincere swellsif i may use that convenient name for the upper classesplay much more with their cards on the table if you tell the young lady that you want to jilt her and she calls you a pig the tone of the transaction may leave much to be desired but itll be less camberwellian than if you say youre not worthy  bobby oh i cant make you understand juggins the girl isnt a scullerymaid i want to do it delicately  juggins a mistake sir believe me if you are not a born artist in that linebeg pardon sir i think i heard the bell he goes out  bobby much perplexed shoves his hands into his pockets and comes off the table staring disconsolately straight before him then goes reluctantly to his books and sits down to write juggins returns  juggins announcing miss knox  margaret comes in juggins withdraws  margaret still grinding away for that society of arts examination bobby youll never pass  bobby rising no i was just writing to you  margaret what about  bobby oh nothing at least how are you  margaret passing round the other end of the table and putting down on it a copy of lloyds weekly and her pursebag quite well thank you how did you enjoy brighton  bobby brighton i wasnt at oh yes of course oh pretty well is your aunt all right  margaret my aunt i suppose so i havent seen her for a month  bobby i thought you were down staying with her  margaret oh was that what they told you  bobby yes why werent you really  margaret no ive something to tell you sit down and lets be comfortable  she sits on the edge of the table he sits beside her and puts his arm wearily round her waist  margaret you neednt do that if you dont like bobby suppose we get off duty for the day just to see what its like  bobby off duty what do you mean  margaret you know very well what i mean bobby did you ever care one little scrap for me in that sort of way dont funk answering i dont care a bit for youthat way  bobby removing his arm rather huffily i beg your pardon im sure i thought you did  margaret well did you come dont be mean ive owned up you can put it all on me if you like but i dont believe you care any more than i do  bobby you mean weve been shoved into it rather by the pars and mars  margaret yes  bobby well its not that i dont care for you in fact no girl can ever be to me exactly what you are but weve been brought up so much together that it feels more like brother and sister thanwell than the other thing doesnt it  margaret just so how did you find out the difference  bobby blushing oh i say  margaret i found out from a frenchman  bobby oh i say he comes off the table in his consternation  margaret did you learn it from a frenchwoman you know you must have learnt it from somebody  bobby not a frenchwoman shes quite a nice woman but shes been rather unfortunate the daughter of a clergyman  margaret startled oh bobby that sort of woman  bobby what sort of woman  margaret you dont believe shes really a clergymans daughter do you you silly boy its a stock joke  bobby do you mean to say you dont believe me  margaret no i mean to say i dont believe her  bobby curious and interested resuming his seat on the table beside her what do you know about her what do you know about all this sort of thing  margaret what sort of thing bobby  bobby well about life  margaret ive lived a lot since i saw you last i wasnt at my aunts all that time that you were in brighton i mean  bobby i wasnt at brighton meg id better tell you youre bound to find out sooner or later he begins his confession humbly avoiding her gaze meg its rather awful youll think me no end of a beast ive been in prison  margaret you  bobby yes me for being drunk and assaulting the police  margaret do you mean to say that youoh this is a letdown for me she comes off the table and drops disconsolate into a chair at the end of it furthest from the hearth  bobby of course i couldnt hold you to our engagement after that i was writing to you to break it off he also descends from the table and makes slowly for the hearth you must think me an utter rotter  margaret oh has everybody been in prison for being drunk and assaulting the police how long were you in  bobby a fortnight  margaret thats what i was in for  bobby what are you talking about in where  margaret in quod  bobby but im serious im not rotting really and truly  margaret what did you do to the copper  bobby nothing absolutely nothing he exaggerated grossly i only laughed at him  margaret jumping up triumphant ive beaten you hollow i knocked out two of his teeth ive got one of them he sold it to me for ten shillings  bobby now please do stop fooling meg i tell you im not rotting he sits down in the armchair rather sulkily  margaret taking up the copy of lloyds weekly and going to him and i tell you im not either look heres a report of it the daily papers are no good but the sunday papers are splendid she sits on the arm of the chair see reading hardened at eighteen a quietly dressed respectablelooking girl who refuses her namethats me  bobby pausing a moment in his perusal do you mean to say that you went on the loose out of pure devilment  margaret i did no harm i went to see a lovely dance i picked up a nice man and went to have a dance myself i cant imagine anything more innocent and more happy all the bad part was done by other people they did it out of pure devilment if you like anyhow here we are two gaolbirds bobby disgraced forever isnt it a relief  bobby rising stiffly but you know its not the same for a girl a man may do things a woman maynt he stands on the hearthrug with his back to the fire  margaret are you scandalized bobby  bobby well you cant expect me to approve of it can you meg i never thought you were that sort of girl  margaret rising indignantly im not you mustnt pretend to think that im a clergymans daughter bobby  bobby i wish you wouldnt chaff about that dont forget the row you got into for letting out that you admired juggins she turns her back on him quicklya footman and what about the frenchman  margaret facing him again i know nothing about the frenchman except that hes a very nice fellow and can swing his leg round like the hand of a clock and knock a policeman down with it he was in wormwood scrubbs with you i was in holloway  bobby its all very well to make light of it meg but this is a bit thick you know  margaret do you feel you couldnt marry a woman whos been in prison  bobby hastily no i never said that it might even give a woman a greater claim on a man any girl if she were thoughtless and a bit on perhaps might get into a scrape anyone who really understood her character could see there was no harm in it but youre not the larky sort at least you usent to be  margaret im not and i never will be she walks straight up to him i didnt do it for a lark bob i did it out of the very depths of my nature i did it because im that sort of person i did it in one of my religious fits im hardened at eighteen as they say so what about the match now  bobby well i dont think you can fairly hold me to it meg of course it would be ridiculous for me to set up to be shocked or anything of that sort i cant afford to throw stones at anybody and i dont pretend to i can understand a lark i can forgive a slip as long as it is understood that it is only a lark or a slip but to go on the loose on principle to talk about religion in connection with it totowell meg i do find that a bit thick i must say i hope youre not in earnest when you talk that way  margaret bobby youre no good no good to me anyhow  bobby huffed im sorry miss knox  margaret goodbye mr gilbey she turns on her heel and goes to the other end of the table i suppose you wont introduce me to the clergymans daughter  bobby i dont think shed like it there are limits after all he sits down at the table as if to to resume work at his books a hint to her to go  margaret on her way to the door ring the bell bobby and tell juggins to shew me out  bobby reddening im not a cad meg  margaret coming to the table then do something nice to prevent us feeling mean about this afterwards youd better kiss me you neednt ever do it again  bobby if im no good i dont see what fun it would be for you  margaret oh itd be no fun if i wanted what you call fun i should ask the frenchman to kiss meor juggins  bobby rising and retreating to the hearth oh dont be disgusting meg dont be low  margaret determinedly preparing to use force now ill make you kiss me just to punish you she seizes his wrist pulls him off his balance and gets her arm round his neck  bobby no stop leave go will you  juggins appears at the door  juggins miss delaney sir dora comes in juggins goes out margaret hastily releases bobby and goes to the other side of the room  dora through the door to the departing juggins well you are a juggins to shew me up when theres

comes to talking about blokes and all thatwell  margaret oh ive learnt the language and i like it its another barrier broken down  bobby its not so much the language meg but i think he looks at dora

to insult you like that bobby say that that wasnt what you meant  bobby i didnt say it was  margaret well deny that it was  bobby no i wouldnt have said it in front of dora but i do think its not

company for you dearie i couldnt live up to you she turns to go  margaret stop do you believe he could live up to me  dora well ill never say anything to stand between a girl and a respectable marriage or to stop a decent lad from settling himself i have a conscience though i maynt be as particular as some  margaret you seem to me to be a very decent sort and bobbys behaving like a skunk  bobby much ruffled nice language that  dora well dearie men have to do some awfully mean things to keep up their respectability but you cant blame them for that can you ive met bobby walking with his mother and of course he cut me dead i wont pretend i liked it but what could he do poor dear  margaret and now he wants me to cut you dead to keep him in countenance well i shant not if my whole

calling a young beast  margaret you  dora peacemaking now dearies  bobby if you dont take care youll get your fat head jolly well clouted  margaret if you dont take care the policemans tooth will only be the beginning of a collection  dora now loveys be good  bobby lost to all sense of adult dignity puts out his tongue at margaret margaret equally furious catches his protended countenance a box on the cheek he hurls himself her they wrestle  bobby cat ill teach you  margaret pig beast she forces him backwards on the table now where are you  dora calling juggins juggins theyll murder one another  juggins throwing open the door and announcing monsieur duvallet  duvallet enters sudden cessation of hostilities and dead silence the combatants separate by the whole width of the room juggins withdraws  duvallet i fear i derange you  margaret not at all bobby you really are a beast monsieur duvallet will think im always fighting  duvallet practising jujitsu or the new iceland wrestling admirable miss knox the athletic young englishwoman is an example to all europe indicating bobby your instructor no doubt monsieur he bows  bobby bowing awkwardly how dy do  margaret to bobby im so sorry bobby i asked monsieur duvallet to call for me here and i forgot to tell you introducing monsieur duvallet miss four hundred and seven mr bobby gilbey duvallet bows i really dont know how to

street  dora let me absquatulate making for the door  juggins if you wish to leave without being seen you had better step into my pantry and leave afterwards  dora right oh she bursts into song hide me in the meat safe til the cop goes by hum the dear old music as his step draws nigh she goes out on tiptoe  margaret i wont stay here if she has to hide ill keep her company in the pantry she follows dora  bobby lets all go we cant have any fun with the mar here i say juggins you can give us tea in the pantry cant you  juggins certainly sir  bobby right say nothing to my mother you dont

duvallet follows him to the door you understand sir that miss knox is a lady absolutely comme il faut  duvallet perfectly but the other  juggins the other sir may be both charitably and accurately described in your native idiom as a daughter of joy  duvallet it is what i thought these english domestic interiors are very interesting he goes out followed by juggins  presently mr and mrs gilbey come in they take their accustomed places he on the hearthrug she at the colder end of the table  mrs gilbey did you smell scent in the hall rob  gilbey no i didnt and i dont want to smell it dont you go looking for trouble maria  mrs gilbey snuffing up the perfumed atmosphere shes been here gilbey rings the bell what are you ringing for are you going to ask  gilbey no im not going to ask juggins said this morning he wanted to speak to me if he likes to tell me let him but im not going to ask and dont you either juggins appears at the door you said you wanted to say something to me  juggins when it would be convenient to you sir  gilbey well what is it  mrs gilbey oh juggins were expecting mr and mrs knox to tea  gilbey he knows that he sits down then to juggins what is it  juggins advancing to the middle of the table would it inconvenience you sir if i was to give you a months notice  gilbey taken aback what why aint you satisfied  juggins perfectly sir it is not that i want to better myself i assure you  gilbey well what do you want to leave for then do you want to worse yourself  juggins no sir ive been well treated in your most comfortable establishment and i should be greatly distressed if you or mrs gilbey were to interpret my notice as an expression of dissatisfaction  gilbey paternally now you listen to me juggins im an older man than you dont you throw out dirty water til you get in fresh dont get too big for your boots youre like all servants nowadays you think youve only to hold up your finger to get the pick of half a dozen jobs but you wont be treated everywhere as youre treated here in bed every night before eleven hardly a ring at the door except on mrs gilbeys day once a month and no other manservant to interfere with you it may be a bit quiet perhaps but youre past the age of adventure take my advice think over it you suit me and im prepared to make it suit you if youre dissatisfiedin reason you know  juggins i realize my advantages sir but ive private reasons  gilbey cutting him short angrily and retiring to the hearthrug in dudgeon oh i know very well go the sooner the better  mrs gilbey oh not until were suited he must stay his month  gilbey sarcastic do you want to lose him his character maria do you think i dont see what it is were prison folk now weve been in the police court to juggins well i suppose you know your own business best i take your notice you can go when your month is up or sooner if you like  juggins believe me sir  gilbey thats enough i dont want any excuses i dont blame you you can go downstairs now if youve nothing else to trouble me about  juggins i really cant leave it at that sir i assure you ive no objection to young mr gilbeys going to prison you may do six months yourself sir and welcome without a word of remonstrance from me im leaving solely because my brother who has suffered a bereavement and feels lonely begs me to spend a few months with him until he gets over it  gilbey and is he to keep you all that time or are you to spend your savings in comforting him have some sense man how can you afford such things  juggins my brother can afford to keep me sir the truth is he objects to my being in service  gilbey is that any reason why you should be dependent on him dont do it juggins pay your own way like an honest lad and dont eat your brothers bread while youre able to earn your own  juggins there is sound sense in that sir but unfortunately it is a tradition in my family that the younger brothers should spunge to a considerable extent on the eldest  gilbey then the sooner that tradition is broken the better my man  juggins a radical sentiment sir but an excellent one  gilbey radical what do you mean dont you begin to take liberties juggins now that you know were loth to part with you your brother isnt a duke you know  juggins unfortunately he is sir   gilbey        what                               together                            mrs gilbey    juggins   juggins excuse me sir the bell he goes out  gilbey overwhelmed maria did you understand him to say his brother was a duke  mrs gilbey fancy his condescending perhaps if youd offer to raise his wages and treat him as one of the family hed stay  gilbey and have my own servant above me not me whats the world coming to heres bobby and  juggins entering and announcing mr and mrs knox  the knoxes come in juggins takes two chairs from the wall and places them at the table between the host and hostess then he withdraws  mrs gilbey to mrs knox how are you dear  mrs knox nicely thank you good evening mr gilbey they shake hands and she takes the chair nearest mrs gilbey mr knox takes the other chair  gilbey sitting down i was just saying knox what is the world coming to  knox appealing to his wife what was i saying myself only this morning  mrs knox this is a strange time i was never one to talk about the end of the world but look at the things that have happened  knox earthquakes  gilbey san francisco  mrs gilbey jamaica  knox martinique  gilbey messina  mrs gilbey the plague in china  mrs knox the floods in france  gilbey my bobby in wormwood scrubbs  knox margaret in holloway  gilbey and now my footman tells me his brothers a duke   knox          no                mrs knox    whats that  gilbey just before he let you in a duke here has everything been respectable from the beginning of the world as you may say to the present day and all of a sudden everything is turned upside down  mrs knox its like in the book of revelations but i do say that unless people have happiness within themselves all the earthquakes all the floods and all the prisons in the world cant make them really happy  knox it isnt alone the curious things that are happening but the unnatural way people are taking them why theres margaret been in prison and she hasnt time to go to all the invitations shes had from people that never asked her before  gilbey i never knew we could live without being respectable  mrs gilbey oh rob what a thing to say who says were not respectable  gilbey well its not what i call respectable to have your children in and out of gaol  knox oh come gilbey were not tramps because weve had as it were an accident  gilbey its no use knox look it in the face did i ever tell you my father drank  knox no but i knew it simmons told me  gilbey yes he never could keep his mouth quiet he told me your aunt was a kleptomaniac  mrs knox it wasnt true mr gilbey she used to pick up handkerchiefs if she saw them lying about but you might trust her with untold silver  gilbey my uncle phil was a teetotaller my father used to say to me rob he says dont you ever have a weakness if you find one getting a hold on you make a merit of it he says your uncle phil doesnt like spirits and he makes a merit of it and is chairman of the blue ribbon committee i do like spirits and i make a merit of it and im the king cockatoo of the convivial cockatoos never put yourself in the wrong he says i used to boast about what a good boy bobby was now i swank about what a dog he is and it pleases people just as well what a world it is  knox it turned my blood cold at first to hear margaret telling people about holloway but it goes down better than her singing used to  mrs knox i never thought she sang right after all those lessons we paid for  gilbey lord knox it was lucky you and me got let in together i tell you straight if it hadnt been for bobbys disgrace id have broke up the firm  knox i shouldnt have blamed you id have done the same only for margaret too much straightlacedness narrows a mans mind talking of that what about those hygienic corset advertisements that vines  jackson want us to put in the window i told vines they werent decent and we couldnt shew them in our shop i was pretty high with him but what am i to say to him now if he comes and throws this business in our teeth  gilbey oh put em in we may as well go it a bit now  mrs gilbey youve been going it quite far enough rob to mrs knox he wont get up in the mornings now he that was always out of bed at seven to the tick  mrs knox you hear that jo to mrs gilbey hes taken to whisky and soda a pint a week and the beer the same as before  knox oh dont preach old girl  mrs knox to mrs gilbey thats a new name hes got for me to knox i tell you jo this doesnt sit well on you you may call it preaching if you like but its the truth for all that i say that if youve happiness within yourself you dont need to seek it outside spending money on drink and theatres and bad company and being miserable after all you can sit at home and be happy and you can work and be happy if you have that in you the spirit will set you free to do what you want and guide you to do right but if you havent got it then youd best be respectable and stick to the ways that are marked out for you for youve nothing else to keep you straight  knox angrily and is a man never to have a bit of fun see whats come of it with your daughter she was to be content with your happiness that youre always talking about and how did the spirit guide her to a months hard for being drunk and assaulting the police did i ever assault the police  mrs knox you wouldnt have the courage i dont blame the girl   mrs gilbey        oh maria  what are you saying                     gilbey            what  and you so pious  mrs knox she went where the spirit guided her and what harm there was in it she knew nothing about  gilbey oh come mrs knox girls are not so innocent as all that  mrs knox i dont say she was ignorant but i do say that she didnt know what we know i mean the way certain temptations get a sudden hold that no goodness nor selfcontrol is any use against she was saved from that and had a rough lesson too and i say it was no earthly protection that did that but dont think you two men that youll be protected if you make what she did an excuse to go and do as youd like to do if it wasnt for fear of losing your characters the spirit wont guide you because it isnt in you and it never had been not in either of you  gilbey with ironic humility im sure im obliged to you for your good opinion mrs knox  mrs knox well i will say for you mr gilbey that youre better than my man here hes a bitter hard heathen is my jo god help me she begins to cry quietly  knox now dont take on like that amelia you know i always give in to you that you were right about religion but one of us had to think of other things or wed have starved we and the child  mrs knox how do you know youd have starved all the other things might have been added unto you  gilbey come mrs knox dont tell me knox is a sinner i know better im sure youd be the first to be sorry if anything was to happen to him  knox bitterly to his wife youve always had some grudge against me and nobody but yourself can understand what it is  mrs knox i wanted a man who had that happiness within himself you made me think you had it but it was nothing but being in love with me  mrs gilbey and do you blame him for that  mrs knox i blame nobody but let him not think he can walk by his own light i tell him that if he gives up being respectable hell go right down to the bottom of the hill he has no powers inside himself to keep him steady so let him cling to the powers outside him  knox rising angrily who wants to give up being respectable all this for a pint of whisky that lasted a week how long would it have lasted simmons i wonder  mrs knox gently oh well say no more jo i wont plague you about it he sits down you never did understand and you never will hardly anybody understands even margaret didnt til she went to prison she does now and i shall have a companion in the house after all these lonely years  knox beginning to cry i did all i could to make you happy i never said a harsh word to you  gilbey rising indignantly what right have you to treat a man like that an honest respectable husband as if he were dirt under your feet  knox let her alone gilbey gilbey sits down but mutinously  mrs knox well you gave me all you could jo and if it wasnt what i wanted that wasnt your fault but id rather have you as you were than since you took to whisky and soda  knox i dont want any whisky and soda ill take the pledge if you like  mrs knox no you shall have your beer because you like it the whisky was only brag and if you and me are to remain friends mr gilbey youll get up tomorrow morning at seven  gilbey defiantly damme if i will there  mrs knox with gentle pity how do you know mr gilbey what youll do tomorrow morning  gilbey why shouldnt i know are we children not to be let do what we like and our own sons and daughters kicking their heels all over the place to knox i was never one to interfere between man and wife knox but if maria started ordering me about like that  mrs gilbey now dont be naughty rob you know you mustnt set yourself up against religion  gilbey whos setting himself up against religion  mrs knox it doesnt matter whether you set yourself up against it or not mr gilbey if it sets itself up against you youll have to go the appointed way its no use quarrelling about it with me that am as great a sinner as yourself  gilbey oh indeed and who told you i was a sinner  mrs gilbey now rob you know we are all sinners what else is religion  gilbey i say nothing against religion i suppose were all sinners in a manner of speaking but i dont like to have it thrown at me as if id really done anything  mrs gilbey mrs knox is speaking for your good rob  gilbey well i dont like to be spoken to for my good would anybody like it  mrs knox dont take offence where none is meant mr gilbey talk about something else no good ever comes of arguing about such

way they always did we bring our children up just as we were brought up and we go to church or chapel just as our parents did and we say what everybody says and it goes on all right until something out of the way happens theres a family quarrel or one of the children goes wrong or a father takes to drink or an aunt goes mad or one of us finds ourselves doing something we never thought wed want to do and then you know what happens complaints and quarrels and huff and offence and bad language and bad temper and regular bewilderment as if satan possessed us all we find out then that with all our respectability and piety weve no real religion and no way of telling right from wrong weve nothing but our habits and when theyre upset where are we just like peter in the storm trying to walk on

he proceeds calmly with his duties handing round cups of tea as mrs knox fills them  shrieks of laughter from below stairs reach the ears of the company  mrs gilbey whats that noise is master bobby at home i heard his laugh  mrs knox im sure i heard margarets  gilbey not a bit of it it was that woman  juggins i can explain sir i must ask you to excuse the liberty but im entertaining a small party

knoxs daughter shewn into my pantry  knox margaret mixing with a frenchman and a footman suddenly realizing that the footman is offering him cake she doesnt know aboutabout his grace you know  mrs gilbey perhaps she does does she mr juggins  juggins the other lady suspects me madam they call me rudolph or the long lost heir  mrs gilbey its a much nicer name than juggins i think ill call you by

so loudly sir but the french gentleman always sets them off again  knox do you mean to tell me that my daughter laughs at a frenchmans jokes  gilbey we all know what french jokes are  juggins believe me you do not sir the noise this afternoon has all been because the frenchman said that the cat had whooping cough  mrs gilbey laughing heartily well i never  gilbey dont be a fool maria look here knox we cant let this go on people cant be allowed to behave like this  knox just what i say  a concertina adds its music to the revelry  mrs gilbey excited thats the squiffer hes bought it for her  gilbey well of all the scandalous redoubled laughter from below  knox ill put a stop to this he goes out to the landing and shouts margaret sudden dead silence margaret i say  margarets voice yes father shall we all come up were dying to  knox come up and be ashamed of yourselves behaving like wild indians  doras voice screaming oh oh oh dont bobby nowoh in headlong flight she dashes into and right across the room breathless and slightly abashed by the company i beg your pardon mrs gilbey for coming in like that but whenever i go upstairs in front of bobby he pretends its a cat biting my ankles and i just must scream  bobby and margaret enter rather more shyly but evidently in high spirits bobby places himself near his father on the hearthrug and presently slips down into the armchair  margaret how do you do mrs gilbey she posts herself behind her mother  duvallet comes in behaving himself perfectly knox follows  margaret ohlet me introduce my friend lieutenant duvallet mrs gilbey mr gilbey duvallet bows and sits down on mr knoxs left juggins placing a chair for him  dora now bobby introduce me theres a dear  bobby a little nervous about it but trying to keep up his spirits miss delaney mr and mrs knox knox as he resumes his seat acknowledges the introduction suspiciously mrs knox bows gravely looking keenly at dora and taking her measure without prejudice  dora pleased to meet you juggins places the baby rockingchair for her on mrs gilbeys right opposite mrs knox thank you she sits and turns to mrs gilbey bobbys given me the squiffer to the company generally do you know what theyve been doing downstairs she goes off into ecstasies of mirth youd never guess theyve been trying to teach me table manners the lieutenant and rudolph say im a regular pig im sure i never knew there was anything wrong with me but live and learn to gilbey eh old dear  juggins old dear is not correct miss delaney he retires to the end of the sideboard nearest the door  dora oh get out i must call a man something he doesnt mind do you charlie  mrs gilbey his name isnt charlie  dora excuse me i call everybody charlie  juggins you mustnt  dora oh if i were to mind you i should have to hold my tongue altogether and then how sorry youd be lord how i do run on dont mind me mrs gilbey  knox what i want to know is whats to be the end of this its not for me to interfere between you and your son gilbey he knows his own intentions best no doubt and perhaps has told them to you but ive my daughter to look after and its my duty as a parent to have a clear understanding about her no good is ever done by beating about the bush i ask lieutenantwell i dont speak french and i cant pronounce the name  margaret mr duvallet father  knox i ask mr doovalley what his intentions are  margaret oh father how can you  duvallet im afraid my knowledge of english is not enough to understand intentions how  margaret he wants to know will you marry me   mrs gilbey    what a thing to say                 knox          silence miss                 dora          well thats straight aint it  duvallet but i am married already i have two daughters  knox rising virtuously indignant you sit there after carrying on with my daughter and tell me coolly youre married  margaret papa you really must not tell people that they sit there he sits down again sulkily  duvallet pardon carrying on what does that mean  margaret it means  knox violently hold your tongue you shameless young hussy dont you dare say what it means  duvallet shrugging his shoulders what does it mean rudolph  mrs knox if its not proper for her to say its not proper for a man to say either mr doovalley youre a married man with daughters would you let them go about with a stranger as you are to us without wanting to know whether he intended to behave honorably  duvallet ah madam my daughters are french girls that is very different it would not be correct for a french girl to go about alone and speak to men as english and american girls do that is why i so immensely admire the english people you are so freeso unprejudicedyour women are so brave and franktheir minds are sohow do you saywholesome i intend to have my daughters educated in england nowhere else in the world but in england could i have met at a variety theatre a charming young lady of perfect respectability and enjoyed a dance with her at a public dancing saloon and where else are women trained to box and knock out the teeth of policemen as a protest against injustice and violence rising with immense elan your daughter madam is superb your country is a model to the rest of europe if you were a frenchman stifled with prudery hypocrisy and the tyranny of the family and the home you would understand how an enlightened frenchman admires and envies your freedom your broadmindedness and the fact that home life can hardly be said to exist in england you have made an end of the despotism of the parent the family council is unknown to you everywhere in these islands one can enjoy the exhilarating the soulliberating spectacle of men quarrelling with their brothers defying their fathers refusing to speak to their mothers in france we are not men we are only sonsgrownup children here one is a human beingan end in himself oh mrs knox if only your military genius were equal to your moral geniusif that conquest of europe by france which inaugurated the new age after the revolution had only been an english conquest how much more enlightened the world would have been now we alas can only fight france is unconquerable we impose our narrow ideas our prejudices our obsolete institutions our insufferable pedantry on the world by brute forceby that stupid quality of military heroism which shews how little we have evolved from the savage nay from the beast we can charge like bulls we can spring on our foes like gamecocks when we are overpowered by reason we can die fighting like rats and we are foolish enough to be proud of it why should we be does the bull progress can you civilize the gamecock is there any future for the rat we cant even fight intelligently when we lose battles it is because we have not sense enough to know when we are beaten at waterloo had we known when we were beaten we should have retreated tried another plan and won the battle but no we were too pigheaded to admit that there is anything impossible to a frenchman we were quite satisfied when our marshals had six horses shot under them and our stupid old grognards died fighting rather than surrender like reasonable beings think of your great wellington think of his inspiring words when the lady asked him whether british soldiers ever ran away all soldiers run away madam he said but if there are supports for them to fall back on it does not matter think of your illustrious nelson always beaten on land always victorious at sea where his men could not run away you are not dazzled and misled by false ideals of patriotic enthusiasm your honest and sensible statesmen demand for england a twopower standard even a threepower standard frankly admitting that it is wise to fight three to one whilst we fools and braggarts as we are declare that every frenchman is a host in himself and that when one frenchman attacks three englishmen he is guilty of an act of cowardice comparable to that of the man who strikes a woman it is folly it is nonsense a frenchman is not really stronger than a german than an italian even than an englishman sir if all frenchwomen were like your daughterif all frenchmen had the good sense the power of seeing things as they really are the calm judgment the open mind the philosophic grasp the foresight and true courage which are so natural to you as an englishman that you are hardly conscious of possessing them france would become the greatest nation in the world  margaret three cheers for old england she shakes hands with him warmly  bobby hurraaay and so say all of us  duvallet having responded to margarets handshake with enthusiasm kisses juggins on both cheeks and sinks into his chair wiping his perspiring brow  gilbey well this sort of talk is above me can you make anything out of it knox  knox the long and short of it seems to be that he cant lawfully marry my daughter as he ought after going to prison with her  dora im ready to marry bobby if that will be any satisfaction  gilbey no you dont not if i know it  mrs knox he ought to mr gilbey  gilbey well if thats your religion amelia knox i want no more of it would you invite them to your house if he married her  mrs knox he ought to marry her whether or no  bobby i feel i ought to mrs knox  gilbey hold your tongue mind your own business  bobby wildly if im not let marry her ill do something downright disgraceful ill enlist as a soldier  juggins that is not a disgrace sir  bobby not for you perhaps but youre only a footman im a gentleman  mrs gilbey dont dare to speak disrespectfully to mr rudolph bobby for shame  juggins coming forward to the middle of the table it is not gentlemanly to regard the service of your country as disgraceful it is gentlemanly to marry the lady you make love to  gilbey aghast my boy is to marry this woman and be a social outcast  juggins your boy and miss delaney will be inexorably condemned by respectable society to spend the rest of their days in precisely the sort of company they seem to like best and be most at home in  knox and my daughter whos to marry my daughter  juggins your daughter sir will probably marry whoever she makes up her mind to marry she is a lady of very determined character  knox yes if hed have her with her character gone but who would youre the brother of a duke would   bobby         whats that                margaret      juggins a duke                duvallet      comment                dora          what did i tell you  knox yes the brother of a duke thats what he is to juggins well would you marry her  juggins i was about to propose that solution of your problem mr knox   mrs gilbey    well i never                knox          dye mean it                mrs knox      marry margaret  juggins continuing as an idle younger son unable to support myself or even to remain in the guards in competition with the grandsons of american millionaires i could not have aspired to miss knoxs hand but as a sober honest and industrious domestic servant who has i trust given satisfaction to his employer he bows to mr gilbey i feel i am a man with a character it is for miss knox to decide  margaret i got into a frightful row once for admiring you rudolph  juggins i should have got into an equally frightful row myself miss had i betrayed my admiration for you i looked forward to those weekly dinners  mrs knox but why did a gentleman like you stoop to be a footman  dora he stooped to conquer  margaret shut up dora i want to hear  juggins i will explain but only mrs knox will understand i once insulted a servantrashly for he was a sincere christian he rebuked me for trifling with a girl of his own class i told him to remember what he was and to whom he was speaking he said god would remember i discharged him on the spot  gilbey very properly  knox what right had he to mention such a thing to you  mrs gilbey what are servants coming to  mrs knox did it come true what he said  juggins it stuck like a poisoned arrow it rankled for months then i gave in i apprenticed myself to an old butler of ours who kept a hotel he taught me my present business and got me a place as footman with mr gilbey if ever i meet that man again i shall be able to look him in the face  mrs knox margaret its not on account of the duke dukes are vanities but take my advice and take him  margaret slipping her arm through his i have loved juggins since the first day i beheld him i felt instinctively he had been in the guards may he walk out with me mr gilbey  knox dont be vulgar girl remember your new position to juggins i suppose youre serious about this mrmr rudolph  juggins i propose with your permission to begin keeping company this afternoon if mrs gilbey can spare me  gilbey in a gust of envy to bobby itll be long enough before youll marry the sister of a duke you young goodfornothing  dora dont fret old dear rudolph will teach me highclass manners i call it quite a happy ending dont you lieutenant  duvallet in france it would be impossible but hereah kissing his hand la belle angleterre    epilogue  before the curtain the count dazed and agitated hurries to the 4 critics as they rise bored and weary from their seats  the count gentlemen do not speak to me i implore you to withhold your opinion i am not strong enough to bear it i could never have believed it is this a play is this in any sense of the word art is it agreeable can it conceivably do good to any human being is it delicate do such people really exist excuse me gentlemen i speak from a wounded heart there are private reasons for my discomposure this play implies obscure unjust unkind reproaches and menaces to all of us who are parents  trotter pooh you take it too seriously after all the thing has amusing passages dismiss the rest as impertinence  the count mr trotter it is easy for you to play the pococurantist trotter amazed repeats the first three syllables in his throat making a noise like a pheasant you see hundreds of plays every year but to me who have never seen anything of this kind before the effect of this play is terribly disquieting sir if it had been what people call an immoral play i shouldnt have minded a bit vaughan is shocked love beautifies every romance and justifies every audacity bannal assents gravely but there are reticences which everybody should respect there are decencies too subtle to be put into words without which human society would be unbearable people could not talk to one another as those people talk no child could speak to its parentno girl could speak to a youthno human creature could tear down the veils appealing to vaughan who is on his left flank with gunn between them could they sir  vaughan well i dont see that  the count you dont see it dont feel it to gunn sir i appeal to you  gunn with studied weariness it seems to me the most ordinary sort of oldfashioned ibsenite drivel  the count turning to trotter who is on his right between him and bannal mr trotter will you tell me that you are not amazed outraged revolted wounded in your deepest and holiest feelings by every word of this play every tone every implication that you did not sit there shrinking in every fibre at the thought of what might come next  trotter not a bit any clever modern girl could turn out that kind of thing by the yard  the count then sir tomorrow i start for venice never to return i must believe what you tell me i perceive that you are not agitated not surprised not concerned that my own horror yes gentlemen horrorhorror of the very soul appears unaccountable to you ludicrous absurd even to you mr trotter who are little younger than myself sir if young people spoke to me like that i should die of shame i could not face it i must go back the world has passed me by and left me accept the apologies of an elderly and no doubt ridiculous admirer of the art of a bygone day when there was still some beauty in the world and some delicate grace in family life but i promised my daughter your opinion and i must keep my word gentlemen you are the choice and master spirits of this age you walk through it without bewilderment and face its strange products without dismay pray deliver your verdict mr bannal you know that it is the custom at a court martial for the youngest officer present to deliver his judgment first so that he may not be influenced by the authority of his elders you are the youngest what is your opinion of the play  bannal well whos it by  the count that is a secret for the present  bannal you dont expect me to know what to say about a play when i dont know who the author is do you  the count why not  bannal why not why not suppose you had to write about a play by pinero and one by jones would you say exactly the same thing about them  the count i presume not  bannal then how could you write about them until you knew which was pinero and which was jones besides what sort of play is this thats what i want to know is it a comedy or a tragedy is it a farce or a melodrama is it repertory theatre tosh or really straight paying stuff  gunn cant you tell from seeing it  bannal i can see it all right enough but how am i to know how to take it is it serious or is it spoof if the author knows what his play is let him tell us what it is if he doesnt he cant complain if i dont know either im not the author  the count but is it a good play mr bannal thats a simple question  bannal simple enough when you know if its by a good author its a good play naturally that stands to reason who is the author tell me that and ill place the play for you to a hairs breadth  the count im sorry im not at liberty to divulge the authors name the author desires that the play should be judged on its merits  bannal but what merits can it have except the authors merits who would you say its by gunn  gunn well who do you think here you have a rotten oldfashioned domestic melodrama acted by the usual stage puppets the heros a naval lieutenant all melodramatic heroes are naval lieutenants the heroine gets into trouble by defying the law if she didnt get into trouble thered be no drama and plays for sympathy all the time as hard as she can her good old pious mother turns on her cruel father when hes going to put her out of the house and says shell go too then theres the comic relief the comic shopkeeper the comic shopkeepers wife the comic footman who turns out to be a duke in disguise and the young scapegrace who gives the author his excuse for dragging in a fast young woman all as old and stale as a fried fish shop on a winter morning  the count but  gunn interrupting him i know what youre going to say count youre going to say that the whole thing seems to you to be quite new and unusual and original the naval lieutenant is a frenchman who cracks up the english and runs down the french the hackneyed old shaw touch the characters are secondrate middle class instead of being dukes and millionaires the heroine gets kicked through the mud real mud theres no plot all the old stage conventions and puppets without the old ingenuity and the old enjoyment and a feeble air of intellectual pretentiousness kept up all through to persuade you that if the author hasnt written a good play its because hes too clever to stoop to anything so commonplace and you three experienced men have sat through all this and cant tell me who wrote it why the play bears the authors signature in every line  bannal who  gunn granville barker of course why old gilbey is straight out of the madras house  bannal poor old barker  vaughan utter nonsense cant you see the difference in style  bannal no  vaughan contemptuously do you know what style is  bannal well i suppose youd call trotters uniform style but its not my stylesince you ask me  vaughan to me its perfectly plain who wrote that play to begin with its intensely disagreeable therefore its not by barrie in spite of the footman whos cribbed from the admirable crichton he was an earl you may remember you notice too the authors offensive habit of saying silly things that have no real sense in them when you come to examine them just to set all the fools in the house giggling then what does it all come to an attempt to expose the supposed hypocrisy of the puritan middle class in england people just as good as the author anyhow with of course the inevitable improper female the mrs tanqueray iris and so forth well if you cant recognize the author of that youve mistaken your professions thats all i have to say  bannal why are you so down on pinero and what about that touch that gunn spotted the frenchmans long speech i believe its shaw  gunn rubbish  vaughan rot you may put that idea out of your head bannal poor as this play is theres the note of passion in it you feel somehow that beneath all the assumed levity of that poor waif and stray she really loves bobby and will be a good wife to him now ive repeatedly proved that shaw is physiologically incapable of the note of passion  bannal yes i know intellect without emotion thats right i always say that myself a giant brain if you ask me but no heart  gunn oh shut up bannal this crude medieval psychology of heart and brainshakespear would have called it liver and witsis really schoolboyish surely weve had enough of secondhand schopenhauer even such a playedout old back number as ibsen would have been ashamed of it heart and brain indeed  vaughan you have neither one nor the other gunn youre decadent  gunn decadent how i love that early victorian word  vaughan well at all events you cant deny that the characters in this play were quite distinguishable from one another that proves its not by shaw because all shaws characters are himself mere puppets stuck up to spout shaw its only the actors that make them seem different  bannal there can be no doubt of that everybody knows it but shaw doesnt write his plays as plays all he wants to do is to insult everybody all round and set us talking about him  trotter wearily and naturally here we are all talking about him for heavens sake let us change the subject  vaughan still my articles about shaw  gunn oh stow it vaughan drop it what ive always told you about shaw is  bannal there you go shaw shaw shaw do chuck it if you want to know my opinion about shaw   trotter       no please we dont                                               vaughan       shut your head bannal  yelling                                           gunn          oh do drop it           the deafened count puts his fingers in his ears and flies from the centre of the group to its outskirts behind vaughan  bannal sulkily oh very well sorry i spoke im sure   trotter       shaw                            beginning again  vaughan       shaw   simultaneously                           gunn          shaw    they are cut short by the entry of fanny through the curtains she is almost in tears  fanny coming between trotter and gunn im so sorry gentlemen and it was such a success when i read it to the cambridge fabian society  trotter miss odowda i was about to tell these gentlemen what i guessed before the curtain rose that you are the author of the play general amazement and consternation  fanny and you all think it beastly you hate it you think im a conceited idiot and that i shall never be able to write anything decent  she is almost weeping a wave of sympathy carries away the critics  vaughan no no why i was just saying that it must have been written by pinero didnt i gunn  fanny enormously flattered really  trotter i thought pinero was much too popular for the cambridge fabian society  fanny oh yes of course but stilloh did you really say that mr vaughan  gunn i owe you an apology miss odowda i said it was by barker  fanny radiant granville barker oh you couldnt really have thought it so fine as that  bannal i said bernard shaw  fanny oh of course it would be a little like bernard shaw the fabian touch you know  bannal coming to her encouragingly a jolly good little play miss odowda mind i dont say its like one of shakespearshamlet or the lady of lyons you knowbut still a firstrate little bit of work he shakes her hand  gunn following bannals example i also miss odowda capital charming he shakes hands  vaughan with maudlin solemnity only be true to yourself miss odowda keep serious give up making silly jokes sustain the note of passion and youll do great things  fanny you think i have a future  trotter you have a past miss odowda  fanny looking apprehensively at her father shshsh  the count a past what do you mean mr trotter  trotter to fanny you cant deceive me that bit about the police was real youre a suffraget miss odowda you were on that deputation  the count fanny is this true  fanny it is i did a month with lady constance lytton and im prouder of it than i ever was of anything or ever shall be again  trotter is that any reason why you should stuff naughty plays down my throat  fanny yes itll teach you what it feels like to be forcibly fed  the count she will never return to venice i feel now as i felt when the campanile fell  savoyard comes in through the curtains  savoyard to the count would you mind coming to say a word of congratulation to the company theyre rather upset at having had no curtain call  the count certainly certainly im afraid ive been rather remiss let us go on the stage gentlemen  the curtains are drawn revealing the last scene of the play and the actors on the stage the count savoyard the critics and fanny join them shaking hands and congratulating  the count whatever we may think of the play gentlemen im sure you will agree with me that there can be only one opinion about the acting  the critics hear hear they start the applause   ayot st lawrence march 1911
