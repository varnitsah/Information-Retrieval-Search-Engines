34739011	the making of religion  by andrew lang  ma lld st andrews  honorary fellow of merton college oxford sometime gifford lecturer in the university of st andrews  second edition 1900     to the principal of the university of st andrews   dear principal donaldson  i hope you will permit me to lay at the feet of the university of st andrews in acknowledgment of her lifelong kindnesses to her old pupil these chapters on the early history of religion they may be taken as representing the gifford lectures delivered by me though in fact they contain very little that was spoken from lord giffords chair i wish they were more worthy of an alma mater which fostered in the past the leaders of forlorn hopes that were destined to triumph and the friends of lost causes who fought bravely against fatepatrick hamilton cargill and argyll beaton and montrose and dundee  believe me  very sincerely yours  andrew lang                                       preface to the new edition  by the nature of things this book falls under two divisions the first eight chapters criticise the current anthropological theory of the origins of the belief in spirits chapters ixxvii again criticise the current anthropological theory as to how the notion of spirit once attained man arrived at the idea of a supreme being these two branches of the topic are treated in most modern works concerned with the origins of religion such as mr tylers primitive culture mr herbert spencers principles of sociology mr jevonss introduction to the history of religion the late mr grant allens evolution of the idea of god and many others yet i have been censured for combining in this work the two branches of my subject and the second part has been regarded as but faintly connected with the first  the reason for this criticism seems to be that while one small set of students is interested in and familiar with the themes examined in the first part namely the psychological characteristics of certain mental states from which in part the doctrine of spirits is said to have arisen that set of students neither knows nor cares anything about the matter handled in the second part this group of students is busied with psychical research and the obscure human faculties implied in alleged cases of hallucination telepathy double personality human automatism clairvoyance and so on meanwhile anthropological readers are equally indifferent as to that branch of psychology which examines the conditions of hysteria hypnotic trance double personality and the like anthropologists have not hitherto applied to the savage mental conditions out of which in part the doctrine of spirits arose the recent researches of french german and english psychologists of the new school as to whether these researches into abnormal psychological conditions do or do not indicate the existence of a transcendental region of human faculty anthropologists appear to be unconcerned the only english exception known to me is mr tylor and his great work primitive culture was written thirty years ago before the modern psychological studies of professor william james dr romaine newbold m richet dr janet professor sidgwick mr myers mr gurney dr parish and many others had commenced  anthropologists have gone on discussing the trances and visions and socalled demoniacal possession of savages as if no new researches into similar facts in the psychology of civilised mankind existed or if they existed threw any glimmer of light on the abnormal psychology of savages i have on the other hand thought it desirable to sketch out a study of savage psychology in the light of recent psychological research thanks to this daring novelty the book has been virtually taken as two books anthropologists have criticised the second part and one or two psychical researchers have criticised the first part each school leaving one part severely alone such are the natural results of a too restricted specialism  even to psychical researchers the earlier division is of scant interest because witnesses to successful abnormal or supernormal faculty in savages cannot be brought into court and crossexamined but i do not give anecdotes of such savage successes as evidence to facts they are only illustrations and evidence to beliefs and methods as of crystal gazing and automatic utterances of secondary personality which among the savages correspond to the supposed facts examined by psychical research among the civilised i only point out as bastian had already pointed out the existence of a field that deserves closer study by anthropologists who can observe savages in their homes we need persons trained in the psychological laboratories of europe and america as members of anthropological expeditions it may be noted that in his letters from the south seas mr louis stevenson makes some curious observations especially on a singular form of hypnotism applied to himself with fortunate results the method used in native medicine was novel and the results were entirely inexplicable to mr stevenson who had not been amenable to european hypnotic practice but he was not a trained expert  anthropology must remain incomplete while it neglects this field whether among wild or civilised men in the course of time this will come to be acknowledged it will be seen that we cannot really account for the origin of the belief in spirits while we neglect the scientific study of those psychical conditions as of hallucination and the hypnotic trance in which that belief must probably have had some at least of its origins  as to the second part of the book i have argued that the first dim surmises as to a supreme being need not have arisen as on the current anthropological theory in the notion of spirits at all see chapter xi here i have been said to draw a mere verbal distinction but no distinction can be more essential if such a supreme being as many savages acknowledge is not envisaged by them as a spirit then the theories and processes by which he is derived from a ghost of a dead man are invalid and remote from the point as to the origin of a belief in a kind of germinal supreme being say the australian baiame i do not in this book offer any opinion i again and again decline to offer an opinion critics none the less have said that i attribute the belief to revelation i shall therefore here indicate what i think probable in so obscure a field  as soon as man had the idea of making things he might conjecture as to a maker of things which he himself had not made and could not make he would regard this unknown maker as a magnified nonnatural man these speculations appear to me to need less reflection than the long and complicated processes of thought by which mr tylor believes and probably believes with justice the theory of spirits to have been evolved see chapter iii this conception of a magnified nonnatural man who is a maker being given his power would be recognised and fancy would clothe one who had made such useful things with certain other moral attributes as of fatherhood goodness and regard for the ethics of his children these ethics having been developed naturally in the evolution of social life in all this there is nothing mystical nor anything as far as i can see beyond the limited mental powers of any beings that deserve to be called human  but i hasten to add that another theory may be entertained since this book was written there appeared the native tribes of central australia by professor spencer and mr gillen a most valuable study1 the authors closely scrutinising the esoteric rites of the arunta and other tribes in central australia found none of the moral precepts and attributes which according to mr howitt to whom their work is dedicated prevail in the mysteries of the natives of new south wales and victoria see chapter x what they found was a belief in the great spirit twanyirika who is believed by uninitiated boys and women but apparently not by adults to preside over the cruel rites of tribal initiation2 no more is said no myths about the great spirit are given he is dismissed in a brief note now if these ten lines contain all the native lore of twanyirika he is a mere bugbear not believed in apparently by adults but invented by them to terrorise the women and boys next granting that the information of messrs spencer and gillen is exhaustive and granting that as mr jg frazer holds in his essays in the fortnightly review april and may 1899 the arunta are the most primitive of mortals it will seem to follow that the moral attributes of baiame and other gods of other australian regions are later accretions round the form of an original and confessed bugbear as among the primitive arunta a bogle of the nursery in the phrase repudiated by maitland of lethington though not otherwise conspicuously more civilised than the arunta except perhaps in marriage relations mr howitts south eastern natives will have improved the arunta confessed bogle into a beneficent and moral father and maker religion will have its origin in a tribal joke and will have become not diablement but divinement chang√©e en route readers of messrs spencer and gillen will see that the arunta philosophy primitive or not is of a high ingenuity and so artfully composed that it contains no room either for a supreme being or for the doctrine of the survival of the soul with a future of rewards and punishments opinions declared to be extant among other australian tribes there is no creator and every soul after death is reincarnated in a new member of the tribe on the other hand granting that the brief note on twanyirika is exhaustive the arunta in their isolation may have degenerated in religion and may have dropped in the case of twanyirika the moral attributes of baiame it may be noticed that in south eastern australia the being who presides like twanyirika over initiations is not the supreme being but a son or deputy of his such as the kurnai tundun we do not know whether the arunta have or have had and lost or never possessed a being superior to twanyirika  with regard to all such moral and in certain versions creative beings as baiame criticism has taken various lines there is the high a priori line that savage minds are incapable of originating the notion of a moral maker i have already said that the notion in an early form seems to be well within the range of any minds deserving to be called human next the facts are disputed i can only refer readers to the authorities cited they speak for tribes in many quarters of the world and the witnesses are laymen as well as missionaries i am accused again of using a misleading rhetoric and of thereby covertly introducing christian or philosophical ideas into my account of savages guiltless of christian teaching as to the latter point i am also accused of mistaking for native opinions the results of christian teaching one or other charge must fall to the ground as to my rhetoric in the use of such words as creator eternal and the like i shall later qualify and explain it for a long discussion between myself and mr sidney hartland involving minute detail i may refer the reader to folklore the last number of 1898 and the first of 1899 and to the introduction to the new edition of my myth ritual and religion 1899  where relatively high moral attributes are assigned to a being i have called the result religion where the same being acts like zeus in greek fable plays silly or obscene tricks is lustful and false i have spoken of myth3 these distinctions of myth and religion may be and indeed are called arbitrary the whole complex set of statements about the being good or bad sublime or silly are equally myths it may be urged very well but one set the loftier set is fitter to survive and does survive in what we still commonly call religion while the other set the puerile set of statements is fairly near to extinction and is usually called mythology one set has been the root of a goodly tree the other set is being lopped off like the parasitic mistletoe  i am arguing that the two classes of ideas arise from two separate human moods moods as different and distinct as lust and love i am arguing that as far as our information goes the nobler set of ideas is as ancient as the lower personally though we cannot have direct evidence i find it easy to believe that the loftier notions are the earlier if man began with the conception of a powerful and beneficent maker or father then i can see how the humorous savage fancy ran away with the idea of power and attributed to a potent being just such tricks as a waggish and libidinous savage would like to play if he could moreover i have actually traced in myth ritual and religion some plausible processes of mythical accretion the early mind was not only religious in its way but scientific in its way it embraced the idea of evolution as well as the idea of creation to one mood a maker seemed to exist but the institution of totemism whatever its origin suggested the idea of evolution for men it was held developed out of their totemsanimals and plants but then on the other hand zeus or baiame or mungunngaur was regarded as their father how were these contradictions to be reconciled easily thus zeus was the father but in each case was the father by an amour in which he wore the form of the totemsnake swan bull ant dog or the like at once a degraded set of secondary erotic myths cluster around zeus  again it is notoriously the nature of man to attribute every institution to a primal inventor or legislator men then find themselves performing certain rites often of a buffooning or scandalous character and in origin mainly magical intended for the increase of game edible plants or later for the benefit of the crops why do they perform these rites they ask and looking about as usual for a primal initiator they attribute what they do to a primal being the corn spirit demeter or to zeus or to baiame or manabozho or punjel this is mans usual way of going back to origins instantly then a new set of parasitic myths crystallises round a being who perhaps was originally moral the savage mind in short has not maintained itself on the high level any more than the facetious mediaeval myths maintained themselves say on the original level of the conception of the character of st peter the keeper of the keys of heaven  all this appears perfectly natural and human and in this and in other ways what we call low myth may have invaded the higher realms of religion a lower invaded a higher element but reverse the hypothesis conceive that zeus or baiame was originally not a father and guardian but a lewd and tricky ghost of a medicineman a dancer of indecent dances a wooer of other mens wives a shapeshifter a burlesque droll a more jocular bugbear like twanyirika by what means did he come to be accredited later with his loftiest attributes and with regard for the tribal ethics which in practice he daily broke and despised students who argue for the possible priority of the lowest or as i call them mythical attributes of the being must advance an hypothesis of the concretion of the nobler elements around the original wanton and mischievous ghost  then let us suppose that the arunta twanyirika a confessed bugbear discredited by adults and only invented to keep women and children in order was the original germ of the moral and fatherly baiame of south eastern australian tribes how in that case did the adults of the tribe fall into their own trap come to believe seriously in their invented bugbear and credit him with the superintendence of such tribal ethics as generosity and unselfishness what were the processes of the conversion of twanyirika i do not deny that this theory may be correct but i wish to see an hypothesis of the process of elevation  i fail to frame such an hypothesis grant that the adults merely chuckle over twanyirika whose voice they themselves produce by whirling the wooden tundun or bullroarer grant that on initiation the boys learn that the great spirit is a mere bogle invented to mystify the women and keep them away from the initiatory rites how then did men come to believe in him as a terrible allseeing allknowing creative and potent moral being for this undeniably is the belief of many australian tribes where his voice or rather that of his subordinate is produced by whirling the tundun that these higher beliefs are of european origin mr howitt denies how were they evolved out of the notion of a confessed artificial bogle i am unable to frame a theory  from my point of view namely that the higher and simple ideas may well be the earlier i have at least offered a theory of the processes by which the lower attributes crystallised around a conception supposed argumenti gratia to be originally high other processes of degradation would come in as on my theory the creed and practice of animism or worship of human ghosts often of low character swamped and invaded the prior belief in a fairly moral and beneficent but not originally spiritual being my theory at least is a theory and rightly or wrongly accounts for the phenomenon the combination of the highest divine and the lowest animal qualities in the same being but i have yet to learn how if the lowest myths are the earliest the highest attributes came in time to be conferred on the hero of the lowest myths why or how did a silly buffoon or a confessed bogle arrive at being regarded as a patron of such morality as had been evolved an hypothesis of the processes involved must be indicated it is not enough to reply in general that the rudimentary human mind is illogical and confused that is granted but there must have been a method in its madness what that method was from my point of view i have shown and it must be as easy for opponents to set forth what from their point of view the method was  we are here concerned with what since the time of the earliest greek philosophers has been the crux of mythology why are infamous myths told about the father of gods and men we can easily explain the nature of the myths they are the natural flowers of savage fancy and humour but wherefore do they crystallise round zeus i have at least shown some probable processes in the evolution  where criticism has not disputed the facts of the moral attributes now attached to say an australian being it has accounted for them by a supposed process of borrowing from missionaries and other europeans in this book i deal with that hypothesis as urged by sir ab ellis in west africa chapter xiii i need not have taken the trouble as this distinguished writer had already in a work which i overlooked formally withdrawn as regards africa his theory of loangods miss kingsley too is no believer in the borrowing hypothesis for west africa in regard that is to the highest divine conception i was when i wrote unaware that especially as concerns america and australia mr tylor had recently advocated the theory of borrowing journal of anthrop institute vol xxi to mr tylors arguments when i read them i replied in the nineteenth century january 1899 are savage gods borrowed from missionaries i do not here repeat my arguments but await the publication of mr tylors gifford lectures in which his hypothesis may be reinforced and may win my adhesion  it may here be said however that if the australian higher religious ideas are of recent and missionary origin they would necessarily be known to the native women from whom in fact they are absolutely concealed by the men under penalty of death again if the son or sons of australian chief beings resemble part of the christian dogma they much more closely resemble the apollo and hermes of greece4 but nobody will say that the australians borrowed them from greek mythology  in chapter xiv owing to a bibliographical error of my own i have done injustice to mr tylor by supposing him to have overlooked stracheys account of the virginian god ahone he did not overlook ahone but mistrusted strachey in an excursus on ahone in the new edition of myth ritual and religion i have tried my best to elucidate the bibliography and other aspects of stracheys account which i cannot regard as baseless mr tylors opinion is doubtless different and may prove more persuasive as to australia mr howitt our best authority continues to disbelieve in the theory of borrowing  i have to withdraw in chapters x xi the statement that darumulun never died at all mr hartland has corrected me and pointed out that among the wiraijuri a myth represents him as having been destroyed for his offences by baiame in that tribe however darumulun is not the highest but a subordinate being mr hartland has also collected a few myths in which australian supreme beings do contrary to my statement set the example of sinning nothing can surprise me less and i only wonder that in so savage a race the examples hitherto collected are so rare and so easily to be accounted for on the theory of processes of crystallisation of myths already suggested  as to a remark in appendix b mr podmore takes a distinction i quote his remark the phenomena described are quite inexplicable by ordinary mechanical means and i contrast this as illogical with his opinion that a girl may have been directly responsible for all that took place mr podmore replies that what was described is not necessarily identical with what occurred strictly speaking he is right but the evidence was copious was given by many witnesses and as offered by me was in part contemporary being derived from the local newspapers so that here mr podmores theory of illusions of memory on a large scale developed in the five weeks which elapsed before he examined the spectators is out of court the evidence was of contemporary published record  the handling of fire by home is accounted for by mr podmore in the same chapter as the result of homes use of a nonconducting substance asked what substance he answered asbestos sir william crookes again repeating his account of the performance which he witnessed says home took up a lump of redhot charcoal about twice the size of an egg into his hand on which certainly no asbestos was visible he blew into his hands and the flames could be seen coming out between his fingers and he carried the charcoal round the room5 sir w crookes stood close beside home the light was that of the fire and of two candles probably sir william could see a piece of asbestos if it was covering homes hands which he was watching  what i had to say by way of withdrawal qualification explanation or otherwise i inserted in order to seize the earliest opportunity in the introduction to the recent edition of my myth ritual and religion 1899 the reader will perhaps make his own kind deductions from my rhetoric when i talk for example about a creator in the creed of low savages they have no business anthropologists declare to entertain so large an idea but in the journal of the anthropological institute ns ii nos 1 2 p 85 dr bennett gives an account of the religion of the cannibal fangs of the congo first described by du chaillu these anthropophagi have some idea of a god a superior being their tata father a bo mam merere he made all things anyambi is their tata father and ranks above all other fang gods because ane yap literally he lives in heaven this is inconsiderate in the fangs a set of native cannibals have no business with a creative father who is in heaven i say creative because he made all things and as the bowler said about a yorker what else can you call him in all such cases where creator and creative are used by me readers will allow for the imperfections of the english language as anthropologists say the savages simply cannot have the corresponding ideas and i must throw the blame on people who knowing the savages and their language assure us that they have this fang father or tata is considered indifferent to the wants and sufferings of men women and children offerings and prayers are therefore made not to him but to the ghosts of parents who are more accessible this additional information precisely illustrates my general theory that the chief being was not evolved out of ghosts but came to be neglected as ghostworship arose i am not aware that dr bennett is a missionary anthropologists distrust missionaries and most of my evidence is from laymen if the anthropological study of religion is to advance the high and usually indolent chief beings of savage religions must be carefully examined not consigned to a casual page or paragraph i have found them most potent and most moral where ghostworship has not been evolved least potent or at all events most indifferent where ghostworship is most in vogue the inferences granting the facts are fatal to the current anthropological theory  the phrases creator creative as applied to anyambi or baiame have been described by critics as rhetorical covertly introducing conceptions of which savages are incapable i have already shown that i only follow my authorities and their translations of phrases in various savage tongues but the phrase eternal applied to anyambi or baiame may be misleading i do not wish to assert that if you talked to a savage about eternity he would understand what you intend i merely mean what mariner says that the tongans mean as to the god t√°liy tooboo of his origin they had no idea rather supposing him to be eternal the savage theologians assert no beginning for such beings as a rule and no end except where unkulunkulu is by some zulus thought to be dead and where the wiraijuris declare that their darumulun not supreme was destroyed by baiame i do not wish to credit savages with thoughts more abstract than they possess but that their thought can be abstract is proved even in the case of the absolutely primitive arunta by their myth of the ungambikula a word which means out of nothing or selfexisting say messrs spencer and gillen6 once more i find that i have spoken of some savage beings as omnipresent and omnipotent but i have pointed out that this is only a modern metaphysical rendering of the actual words attributed to the savage he can go everywhere and do everything as to the phrase also used that baiame for example makes for righteousness i mean that he sanctions the morality of his people for instance sanctions veracity and unselfishness as mr howitt distinctly avers these are examples of righteousness in conduct i do not mean that these virtues were impressed on savages in some supernatural way as a critic has daringly averred that i do the strong reaction of some early men against the cosmical process by which the weakest goes to the wall is indeed a curious moral phenomenon and deserves the attention of moralists but i never dreamed of supposing that this reaction which extends beyond the limit of the tribe or group had a supernatural origin it has been argued that tribal morality is only a set of regulations based on the convenience of the elders of the tribe is in fact as the platonic thrasymachus says the interest of the strongest that does not appear to me to be demonstrated but this is no place for a discussion of the origin of morals the interest of the strongest and of the nomadic group would be to knock elderly invalids on the head but dampier says of the australians in 1688 be it little or be it much they get every one has his part as well the young and tender and the old and feeble who are not able to go abroad as the strong and lusty the origin of this fair and generous dealing may be obscure but it is precisely the kind of dealing on which according to mr howitt the religion of the kurnai insists chapter x thus the being concerned does make for righteousness  with these explanations i trust that my rhetorical use of such phrases as eternal creative omniscient omnipotent omnipresent and moral may not be found to mislead or covertly to import modern or christian ideas into my account of the religious conceptions of savages  as to the evidence throughout a learned historian has informed me that no anthropological evidence is of any value if so there can be no anthropology in the realm of institutions but the evidence that i adduce is from such sources as anthropologists at least accept and employ in the construction of theories from which in some points i venture to dissent  al  footnote 1 macmillans 1899  footnote 2 op cit p 246 note  footnote 3 see the new edition of myth ritual and religion especially the new introduction  footnote 4 see

cannot omit the opportunity of thanking mr frederic myers for his kindness in reading the proof sheets of the earlier chapters and suggesting some corrections of statement mr myers however is probably not in agreement with the author on certain points for example in the chapter on possession as the second part of the book differs considerably from the opinions which have recommended themselves to most anthropological writers on early religion the author must say here as he says later that no harm can come of trying how facts look from a new point of view and that he certainly did not expect

    the making of religion  i  introductory chapter  the modern science of the history of religion has attained conclusions which already possess an air of being firmly established these conclusions may be briefly stated thus man derived the conception of spirit or soul from his reflections on the phenomena of sleep dreams death shadow and from the experiences of trance and hallucination worshipping first the departed souls of his kindred man later extended the doctrine of spiritual beings in many directions ghosts or other spiritual existences fashioned on the same lines prospered till they became gods finally as the result of a variety of processes one of these gods became supreme and at last was regarded as the one only god meanwhile man retained his belief in the existence of his own soul surviving after the death of the body and so reached the conception of immortality thus the ideas of god and of the soul are the result of early fallacious reasonings about misunderstood experiences  it may seem almost wanton to suggest the desirableness of revising a system at once so simple so logical and apparently so well bottomed on facts but there can never be any real harm in studying masses of evidence from fresh points of view at worst the failure of adverse criticism must help to establish the doctrines assailed now as we shall show there are two points of view from which the evidence as to religion in its early stages has not been steadily contemplated therefore we intend to ask first what if anything can be ascertained as to the nature of the visions and hallucinations which according to mr tylor in his celebrated work primitive culture lent their aid to the formation of the idea of spirit secondly we shall collect and compare the accounts which we possess of the high gods and creative beings worshipped or believed in by the most backward races we shall then ask whether these relatively supreme beings so conceived of by men in very rudimentary social conditions can be as anthropology declares mere developments from the belief in ghosts of the dead  we shall end by venturing to suggest that the savage theory of the soul may be based at least in part on experiences which cannot at present be made to fit into any purely materialistic system of the universe we shall also bring evidence tending to prove that the idea of god in its earliest known shape need not logically be derived from the idea of spirit however that idea itself may have been attained or evolved the conception of god then need not be evolved out of reflections on dreams and ghosts  if these two positions can be defended with any success it is obvious that the whole theory of the science of religion will need to be reconsidered but it is no less evident that our two positions do not depend on each other the first may be regarded as fantastic or improbable or may be masked and left on one side but the strength of the second position derived from evidence of a different character will not therefore be in any way impaired our first position can only be argued for by dint of evidence highly unpopular in character and as a general rule condemned by modern science the evidence is obtained by what is at all events a legitimate anthropological proceeding we may follow mr tylors example and collect savage beliefs about visions hallucinations clairvoyance and the acquisition of knowledge apparently not attainable through the normal channels of sense we may then compare these savage beliefs with attested records of similar experiences among living and educated civilised men even if we attain to no conclusion or a negative conclusion as to the actuality and supernormal character of the alleged experiences still to compare data of savage and civilised psychology or even of savage and civilised illusions and fables is decidedly part though a neglected part of the function of anthropological science the results whether they do or do not strengthen our first position must be curious and instructive if only as a chapter in the history of human error that chapter too is concerned with no mean topic but with what we may call the x region of our nature out of that region out of miracle prophecy vision have certainly come forth the great religions christianity and islam and the great religious innovators and leaders our lord himself st francis john knox jeanne darc down to the founder of the new faith of the sioux and arapahoe it cannot then be unscientific to compare the barbaric with the civilised beliefs and experiences about a region so dimly understood and so fertile in potent influences here the topic will be examined rather by the method of anthropology than of psychology we may conceivably have something to learn as has been the case before from the rough observations and hasty inferences of the most backward races  we may illustrate this by an anecdote  the northern indians call the aurora borealis edthin that is deer their ideas in this respect are founded on a principle one would not imagine experience has shown them that when a hairy deerskin is briskly stroked with the hand on a dark night it will emit many sparks of electrical fire  so says hearne in his journey published in 1795 p 346  this observation of the red men is a kind of parable representing a part of the purport of the following treatise the indians making a hasty inference from a trivial phenomenon arrived unawares at a probably correct conclusion long unknown to civilised science they connected the aurora borealis with electricity supposing that multitudes of deer in the sky rubbed the sparks out of each other meanwhile even in the last century a puzzled populace spoke of the phenomenon as lord derwentwaters lights the cosmic pomp and splendour shone to welcome the loyal derwentwater into heaven when he had given his life for his exiled king  now my purpose in the earlier portion of this essay is to suggest that certain phenomena of human nature apparently as trivial as the sparks rubbed out of a deers hide in a dark night may indicate and may be allied to a force or forces which like the aurora borealis may shine from one end of the heavens to the other strangely illumining the darkness of our destiny such phenomena science has ignored as it so long ignored the sparks from the stroked deerskin and the attractive power of rubbed amber these trivial things were not known to be allied to the lightning or to indicate a force which man could tame and use but just as the indians by a rapid careless inference attributed the aurora borealis to electric influences so as anthropology assures us savages everywhere have inferred the existence of soul or spirit intelligence that    does not know the bond of time   nor wear the manacles of space  in part from certain apparently trivial phenomena of human faculty these phenomena as mr tylor says the great intellectual movement of the last two centuries has simply thrown aside as worthless1 i refer to alleged experiences merely odd sporadic and for commercial purposes useless such as the transference of thought from one mind to another by no known channel of sense the occurrence of hallucinations which prima facie correspond coincidentally with unknown events at a distance all that is called second sight or clairvoyance and other things even more obscure reasoning on these real or alleged phenomena and on other quite normal and accepted facts of dream shadow sleep trance and death savages have inferred the existence of spirit or soul exactly as the indians arrived at the notion of electricity not so called by them of course as the cause of the aurora borealis but just as the indians thought that the cosmic lights were caused by the rubbing together of crowded deer in the heavens a theory quite childishly absurd so the savage has expressed in rude fantastic ways his conclusion as to the existence of spirit he believes in wandering separable souls of men surviving death and he has peopled with his dreams the whole inanimate universe  my suggestion is that in spite of his fantasies the savage had possibly drawn from his premises an inference not wholly or not demonstrably erroneous as the sparks of the deerskin indicated electricity so the strange lights in the night of human nature may indicate faculties which science till of late and in a few instances has laughed at ignored thrown aside as worthless  it should be observed that i am not speaking of spiritualism a word of the worst associations inextricably entangled with fraud bad logic and the blindest credulity some of the phenomena alluded to have however been claimed as their own province by spiritists and need to be rescued from them mr tylor writes  the issue raised by the comparison of savage barbaric and civilised spiritualism is this do the red indian medicineman the tatar necromancer the highland ghostseer and the boston medium share the possession of belief and knowledge of the highest truth and import which nevertheless the great intellectual movement of the last two centuries has simply thrown aside as worthless  distinguo that does not seem to me to be the issue in my opinion the issue is have the red indian the tatar the highland seer and the boston medium the least reputable of the menagerie observed and reasoned wildly from and counterfeited and darkened with imposture certain genuine byproducts of human faculty which do not prima facie deserve to be thrown aside  that i venture to think is the real issue that science may toss aside as worthless some valuable observations of savages is now universally admitted by people who know the facts among these observations is the whole topic of hypnotism with the use of suggestion for healing purposes and the phenomena no longer denied of alternating personalities for the truth of this statement we may appeal to one of the greatest of continental anthropologists adolf bastian2 the missionaries like livingstone usually supposed that the savage seers declared ignorance after his socalled fit of inspirationof what occurred in that state was an imposture but nobody now doubts the similar oblivion of what has passed that sometimes follows the analogous hypnotic sleep of a remarkable cure which the school of the salp√™tri√®re or nancy would ascribe with probable justice to suggestion a savage example will be given later  savage hypnotism and suggestion among the sioux and arapahoe has been thought worthy of a whole volume in the reports of the ethnological bureau of the smithsonian institute washington us 189298 republican governments publish scientific matter regardless of expense and the essential points might have been put more shortly they illustrate the fact that only certain persons can hypnotise others and throw light on some peculiarities of rapport3 in brief savages anticipated us in the modern science of experimental psychology as is frankly acknowledged by the society for experimental psychology of berlin that many mystical phenomena are much more common and prominent among savages than among ourselves is familiar to everyone acquainted with the subject the ethnological side of our inquiry demands penetrative study4  that study i am about to try to sketch my object is to examine some superstitious practices and beliefs of savages by aid of the comparative method i shall compare as i have already said the ethnological evidence for savage usages and beliefs analogous to thoughttransference coincidental hallucinations alternating personality and so forth with the best attested modern examples experimental or spontaneous this raises the question of our evidence which is allimportant we proceed to defend it the savage accounts are on the level of much anthropological evidence they may that is be dismissed by adversaries as travellers tales but the best testimony for the truth of the reports as to actual belief in the facts is the undesigned coincidence of evidence from all ages and quarters5 when the stories brought by travellers ancient and modern learned and unlearned pious or sceptical agree in the main we have all the certainty that anthropology can offer again when we find practically the same strange neglected sparks not only rumoured of in european popular superstition but attested in many hundreds of depositions made at first hand by respectable modern witnesses educated and responsible we cannot honestly or safely dismiss the coincidence of report as indicating a mere survival of savage superstitious belief and nothing more  we can no longer do so it is agreed in the case of hypnotic phenomena i hope to make it seem possible that we should not do so in the matter of the hallucinations provoked by gazing in a smooth deep usually styled crystalgazing ethnologically this practice is at least as old as classical times and is of practically worldwide distribution i shall prove its existence in australia new zealand north america south america asia africa polynesia and among the incas not to speak of the middle and recent european ages the universal idea is that such visions may be clairvoyant to take a polynesian case resembling the hawaiian wai harru when anyone has been robbed the priest after praying has a hole dug in the floor of the house and filled with water then he gazes into the water over which the god is supposed to place the spirit of the thief the image of the thief was according to their account reflected in the water and being perceived by the priest he named the individual or the parties6 here the statement about the spirit is a mere savage philosophical explanation but the fact that hallucinatory pictures can really be seen by a fair percentage of educated europeans in water glass balls and so forth is now confirmed by frequent experiment and accepted by opponents nonmystical writers like dr parish of munich7 i shall bring evidence to suggest that the visions may correctly reflect as it were persons and places absolutely unknown to the gazer and that they may even reveal details unknown to every one present such results among savages or among the superstitious would be and are explained by the theory of spirits modern science has still to find an explanation consistent with recognised laws of nature but spirits we shall not invoke  in the same way i mean to examine all or most of the socalled mystical phenomena of savage life i then compare them with the better vouched for modern examples to return to the question of evidence i confess that i do not see how the adverse anthropologist psychologist or popular agnostic is to evade the following dilemma to the anthropologist we say the evidence we adduce is your own evidence that of books of travel in all lands and countries if you may argue from it so may we some of it is evidence to unusual facts more of it is evidence to singular beliefs which we think not necessarily without foundation as raising a presumption in favour of that opinion we cite examples in which savage observations of abnormal and once rejected facts are now admitted by science to have a large residuum of truth we argue that what is admitted in some cases may come to be admitted in more no a priori line can here be drawn  to the psychologist who objects that our modern instances are mere anecdotes we reply by asking dear sir what are your modern instances what do you know of mrs a whom you still persistently cite as an example of morbid recurrent hallucinations name the german servant girl who in a fever talked several learned languages which she had heard her former master a scholar declaim where did she live who vouches for her who heard her who understood her there is you know no evidence at all the anecdote is told by coleridge the phenomena are said by him to have been observed in a roman catholic town in germany a year or two before my arrival at g√∂ttingen many eminent physiologists and psychologists visited the town why do you not name a few out of the distinguished crowd8 this anecdote a rumour of a rumour of a protestant explanation of a catholic marvel was told by coleridge at least twenty years after the possible date the psychologists copy it9 one after the other as a flock of sheep jump where their leader has jumped an example by way of anecdote may be permitted  according to the current anthropological theory the idea of soul or spirit was suggested to early men by their experiences in dreams they seemed in sleep to visit remote places therefore they argued something within them was capable of leaving the body and wandering about  this something was the soul or spirit now it is obvious that this opinion of early men would be confirmed if they ever chanced to acquire in dreams knowledge of places which they had never visited and of facts as to which in their waking state they could have no information this experience indeed would suggest problems even to mr herbert spencer if it occurred to him  conversing on this topic with a friend of acknowledged philosophical eminence i illustrated my meaning by a story of a dream it was reported to me by the dreamer with whom i am well acquainted was of very recent occurrence and was corroborated by the evidence of another person to whom the dream was narrated before its fulfilment was discovered i am not at liberty to publish the details for good reasons but the essence of the matter was this a and b the dreamer had common interests a had taken certain steps about which b had only a surmise and a vague one that steps had probably been taken a then died and b in an extremely vivid dream a thing unfamiliar to him seemed to read a mass of unknown facts culminating in two definite results capable of being stated in figures these results by the very nature of the case could not be known to a so that before he was placed out of bs reach by death he could not have stated them to him and afterwards had assuredly no means of doing so  the dream two days after its occurrence and after it had been told to c proved to be literally correct now i am not asking the readers belief for this anecdote for that could only be yielded in virtue of knowledge of the veracity of b and c but i invite his attention to the psychological explanation my friend suggested that a had told b all about the affair that b had not listened though his interests were vitally concerned and that the crowd of curious details naturally unfamiliar to b had reposed in his subconscious memory and had been revived in the dream  now bs dream was a dream of reading a mass of minute details including names of places entirely unknown to him it may be admitted in accordance with the psychological theory that b might have received all this information from a but by dint of inattentionthe malady of not markingmight never have been consciously aware of what he heard then bs subconscious memory of what he did not consciously know might break upon him in his dream instances of similar mental phenomena are not uncommon but the general result of the combined details was one which could not possibly be known to a before his death nor to b could it be known at all yet bs dream represented this general result with perfect accuracy which cannot be accounted for by the revival of subconscious memory in sleep neither asleep nor awake can a man remember what it is impossible for him to have known the dream contained no prediction for the results were now fixed but granting the good faith of the narrator the dream did contain information not normally accessible  however by way of psychological explanation of the dream my friend cited coleridges legend as to the german girl and her unconscious knowledge of certain learned languages and what is the evidence for the truth of coleridges legend of course there is none or none known to all the psychologists who quote it from coleridge neither if true was the legend to the point however psychology will accept such unauthenticated narratives and yet will scoff at first baud duly corroborated testimony from living and honourable people about recent events  only a great force of prejudice can explain this acceptance by psychologists of one kind of marvellous tale on no evidence and this rejection of another class of marvellous tale when supported by first hand signed and corroborated evidence of living witnesses i see only one escape for psychologists from this dilemma their marvellous tales are possible though unvouched for because they have always heard them and repeated them in lectures and read and repeated them in books our marvellous tales are impossible because the psychologists know that they are impossible which means that they have not been familiar with them from youth upwards in lectures and manuals but man has no right to have clear ideas of the possible and impossible like faraday a priori except in the exact sciences there are other instances of weak evidence which satisfies psychologists  hamilton has an anecdote borrowed from monboddo who got it from mr hans stanley who about twentysix years ago heard it from the subject of the story madame de laval i have the memorandum somewhere in my papers says mr stanley vaguely then we have two american anecdotes by dr flint and mr rush and such is sir william hamiltons equipment of odd facts for discussing the unconscious or subconscious the least credible and worst attested of these narratives still appears in popular works on psychology moreover all psychology except experimental psychology is based on anecdotes which people tell about their own subjective experiences mr galton whose original researches are well known even offered rewards in money for such narratives about visualised rows of coloured figures and so on  clearly the psychologist then has no prima facie right to object to our anecdotes of experiences which he regards as purely subjective as evidence we only accept them at first hand and when possible the witnesses have been crossexamined personally our evidence then where it consists of travellers tales is on a level with that which satisfies the anthropologist where it consists of modern statements of personal experience our evidence is often infinitely better than much which is accepted by the nonexperimental psychologist as for the agnostic writer on the nonreligion of the future m guyau actually illustrates the resurrection of our lord by an american myth about a criminal of whom a hallucinatory phantasm appeared to each of his gaol companions separately and successively on a day after his execution for this prodigious fable no hint of reference to authority is given10 yet the evidence appears to satisfy m guyau and is used by him to reinforce his argument  the anthropologist and psychologist then must either admit that their evidence is no better than ours if as good or must say that they only believe evidence as to possible facts they thus constitute themselves judges of what is possible and practically regard themselves as omniscient science has had to accept so many things once scoffed at as impossible that this attitude of hers as we shall show in chapter ii ceases to command respect  my suggestion is that the trivial rejected or unheeded phenomena vouched for by the evidence here defended may not inconceivably be of considerable importance but stating the case at the lowest if we are only concerned with illusions and fables it cannot but be curious to note their persistent uniformity in savage and civilised life  to make the first of our two main positions clear and in part to justify ourselves in asking any attention for such matters we now offer an historical sketch of the relations

conference with the witch of endor he made an elementary attempt at a scientific test of the supernormal croesus the king went much further when he tested the clairvoyance of the oracles of greece by sending an embassy to ask what he was doing at a given hour on a given day and by then doing something very bizarre we do not know how the delphic oracle found out the right answer but various easy methods of fraud at once occur to the mind however the procedure of croesus if he took certain precautions was relatively scientific relatively scientific also was the inquiry of porphyry with whose position our own is not unlikely to be compared unable or reluctant to accept christianity porphyry sought after a sign of an element of supernormal truth in paganism but he began at the wrong end namely at pagan spiritualistic s√©ances with the usual accompaniments of darkness and fraud his perplexed letter to anebo with the reply attributed to iamblichus reveal porphyry wandering puzzled among mediums floating lights odd noises queer dubious physical phenomena he did not begin with accurate experiments as to the existence of rare and apparently supernormal human faculties and he seems to have attained no conclusion except that spirits are deceitful1  something more akin to modern research began about the time of the reformation and lasted till about 1680 the fury for burning witches led men of sense learning and humanity to ask whether there was any reality in witchcraft and generally in the marvels of popular belief the inquiries of thyraeus lavaterus bodinus wierus le loyer reginald scot and many others tended on the whole to the negative side as regards the wilder fables about witches but left the problems of ghosts and haunted houses pretty much where they were before it may be observed that lavaterus circ 1580 already put forth a form of the hypothesis of telepathy that ghosts are hallucinations produced by the direct action of one mind or brain upon another while thyraeus doubted whether the noises heard in haunted houses were not mere hallucinations of the sense of hearing but all these early writers like cardan were very careless of firsthand evidence and indeed preferred ghosts vouched for by classical authority pliny plutarch or suetonius with the rev joseph glanvil frs circ 1666 a more careful examination of evidence came into use among the marvels of glanvils and other tracts usually published together in his sadducismus triumphatus will be found letters which show that he and his friends like henry more and boyle laboured to collect firsthand evidence for second sight haunted houses ghosts and wraiths the confessed object was to procure a whip for the droll a reply to the laughing scepticism of the restoration the result was to bring on glanvil a throng of boreshe was worse haunted than mr mompessons house he saysand mr pepys found his arguments not very convincing mr pepys however was alarmed by our young gibcat which he mistook for a spright with henry more baxter and glanvil practically died for the time the attempt to investigate these topics scientifically though an impression of doubt was left on the mind of addison witchcraft ceased to win belief and was abolished as a crime in 1736 some of the scottish clergy and john wesley clung fondly to the old faith but wodrow and cotton mather about 17101730 were singularly careless and unlucky in producing anything like evidence for their narratives ghost stories continued to be told but not to be investigated  then one of the most acute of philosophers decided that investigation ought never to be attempted this scientific attitude towards x phenomena that of refusing to examine them and denying them without examination was fixed by david hume in his celebrated essay on miracles hume derided the observation and study of what he called miracles in the field of experience and he looked for an a priori argument which would for ever settle the question without examination of facts in an age of experimental philosophy which derided a priori methods this was humes great contribution to knowledge his famous argument the joy of many an honest breast is a tissue of fallacies which might be given for exposure to beginners in logic as an elementary exercise in announcing his discovery hume amusingly displays the selfcomplacency and the want of humour with which we scots are commonly charged by our critics  i flatter myself that i have discovered an argument which if just will with the wise and learned be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusions and consequently will be useful as long as the world endures  he does not expect however to convince the multitude till the end of the world accounts of miracles and prodigies i suppose will be found in all histories sacred and profane without saying here what he means by a miracle hume argues that experience is our only guide in reasoning he then defines a miracle as a violation of the laws of nature by a law of nature he means a uniformity not of all experience but of each experience as he will deign to admit while he excludes without examination all evidence for experience of the absence of such uniformity that kind of experience cannot be considered there must be a uniform experience against every miraculous event otherwise the event would not merit that appellation if there be any experience in favour of the event that experience does not count a miracle is counter to universal experience no event is counter to universal experience therefore no event is a miracle if you produce evidence to what hume calls a miracle we shall see examples he replies that the evidence is not valid unless its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact now no error of human evidence can be more miraculous than a miracle therefore there can be no valid evidence for miracles fortunately hume now gives an example of what he means by miracles he says  for first there is not to be found in all history any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men of such unquestioned good sense education and learning as to secure us against all delusion in themselves of such undoubted integrity as to place them beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others of such credit and reputation in the eyes of mankind as to have a great deal to lose in case of their being detected in any falsehood and at the same time attesting facts performed in such a public manner and in so celebrated a part of the world as to render the detection unavoidable all which circumstances are requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men2  hume added a note at the end of his book in which he contradicted every assertion which he had made in the passage just cited indeed be contradicted himself before he had written six pages  there surely never was a greater number of miracles ascribed to one person than those which were lately said to have been wrought in france upon the tomb of abb√© paris the famous jansenist with whose sanctity the people were so long deluded the curing of the sick giving hearing to the deaf and sight to the blind were everywhere talked of as the usual effects of that holy sepulchre but what is more extraordinary many of the miracles were immediately proved upon the spot before judges of unquestioned integrity attested by witnesses of credit and distinction in a learned age and on the most eminent theatre that is now in the world nor is this all a relation of them was published and dispersed everywhere nor were the jesuits though a learned body supported by the civil magistrate and determined enemies to those opinions in whose favour the miracles were said to have been wrought ever able distinctly to refute or detect them where shall we find such a number of circumstances agreeing to the corroboration of one fact and what have we to oppose to such a cloud of witnesses but the absolute impossibility or miraculous nature of the events which they relate and this surely in the eyes of all reasonable people will alone be regarded as a sufficient refutation  thus hume first denies the existence of such evidence given in such circumstances as he demands and then he produces an example of that very kind of evidence having done this he abandons as mr wallace observes his original assertion that the evidence does not exist and takes refuge in alleging the absolute impossibility of the events which the evidence supports thus hume poses as a perfect judge of the possible in a kind of omniscience he takes his stand on the uniformity of all experience that is not hostile to his idea of the possible and dismisses all testimony to other experience even when it reaches his standard of evidence he is remote indeed from virchows position that what we call the laws of nature must vary according to our frequent new experiences3 in his note hume buttresses and confirms his evidence for the jansenist miracles they have even a martyr m montgeron who wrote an account of the events and says hume lightly is now said to be somewhere in a dungeon on account of his book many of the miracles of the abb√© paris were proved immediately by witnesses before the bishops court at paris under the eye of cardinal noailles his successor was an enemy to the jansenists yet twentytwo cur√©s of paris  pressed him to examine these miracles  but he wisely forbore hume adds his testimony to the character of these cur√©s thus it is wisdom according to hume to dismiss the most public and wellattested miracles without examination this is experimental science of an odd kind  the phenomena were cases of healing many of them surprising of cataleptic rigidity and of insensibility to pain among visitors to the tomb of the abb√© paris 1731 had the cases been judicially examined all medical evidence was in their favour and had they been proved false the cause of hume would have profited enormously a strong presumption would have been raised against the miracles of christianity but hume applauds the wisdom of not giving his own theory this chance of a triumph the cataleptic seizures were of the sort now familiar to science these have therefore emerged from the miraculous in fact the phenomena which occurred at the tomb of the abb√© paris have emerged almost too far and now seem in danger of being too readily and too easily accepted in 1887 mm binet and f√©r√© of the school of the salp√™tri√®re published in english a popular manual styled animal magnetism these authors write with great caution about such alleged phenomena as the reading by the hypnotised patient of the thoughts in the mind of the hypnotiser but as to the phenomena at the tomb of the abb√© paris they say that suggestion explains them4 that is in the opinion of mm binet and f√©r√© the socalled miracles really occurred and were worked by the imagination by selfsuggestion  the most famous casethat of mlle coirinhas been carefully examined by dr charcot5  mlle coirin had a dangerous fall from her horse in september 1716 in her thirtyfirst year the medical details may be looked for in dr charcots essay or in montgeron6 her disease was diagnosed as cancer of the left breast the nipple fell off bodily amputation of the breast was proposed but madame coirin believing the disease to be radically incurable refused her consent paralysis of the left side set in 1718 the left leg shrivelling up on august 9 1731 mlle coirin tried the off chance of a miracle put on a shift that had touched the tomb of paris and used some earth from the grave on august 11 mlle coirin could turn herself in bed on the 12th the horrible wound was staunched and began to close up and heal the paralysed side recovered life and its natural proportions by september 3 mlle coirin could go out for a drive  all her malady says dr charcot paralysis cancer and all was hysterical hysterical oedema for which he quotes many french authorities and one american under the physical psychical influence brought to bear by the application of the shift  the oedema which was due to vasomotor trouble disappeared almost instantaneously the breast regained its normal size  dr charcot generously adds that shrines like lourdes have cured patients in whom he could not inspire the operation of the faith cure he certainly cannot explain everything which claims to be of supernatural origin in the faith cure we have to learn the lesson of patience i am among the first to recognise that shakespeares words hold good today    there are more things in heaven and earth horatio    than are dreamt of in your philosophy  if dr charcot had believed in what the french call suggestion mentale suggestion by thoughttransference which i think he did nothe could have explained the healing of the centurions servant say the word lord and my servant shall be healed by suggestion  distance telepathy and by premising that the servants palsy was hysterical but what do we mean by hysterical nobody knows the mind somehow causes gangrenes if not cancers paralysis shrinking of tissues the mind somehow cures them and what is the mind as my object is to give savage parallels to modern instances better vouched for i quote a singular red indian cure by suggestion hearne travelling in canada in 1770 met a native who had dead palsy affecting the whole of one side he was dragged on a sledge reduced to a mere skeleton and so was placed in the magic lodge the first step in his cure was the public swallowing by a conjurer of a board of wood about the size of a barrelstave twice as wide across as his mouth hearne stood beside the man naked as he was born and notwithstanding i was all attention i could not detect the deceit of course hearne believes that this was mere legerdemain and p 216 mentions a most suspicious circumstance the account is amusing and deserves the attention of mr neville maskelyne the same conjurer had previously swallowed a cradle now bayonet swallowing which he also did is possible though hearne denies it p 217  the real object of these preliminary feats however performed is probably to inspire faith which dr charcot might have done by swallowing a cradle the indians explain that the barrel staves apparently swallowed are merely dematerialised by spirits leaving only the forked end sticking out of the conjurers mouth in fact hearne caught the conjurer in the act of making a separate forked end  faith being thus inspired the conjurer for three entire days blew sang and danced round the poor paralytic fasting and it is truly wonderful though the strictest truth that when the poor man was taken from the conjuring house  he was able to move all the fingers and toes of the side that had been so long dead at the end of six weeks he went ahunting for his family p 219 hearne kept up his acquaintance and adds what is very curious that he developed almost a secondary personality before that dreadful paralytic stroke he had been distinguished for his good nature and benevolent disposition was entirely free from every appearance of avarice but after this event he was the most fractious quarrelsome discontented and covetous wretch alive p 220  dr charcot if he had been acquainted with this case would probably have said that it is of the nature of those which professor russell reynolds has classified under the head of paralysis dependent on idea7 unluckily hearne does not tell us how his hunter an untutored indian became paralysed by idea  dr charcot adds in every case science is a foe to systematic negation which the morrow may cause to melt away in the light of its new triumphs the present new triumph is a mere coincidence with the dicta of our lord thy faith hath made thee whole i have not found so great faith no not in israel there are cures as there are maladies caused by idea so in fact we had always understood but the point is that science wherever it agrees with david hume is not a foe but a friend to systematic negation  a parallel case of a miracle the stigmata of st francis was of course regarded by science as a fable or a fraud but now that blisters and other lesions can be produced by suggestion the fable has become a probable fact and therefore not a miracle at all8 mr james remarks as so often happens a fact is denied till a welcome interpretation comes with it then it is admitted readily enough and evidence quite insufficient to back a claim so long as the church had an interest in making it proves to be quite sufficient for modern scientific enlightenment the moment it appears that a reputed saint can thereby be claimed as a case of hysteroepilepsy9  but the church continues to have an interest in the matter as the class of facts which hume declined to examine begins to be gradually admitted by science the thing becomes clear the evidence which could safely convey these now admittedly possible facts say from the time of christ is so far proved to be not necessarily mythicalproved to be not incapable of carrying statements probably correct which once seemed absolutely false if so where precisely ends its power of carrying facts thus considered the kinds of marvellous events recorded in the gospels for example are no longer to be dismissed on a priori grounds as mythical we cannot now discard evidence as necessarily false because it clashes with our present ideas of the possible when we have to acknowledge that the very same evidence may safely convey to us facts which clashed with our fathers notions of what is possible but which are now accepted our notions of the possible cease to be a criterion of truth or falsehood and our contempt for the gospels as myths must slowly die as miracle after miracle is brought within the realm of acknowledged law with each such admission the hypothesis that the gospel evidence is mythical must grow weaker and weaker must grow the negative certainty of popular science  the occurrences which took place at and near the tomb of paris were attested as hume truly avers by a great body of excellent evidence but the wisdom which declined to make a judicial examination has deprived us of the best kind of record analogous if not exactly similar events now confessedly take place and are no longer looked upon as miraculous but as long as they were held to be miraculous not to examine the evidence said hume was the policy of all reasonable people the result was to deprive science of the best sort of record of facts which she welcomes as soon as she thinks she can explain them10 examples of the folly of a priori negation are common the british association refused to hear the essay which braid the inventor of the word hypnotism had written upon the subject braid elliotson and other english inquirers of the midcentury were subjected to such persecutions as official science could inflict we read of m deslon a disciple of mesmer about 1783 that he was condemned by the faculty of medicine without any examination of the facts the inquisition proceeded more fairly than these scientific obscurantists  another curious example may be cited m guyau in his work the nonreligion of the future argues that religion is doomed poetic genius has withdrawn its services witness tennyson and browning among orthodox protestant nations miracles do not happen11 but marvellous facts do happen12 these marvellous facts accepted by m guyau are what hume called miracles and advised the wise and learned to laugh at without examination they were not facts and could not be he said now to m guyaus mind they are facts and therefore are not miracles he includes mental suggestion taking place even at a distance a man can transmit an almost compulsive command it appears nowadays by a simple tension of his will if this be so if will can affect matter from a distance obviously the relations of will and matter are not what popular science tells us that they are again if this truth is now established and won from that region which hume and popular science forbid us to investigate who knows what other facts may be redeemed from that limbo or how far they may affect our views of possibilities the admission of mental action operative √† distance is of course personal only to m guyau among friends of the new negative tradition  we return to hume he next argues that the pleasures of wonder make all accounts of miracles worthless he has just given an example of the equivalent pleasures of dogmatic disbelief then religion is a disturbing force but so manifestly is irreligion the wise and learned are content to deride the absurdity without informing themselves of the particular facts the wise and learned are applauded for their scientific attitude again miracles destroy each other for all religions have their miracles but all religions cannot be true this argument is no longer of force with people who look on miracles as  x phenomena not as divine evidences to the truth of this or that creed the gazing populace receives without examination whatever soothes superstition and humes whole purpose is to make the wise and learned imitate the gazing populace by rejecting alleged facts without examination the populace investigated more than did the wise and learned  hume has an alternative definition of a miraclea miracle is a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the deity or by the interposition of some invisible agent we reply that what hume calls a miracle may result from the operation of some as yet unascertained law of nature say selfsuggestion and that our business at present is to examine such events not to account for them  it may fairly be said that hume is arguing against men who wished to make socalled miracles a test of the truth of jansenism for example and that he could not be expected to answer by anticipation ideas not current in his day but he remains guilty of denouncing the investigation of apparent facts no attitude can be less scientific than his or more common among many men of science  according to the humorous wont of things in this world the whole question of the marvellous had no sooner been settled for ever by david hume than it was reopened by emanuel swedenborg now kant was familiar with certain of the works of hume whether he had read his essay on miracles or not far from declining to examine the portentous visions of swedenborg kant interested himself deeply in the topic as early as 1758 he wrote his first remarks on the seer containing some reports of stories or legends about swedenborgs clairvoyance in the true spirit of psychical research kant wrote a letter to swedenborg asking for information at first hand the seer got the letter but he never answered it kant however prints one or two examples of swedenborgs successes madame harteville widow of the dutch envoy in stockholm was dunned by a silversmith for a debt of her late husbands she believed that it had been paid but could not find the receipt she therefore asked swedenborg to use his renowned gifts he promised to see what he could do and three days later arrived at the ladys house while she was giving a tea or rather a coffee party to the assembled society swedenborg remarked in a coldblooded way that he had seen her man and spoken to him the late m harteville declared to swedenborg that he had paid the bill seven months before his decease the receipt was in a cupboard upstairs madame harteville replied that the cupboard had been thoroughly searched to no purpose swedenborg answered that as he learned from the ghost there was a secret drawer behind the sideplank within the cupboard the drawer contained diplomatic correspondence and the missing receipt the whole company then went upstairs found the secret drawer and the receipt among the other papers kant adds swedenborgs clairvoyant vision from gothenburg of a great fire at stockholm dated september 1756 kant pined to see swedenborg himself and waited eagerly for his book arcana coelestia at last he obtained this work at the ransom ruinous to kant at that time of 7¬£ but he was disappointed with what he read and in tr√§ume eines geistersehers made a somewhat sarcastic attempt at a metaphysical theory of apparitions    velut aegri somnia vanae   finguntur species  is his motto  kants real position about all these matters is i venture to say almost identical with that of sir walter scott a scot himself by descent kant may have heard tales of secondsight and bogles like scott he dearly loved a ghoststory like scott he was canny enough to laugh publicly at them and at himself for his interest in them yet both would take trouble to inquire as kant vainly wrote to swedenborg and othersas he vainly spent 7¬£ on arcana coelestia so sir walter was anxious to go to egypt to examine the facts of inkgazing clairvoyance kant confesses that each individual ghoststory found him sceptical whereas the cumulative mass made a considerable impression13  the first seventy pages of the tribune are devoted to a perfectly serious discussion of the metaphysics of spirits on page 73 he pleasantly remarks now we shall understand that all said hitherto is superfluous and he will not reproach the reader who regards seers not as citizens of two worlds plotinus but as candidates for bedlam  kants irony is peculiarly scottish he does not himself know how far he is in earnest and to save his selfrespect and character for canniness he jocks wi deeficulty he amuses himself with trying how far he can carry speculations on metaphysics not yet reformed by himself into the realm of the ghostly he makes admissions about his own tendency to think that he has an immaterial soul and that these points are or may be or some day will be scientifically solved these admissions are eagerly welcomed by du prel in his philosophy of mysticism but they are only part of kants joke and how far they are serious kant himself does not know if spiritualists knew their own business they would translate and publish kants first seventy pages of tr√§ume something like telepathy action of spirit even discarnate on spirit is alluded to but the idea is as old as lavaterus at least p 52 kant has a good deal to say like scott in his demonology on the physics of hallucination but it is antiquated matter he thinks the whole topic of spiritual being only important as bearing on hopes of a future life as speculation all is in the air and as in such matters the learned and unlearned are on a level of ignorance science will not discuss them he then repeats the swedenborg stories and thinks it would be useful to posterity if some one would investigate them while witnesses are alive and memories are fresh  in fact kant asks for psychical research  as for swedenborgs so costly book kant laughs at it there is in it no evidence only assertion kant ends having pleased nobody he says and as ignorant as when he began by citing cultivons notre jardin  kant returned to the theme in anthropologische didaktik he discusses the unconscious or subconscious which till sir william hamilton lectured seems to have been an absolutely unknown topic to british psychologists so ist das feld dunkler vorstellungen das gr√∂sste in menschen he has a chapter on the divining faculty pp 8993 he will not hear of presentiments and unlike hegel he scouts the highland secondsight the possessed of anthropology are epileptic patients mystics swedenborg are victims of schw√§rmerei  this reference to swedenborg is remarked upon by schubert in his preface to the essay of kant he points out that it is interesting to compare the circumspection the almost uncertainty of kant when he had to deliver a judgment on the phenomena described by himself and as to which he had made inquiry ie in his letter re swedenborg to mlle de knobloch and the very decided opinions he expressed forty years later on swedenborg and his companions in the work cited sections 3537 the opinion in paragraph 35 is a general one as to mystics there is no other mention of swedenborg  on the whole kant is interested but despairing he wants facts and no facts are given to him but the book of the prophet emanuel but as it happened a new or a revived order of facts was just about to solicit scientific attention kant had 1766 heard rumours of healing by magnetism and of the alleged effect of the magnet on the human frame the subject was in the air and had already won the attention of mesmer about whom kant had information it were superfluous to tell again the familiar story of mesmers performances at paris while mesmers theory of magnetism was denounced by contemporary science the discovery of the hypnotic sleep was made by his pupil puys√©gur this gentleman was persuaded that instances of thoughttransference not through known channels of sense occurred between the patient and the magnetiser and he also believed that he had witnessed cases of clairvoyance lucidity vue √† distance in which the patient apparently beheld places and events remote in space these things would now be explained by unconscious suggestion in the more sceptical schools of psychological science the revolution interrupted scientific study in france to a great degree but somnambulism the hypnotic sleep and magnetism were eagerly examined in germany modern manuals for some reason are apt to overlook these german researches and speculations compare mr vincents elements of hypnotism p 34 the schellings were interested ritter thought he had detected a new force siderism mr wallace in his preface to hegels philosophie des geistes speaks as if ritter had made experiments in telepathy he may have done so but his siderismus t√ºbingen 1808 is a report undertaken for the academy of munich on the doings of an italian waterfinder or dowser ritter gives details of seventyfour experiments in dowsing for water metals or coal he believes in the faculty but not in psychic explanations or the devil he talks about electricity pp 170 190 he describes his precautions to avoid vulgar fraud but he took no precautions against unconscious thoughttransference he reckoned the faculty temperamental and useful  amoretti at milan examined hundreds of cases of the socalled divining rod and jung stilling became an early spiritualist and fullwelling fountain head of ghost stories  probably the most important philosophical result of the early german researches into the hypnotic slumber is to be found in the writings of hegel owing to his peculiar use of a terminology or scientific language all his own it is extremely difficult to make hegels meaning even moderately clear perhaps we may partly elucidate it by a similitude of mr frederic myers suppose we compare the ordinary everyday consciousness of each of us to a spectrum whose ends towards each extremity fade out of our view  beyond the range of sight there may be imagined a lower or physiological end for our ordinary consciousness of course is unaware of many physiological processes which are eternally going on within us digestion so long as it is healthy is an obvious example but hypnotic experiment makes it certain that a patient in the hypnotic condition can consciously or at least purposefully affect physiological processes to which the ordinary consciousness is blindfor example by raising a blister when it is suggested that a blister must be raised again granting the facts hypothetically and merely for the sake of argument at the upper end of the spectrum beyond the view of ordinary everyday consciousness knowledge may be acquired of things which are out of the view of the consciousness of every day for example for the sake of argument let us admit it unknown and remote people and places may be seen and described by clairvoyance or vue √† distance  now hegel accepted as genuine the facts which we here adduce merely for the sake of argument and by way of illustrations but he did not regard the clairvoyant consciousness or whatever we call it which ex hypothesi is untrammelled by space or even by time as occupying what we style the upper end of the psychical spectrum on the contrary he placed it at the lower end hegels upper end loses itself in light the lower end qui voit tant de choses as la fontaines shepherd says is not a sublime mental phase and capable of conveying general truths time and space do not thwart the consciousness at hegels lower end which springs from the great soul of nature but that lower end though it may see for jeanne darc at valcouleurs a battle at rouvray a hundred leagues away does not communicate any lofty philosophic truths14 the phenomena of clairvoyance in hegels opinion merely indicate that the material is really ideal which perhaps is as much as we can ask from them the somnambulist and clairvoyant see without eyes and carry their visions directly into regions where the waiting consciousness of orderly intelligence cannot enter wallace hegel admits however that in ordinary selfpossessed conscious life there are traces of the magic tie especially between female friends of delicate nerves to whom he adds husband and wife and members of the same family he gives without date or source a case of a girl in germany who saw her brother lying dead in a hospital at valladolid her brother was at the time in the hospital but it was another man in the nest bed who was dead it is thus impossible to make out whether what the clairvoyants really see preponderates over what they deceive themselves in  as long as the facts which hegel accepted are not officially welcomed by science it may seem superfluous to dispute as to whether they are attained by the lower or the higher stratum of our consciousness but perhaps the question here at issue may be elucidated by some remarks of dr max dessoir psychology he says has proved that in every conception and idea an image or group of images must be present these mental images are the recrudescence or recurrence of perceptions we see a tree or a man or a dog and whenever we have before our minds the conception or idea of any of these things the original perception of them returns though of course more faintly but in dr dessoirs opinion these revived mental images would reach the height of actual hallucinations so that the man dog or tree would seem visibly present if other memories and new sensations did not compete with them and check their development  suppose to use mlle ferrands metaphor a human body living but with all its channels of sensation hitherto unopened open the sense of sight to receive a flash of green colour and close it again apparently whenever the mind informing this body had the conception of green and it could have no other it would also have an hallucination of green thus    annihilating all thats made   to a green thought in a green shade  now in sleep or hypnotic trance the competition of new sensations and other memories is removed or diminished and therefore the idea of a man dog or tree once suggested to the hypnotised patient does become an actual hallucination the hypnotised patient sees the absent object which he is told to see the sleeper sees things not really present  our primitive state before the enormous competition of other memories and new sensations set in would thus be a state of hallucination our normal present condition in which hallucination is checked by competing memories and new sensations is a suppression of our original primitive natural tendencies hallucination represents the main trunk of our psychical existence15 in dr dessoirs theory this condition of hallucination is mans original and most primitive condition but it is not a higher rather a lower state of spiritual activity than the everyday practical unhallucinated consciousness  this is also the opinion of hegel who supposes our primitive mental condition to be capable of descrying objects remote in space and time mr myers as we saw is of the opposite opinion as to the relative dignity and relative reality of the present everyday self and the old original fundamental self dr dessoir refrains from pronouncing a decided opinion as to whether the original primitive hallucinated self within us does preside over powers and actions at a distance such as clairvoyance but he believes in hypnotisation at a distance his theory like hegels is that of atavism or throwing back to some very remote ancestral condition this will prove of interest later  hegel at all events believed in the fact of clairvoyance though deeming it of little practical use he accepted telepathy the magic tie he accepted interchange of sensations between the hypnotiser and the hypnotised he believed in the divining rod and unlike kant even in scottish secondsight the intuitive soul oversteps the conditions of time and space it beholds things remote things long past and things to come16  the pendulum of thought has swung back a long way from the point whither it was urged by david hume hegel remarks the facts it might seem first of all call for verification but such verification would be superfluous to those on whose account it was called for since they facilitate the inquiry for themselves by declaring the narratives infinitely numerous though they be and accredited by the education and character of the witnesses to be mere deception and imposture their a priori conceptions are so rooted that no testimony can avail against them and they have even denied what they have seen with their own eyes and reported under their own hands like sir david brewster hegel it will be observed takes the facts as given and works them into his general theory of the sensitive soul f√ºhlende seele he does not try to establish the facts but to establish or at least to examine them is the first business of psychical research theorising comes later  the years which have passed between the date of hegels philosophy of mind and our own time have witnessed the long dispute over the existence the nature and the causes of the hypnotic condition and over the reality and limitations of the phenomena thus the academy of medicine in paris appointed a committee to examine the subject in 1825 the report on animal magnetism as it was then styled was presented in 1831 the academy lacked the courage to publish it for the report was favourable even to certain of the still disputed phenomena at that time in accordance with a survival of the theory of mesmer the agent in hypnotic cases was believed to be a kind of efflux of a cosmic fluid from the magnetiser to the patient there was a magnetic connection  though no distinction between mesmerism and hypnotism is taken in popular language mesmerism is a word implying this theory of magnetic or other unknown personal influence hypnotism as will presently be seen implies no such theory the academys report 1831 attested the development under magnetism of new faculties such as clairvoyance and intuition also the production of great changes in the physical economy such as insensibility and sudden increase of strength the report declared it to be demonstrated that sleep could be produced without suggestion as we say now though the term was not then in use sleep has been produced in circumstances in which the persons could not see or were ignorant of the means employed to produce it  the academy did its best to suppress this report which attests the phenomena that hegel accepted phenomena still disputed six years later 1837 a committee reported against the pretensions of a certain berna a magnetiser no person acted on both committees and this report was accepted later a number of people tried to read a letter in a box and failed this says mr vincent settled the question with regard to clairvoyance though it might be more logical to say that it settled the pretensions of the competitors on that occasion the academy now decided that because certain persons did not satisfy the expectations raised by their preliminary advertisements therefore the question of magnetism was definitely closed  we have often to regret that scientific eminence is not always accompanied by scientific logic where science neglects a subject charlatans and dupes take it up in england animal magnetism had been abandoned to this class of enthusiasts till thackerays friend dr elliotson devoted himself to the topic he was persecuted as doctors know how to persecute but in 1841 braid of manchester discovered that the socalled magnetic sleep could be produced without any magnetism he made his patients stare fixedly at an object and encouraged them to expect to go to sleep he called his method hypnotism a term which begs no question seeming to cease to be mysterious hypnotism became all but respectable and was being used in surgical operations till it was superseded by chloroform in england the study has been and remains rather suspect while on the continent hypnotism is used both for healing purposes and in the inquiries of experimental psychology wide differences of opinion still exist as to the nature of the hypnotic sleep as to its physiological concomitants and as to the limits of the faculties exercised in or out of the slumber it is not even absolutely certain that the exercise of the stranger facultiesfor instance that the production of anaesthesia and rigidityare the results merely of suggestion and expectancy a hypnotised patient is told that the middle finger of his left hand will become rigid and incapable of sensation this occurs and is explained by suggestion though how suggestion produces the astonishing effect is another problem the late mr gurney however made a number of experiments in which no suggestion was pronounced nor did the patients know which of their fingers was to become rigid and incapable of pain the patients hands were thrust through a screen on the other side of which the hypnotist made passes above the finger which was to become rigid the lookerson selected the finger and the insensibility was tested by a strong electric current the effect was also produced without passes the operator merely pointing at the selected finger and willing the result if he did not will it nothing occurred nor did anything occur if he willed without pointing the proximity of the operators hand produced no effect if he did not will nor was his willing successful if he did not bring his hand near that of the patient other peoples hands similarly situated produced no effect  experiments in transferring taste as of salt sugar cayenne pepper from operator to subject were also successful drs janet and gibert also produced sleep in a woman at a distance by willing it at hours which were selected by a system of drawing lots17 these facts of course rather point to an element of truth in the old mesmeric hypothesis of some specific influence in the operator they cannot very well be explained by suggestion and expectancy but these facts and facts of clairvoyance and thoughttransference will be rejected as superstitious delusions by people who have not met them in their own experience this need not prevent us from examining them because all the facts including those now universally accepted by continental and scarcely impeached by british science have been noisily rejected again and again on humes principles  the rarer facts as mr gurney remarks still go through the hollow form of taking place here is an example of the mode in which these phenomena are treated by popular science mr vincent says that clairvoyance and phrenology were elliotsons constant stock in trade phrenology was also braids stock in trade it is a matter of congratulation to have been so soon delivered from what dr lloyd tuckey has well called a mass of superincumbent rubbish18 clairvoyance is part of a mass of rubbish on page 57 on page 67 mr vincent says there are many interesting questions such as telepathy thoughtreading clairvoyance upon which it would be perhaps rash to give any decided opinion all these strange psychical conditions present problems of great interest and are only omitted because they have not a sufficient bearing on the normal states of hypnosis thus what was rubbish in one page presents problems of great interest ten pages later and after offering a decided opinion that clairvoyance is rubbish mr vincent thinks it rash to give any decided opinion it is rather rash to give a decided opinion and then to say that it is rash to do so19  this brief sketch shows that science is confronted by certain facts which in his time hume dismissed as incredible miracles beneath the contempt of the wise and learned we also see that the stranger and rarer phenomena which hegel accepted as facts and interwove with his general philosophy are still matters of dispute admitted by some men of science they are doubted by others by others again are denied while most of the journalists and authors of cheap primers who inspire popular tradition regard the phenomena as frauds or fables of superstition but it is plain that these phenomena like the more ordinary facts of hypnotism may finally be admitted by science the scientific world laughed not so long ago at ogham inscriptions meteorites and at palaeolithic weapons as impostures or freaks of nature now nobody has any doubt on these matters and clairvoyance thoughttransference and telepathy may not inconceivably be as fortunate in the long run as meteorites or as the more usual phenomena of hypnotism  it is only lord kelvin who now maintains or lately maintained that in hypnotism there is nothing at all but fraud and malobservation in years to come it may be that only some similar belated voice will cry that in thoughttransference there is nothing but malobservation and fraud at present the serious attention and careful experiment needed for the establishment of the facts are more common among french than among english men of science when published these experiments if they contain any affirmative instances are denounced as superstitious or criticized after what we must charitably deem to be a very hasty glance by the guides of popular opinion examples of this method will be later quoted meanwhile the disputes as to these alleged facts are noticed here because of their supposed relation to the origin of religion  footnote 1 see mr

question on which we cannot enter here     iii  anthropology and religion  among the various forms of science which are reaching and affecting the new popular tradition we have reckoned anthropology pleasantly enough anthropology has herself but recently emerged from that limbo of the unrecognised in which psychical research is pining the british association used to reject anthropological papers as vain dreams based on travellers tales no doubt the british association would reject a paper on clairvoyance as a vain dream based on old wives fables or on hysterical imposture undeniably the study of such themes is hampered by fable and fraud just as anthropology has to be ceaselessly on its guard against travellers tales against european misunderstandings of savage ideas and against civilised notions and scientific theories unconsciously read into barbaric customs rites traditions and usages man ondoyant et divers is the subject alike of anthropology and of psychical research man especially savage man cannot be secluded from disturbing influences and watched like the materials of a chemical experiment in a laboratory nor can man be caught in a primitive state his intellectual beginnings lie very far behind the stage of culture in which we find the lowest known races consequently the matter on which anthropology works is fluctuating the evidence on which it rests needs the most sceptical criticism and many of its conclusions in the necessary absence of historical testimony as to times far behind the lowest known savages must be hypothetical  for these sound reasons official science long looked askance on anthropology her followers were not regarded as genuine scholars and perhaps as a result of this contempt they were often broken men intellectual outlaws people of one wild idea to the scientific mind anthropologists or ethnologists were a horde who darkly muttered of serpent worship phallus worship arkite doctrines and the ten lost tribes that kept turning up in the most unexpected places anthropologists were said to gloat over dirty rites of dirty savages and to seek reason where there was none the exiled the outcast the pariah of science is indeed apt to find himself in odd company round the campfire of psychical research too in the unofficial unstaked waste of science hover odd menacing figures of esoteric buddhists satanistes occultists christian scientists spiritualists and astrologers as the arkites and lost tribesmen haunted the cradle of anthropology  but there was found at last to be reason in the thing and method in the madness evolution was in it the acceptance after long ridicule of palaeolithic weapons as relics of human culture probably helped to bring anthropology within the sacred circle of permitted knowledge her topic was full of illustrations of the doctrine of mr darwin modern writers on the theme had been anticipated by the less systematic students of the eighteenth centurygoguet de brosses millar fontenelle lafitau boulanger or even hume and voltaire as pioneers these writers answer to the early mesmerists and magnetists puys√©gur amoretti ritter elliotson mayo gregory in the history of psychical research they were on the same track in each case as lubbock tylor spencer bastian and frazer or as gurney richet myers janet dessoir and von schrencknotzing but the earlier students were less careful of method and evidence  evidence that was the stumbling block of anthropology we still hear in the later works of mr max m√ºller the echo of the old complaints anything you please mr max m√ºller says you may find among your useful savages and in regard to some anthropologists his criticism is just you have but to skim a few books of travel pencil in hand and pick out what suits your case suppose as regards our present theme your theory is that savages possess broken lights of the belief in a supreme being you can find evidence for that or suppose you want to show that they have no religious ideas at all you can find evidence for that also your testimony is often derived from observers ignorant of the language of the people whom they talk about or who are themselves prejudiced by one or other theory or bias how can you pretend to raise a science on such foundations especially as the savage informants wish to please or to mystify inquirers or they answer at random or deliberately conceal their most sacred institutions or have never paid any attention to the subject  to all these perfectly natural objections mr tylor has replied1 evidence must be collected sifted tested as in any other branch of inquiry a writer of course is bound to use his best judgment as to the trustworthiness of all authors he quotes and if possible to obtain several accounts to certify each point in each locality mr tylor then adduces the test of recurrence of undesigned coincidence in testimony as millar had already argued in the last century2 if a mediaeval mahommedan in tartary a jesuit in brazil a wesleyan in fiji one may add a police magistrate in australia a presbyterian in central africa a trapper in canada agree in describing some analogous rite or myth in these diverse lands and ages we cannot set down the coincidence to chance or fraud now the most important facts of ethnography are vouched for in this way  we may add that even when the ideas of savages are obscure we can often detect them by analysis of the institutions in which they are expressed3  thus anthropological like psychical or any other evidence must be submitted to conscientious processes of testing and sifting contradictory instances must be hunted for sedulously nothing can be less scientific than to snatch up any travellers tale which makes for our theory and to ignore evidence perhaps earlier or later or better observed which makes against it yet this unfortunately in certain instances which will be adduced has been the occasional error of mr huxley and mr spencer4 mr spencer opens his ecclesiastical institutions by the remark that the implication from the reported absence of the ideas of belief in persons born deaf and dumb is that the religious ideas of civilised men are not innate who says they are and this implication mr spencer supports by proofs that among various savages religious ideas do not exist sir john lubbock has given many of these but it would be well to advise the reader to consult roskoffs confutation of sir john lubbock and mr tylors masterly statement5 mr spencer cited sir samuel baker for savages without even a ray of superstition or a trace of worship mr tylor twelve years before mr spencer wrote had demolished sir samuel bakers assertion6 as regards many tribes and so shaken it as regards the latukas quoted by mr spencer the godless dinkas have a good deity and heavendwelling creator carefully recorded years before sir samuels rash denial we show later that mr spencer relying on a single isolated sentence in brough smyth omits all his essential information about the australian supreme being while mr huxleyoverlooking the copious and conclusive evidence as to their ethical religioncharges the australians with having merely a nonmoral belief in casual spirits we have also to show that mr huxley under the dominance of his theory and inadvertently quotes a good authority as saying the precise reverse of what he really does say  if the facts not fitting their theories are little observed by authorities so popular as mr huxley and mr spencer if instantiae contradictoriae are ignored by them or left vague if these things are done in the green tree we may easily imagine what shall be done in the dry but we need not war with hasty vulgarisateurs and headlong theorists  enough has been said to show the position of anthropology as regards evidence and to prove that if he confines his observations to certain anthropologists the censures of mr max m√ºller are justified it is mainly for this reason that the arguments presently to follow are strung on the thread of mr tylors truly learned and accurate book primitive culture  though but recently crept forth vix aut ne vix quidem from the chill shade of scientific disdain anthropology adopts the airs of her elder sisters among the sciences and is as severe as they to the cinderella of the family psychical research she must murmur of her fairies among the cinders of the hearth while they go forth to the ball and dance with provincial mayors at the festivities of the british association this is ungenerous and unfortunate as the records of anthropology are rich in unexamined materials of psychical research i am unacquainted with any work devoted by an anthropologist of renown to the hypnotic and kindred practices of the lower races except herr bastians very meagre tract √úber psychische beobachtungen bei naturv√∂lkern7 we possess none the less a mass of scattered information on this topic the savage side of psychical phenomena in works of travel and in mr tylors monumental primitive culture mr tylor however as we shall see regards it as a matter of indifference or at least as a matter beyond the scope of his essay to decide whether the parallel supernormal phenomena believed in by savages and said to recur in civilisation are facts of actual experience or not  now this question is not otiose mr tylor like other anthropologists mr huxley mr herbert spencer and their followers and popularisers constructs on anthropological grounds a theory of the origin of religion  that origin anthropology explains as the result of early and fallacious reasonings on a number of biological and psychological phenomena both normal and as is alleged by savages supernormal these reasonings led to the belief in souls and spirits now first anthropology has taken for granted that the supreme deities of savages are envisaged by them as spirits this paradoxical as the statement may appear is just what does not seem to be proved as we shall show next if the supernormal phenomena clairvoyance thoughttransference phantasms of the dead phantasms of the dying and others be real matters of experience the inferences drawn from them by early savage philosophy may be in some degree erroneous but the inferences drawn by materialists who reject the supernormal phenomena will also perhaps be let us say incomplete religion will have been in part developed out of facts perhaps inconsistent with materialism in its present dogmatic form to put it less trenchantly and perhaps more accurately the alleged facts are not merely dramatically strange they are not merely extraordinary and striking but they are odd in the sense that they will not easily fit in with the views which physicists and men of science generally give us of the universe in which we live mr aj balfour presidents address proceedings spr vol x p 8 1894  as this is the case it might seem to be the business of anthropology the science of man to examine among other things the evidence for the actual existence of those alleged unusual and supernormal phenomena belief in which is given as one of the origins of religion  to make this examination in the ethnographic field is almost a new labour as we shall see anthropologists have not hitherto investigated such things as the firewalk of savages uninjured in the flames like the three holy children the worldwide savage practice of divining by hallucinations induced through gazing into a smooth deep crystalgazing has been studied i think by no anthropologist the veracity of messages uttered by savage seers when as they suppose possessed or inspired has not been criticised and probably cannot be for lack of detailed information the physical phenomena which answer among savages to the use of the divining rod and to spiritist marvels in modern times have only been glanced at in short all the savage parallels to the socalled psychical phenomena now under discussion in england america germany italy and france have escaped critical analysis and comparison with their civilised counterparts  an exception among anthropologists is mr tylor he has not suppressed the existence of these barbaric parallels to our modern problems of this kind but his interest in them practically ends when he has shown that the phenomena helped to originate the savage belief in spirits and when he has displayed the survival of that belief in later culture he does not ask are the phenomena real he is concerned only with the savage philosophy of the phenomena and with its relics in modern spiritism and religion my purpose is to do by way only of √©bauche what neither anthropology nor psychical research nor psychology has done to put the savage and modern phenomena side by side such evidence as we can give for the actuality of the modern experiences will so far as it goes raise a presumption that the savage beliefs however erroneous however darkened by fraud and fancy repose on a basis of real observation of actual phenomena  anthropology is concerned with man and what is in manhumani nihil a se alienum putat these researches therefore are within the anthropological province especially as they bear on the prevalent anthropological theory of the origin of religion by religion we mean for the purpose of this argument the belief in the existence of an intelligence or intelligences not human and not dependent on a material mechanism of brain and nerves which may or may not powerfully control mens fortunes and the nature of things we also mean the additional belief that there is in man an element so far kindred to these intelligences that it can transcend the knowledge obtained through the known bodily senses and may possibly survive the death of the body these two beliefs at present though not necessarily in their origin appear chiefly as the faith in god and in the immortality of the soul  it is important then to trace if possible the origin of these two beliefs if they arose in actual communion with deity as the first at least did in the theory of the hebrew scriptures or if they could be proved to arise in an unanalysable sensus numinis or even in a perception of the infinite max m√ºller religion would have a divine or at least a necessary source to the theist what is inevitable cannot but be divinely ordained therefore religion is divinely preordained therefore in essentials though not in accidental details religion is true the atheist or nontheist of course draws no such inferences  but if religion as now understood among men be the latest evolutionary form of a series of mistakes fallacies and illusions if its germ be a blunder and its present form only the result of progressive but unessential refinements on that blunder the inference that religion is untruethat nothing actual corresponds to its hypothesisis very easily drawn the inference is not perhaps logical for all our science itself is the result of progressive refinements upon hypotheses originally erroneous fashioned to explain facts misconceived yet our science is true within its limits though very far from being exhaustive of the truth in the same way it might be argued our religion even granting that it arose out of primitive fallacies and false hypotheses may yet have been refined as science has been through a multitude of causes into an approximate truth  frequently as i am compelled to differ from mr spencer both as to facts and their interpretation i am happy to find that he has anticipated me here opponents will urge he says that if the primitive belief in ghosts was absolutely false all derived beliefs from it must be absolutely false mr spencer replies a germ of truth was contained in the primitive conceptionthe truth namely that the power which manifests itself in consciousness is but a differently conditioned form of the power which manifests itself beyond consciousness in fact we find mr spencer like faust as described by marguerite saying much the same thing as the priests but not quite in the same way of course i allow for a much larger germ of truth in the origin of the ghost theory than mr spencer does but we can both say the ultimate form of the religious consciousness is will be the final development of a consciousness which at the outset contained a germ of truth obscured by multitudinous errors8    one god one law one element   and one faroff divine event   to which the whole creation moves  coming at last to mr tylor we find that he begins by dismissing the idea that any known race of men is devoid of religious conceptions he disproves out of their own mouths the allegations of several writers who have made this exploded assertion about godless tribes he says the thoughts and principles of modern christianity are attached to intellectual clues which run back through far prechristian ages to the very origin of human civilisation perhaps even of human existence9 so far we abound in mr tylors sense as a minimum definition of religion he gives the belief in spiritual beings which appears among all low races with whom we have attained to thoroughly intimate relations the existence of this belief at present does not prove that no races were ever at any time destitute of all belief but it prevents us from positing the existence of such creedless races in any age as a demonstrated fact we have thus in short no opportunity of observing historically mans development from blank unbelief into even the minimum or most rudimentary form of belief we can only theorise and make more or less plausible conjectures as to the first rudiments of human faith in god and in spiritual beings we find no race whose mind as to faith is a tabula rasa  to the earliest faith mr tylor gives the name of animism a term not wholly free from objection though spiritualism is still less desirable having been usurped by a form of modern superstitiousness this animism in its full development includes the belief in souls and in a future state in controlling deities and subordinate spirits in mr tylors opinion as in mr huxleys animism in its lower and earlier forms has scarcely any connection with ethics its spirits do not make for righteousness this is a side issue to be examined later but we may provisionally observe in passing that the ethical ideas such as they are even of australian blacks are reported to be inculcated at the religious mysteries bora of the tribes which were instituted by and are performed in honour of the gods of their native belief but this topic must be reserved for our closing chapters  mr tylor however is chiefly concerned with animism as an ancient and worldwide philosophy of which belief is the theory and worship is the practice given animism then or the belief in spiritual beings as the earliest form and minimum of religious faith what is the origin of animism it will be seen that by animism mr tylor does not mean the alleged early theory implicitly if not explicitly and consciously held that all things whatsoever are animated and are personalities10 judging from the behaviour of little children and from the myths of savages early man may have halfconsciously extended his own sense of personal and potent and animated existence to the whole of nature as known to him not only animals but vegetables and inorganic objects may have been looked on by him as persons like what he felt himself to be the child perhaps merely because taught to do so beats the naughty chair and all objects are persons in early mythology but this feeling rather than theory may conceivably have existed among early men before they developed the hypothesis of spirits ghosts or souls it is the origin of that hypothesis animism which mr tylor investigates  what then is the origin of animism it arose in the earliest traceable speculations on two groups of biological problems  1 what is it that makes the difference between a living body and a dead one what causes waking sleep trance disease and death  2 what are those human shapes which appear in dreams and visions11  here it should be noted that mr tylor most properly takes a distinction between sleeping dreams and waking visions or clear vision the distinction is made even by the blacks of australia thus one of the kurnai announced that his yambo or soul could go out during sleep and see the distant and the dead but while any one might be able to communicate with the ghosts during sleep it was only the wizards who were able to do so in waking hours a wizard in fact is a person susceptible or feigning to be susceptible when awake to hallucinatory perceptions of phantasms of the dead among the kulin of wimmera river a man became a wizard who as a boy had seen his mothers ghost sitting at her grave12 these facts prove that a race of savages at the bottom of the scale of culture do take a formal distinction between normal dreams in sleep and waking hallucinationsa thing apt to be denied  thus mr herbert spencer offers the massive generalisation that savages do not possess a language enabling a man to say i dreamed that i saw instead of i saw principles of sociology p 150 this could only be proved by giving examples of such highly deficient languages which mr spencer does not do13 in many savage speculations there occur ideas as subtly metaphysical as those of hegel moreover even the australian languages have the verb to see and the substantive sleep nothing then prevents a man from saying i saw in sleep insomnium greek enupnion  we have shown too that the australians take an essential distinction between waking hallucinations ghosts seen by a man when awake and the common hallucinations of slumber anybody can have these the man who sees ghosts when awake is marked out for a wizard  at the same time the vividness of dreams among certain savages as recorded in mr im thurns indians of guiana and the consequent confusion of dreaming and waking experiences are certain facts wilson says the same of some negroes and mr spencer illustrates from the confusion of mind in dreamy children they we know are much more addicted to somnambulism than grownup people i am unaware that spontaneous somnambulism among savages has been studied as it ought to be i have demonstrated however that very low savages can and do draw an essential distinction between sleeping and waking hallucinations  again the crystalgazer whose apparently telepathic crystal pictures are discussed later chap v was introduced to a crystal just because she had previously been known to be susceptible to waking and occasionally veracious hallucinations  it was not only on the dreams of sleep so easily forgotten as they are that the savage pondered in his early speculations about the life and the soul he included in his materials the much more striking and memorable experiences of waking hours as we and mr tylor agree in holding  reflecting on these things the earliest savage reasoners would decide 1 that man has a life which leaves him temporarily in sleep finally in death 2 that man also possesses a phantom which appears to other people in their visions and dreams the savage philosopher would then combine his information like a celebrated writer on chinese metaphysics he would merely combine the life and the phantom as manifestations of one and the same soul the result would be an apparitional soul or ghostsoul  this ghostsoul would be a highly accomplished creature a vapour film or shadow yet conscious capable of leaving the body mostly invisible and impalpable yet also manifesting physical power existing and appearing after the death of the body able to act on the bodies of other men beasts and things14  when the earliest reasoners in an age and in mental conditions of which we know nothing historically had evolved the hypothesis of this conscious powerful separable soul capable of surviving the death of the body it was not difficult for them to develop the rest of religion as mr tylor thinks a powerful ghost of a dead man might thrive till its original owner being long forgotten it became a god again souls once given it would not be a very difficult logical leap perhaps to conceive of souls or spirits that had never been human at all it is we may say only le premier pas qui co√ªte the step to the belief in a surviving separable soul nevertheless when we remember that mr tylor is theorising about savages in the dim background of human evolution savages whom we know nothing of by experience savages far behind australians and bushmen who possess gods we must admit that he credits them with great ingenuity and strong powers of abstract reasoning he may be right in his opinion in the same way just as primitive men were keen reasoners so early bees more clever than modern bees may have evolved the system of hexagonal cells and only an early fish of genius could first have hit on the plan now hereditary of killing a fly by blowing water at it  to this theory of metaphysical genius in very low savages i have no objection to offer we shall find later astonishing examples of savage abstract speculation certainly not derived from missionary sources because wholly out of the missionarys line of duty and reflection  as early beasts had genius so the earliest reasoners appear to have been as logically gifted as the lowest savages now known to us or even as some biblical critics by mr tylors hypothesis they first conceived the extremely abstract idea of life that which makes the difference between a living body and a dead one15 this highly abstract conception must have been however the more difficult to early man as to him all things universally are animated16 mr tylor illustrates this theory of early man by the little childs idea that chairs sticks and wooden horses are actuated by the same sort of personal will as nurses and children and kittens in such matters the savage mind well represents the childish stage17  now nothing can be more certain than that if children think sticks are animated they dont think so because they have heard or discovered that they possess souls and then transfer souls to sticks we may doubt then if primitive man came in this way by reasoning on souls to suppose that all things universally were animated but if he did think all things animateda corpse to his mind was just as much animated as anything else did he reason all things are animated a corpse is not animated therefore a corpse is not a thing within the meaning of my general law  how again did early man conceive of life before he identified life 1 with that which makes the difference between a living body and a dead one a difference which ex hypothesi he did not draw all things being animated to his mind and 2 with those human shapes which appear in dreams and visions the ancient savage philosophers probably reached the obvious inference that every man had two things belonging to him a life and a phantom but everything was supposed to have a life as far as one makes out before the idea of separable soul was developed at least if savages arrived at the theory of universal animation as children are said to do  we are dealing here quite conjecturally with facts beyond our experience  in any case early man excogitated by the hypothesis the abstract idea of life before he first envisaged it in material terms as breath or shadow he next decided that mere breath or shadow was not only identical with the more abstract conception of life but could also take on forms as real and fullbodied as to him are the hallucinations of dream or waking vision his reasoning appears to have proceeded from the more abstract the idea of life to the more concrete to the life first shadowy and vaporous then clothed in the very aspect of the real man  mr tylor has thus whether we follow his logic or not provided man with a theory of active intelligent separable souls which can survive the death of the body at this theory early man arrived by speculations on the nature of life and on the causes of phantasms of the dead or living beheld in dreams and visions but our author by no means leaves out of sight the effects of alleged supernormal phenomena believed in by savages with their parallels in modern civilisation these supernormal phenomena whether real or illusory are he conceives facts in that mass of experiences from which savages constructed their belief in separable enduring intelligent souls or ghosts the foundation of religion  while we are perhaps owing to our own want of capacity puzzled by what seem to be two kinds of early philosophy1 a sort of instinctive or unreasoned belief in universal animation which mr spencer calls animism and does not believe in 2 the reasoned belief in separable and surviving souls of men and in things which mr spencer believes in and mr tylor calls animismwe must also note another difficulty mr tylor may seem to be taking it for granted that the earliest remote unknown thinkers on life and the soul were existing on the same psychical plane as we ourselves or at least as modern savages between modern savages and ourselves in this regard he takes certain differences but takes none between modern savages and the remote founders of religion  thus mr tylor observes  the condition of the modern ghostseer whose imagination passes on such slight excitement into positive hallucination is rather the rule than the exception among uncultured and intensely imaginative tribes whose minds may be thrown off their balance by a touch a word a gesture an unaccustomed noise18  i find evidence that low contemporary savages are not great ghostseers and again i cannot quite accept mr tylors psychology of the modern ghostseer most such favoured persons whom i have known were steady unimaginative unexcitable people with just one odd experience lord tennyson too after sleeping in the bed of his recently lost father on purpose to see his ghost decided that ghosts are not seen by imaginative people  we now examine at greater length the psychical conditions in which according to mr tylor contemporary savages differ from civilised men later we shall ask what may be said as to possible or presumable psychical differences between modern savages and the datelessly distant founders of the belief in souls mr tylor attributes to the lower races and even to races high above their level morbid ecstasy brought on by meditation fasting narcotics excitement or disease now we may still meditateand how far the result is morbid is a matter for psychologists and pathologists to determine fasting we do not practise voluntarily nor would we easily accept evidence from an englishman as to the veracity of voluntary fasting visions like those of cotton mather the visions of disease we should set aside as a rule with those of excitement produced for instance by devildances narcotic and alcoholic visions are not in question19 for our purpose the induced trances of savages in whatever way voluntarily brought on are analogous to the modern induced hypnotic trance any supernormal acquisitions of knowledge in these induced conditions among savages would be on a par with similar alleged experiences of persons under hypnotism  we do not differ from known savages in being able to bring on nonnormal psychological conditions but we produce these as a rule by other methods than theirs and such experiments are not made on all of us as they were on all red indian boys and girls in the medicinefast at the age of puberty  further in their normal state known savages or some of them are more suggestible than educated europeans at least20 they can be more easily hallucinated in their normal waking state by suggestion once more their intervals of hunger followed by gorges of food and their lack of artificial light combine to make savages more apt to see what is not there than are comfortable educated white men but mr tylor goes too far when he says where the savage could see phantasms the civilised man has come to amuse himself with fancies21 the civilised man beyond all doubt is capable of being enfantosm√©  in all that he says on this point the point of psychical condition mr tylor is writing about known savages as they differ from ourselves but the savages who ex hypothesi evolved the doctrine of souls lie beyond our ken far behind the modern savages among whom we find belief not only in souls and ghosts but in moral gods about the psychical condition of the savages who worked out the theory of souls and founded religion we necessarily know nothing if there be such experiences as clairvoyance telepathy and so on these unknown ancestors of ours may for all that we can tell have been peculiarly open to them and therefore peculiarly apt to believe in separable souls in fact when we write about these faroff founders of religion we guess in the dark or by the flickering light of analogy the lower animals have faculties as in their power of finding their way home through new unknown regions and in the ants modes of acquiring and communicating knowledge to each other which are mysteries to us the terror of dogs in haunted houses and of horses in passing haunted scenes has often been reported and is alluded to briefly by mr tylor balaams ass and the dogs which crouched and whined before athene whom eumaeus could not see are classical instances  the weakness of the anthropological argument here is we must repeat that we know little more about the mental condition and experiences of the early thinkers who developed the doctrine of souls than we know about the mental condition and experiences of the lower animals and the more firmly a philosopher believes in the darwinian hypothesis the less he must admit can he suppose himself to know about the twilight ages between the lower animal and the fully evolved man what kind of creature was man when he first conceived the germs or received the light of religion all is guesswork here we may just allude to hegels theory that clairvoyance and hypnotic phenomena are produced in a kind of temporary atavism or throwing hack to a remotely ancient condition of the sensitive soul f√ºklende seele the sensitive unconditioned clairvoyant faculty or soul is a disease when it becomes a state of the selfconscious educated selfpossessed human being of civilisation22 second sight hegel thinks was a product of an earlier day and earlier mental condition than ours  approaching this almost untouched subjectthe early psychical condition of mannot from the side of metaphysical speculations like hegel but with the instruments of modern psychology and physiology dr max dessoir of berlin following indeed m taine has arrived as we saw at somewhat similar conclusions this fully conscious life of the spirit in which we moderns now live seems to rest upon a substratum of reflex action of a hallucinatory type our actual modern condition is not fundamental and hallucination represents at least in its nascent condition the main trunk of our psychical existence23  now suppose that the remote and unknown ancestors of ours who first developed the doctrine of souls had not yet spread far from the main trunk of our psychical existence far from constant hallucination in that case at least according to dr dessoirs theory their psychical experiences would be such as we cannot estimate yet cannot leave as a possibility influencing religion out of our calculations  if early men were ever in a condition in which telepathy and clairvoyance granting their possibility were prevalent one might expect that faculties so useful would be developed in the struggle for existence that they are deliberately cultivated by modern savages we know the indian fostermother of john tanner used when food was needed to suggest herself into an hypnotic condition so that she became clairvoyante as to the whereabouts of game tanner an english boy caught early by the indians was sceptical but came to practise the same art not unsuccessfully himself24 his reminiscences which he dictated on his return to civilisation were certainly not feigned in the interests of any theories but the most telepathic human stocks it may be said ought ceteris paribus to have been the most successful in the struggle for existence we may infer that the cetera were not paria the clairvoyant state not being precisely the best for the practical business of life but really we know nothing of the psychical state of the earliest men they may have had experiences tending towards a belief in spirits of which we can tell nothing we are obliged to guess in considerable ignorance of the actual conditions and this historical ignorance inevitably besets all anthropological speculation about the origin of religion  the knowledge of our nescience as to the psychical condition of our first thinking ancestors may suggest hesitation as to taking it for granted that early man was on our own or on the modern savage level in psychical experience even savage races as mr tylor justly says attribute superior psychical knowledge to neighbouring tribes on a yet lower level of culture than themselves the finn esteems the lapp sorcerers above his own the lapp yields to the superior pretensions of the samoyeds there may be more ways than one of explaining this relative humility there is hegels way and there is mr tylors way we cannot be certain a priori that the earliest man knew no more of supernormal or apparently supernormal experiences than we commonly do or that these did not influence his thoughts on animism  it is an example of the chameleonlike changes of science even of science falsely so called if you please that when he wrote his book in 1871 mr tylor could not possibly have anticipated this line of argument  psychical planes had not been invented hypnotism with its problems had not been much noticed in england but spiritualism was flourishing mr tylor did not ignore this revival of savage philosophy he saw very well that the end of the century was beholding the partial rehabilitation of beliefs which were scouted from 1660 to 1850 seventy years ago as mr tylor says dr macculloch in his description of the western islands of scotland wrote of the famous highland second sight that ceasing to be believed it has ceased to exist25  dr macculloch was mistaken in his facts second sight has never ceased to exist or to be believed to exist and it has recently been investigated in the journal of the caledonian medical society mr tylor himself says that it has been reinstated in a far larger range of society and under far better circumstances of learning and prosperity this fact he ascribes generally to a direct revival from the regions of savage philosophy and peasant folklore a revival brought about in great part by the writings of swedenborg today things have altered the students now interested in this whole class of alleged supernormal phenomena are seldom believers in the philosophy of spiritualism in the american sense of the word26  mr tylor as we have seen attributes the revival of interest in this obscure class of subjects to the influence of swedenborg it is true as has been shown that swedenborg attracted the attention of kant but modern interest has chiefly been aroused and kept alive by the phenomena of hypnotism the interest is now among educated students really scientific  thus mr william james professor of psychology in the university of harvard writes  i was attracted to this subject psychical research some years ago by my love of fair play in science27  mr tylor is not incapable of appreciating this attitude even the socalled spirit manifestations he says should be discussed on their merits and the investigation would seem apt to throw light on some most interesting psychological questions nothing can be more remote from the logic of hume  the ideas of mr tylor on the causes of the origin of religion are now criticised not from the point of view of spiritualism but of experimental psychology we hold that very probably there exist human faculties of unknown scope that these conceivably were more powerful and prevalent among our very remote ancestors who founded religion that they may still exist in savage as in civilised races and that they may have confirmed if they did not originate the doctrine of separable souls if they do exist the circumstance is important in view of the fact that modern ideas rest on a denial of their existence  mr tylor next examines the savage and other names for the ghostsoul such as shadow umbra breath spiritus and he gives cases in which the shadow of a man is regarded as equivalent to his life of course the shadow in the sunlight does not resemble the phantasm in a dream the two however were combined and identified by early thinkers while breath and heart were used as symbols of that in men which makes them live a phrase found among the natives of nicaragua in 1528 the confessedly symbolical character of the phrase it is not precisely the heart but that in them which makes them live proves that to the speaker life was not heart or breath but that these terms were known to be material wordcounters for the conception of life1 whether the earliest thinkers identified heart breath shadow with life or whether they consciously used words of material origin to denote an immaterial conception of course we do not know but the word in the latter case would react on the thought till the roman inhaled as his life the last breath of his dying kinsman he well knowing that the manes of the said kinsman were elsewhere and not to be inhaled  subdivisions and distinctions were then recognised as of the egyptian ka the double the karen kelah or personal lifephantom wraith on one side and the karen thah the responsible moral soul on the other the roman umbra hovers about the grave the manes go to orcus the spiritus seeks the stars  we are next presented with a crowd of cases in which sickness or lethargy is ascribed by savages to the absence of the patients spirit or of one of his spirits this idea of migratory spirit is next used by savages to explain certain proceedings of the sorcerer priest or seer his soul or one of his souls is thought to go forth to distant places in quest of information while the seer perhaps remains lethargic probably in the struggle for existence he lost more by being lethargic than he gained by being clairvoyant  now here we touch the first point in mr tylors theory where a critic may ask was this belief in the wandering abroad of the seers spirit a theory not only false in its form as probably it is but also wholly unbased on experiences which might raise a presumption in favour of the existence of phenomena really supernormal by supernormal experiences i here mean such as the acquisition by a human mind of knowledge which could not be obtained by it through the recognised channels of sensation say for the sake of argument that a person savage or civilised obtains in trance information about distant places or events to him unknown and through channels of sense unknowable the savage will explain this by saying that the seers soul shadow or spirit wandered out of the body to the distant scene this is at present an unverified theory but still for the sake of argument suppose that the seer did honestly obtain this information in trance lethargy or hypnotic sleep or any other condition if so the modern savage or his more gifted ancestors would have other grounds for his theory of the wandering soul than any ground presented by normal occurrences ordinary dreams shadows and so forth again in human nature there would be if such things occur a potentiality of experiences other and stranger than materialism will admit as possible it will granting the facts be impossible to aver that there is nihil in intellectu quod non prius in sensu the soul will be not ce quun vain peuple pense under the new popular tradition and the savages theory of the spirit will be at least in part based on other than normal and everyday facts that condition in which the seer acquires information not otherwise accessible about events remote in space is what the mesmerists of the midcentury called travelling clairvoyance  if such an experience be in rerum natura it will not of course justify the savages theory that the soul is a separable entity capable of voyaging and also capable of existing after the death of the body but it will give the savage a better excuse for his theory than normal experiences provide and will even raise a presumption that reflection on mere ordinary experiencesdeath shadow tranceis not the sole origin of his theory for a savage so acute as mr tylors hypothetical early reasoner might decline to believe that his own or a friends soul had been absent on an expedition unless it brought back information not normally to be acquired however we cannot reason a priori as to how far the logic of a savage might or might not go on occasion  in any case a scientific reasoner might be expected to ask is this alleged acquisition of knowledge not through the ordinary channels of sense a thing in rerum natura because if it is we must obviously increase our list of the savages reasons for believing in a soul we must make his reasons include psychical experiences and there must be an x region to investigate  these considerations did not fail to present themselves to mr tylor but his manner of dealing with them is peculiar with his unequalled knowledge of the lower races it was easy for him to examine travellers tales about savage seers who beheld distant events in vision and to allow them what weight he thought proper after discounting possibilities of falsehood and collusion he might then have examined modern narratives of similar performances among the civilised which are abundant it is obvious and undeniable that if the supernormal acquisition of knowledge in trance is a vera causa a real process however rare mr tylors theory needs modifications while the character of the savages reasoning becomes more creditable to the savage and appears as better bottomed than we had been asked to suppose but mr tylor does not examine this large body of evidence at all or at least does not offer us the details of his examination he merely writes in this place  a typical spiritualistic instance may be quoted from jungstilling who says that examples have come to his knowledge of sick persons who longing to see absent friends have fallen into a swoon during which they have appeared to the distant objects of their affection29  jungstilling though he wrote before modern spiritualism came in is not a very valid authority there is plenty of better evidence than his but mr tylor passes it by merely remarking that modern europe has kept closely enough to the lines of early philosophy modern europe has indeed done so if it explains the supernormal acquisition of knowledge or the hallucinatory appearance of a distant person to his friend by a theory of wandering spirits but facts do not cease to be facts because wrong interpretations have been put upon them by savages by jungstilling or by anyone else the real question is do such events occur among lower and higher races beyond explanation by fraud and fortuitous coincidence we gladly grant that the belief in animism when it takes the form of a theory of wandering spirits is probably untenable as it is assuredly of savage origin but we are not absolutely so sure that in this aspect the theory is not based on actual experiences not of a normal and ordinary kind if so the savage philosophy and its supposed survivals in belief will appear in a new light and we are inclined to hold that an examination of the mass of evidence to which mr tylor offers here so slight an allusion will at least make it wise to suspend our judgment not only as to the origins of the savage theory of spirits but as to the materialistic hypothesis of the absence of a psychical element in man  i may seem to have outrun already the limits of permissible hypothesis it may appear absurd to surmise that there can exist in man savage or civilised a faculty for acquiring information not accessible by the known channels of sense a faculty attributed by savage philosophers to the wandering soul but one may be permitted to quote the opinion of m charles richet professor of physiology in the faculty of medicine in paris it is not cited because m richet is a professor of physiology but because he reached his conclusion after six years of minute experiment he says there exists in certain persons at certain moments a faculty of acquiring knowledge which has no rapport with our normal faculties of that kind30  instances tending to raise a presumption in favour of m

what is called clairvoyance or vue √† distance this if it exists is the result of a faculty of undetermined nature whereby knowledge of remote events may be acquired not through normal channels of sense as the zulus say isiyezi is a state in which a man becomes slightly insensible he is awake but still sees things which he would not see if he were not in a state of ecstasy nasiyesi1 the zulu description of isiyezi includes what is technically styled dissociation no psychologist or pathologist will deny that visions of an hallucinatory sort may occur in dissociated states say in the petit mal of epilepsy the question however is whether any such visions convey actual information not otherwise to be acquired beyond the reach of chance coincidence to explain  a scottish example from the records of a court of law exactly illustrates the zulu theory at the moment when the husband of jonka dyneis was in danger six miles from her house in his boat jonka was found and seen standing at her own house wall in a trance and being taken she could not give answer but stood as bereft of her senses and when she was asked why she was so moved she answered if our boat be not lost she was in great hazard october 2 16162  the belief in opening the gates of distance is of course very widely diffused the gift is attributed to apollonius of tyana to plotinus to many saints to catherine de medici to the rev mr peden3 and to jeanne darc while the faculty is the stock in trade of savage seers in all regions4  the question however on which mr tylor does not touch is are any of the stories true if so of course they would confirm in the mind of the savage his theory of the wandering soul now to find anything like attested cases of successful clairvoyance among savages is a difficult task white men either scout the idea or are afraid of seeming superstitious if they give examples or if they do give examples are accused of having sunk to the degraded level of zulus or red indians even where travellers like scheffer have told about their own experiences the narratives are omitted by modern writers on savage divination5 we must therefore make our own researches and it is to be noted that the stories of successful savage clairvoyance are given as illustrations merely not as evidence to facts for we cannot crossexamine the witnesses  mr tylor dismisses the topic in a manner rather cavalier  without discussing on their merits the accounts of what is called second sight6 it may be pointed out that they are related among savage tribes as when captain jonathan carver obtained from a cree medicineman a true prophecy of the arrival of a canoe with news next day at noon or when mr j mason brown travelling with two voyageurs on the copper mine river was met by indians of the very band he was seeking these having been sent by their medicineman who on enquiry stated that he saw them coming and heard them talk on their journey7  now in our opinion the merits of stories of second sight need discussion because they may if well attested raise a presumption that the savages theory has a better foundation than mr tylor supposes oddly enough though mr tylor does not say so dr brinton from whom he borrows his two anecdotes is more or less of our opinion  there are says dr brinton statements supported by unquestionable testimony which ought not to be passed over in silence and yet i cannot but approach them with hesitation they are so revolting to the laws of exact science so alien i had almost said to the experience of our lives yet is this true or are such experiences only ignored and put aside without serious consideration  that is exactly what we complain of the alleged facts are put aside without serious consideration  we at least are not slaves to the idea that the laws of exact science must be the only laws at work in the world science however exact does not pretend to have discovered all laws  to return to actual examples of the alleged supernormal acquisition of knowledge by savages dr brinton gives an example from charlevoix and general mason browns anecdote8 in general mason browns instance the medicineman at a great distance bade his emissaries seek three whites whose horses arms attire and personal appearance he minutely described which description was repeated to general brown by the warriors before they saw his two companions general brown assured dr brinton of the accuracy of this in every particular mr tylor has certainly not improved the story in his condensed version dr brinton refers to many tales such as these and some will be found in among the zulus by mr david leslie 1875  mr leslie was a scottish sportsman brought up from boyhood in familiarity with the zulus his knowledge of their language and customs was minute and his book privately printed contains much interesting matter he writes  i was obliged to proceed to the zulu country to meet my kaffir elephanthunters the time for their return having arrived they were hunting in a very unhealthy country and i had agreed to wait for them on the northeast border the nearest point i could go to with safety i reached the appointed rendezvous but could not gain the slightest intelligence of my people at the kraal  after waiting some time and becoming very uneasy about them one of my servants recommended me to go to the doctor and at last out of curiosity and pour passer le temps i did go  i stated what i wantedinformation about my huntersand i was met by a stern refusal i cannot tell anything about white men said he and i know nothing of their ways however after some persuasion and promise of liberal payment impressing upon him the fact that it was not white men but kaffirs i wanted to know about he at last consented saying he would open the gate of distance and would travel through it even although his body should lie before me  his first proceeding was to ask me the number and names of my hunters to this i demurred telling him that if he obtained that information from me he might easily substitute some news which he may have heard from others instead of the spiritual telegraphic news which i expected him to get from his familiar  to this he answered i told you i did not understand white mens ways but if i am to do anything for you it must be done in my waynot yours on receiving this fillip i felt inclined to give it up as i thought i might receive some rambling statement with a considerable dash of truth it being easy for anyone who knew anything of hunting to give a tolerably correct idea of their motions  however i conceded this point also and otherwise satisfied him  the doctor then made eight little firesthat being the number of my hunters on each he cast some roots9 which emitted a curious sickly odour and thick smoke into each he cast a small stone shouting as he did so the name to which the stone was dedicated then he ate some medicine and fell over in what appeared to be a trance for about ten minutes during all which time his limbs kept moving then he seemed to wake went to one of the fires raked the ashes about looked at the stone attentively described the man faithfully and said this man has died of the fever and your gun is lost  to the next fire as before this man correctly described has killed four elephants and then he described the tusks the next this man again describing him has been killed by an elephant but your gun is coming home and so on through the whole the men being minutely and correctly described their success or nonsuccess being equally so i was told where the survivors were and what they were doing and that in three months they would come out but as they would not expect to find me waiting on them there so long after the time appointed they would not pass that way  i took a particular note of all this information at the time and to my utter amazement it turned out correct in every particular  it was scarcely within the bounds of possibility that this man could have had ordinary intelligence of the hunters they were scattered about in a country two hundred miles away  mr leslie could discover no explanation nor was any suggested by friends familiar with the country and the natives whom he consulted he gives another example which may be explained by suggestion a parallel case from central africa will be found in the journal of the anthropological institute november 1897 p 320 where private information as usual would explain the singular facts  the zulus themselves lay claim to a kind of clairvoyance which looks like the result of intense visualising power combined with the awakening of the subconscious memory10  there is among black men a something which is divination within them when anything valuable is lost they look for it at once when they cannot find it each one begins to practise this inner divination trying to feel where the thing is for not being able to see it he feels internally a pointing which tells him if he will go down to such a place it is there and he will find it at length it says he will find it at length he sees it and himself approaching it before he begins to move from where he is he sees it very clearly indeed and there is an end of doubt that sight is so clear that it is as though it was not an inner sight but as if he saw the very thing itself and the place where it is so he quickly arises and goes to the place if it is a hidden place he throws himself into it as though there was something that impelled him to go as swiftly as the wind and in fact he finds the thing if he has not acted by mere headguessing if it has been done by real inner divination he really sees it but if it is done by mere headguessing and knowledge that he has not gone to such a place and such a place and that therefore it must be in such another place he generally misses the mark  other zulu instances will be given under the heads possession and fetishism  to take a northern people in his history of the lapps11 scheffer describes mechanical modes of divination practised by that race who use a drum and other objects for the purpose these modes depend on more traditional rules for interpreting the accidental combinations of lots but a lapp confessed to scheffer with tears that he could not help seeing visions as he proved by giving scheffer a minute relation of whatever particulars had happened to me in my journey to lapland and he further complained that he know not how to make use of his eyes since things altogether distant were presented to them this lapp was anxious to become a christian hence his regret at being a rare and valuable example of clairvoyance torfaeus also was posed by the clairvoyance of a samoyed as was regnard by a lapp seer12  the next case is of old date and like the other savage examples is merely given for purposes of illustration    25e lettre13    suite des traditions des sauvages    au fort de la rivi√®re de st joseph ce 14 septembre 1721    des jongleurs  vous ayez vu √† paris madame de marson  elle   y est encore voici ce que m le marquis de vaudreuil son gendre   actuellement notre gouverneur g√©n√©ral me raconta cet hyver  quil a   s√ß√ª de cette dame qui nest rien mo√≠ns quun esprit foible elle etoit   un jour fort inquiette an sujet de m de marson son mari lequel   commandoit dans un poste que nous avions en accadie et etoit absent    le tems quil avoit marqu√© pour son retour etoit pass√©    une femme sauvage qui vit madame de marson en peine lui en demanda la   cause  layant apprise lui dit apr√®s y avoir un peu r√™v√© de ne plus   se chagriner que son epoux reviendroit tel jour et √† telle heure   quelle lui marqua avec un chapeau gris sur la t√™te comme elle   sapper√ßut que la dame najoutoit point foi √† sa pr√©diction au jour  √†   lheure quelle avoit assign√©e elle rotourna chez elle lui demanda si   elle ne vouloit pas venir voir arriver son mari  la pressa de telle   sorte de la suivre quelle lentra√Æna au bord de la rivi√®re    a peine y eto√≠entelles arriv√©es que m de marson parut dans un canot   un chapeau gris sur la t√™te  ayant appris ce qui setoit pass√© ass√ªra   quil ne pouvoit pas comprendre comment la sauvagesse avoit p√ª s√ßavoir   lheure  le jour de son arriv√©e  it is unusual for european travellers and missionaries to give anecdotes which might seem to confirm the delusions of benighted savages such anecdotes again are among the arcana of these wild philosophers and are not readily communicated to strangers when successful cases are reported it is natural to assert that they come through europeans who have sunk into barbarous superstition or that they may be explained by fraud and collusion it is certain however that savage proficients believe in their own powers though no less certainly they will eke them out by imposture seers are chosen in zululand as among eskimos and samoyeds from the class which in europe supplies the persons who used to be but are no longer the most favourite hypnotic subjects abnormal children epileptic and hysterical these are subjected to a long and methodical course of training14 stoll speaking of guatemala says that certainly most of the induced and spontaneous phenomena with which we are familiar occur among savages and appeals to travellers for observations15 information is likely to come in as educated travellers devote attention to the topic  dr callaway translates some zulu communications which indicate the amount of belief in this very practical and sceptical people amusing illustrations of their scepticism will be quoted later under possession but they do accept as seers certain hysterical patients these are tested by their skill in finding objects which have been hidden without their knowledge they then behave much like mr stuart cumberland but have not the advantage of muscular contact with the person who knows where the hidden objects are concealed the neighbours even deny that they have hidden anything at all when they persist in their denial  he finds all the things that they have hidden they see that he is a great inyanga seer when he has found all the things they have concealed no doubt he is guided perhaps in a supersensitive condition by the unconscious indications of the excited spectators  the point is that while the savage conjurer will doubtless use fraud wherever he can still the experience of low races is in favour of employing as seers the class of people who in europe were till recently supposed to make the best hypnotic subjects thus in west africa the presiding elders during your initiation to the secret society of your tribe discover this gift of ebumtupism or second sight and so select you as a witch doctor15 among the karens the wees or prophets are nervous excitable men such as would become mediums16 as mediums are diagnosed by mr tylor  in short not to multiply examples there is an element of actual observation and of bona fides entangled in the trickery of savage practice though the subjects may be selected partly because of the physical phenomena of convulsions which they exhibit and which favourably impress their clients they are also such subjects as occasionally yield that evidence of supernormal faculty which is investigated by modern psychologists like richet janet and william james  the following example by no means unique shows the view taken by savages of their own magic after they have become christians catherine wabose a converted red indian seeress described her preliminary fast at the age of puberty after six days of abstention from food she was rapt away to an unknown place where a radiant being welcomed her later a dark round object promised her the gift of prophecy she found her natural senses greatly sharpened by lack of food she first exercised her powers when her kinsfolk in large numbers were starving a medicinelodge or tabernacle as lufitau calls it was built for her and she crawled in as is well known these lodges are violently shaken during the magicians stay within them which the early jesuits at first attributed to muscular efforts by the seers in 1637 p√®re lejeune was astonished by the violent motions of a large lodge tenanted by a small man one sorcerer with an appearance of candour vowed that a great wind entered boisterously and the father was assured that if he went in himself he would become clairvoyant he did not make the experiment the methodist convert catherine gave the same description of her own experience the lodge began shaking violently by supernatural means i knew this by the compressed current of air above and the noise of motion she had been beating a small drum and singing now she lay quiet the radiant orbicular spirit then informed her that they must go westwards for game how shortsighted you are the advice was taken and crowned by instant success this established her reputation17 catherines conversion was led up to by a dream of her dying son who beheld a sacred figure and received from him white raiment her magical songs tell how unseen hands shake the magic lodge they invoke the great spirit that      illumines earth     illumines heaven   ah say what spirit or body is this body     that fills the world around     speak man ah say   what spirit or body is this body  it is like a savage hymn to hegels f√ºhlende seele the allpervading sensitive soul we are reminded too of the doctrine of the sanscrit upanishads there is no limit to the knowing of the self that knows18  unluckily catherine was not asked to give other examples of what she considered her successes  acosta who has not the best possible repute as an authority informs us that peruvian clairvoyants tell what hath passed in the furthest parts before news can come in the distance of two or three hundred leagues they would tell what the spaniards did or suffered in their civil wars to du pont in 1606 a sorcerer rendered a true oracle of the coming of poutrincourt saying his devil had told him so19  we now give a modern case from a scientific laboratory of knowledge apparently acquired in no normal way by a person of the sort usually chosen to be a prophet or wizard by savages  professor richet writes20  on monday july 2 1888 after having passed all the day in my laboratory i hypnotised l√©onie at 8 pm and while she tried to make out a diagram concealed in an envelope i said to her quite suddenly what has happened to m langlois l√©onie knows m langlois from having seen him two or three times some time ago in my physiological laboratory where he acts as my assistanthe has burnt himself l√©onie repliedgood i said and where has he burnt himselfon the left hand it is not fire it isi dont know its name why does he not take care when he pours it outof what colour i asked is the stuff which he pours outit is not red it is brown he has hurt himself very muchthe skin puffed up directly  now this description is admirably exact at 4 pm that day m langlois had wished to pour some bromine into a bottle he had done this clumsily so that some of the bromine flowed on to his left hand which held the funnel and at once burnt him severely although he at once put his hand into water wherever the bromine had touched it a blister was formed in a few secondsa blister which one could not better describe than by saying the skin puffed up i need not say that l√©onie had not left my house nor seen anyone from my laboratory of this i am absolutely certain and i am certain that i had not mentioned the incident of the burn to anyone moreover this was the first time for nearly a year that m langlois had handled bromine and when l√©onie saw him six months before at the laboratory he was engaged in experiments of quite another kind  here the savage reasoner would infer that l√©onies spirit had visited m langlois the modern inquirer will probably say that l√©onie became aware of what was passing in the mind of m richet this supranormal way of acquiring knowledge was observed in the last century by m de puys√©gur in one of his earliest cases of somnambulism mm binet and f√©r√© say it is not yet admitted that the subject is able to divine the thoughts of the magnetiser without any material communication while they grant as a minimum that research should be continued in this direction21 they appear to think that l√©onie may have read involuntary signs in the aspect of m richet this is a difficult hypothesis  here follows a case recorded in his diary by mr dobbie of adelaide australia who has practised hypnotism for curative purposes he explains june 10 1884 that he had mesmerised miss  on several occasions to relieve rheumatic pain and sore throat he found her to be clairvoyant  the following is a verbatim account of the second time i tested her powers in this respect april 12 1884 there were four persons present during the s√©ance one of the company wrote down the replies as they were spoken  her father was at the time over fifty miles away but we did not know exactly where so i questioned her as follows can you find your father at the present moment at first she replied that she could not see him but in a minute or two she said oh yes now i can see him mr dobbie where is he sitting at a large table in a large room and there are a lot of people going in and out what is he doing writing a letter and there is a book in front of him whom is he writing to to the newspaper here she paused and laughingly said well i declare he is writing to the a b naming a newspaper you said there was a book there can you tell me what book it is it has gilt letters on it can you read them or tell me the name of the author she read or pronounced slowly wlw giving the full surname of the author she answered several minor questions re the furniture in the room and i then said to her is it any effort or trouble to you to travel in this way yes a little i have to think  i now stood behind her holding a halfcrown in my hand and asked her if she could tell me what i had in my hand to which she replied it is a shilling it seemed as though she could see what was happening miles away easier than she could see what was going on in the room  her father returned home nearly a week afterwards and was perfectly astounded when told by his wife and family what he had been doing on that particular evening and although previous to that date he was a thorough sceptic as to clairvoyance he frankly admitted that my clairvoyant was perfectly correct in every particular he also informed us that the book referred to was a new one which he had purchased after he had left his home so that there was no possibility of his daughter guessing that he had the book before him i may add that the letter in due course appeared in the paper and i saw and handled the book  a number of cases of socalled clairvoyance will be found in the proceedings of the society for psychical research22 as the authors of these essays remark even after discounting in each case fraud malobservation and misreporting the residue of cases can seldom justify either the savage theory of the wandering soul which is not here seriously proposed or hegels theory that the f√ºhlende seele is unconditioned by space for if thought transference be a fact the apparent clairvoyant may only be reading the mind of a person at a distance the results however when successful would naturally suggest to the savage thinker the belief in the wandering soul or corroborate it if it had already been suggested by the common phenomena of dreaming  to these instances of knowledge acquired otherwise than by the recognised channels of sense we might add the scottish tales of second sight that phrase is merely a local term covering examples of what is called clairvoyanceviews of things remote in space hallucinations of sight that coincide with some notable event premonitions of things future and so on the belief and hallucinatory experiences are still very common in the highlands where i have myself collected many recent instances mr tylor observes that the examples prove a little too much they vouch not only for human apparitions but for such phantoms as demon dogs and for still more fanciful symbolic omens this is perfectly true i have found no cases of demon dogs but wandering lights probably of meteoric or miasmatic origin are certainly regarded as tokens of death this is obviously a superstitious hypothesis the lights being real phenomena misconstrued again funerals are not uncommonly seen where no funeral is taking place it is then alleged that a real funeral similar and similarly situated soon afterwards occurred on the hypothesis of believers the percipients somehow behold    such refraction of events     as often rises ere they rise  even the savage cannot account for this experience by the wandering of the soul in space nor do i suggest any explanation i give however one or two instances they are published in the journal of the caledonian medical society 1897 by dr alastair macgregor on the authority of the mss of his father a minister in the island of skye  he once told me that when he first went to skye he scoffed at the idea of such a power as second sight being genuine but he said that after having been there for some years as a clergyman he had been so often consulted beforehand by people who said they had seen visions of events which subsequently occurred to my fathers knowledge in exact accordance with the form and details of the vision as foretold that he was compelled to confess that some folks had apparently at least the unfortunate faculty  as my father expressed it this faculty was neither voluntary nor constant and was considered rather annoying than agreeable to the possessors of it the gift was possessed by individuals of both sexes and its fits came on within doors and without sitting and standing at night and by day and at whatever employment the votary might chance to be engaged  here follows a typical example of the vision of a funeral  the session clerk at dull a small village in perthshire was ill and my grandfather clergyman there at the time had to do duty for him one fine summer evening about 7 oclock a young man and woman came to get some papers filled up as they were going to be married my grandfather was with the couple in the session clerks room no doubt attending to the papers when suddenly all three saw through the window a funeral procession passing along the road from their dress the bulk of the mourners seemed to be farm labourersindeed the young woman recognised some of them as natives of dull who had gone to live and work near dunkeld remarks were naturally made by my grandfather and the young couple about the untimely hour for a funeral and hastily filling in the papers my grandfather went out to get the key of the churchyard which was kept in the manse as without the key the procession could not get into gods acre wondering how it was that he had received no intimation of the funeral he went to the manse by a short cut got the key and hurried down to the churchyard gate where of course he expected to find the cort√®ge waiting not a soul was there except the young couple who were as amazed as my grandfather  well at the same hour in the evening of the same day in the following week the funeral this time in reality arrived quite unexpectedly the facts were that a boy a native of dull had got gored by a bull at dunkeld and was so shockingly mangled that his remains were picked up and put into a coffin and taken without delay to dull a grave was dug as quickly as possiblethe poor lad having no relativesand the remains were interred my grandfather and the young couple recognised several of the mourners as being among those whom they had seen out of the session clerks room exactly a week previously in the phantom cort√®ge the young woman knew some of them personally and related to them what she had seen but they of course denied all knowledge of the affair having been then in dunkeld  i give another example because the experience was auditory as well as visual and the prediction was announced before the event  the parishioners in skye were evidently largely imbued with the romanistlike belief in the powers of intercession vested in their clergyman so when they had a warning or vision they usually consulted my father as to what they could do to prevent the coming disaster befalling their relatives or friends in this way my father had the opportunity of noting down the minutiae of the warning or vision directly it was told him having had the advantage of a medical previous to his theological training he was able to note down sound facts unembellished by superadded imagination entering into this method of casetaking with a mind perfectly open except for a slight touch of scepticism he was greatly surprised to discover how very frequently realisations occurred exactly in conformance with the minutiae of the vision as detailed in his notebook finally he was compelled to discard his scepticism and to admit that some people had undoubtedly the uncanny gift almost the first case he took case x was that of a woman who had one day a vision of her son falling over a high rock at uig in skye with a sheep or lamb  case xshe heard her son exclaim in gaelic this is a fatal lamb for me as her son lived several miles from uig and was a fisherman realisation seemed to my father very unlikely but one month afterwards the realisation occurred only too true unknown to his mother who had warned him against having anything to do with sheep or lambs the son one day instead of going out in his boat thought he would take a holiday inland and went off to uig where a farmer enlisted his services in separating some lambs from the ewes one of the lambs ran away and the fisher lad ran headlong after it and not looking where he was going on catching the lamb was pulled by it to the edge of one of the very picturesque but exceedingly dangerous rocks at uig too late realizing his critical position he exclaimed this is a fatal lamb for me but going with such an impetus he was unable to bring himself up in time and along with the lamb fell over into the ravine below and was of course killed on the spot the farmer when he saw the lads danger ran to his assistance but was only in time to hear him cry out in gaelic before disappearing over the brink of the precipice this was predicted by the mother a month before was this simply a coincidence  dr macgregors remarks on the involuntary and unwelcome nature of the visions is borne out by what scheffer as already quoted says concerning the lapps  in addition to visions which thus come unsought contributing knowledge of things remote or even future we may glance at visions which are provoked by various methods drugs impepo are used seers whirl in a wild dance till they fall senseless or trance is induced by various kinds of selfsuggestion or autohypnotism fasting is also practised in modern life the selfinduced trance is common among mediumsa subject to which we recur later  so far it will be observed our evidence proves that precisely similar beliefs as to mans occasional power of opening the gates of distance have been entertained in a great variety of lands and ages and by races in every condition of culture23 the alleged experiences are still said to occur and have been investigated by physiologists of the eminence of m richet the question cannot but arise as to the residuum of fact in these narrations and it keeps on arising  in the following chapter we discuss a mode of inducing hallucinations which has for anthropologists the interest of universal diffusion the width of its range in savage races has not we believe been previously observed we then add facts of modern experience about the authenticity of which we personally entertain no doubt and the provisional conclusion appears to be that savages have observed a psychological circumstance which has been ignored by professed psychologists and which certainly does not fit into the ordinary materialistic hypothesis  footnote 1 callaway religion of the zulus p 232  footnote 2 graham dalzell darker superstitions of scotland p 481  footnote 3 see good evidence in ker of kerslands memoirs

familiar for quotation     v  crystal visions savage and civilised  among savage methods of provoking hallucinations whence knowledge may be supernormally obtained various forms of crystalgazing are the most curious we find the habit of looking into water usually in a vessel preferably a glass vessel among red indians lejeune romans varro cited in civitas dei iii 457 africans of fez leo africanus while maoris use a drop of blood taylor egyptians use ink lane and australian savages employ a ball of polished stone into which the seer puts himself to descry the results of an expedition1  i have already given in the introduction elliss record of the polynesian case a hole being dug in the door of his house and filled with water the priest looks for a vision of the thief who has carried off stolen goods the polynesian theory is that the god carries the spirit of the thief over the water in which it is reflected lejeunes red indians make their patients gaze into the water in which they will see the pictures of the things in the way of food or medicine that will do them good in modern language the instinctive knowledge existing implicitly in the patients subconsciousness is thus brought into the range of his ordinary consciousness  in 1887 the late captain j t bourke of the us cavalry an original and careful observer visited the apaches in the interests of the ethnological bureau he learned that one of the chief duties of the medicinemen was to find out the whereabouts of lost or stolen property naacha one of these jossakeeds possessed a magic quartz crystal which he greatly valued captain bourke presented him with a still finer crystal he could not give me an explanation of its magical use except that by looking into it he could see everything he wanted to see captain bourke appears never to have heard of the modern experiments in crystalgazing captain bourke also discovered that the apaches like the greeks australians africans maoris and many other races use the bullroarer turndun or rhombosa piece of wood which being whirled round causes a strange windy roarin their mystic ceremonies the wide use of the rhombos was known to captain bourke that of the crystal was not  for the iroquois mrs erminie smith supplies information about the crystal placed in a gourd of water it could render visible the apparition of a person who has bewitched another she gives a case in european times of a medicineman who found the witchs habitat but got only an indistinct view of her face on a second trial he was successful2 one may add that treasureseekers among the huilleche look earnestly for what they want to find into a smooth slab of black stone which i suppose to be basalt3  the kindness of monsieur lef√©bure enables me to give another example from madagascar4 flacourt describing the malagasies says that they squillent a word not in littr√© that is divine by crystals which fall from heaven when it thunders of course the rain reveals the crystals as it does the flint instruments called thunderbolts in many countries lorsquils squillent ils ont une de ces pierres au coing de leurs tablettes disans quelle √† la vertu de faire faire operation √† leur figure de geomance probably they used the crystals as do the apaches on july 15 a malagasy woman viewed whether in her crystal or otherwise two french vessels which like the spanish fleet were not in sight also officers and doctors and others aboard whom she had seen before their return to france in madagascar the earliest of the ships did not arrive till august 11  dr callaway gives the zulu practice where the chief sees what will happen by looking into the vessel5 the shamans of siberia and eastern russia employ the same method6 the case of the inca yupanqui is very curious as he came up to a fountain he saw a piece of crystal fall into it within which he beheld a figure of an indian in the following shape  the apparition then vanished while the crystal remained the inca took care of it and they say that he afterwards saw everything he wanted in it7  here then we find the belief that hallucinations can be induced by one or other form of crystalgazing in ancient peru on the other side of the continent among the huilleche in fez in madagascar in siberia among apaches hurons iroquois australian black fellows maoris and in polynesia this is assuredly a wide range of geographical distribution we also find the practice in greece pausanias vii xxi 12 in rome varro in egypt and in india  though anthropologists have paid no attention to the subject it was of course familiar to later europe miss x has traced it among early christians in early councils in episcopal condemnations of specularii and so to dr dee under james vi aubrey the regent dorl√©ans in st simons memoirs the modern mesmerists gregory mayo and the midvictorian spiritualists who as usual explained the phenomena in their prehistoric way by spirits8 till this lady examined the subject nobody had thought of remarking that a belief so universal had probably some basis of facts or nobody if we except two professors of chemistry and physiology drs gregory and mayo miss x made experiments beginning by accident like george sand when a child  the hallucinations which appear to her eyes in ink or crystal are    1 revived memories arising thus and thus only from the subconscious   strata    2 objectivation of ideas or imagesa consciously or b   unconsciouslyin the mind of the percipient    3 visions possibly telepathic or clairvoyant implying acquirement of   knowledge by supernormal means9  the examples given of the last class the class which would be so useful to a priest or medicineman asked to discover things lost are of very slight interest10  since miss x drew attention to this subject experiments have proved beyond doubt that a fair percentage of people sane and healthy can see vivid landscapes and figures of persons in motion in glass balls and other vehicles this faculty dr parish attributes to dissociation practically to drowsiness but he speaks by conjecture and without having witnessed experiments as will be shown later i now offer a series of experiments with a glass ball coming under my own observation in which knowledge was apparently acquired in no ordinary way of the absence of fraud i am personally convinced not only by the characters of all concerned but by the nature of the circumstances that adaptive memory did not later alter the narratives as originally told i feel certain because they were reported to me when i was not present within less than a week precisely as they are now given except in cases specially noted  early in the present year 1897 i met a young lady who told me of three or four curious hallucinatory experiences of her own which were sufficiently corroborated she was innocent of psychical studies and personally was and is in perfect health the pale cast of thought being remote from her i got a glass ball and was present when she first looked into it she saw i remember the interior of a house with a fulllength portrait of a person unknown there were i think one or two other fancy pictures of the familiar kind but she presently living as she was among strangers developed a power of seeing persons and places unknown to her but familiar to them these experiences do seem to me to be good examples of what is called thought transference indeed i never before could get out of a level balance of doubt on that subject a balance which now leans considerably to the affirmative side there may be abundance of better evidence but knowing the persons and circumstances and being present once at what seemed to me a crucial example i was more inclined to be convinced this attitude appears to myself illogical but it is natural and usual  we cannot tell what indications may be accidentally given in experiments in thought transference but in these cases of crystalgazing the detail was too copious to be conveyed by a lookeron in a wink or a cough i do not mean to say that success was invariable i thought of dr wg grace and the scryer saw an old man crawling along with a stick but i doubt if dr grace is very deeply seated in that mystic entity my subconscious self the scries which came right were sometimes but not always those of which the agent or person scried for was consciously thinking but the examples will illustrate the various kinds of occurrences  here one should first consider the arguments against accepting recognition of objects merely described by another person the crystalgazer may know the inquirer so intimately as to have a very good guess at the subject of his meditation again a man is likely to be thinking of a woman and a woman of a man so the field of conjecture is limited in answer to the first objection i may say that the crystalgazer was among strangers all of whom myself included she now saw for the first time nor could she have studied their histories beforehand for she could not know normally when she left home that she was about to be shown a glass ball or whom she would meet the second objection is met by the circumstance that ladies were not usually picked out for men nor men for women indeed these choices were the exceptions and in each case were marked by minutely particular details a third objection is that credulity or the love of strange novelties or desire to oblige biases the inquirers and makes them anxious to recognise something familiar in the scryers descriptions in the same way we know how people recognise faces in the most blurred and vague of spiritist photographs or see family resemblances in the most rudimentary doughfaced babies take descriptions of persons in a passport or in a proclamation sketching the personal appearance of a criminal these fit the men or women intended but they also fit a crowd of other people the description given by the scryer then may come right by a fortuitous coincidence or may be too credulously recognised  the complex of coincidences however could not be attributed to chance selection out of the whole possible field of conjecture we must remember too that a series of such hits increases at an enormous rate the odds against accidental conjecture of such mere luck i may give an example i was writing a story of which the hero was george kelly one of the seven men of moidart a year after composing my tale i found the government description of mr kelly 1736 it exactly tallied with my purely fanciful sketch down to eyes and teeth and face except that i made my hero about six feet whereas the government gave him five feet ten but i knew beforehand that mr kelly was a clergyman his curious career proved him to be a person of great activity and genialityand he was of irish birth even a dozen such guesses equally correct could not suggest any powers of vision when so much was known beforehand about the person guessed at i now give cases in the experience of miss angus as one may call the crystalgazer the first occurred the day after she got the glass ball for the first time she writes  ia lady one day asked me to scry out a friend of whom she would think almost immediately i exclaimed here is an old old lady looking at me with a triumphant smile on her face she has a prominent nose and nutcracker chin her face is very much wrinkled especially at the sides of her eyes as if she were always smiling she is wearing a little white shawl with a black edge but  she cant be old as her hair is quite brown although her face looks so very very old the picture then vanished and the lady said that i had accurately described her friends mother instead of himself that it was a family joke that the mother must dye her hair it was so brown and she was eightytwo years old the lady asked me if the vision were distinct enough for me to recognise a likeness in the sons photograph next day she laid several photographs before me and in a moment without the slightest hesitation i picked him out from his wonderful likeness to my vision  the inquirer verbally corroborated all the facts to me within a week but leaned to a theory of electricity she has read and confirms this account  iione afternoon i was sitting beside a young lady whom i had never seen or heard of before she asked if she might look into my crystal and while she did so i happened to look over her shoulder and saw a ship tossing on a very heavy choppy sea although land was still visible in the dim distance that vanished and as suddenly a little house appeared with five or six i forget now the exact number i then counted steps leading up to the door on the second step stood an old man reading a newspaper in front of the house was a field of thick stubbly grass where some lambs i was going to say but they were more like very small sheep were grazing  when the scene vanished the young lady told me i had vividly described a spot in shetland where she and her mother were soon going to spend a few weeks  i heard of this case from miss angus within a day or two of its occurrence and it was then confirmed to me verbally by the other lady she again confirms it december 21 1897 both ladies had hitherto been perfect strangers to each other the old man was the schoolmaster apparently in her ms miss angus writes skye but at the time both she and the other lady said shetland which i have restored in shetland the sheep like the ponies are small fortuitous coincidence of course may be invoked the next account is by another lady say miss rose  iiiwrites miss rosemy first experience of crystal gazing was not a pleasant one as will be seen from the following which i now relate as exactly as i can remember i asked my friend miss angus to allow me to look in her crystal and after doing so for a short time gave up saying it was very unsatisfactory as although i saw a room with a bright fire in it and a bed all curtained and people coming and going i could not make out who they were so i returned the crystal to miss angus with the request that she might look for me she said at once i see a bed with a man in it looking very ill and a lady in black beside it without saying any more miss angus still kept looking and after some time i asked to have one more look and on her passing the ball back to me i received quite a shock for there perfectly clearly in a bright light i saw stretched out in bed an old man apparently dead for a few minutes i could not look and on doing so once more there appeared a lady in black and out of dense darkness a long black object was being carried and it stopped before a dark opening overhung with rocks at the time i saw this i was staying with cousins and it was a friday evening on sunday we heard of the death of the fatherinlaw of one of my cousins of course i knew the old gentleman was very ill but my thoughts were not in the least about him when looking in the crystal i may also say i did not recognise in the features of the dead man those of the old gentleman whose death i mention on looking again on sunday i once more saw the curtained bed and some people  i now give miss anguss version of this case as originally received from her december 1897 i had previously received an oral version from a person present at the scrying it differed in one respect from what miss angus writes her version is offered because it is made independently without consultation or attempt to reconcile recollections  at a recent experience of gazing for the first time i was able to make another see what i saw in the crystal miss rose called one afternoon and begged me to look in the ball for her i did so and immediately exclaimed oh here is a bed with a man in it looking very ill i saw he was dead but refrained from saying so and there is a lady dressed in black sitting beside the bed i did not recognise the man to be anyone i knew so i told her to look in a very short time she called out oh i see the bed too but oh take it away the man is dead she got quite a shock and said she would never look in it again soon however curiosity prompted her to have one more look and the scene at once came back again and slowly from a misty object at the side of the bed the lady in black became quite distinct then she described several people in the room and said they were carrying something all draped in black when she saw this she put the ball down and would not look at it again she called again on sunday this had been on friday with her cousin and we teased her about being afraid of the crystal so she said she would just look in it once more she took the ball but immediately laid it down again saying no i wont look as the bed with the awful man in it is there again  when they went home they heard that the cousins fatherinlaw had died that afternoon11 but to show he had never been in our thoughts although we all knew he had not been well no one suggested him his name was never mentioned in connection with the vision  clairvoyance of course is not illustrated here the corpse being unrecognised and the coincidence doubtless accidental  the next case is attested by a civilian a slight acquaintance of miss anguss who now saw him for the second time only but better known to her family  ivon thursday march  1897 i was lunching with my friends the anguses and during luncheon the conversation turned upon crystal balls and the visions that by some people can be seen in them the subject arose owing to miss angus having just been presented with a crystal ball by mr andrew lang i asked her to let me see it and then to try and see if she could conjure up a vision of any person of whom i might think i fixed my mind upon a friend a young trooper in the regiment named as i thought his would be a striking and peculiar personality owing to his uniform and also because i felt sure that miss angus could not possibly know of his existence i fixed my mind steadily upon my friend and presently miss angus who had already seen two cloudy visions of faces and people called out now i see a man on a horse most distinctly he is dressed most queerly and glitters all overwhy its a soldier a soldier in uniform but its not an officer my excitement on hearing this was so great that i ceased to concentrate my attention upon the thought of my friend and the vision faded away and could not afterwards be recalleddecember 2 1897  the witness gives the name of the trooper whom he had befriended in a severe illness miss anguss own account follows she had told me the story in june 1897  shortly after i became the happy possessor of a crystal i managed to convert several very decided sceptics and i will here give a short account of my experiences with two or three of them  one was with a mr  who was so determined to baffle me he said he would think of a friend it would not be possible for me to describe  i had only met mr  the day before and knew utmost nothing about him or his personal friends  i took up the ball which immediately became misty and out of this mist gradually a crowd of people appeared but too indistinctly for me to recognise anyone until suddenly a man on horseback came galloping along i remember saying i cant describe what he is like but he is dressed in a very queer wayin something so bright that the sun shining on him quite dazzles me and i cannot make him out as he came nearer i exclaimed why its a soldier in shining armour but its not an officer only a soldier two friends who were in the room said mr s excitement was intense and my attention was drawn from the ball by hearing him call out its wonderful its perfectly true i was thinking of a young boy a son of a crofter in whom i am deeply interested and who is a trooper in the  in london which would account for the crowd of people round him in the street  the next case is given first in the version of the lady who was unconsciously scried for and next in that of miss angus the other lady writes  vi met miss a for the first time in a friends house in the south of england and one evening mention was made of a crystal ball and our hostess asked miss a to look in it and if possible tell her what was happening to a friend of hers miss a took the crystal and our hostess put her hand on miss as forehead to will her i not believing in this took up a book and went to the other side of the room i was suddenly very much startled to hear miss a in quite an agitated way describe a scene that had most certainly been very often in my thoughts but of which i had never mentioned a word she accurately described a racecourse in scotland and an accident which happened to a friend of mine only a week or two before and she was evidently going through the same doubt and anxiety that i did at the time as to whether he was actually killed or only very much hurt it really was a most wonderful revelation to me as it was the very first time i had seen a crystal our hostess of course was very much annoyed that she had not been able to influence miss a while i who had appeared so very indifferent should have affected hernovember 28 1897  miss angus herself writes  another case was a rather interesting one as i somehow got inside the thoughts of one lady while another was doing her best to influence me  miss  a friend in brighton has strange magnetic powers and felt quite sure of success with me and the ball  another lady miss h who was present laughed at the whole thing especially when miss  insisted on holding my hand and patting her other hand on my forehead miss h in a scornful manner took up a book and crossing to the other side of the room left us to our folly  in a very short time i felt myself getting excited which had never happened before when i looked in the crystal i saw a crowd of people and in some strange way i felt i was in it and we all seemed to be waiting for something soon a rider came past young dressed for racing his horse ambled past and he smiled and nodded to those he knew in the crowd and then was lost to sight  in a moment we all seemed to feel as if something had happened and i went through great agony of suspense trying to see what seemed just beyond my view soon however two or three men approached and carried him past before my eyes and again my anxiety was intense to discover if he were only very badly hurt or if life were really extinct all this happened in a few moments but long enough to have left me so agitated that i could not realise it had only been a vision in a glass ball  by this time miss h had laid aside her book and came forward quite startled and told me that i had accurately described a scene on a racecourse in scotland which she had witnessed just a week or two beforea scene that had very often been in her thoughts but as we were strangers to each other she had never mentioned she also said i had exactly described her own feelings at the time and had brought it all back in a most vivid manner  the other lady was rather disappointed that after she had concentrated her thoughts so hard i should have been influenced instead by one who had jeered at the whole affair  this anecdote was also told to me within a few days of the occurrence by miss angus her version was that she first saw a gentleman rider going to the post and nodding to his friends then she saw him carried on a stretcher through the crowd she seemed she said to be actually present and felt somewhat agitated the fact of the accident was later mentioned to me in scotland by another lady a stranger to all the personsal  vii may briefly add an experiment of december 21 1897 a gentleman had recently come from england to the scottish town where miss angus lives he dined with her family and about 1015 to 1030 pm she proposed to look in the glass for a scene or person of whom he was to think he called up a mental picture of a ball at which he had recently been and of a young lady to whom he had there been introduced the ladys face however he could not clearly visualise and miss angus reported nothing but a view of an empty ballroom with polished floor and many lights the gentleman made another effort and remembered his partner with some distinctness miss angus then described another room not a ballroom comfortably furnished in which a girl with brown hair drawn back from her forehead and attired in a highnecked white blouse was reading or writing letters under a bright light in an unshaded glass globe the description of the features figure and height tallied with mr s recollection but he had never seen this geraldine of an hour except in ball dress he and miss angus noted the time by their watches it was 1030 and mr  said that on the first opportunity he would ask the young lady how she had been dressed and how employed at that hour on december 21 on december 22 he met her at another dance and her reply corroborated the crystal picture she had been writing letters in a highnecked white blouse under an incandescent gas lamp with an unshaded glass globe she was entirely unknown to miss angus and had only been seen once by mr  mr  and the lady of the crystal picture corroborated all this in writing  i now suggested an experiment to miss angus which after all was clearly not of a nature to establish a test for sceptics the inquirer was to write down and inclose in an envelope a statement of his thoughts miss angus was to do the same with her description of the picture seen by her and these documents were to be sent to me without communication between the inquirer and the crystalgazer of course this could in no way prove absence of collusion as the two parties might arrange privately beforehand what the vision was to be  indeed nobody is apt to be convinced or shaken unless he is himself the inquirer and a stranger to the seeress as the people in these experiments were evidence interesting to themand in a secondary degree to others who know themcan thus be procured but strangers are left to the same choice of doubts as in all reports of psychological experiences chromatic audition views of coloured numerals and the other topics illustrated by mr galtons interesting researches  in this affair of the envelopes the inquirer was a mr pembroke who had just made miss anguss acquaintance and was but a sojourner in the land he wrote before knowing what miss angus had seen in the ball  viion sunday january 23 1898 whilst miss angus was looking in the crystal ball i was thinking of my brother who was i believe at that time somewhere between sabathu punjab india and egypt i was anxious to know what stage of his journey he had reached  miss angus saw and wrote before telling mr pembroke  a long and very white road with tall trees at one side on the other a river or lake of greyish water blue sky with a crimson sunset a great black ship is anchored near and on the deck i see a man lying apparently very ill he is a powerfullooking man fair and very much bronzed seven or eight englishmen in very light clothes are standing on the road beside the boat  january 28 1898  a great black ship anchored in a river or lake naturally suggests the suez canal where in fact mr pembrokes brother was just arriving as was proved by a letter received from him eight days after the experiment was recorded on january 31 at that date mr pembroke had not yet been told the nature of miss anguss crystal picture nor had she any knowledge of his brothers whereabouts  in february 1898 miss angus again came to the place where i was residing we visited together the scene of an historical crime and miss angus looked into the glass ball it was easy for her to visualise the incidents of the crime the murder of cardinal beaton for they are familiar enough to many people what she did see in the ball was a tall pale lady about forty but looking thirtyfive with hair drawn back from the brows standing beside a high chair dressed in a wide farthingale of stiff grey brocade without a ruff the costume corresponds well as we found with that of 1546 and i said i suppose it is mariotte ogilvyto whom miss anguss historical knowledge and perhaps that of the general public did not extend mariotte was the cardinals ladylove and was in the castle on the night before the murder according to knox she had been in my mind whence on the theory of thought transference she may have passed to miss anguss mind but i had never speculated on mariottes costume nothing but conjecture of course comes of these apparently retrospective pictures though a most singular and picturesque coincidence occurred which may be told in a very different connection  the next example was noted at the same town the lady who furnishes it is well known to me and it was verbally corroborated by miss angus to whom the lady her absent nephew and all about her were entirely strange  viiii was very anxious to know whether my nephew would be sent to india this year so i told miss angus that i had thought of something and asked her to look in the glass ball she did so but almost immediately turned round and looked out of the window at the sea and said i saw a ship so distinctly i thought it must be a reflection she looked in the ball again and said it is a large ship and it is passing a huge rock with a lighthouse on it i cant see who are on the ship but the sky is very clear and blue now i see a large building something like a club and in front there are a great many people sitting and walking about i think it must be some place abroad for the people are all dressed in very light clothes and it seems to be very sunny and warm i see a young man sitting on a chair with his feet straight out before him he is not talking to anyone but seems to be listening to something he is dark and slight and not very tall and his eyebrows are dark and very distinctly marked  i had not had the pleasure of meeting miss angus before and she knew nothing whatever about my nephew but the young man described was exactly like him both in his appearance and in the way he was sitting  in this case thought transference may be appealed to the lady was thinking of her nephew in connection with india it is not maintained of course that the picture was of a prophetic character  the following examples have some curious and unusual features on wednesday february 2 1897 miss angus was looking in the crystal to amuse six or seven people whose acquaintance she had that day made a gentleman mr bissett asked her what letter was in his pocket she then saw under a bright sky and as it were a long way off a large building in and out of which many men were coming and going her impression was that the scene must be abroad in the little company present it should be added was a lady mrs cockburn who had considerable reason to think of her young married daughter then at a place about fifty miles away after miss angus had described the large building and crowds of men some one asked is it an exchange it might be she said now comes a man in a great hurry he has a broad brow and short curly hair12 hat pressed low down on his eyes the face is very serious but he has a delightful smile mr and mrs bissett now both recognised their friend and stockbroker whose letter was in mr bissetts pocket  the vision which interested miss angus passed away and was interrupted by that of a hospital nurse and of a lady in a peignoir lying on a sofa with bare feet13 miss angus mentioned this vision as a bore she being more interested in the stockbroker who seems to have inherited what was once in the possession of another stockbrokerthe smile of charles lamb mrs cockburn for whom no pictures appeared was rather vexed and privately expressed with freedom a very sceptical opinion about the whole affair but on saturday february 5 1897 miss angus was again with mr and mrs bissett when mrs bissett announced that she had thought of something miss angus saw a walk in a wood or garden beside a river under a brilliant blue sky here was a lady very well dressed twirling a white parasol on her shoulder as she walked in a curious stumpy way beside a gentleman in light clothes such as are worn in india he was broadshouldered had a short neck and a straight nose and seemed to listen laughing but indifferent to his obviously vivacious companion the lady had a drawn face indicative of ill health then followed a scene in which the man without the lady was looking on at a number of orientals busy in the felling of trees mrs bissett recognised in the lady her sister mrs clifton in indiaabove all when miss angus gave a realistic imitation of mrs cliftons walk the peculiarity of which was caused by an illness some years ago mrs and mr bissett also recognised their brotherinlaw in the gentleman seen in both pictures on being shown a portrait of mrs clifton as a girl miss angus said it was like but too pretty a photograph done recently however showed her the drawn face of the crystal picture14  next day sunday february 6 mrs bissett received what was not usuala letter from her sister in india mrs clifton dated january 20 mrs clifton described a place in a native state where she had been at a great function in certain gardens beside a river she added that they were going to another place for a certain purpose and then we go into camp till the end of february one of mr cliftons duties is to direct the clearing of wood preparatory to the formation of the camp as in miss anguss crystal picture15 the sceptical mrs cockburn heard of these coincidences and an idea occurred to her she wrote to her daughter who has been mentioned and asked whether on wednesday february 2 she had been lying on a sofa in her bedroom with bare feet the young lady confessed that it was indeed so16 and when she heard how the fact came to be known expressed herself with some warmth on the abuse of glass balls which tend to rob life of its privacy  in this case the prima facie aspect of things is that a thought of mr bissetts about his stockbroker dulce ridentem somehow reflected itself into miss anguss mind by way of the glass ball and was interrupted by a thought of mrs cockburns as to her daughter but how these thoughts came to display the unknown facts concerning the garden by the river the felling of trees for a camp and the bare feet is a question about which it is vain to theorise17  on the vanishing of the jungle scene there appeared a picture of a man in a dark undress uniform beside a great bay in which were ships of war wooden huts as in a plague district were on shore mr bissett asked what is the mans expression he looks as if he had been giving a lot of last orders then appeared a place like a hospital with five or six bedsno berths it is a ship here is the man again he was minutely described one peculiarity being the way in which his hair grewor rather did not growon his temples  miss angus now asked where is my little ladymeaning the lady of the twirling parasol and staccato walk oh ive left off thinking of her said mrs bissett who had been thinking of and recognised in the officer in undress uniform her brother the man with the singular hair whose face in fact had been scarred in that way by an encounter with a tiger he was expected to sail from bombay but news of his setting forth has not been received february 10 at the moment when this is written18  in these indian cases thought transference may account for the correspondence between the figures seen by miss angus and the ideas in the mind of mr and mrs bissett but the hypothesis of thought transference while it would cover the wooden huts at bombay mrs bissett knowing that her brother was about to leave that place can scarcely explain the scene in the garden by the river and the scene with the trees the incident of the bare feet may be regarded as a fortuitous coincidence since miss angus saw the young lady foreshortened and could not describe her face  in the introductory chapter it was observed that the phenomena which apparently point to some unaccountable supernormal faculty of acquiring knowledge are trivial these anecdotes illustrate the triviality but the facts certainly left a number of people wholly unfamiliar with such experiments under the impression that miss anguss glass ball was like prince alis magical telescope in the arabian nights19 these experiments however occasionally touch on intimate personal matters and cannot be reported in such instances  it will be remarked that the faculty is freakish and does not always respond to conscious exertion of thought in the mind of the inquirer thus in case i a connection of the person thought of is discerned in another the mind of a stranger present seems to be read in another case not given here the inquirer tried to visualise a card for a person present to guess while miss angus was asked to describe an object which the inquirer was acquainted with but which he banished from his conscious thought the double experiment was a doublebarrelled success  it seems hardly necessary to point out that chance coincidence will not cover this set of cases where in each guess the field of conjecture is boundless and is not even narrowed by the crystalgazers knowledge of the persons for whose diversion she makes the experiment as musclereading is not in question in the one case of contact between inquirer and crystalgazer the results were unexpected and as no unconsciously made signs could convey for example the idea of a cavalry soldier in uniform or an accident on a racecourse in two tableaux i do not at present see any more plausible explanation than that of thought transference though how that is to account for some of the cases given i do not precisely understand  any one who can accept the assurance of my personal belief in the good faith of all concerned will see how very useful this faculty of crystalgazing must be to the apache or australian medicineman or polynesian priest freakish as the faculty is a few real successes well exploited and eked out by fraud would set up a wizards reputation that a faculty of being thus affected is genuine seems proved apart from modern evidence by the worldwide prevalence of crystalgazing in the ethnographic region but the discovery of this prevalence had not been made to my knowledge before modern instances induced me to notice the circumstances sporadically recorded in books of travel  the phenomena are certainly of a kind to encourage the savage theory of the wandering soul how else thinkers would say can the seer visit the distant place or person and correctly describe men and scenes which in the body he never saw or they would encourage the polynesian belief that the spirit of the thing or person looked for is suspended by a god over the water crystal blood ink or whatever it may be thus to anthropologists the discovery of crystalgazing as a thing widely diffused and still flourishing ought to be grateful however much they may blame my childish credulity i may add that i have no ground to suppose that crystalgazing will ever be of practical service to the police or to persons who have lost articles of portable property but i have no objection to experiments being made at scotland yard20  footnote 1 information with a

savage or civilised in which knowledge is believed to be acquired through no known channel of sense all such instances among savages whether of the nature of clairvoyance simple or by aid of gazing in a smooth surface or in dreams or in trance or through second sight would confirm if they did not originate the belief in the separable soul the soul if it is to visit distant places and collect information must leave the body it would be argued and must so far be capable of leading an independent life perhaps we ought next to study cases of possession when knowledge is supposed to be conveyed by an alien soul ghost spirit or god taking up its abode in a man and speaking out of his lips but it seems better first to consider the alleged supernormal phenomena which may have led the savage reasoner to believe that he was not the only owner of a separable soul that other people were equally gifted  the sense as of separation which a savage dreamer or seer would feel after a dream or vision in which he visited remote places would satisfy him that his soul at least was volatile but some experience of what he would take to be visits from the spirits of others would be needed before he recognised that other men as well as he had the faculty of sending their souls a journeying  now ordinary dreams in which the dreamer seemed to see persons who were really remote would supply to the savage reasoner a certain amount of affirmative evidence it is part of mr tylors contention that savages like some children are subject to the difficulty which most of us may have occasionally felt in deciding did this really happen or did i dream it thus ordinary dreams would offer to the early thinker some evidence that other mens souls could visit his as he believes that his can visit them  but men we may assume were not at the assumed stage of thought so besotted as not to take a great practical distinction between sleeping and waking experience on the whole as has been shown the distinction is made by the lowest savages of our acquaintance one clear waking hallucination on the other hand of the presence of a person really absent could not but tell more with the early philosopher than a score of dreams for to be easily forgotten is of the essence of a dream savages indeed oddly enough have hit on our theory dreams go by contraries dr callaway illustrates this for the zulus and mr scott for the manganza thus they do discriminate between sleeping and waking we must therefore examine waking hallucinations in the field of actual experience and on such recent evidence as may be accessible if these hallucinations agree in a certain ratio beyond what fortuitous coincidence can explain with real but unknown events then such hallucinations would greatly strengthen in the mind of an early thinker the savage theory that a man at a distance may voluntarily or involuntarily project his spirit on a journey and be seen where he is not present  when mr tylor wrote his book the study of the occasional waking hallucinations of the sane and healthy was in its infancy much indeed had been written about hallucinations but these were mainly the chronic false perceptions of maniacs of drunkards and of persons in bad health such as nicolai and mrs a the hallucinations of persons of geniusjeanne darc luther socrates pascal were by some attributed to lunacy in these famous people scarcely any writers before mr galton had recognised the occurrence of hallucinations once in a life perhaps among healthy sober and mentally sound people if these were known to occur they were dismissed as dreams of an unconscious sleep this is still practically the hypothesis of dr parish as we shall see later but in the last twenty years the infrequent hallucinations of the sane have been recognised by mr galton and discussed by professor james mr gurney dr parish and many other writers  two results have followed first ghosts are shown to be when not illusions caused by mistaking one object for another then hallucinations as these most frequently represent a living person who is not present by parity of reason the appearance of a dead person is on the same level is not a spacefilling ghost but merely an hallucination such an appearance can prima facie suggest no reasonable inference as to the continued existence of the dead on the other hand the new studies have raised the perhaps insoluble question do not hallucinations of the sane representing the living coincide more frequently than mere luck can account for with the death or other crisis of the person apparently seen if this could be proved then there would seem to be a causal nexus a relation of cause and effect between the hallucination and the coincident crisis that connection would be provisionally explained by some not understood action of the mind or brain of the person in the crisis on that of the person who has the hallucination this is no new idea only the name telepathy is modern of course if all this were accepted it would be the next step to ask whether hallucinations representing the dead show any signs of being caused by some action on the side of the departed that is a topic on which the little that we have to say must be said later  in the meantime the reader who has persevered so far is apt to go no further the prejudice against wraiths and ghosts is very strong but then our innocent phantasms are neither as we understand their nature ghosts nor wraiths kant broke the edges of his metaphysical tools against not these phantasms but the logically inconceivable entities which were at once material and nonmaterial at once spiritual and spacefilling there is no such difficulty about hallucinations which whatever else may be said about them are familiar facts of experience the only real objections are the statements that hallucinations are always morbid which is no longer the universal belief of physiologists and psychologists and that the alleged coincidences of a phantasm of a person with the unknown death of that person at a distance are pure flukes that is the question to which we recur later  in the meantime the defenders of the theory that there is some not understood connection of cause and effect between the death or other crisis at one end and the perception representing the person affected by the crisis at the other end point out that such hallucinations or other effects on the percipient exist in a regular rising scale of potency and perceptibility suppose that as death in yorkshire is to affect the consciousness of b in surrey before he knows anything about the fact suppose it for the sake of argument then the effect may take place 1 on bs emotions producing a vague malaise and gloom 2 on his motor nerves urging him to some act 3 or may translate itself into his senses as a touch felt a voice heard a figure seen or 4 may render itself as a phrase or an idea  of these 1 the emotional effect is of course the vaguest we may all have had a sudden fit of gloom which we could not explain people rarely act on such impressions and when they do are often wrong thus a friend of my own was suddenly so overwhelmed at golf with inexplicable misery though winning his match that he apologised to his opponent and walked home from the ninth hole nothing was wrong at home probably some real ground of apprehension had obscurely occurred to his mind and expressed itself in his emotion  but one may illustrate what did look like a coincidence by the experience of the same friend he inhabited as a young married man a flat in a house belonging to an acquaintance the hall was covered by a kind of glass roof over part of its extent he was staying in the country with his wife and as they travelled home the lady was beset with an irresistible conviction that something terrible had occurred not to her children on reaching their house they found that one of their maids had fallen through the glass roof and killed herself they also learned that the girls sister had arrived at the house immediately after the accident explaining that she was driven to come by a sense that something dreadful had happened the lawyer too who represented the owner of the house had appeared unsummoned from a conviction which he could not resist that for some reason unknown he was wanted there1 here then was not an hallucination but an emotional effect simultaneously reaching the consciousness of three persons and coinciding with an unknown crisis2  cases in which a person feels urged to an act 2 are also recorded indeed the lawyers in our anecdote is such an instance not to trouble ourselves 3 with voices hallucinations of sight coinciding with a distant unknown crisis are traced from a mere feeling that somebody is in the room followed by a mental or minds eye picture of a person dying at a distance up to a kind of vision of a person or scene and so on to hallucinations appealing at once to touch sight and hearing as some hundreds of these narratives of coincidental hallucinations in every degree have been collected from witnesses at first hand often personally known and usually personally crossquestioned by the student it is difficult to deny that there is a prima facie case for inquiry3  there is here no question of spirits with all their physical and metaphysical difficulties nor is there any desire to shirk the fact that many presentiments and hallucinations of the sane coincide with no ascertainable fact we only provisionally posit the possibility of an influence in its nature unknown of one mind on another at a distance such influence translating itself into an hallucination an inquiry into this subject in the ethnographic and modern fields may be new but involves no superstition  we now return to mr tylor who treats of hallucinations among other experiences which led early savage thinkers to believe in ghosts or separable souls the origin of religion  as to the causes of hallucinations in general mr tylor has something to say but it is nothing systematic sickness exhaustion and excitement cause savages to behold human spectres in the objective reality of which they believe but if an educated modern not sick nor exhausted nor excited has an hallucination of a friends presence he too believes that it is objective is his friend in flesh and blood till he finds out his mistake by examination or reflection as professor william james remarks in his principles of psychology such solitary hallucinations of the sane and healthy once in a lifetime are difficult to account for and are by no means rare sometimes mr tylor observes the phantom has the characteristic quality of not being visible to all of an assembled company and he adds to assert or imply that they are visible sometimes and to some persons but not always or to everyone is to lay down an explanation of facts which is not indeed our usual modern explanation but which is a perfectly rational and intelligible product of early science  it is indeed nor has later science produced any rational and intelligible explanation of collective hallucinations shared by several persons at once and perhaps not perceived by others who are present mr tylor it is true asserts that in civilised countries a rumour of some one having seen a phantom is enough to bring a sight of it to others whose minds are in a properly receptive state but this is arguing in a circle what is a properly receptive state if illness overwork expectant attention make a properly receptive state i should have seen several phantoms in several haunted houses but the only thing of the sort i ever saw occurred when i was thinking of nothing less when i was in good health and when i did not know nor did i learn till long after that it was the right and usual phantom to see mr podmore remarks that various members of the psychical society have sojourned in various haunted houses some of them in a state of expectancy and nervous excitement which never caused them to see phantoms for they saw none4  mr tylor treats of waking hallucinations in much the same manner as he deals with travelling clairvoyance he does not study them in the field of experience he is not concerned with the truth of the facts important as we think it would be but with his theory that hallucinations among other causes would naturally give rise to the belief in spirits and thus to the early philosophy of animism now certainly the hallucination of a persons presence say at the moment of his death at a distance would suggest to a savage that something of the dying mans something symbolised in the word shadow or breath spiritus had come to say farewell the modern spiritualistic theory again that the dead mans spirit is actually present to the percipient in space corresponds to and is derived from the animistic philosophy of the savage but we may believe in such deathwraiths or hallucinatory appearances of the dying without being either savages or spiritualists we may believe without pretending to explain or we may advance the theory of telepathy hegels magical tie according to which the distant mind somehow impresses itself in a more or less perfect hallucination on the mind of the person who perceives the wraith if this be so or even if no explanation be offered the truth of the stories of coincidental apparitions becomes important as pointing to a new region of psychical inquiry then the evidence of savages as to hallucinations of their own coincident with the death of their absent friends will confirm quantum valeat the evidence of many modern observers in all ranks of life and all degrees of culture from lord brougham to an old nurse5  as to hallucinations coincident with the death of the person apparently seen mr tylor says narratives of this class i can here only specify without arguing on them they are abundantly in circulation6 now the modern hallucinations themselves can scarcely perhaps be called survivals from savagery though the opinion that an hallucination of a person must be his spirit is really such a survival it is with that opinion with animism in its hallucinatory origins that mr tylor is concerned not with the hallucinations themselves or with the evidence for their veridical existence  mr tylor gives three anecdotes narrated to him in two cases by the seers of phantasms of the living beheld by them and in one case by a companion also when the real person was dying at a distance he adds my own view is that nothing but dreams and visions could have ever put into mens minds such an idea as that of souls being ethereal images of bodies7 the idea may be perfectly erroneous but if the occurrence of such coincidental appearances as mr tylor tells us about could be shown to be too frequent for mere chance to produce then there would be a presumption in favour of some unknown faculties in our naturea proper theme for anthropology  the hallucinations of which we hear most are those in which a person sees the phantom of another person who unknown to him is in or near the hour of death mr tylor in addition to his three instances in civilised life alludes to one in savage life with references to other cases8 we turn to his savage instance offering it at full length from the original9  among the maoris says mr shortland it is always ominous to see the figure of an absent person if the figure is very shadowy and its face is not seen death although he may ere long be expected has not seized his prey if the face of the absent person is seen the omen forewarns the beholder that he is already dead  the following statement is from the mouth of an eyewitness  a party of natives left their village with the intention of being absent some time on a pighunting expedition one night while they were seated in the open air around a blazing fire the figure of a relative who had been left ill at home was seen to approach the apparition appeared to two of the party only and vanished immediately on their making an exclamation of surprise when they returned to the village they inquired for the sick man and then learnt that he had died about the time he was said to have been seen  i now give maori cases communicated to me by mr tregear frgs author of a maori comparative dictionary  a very intelligent maori chief said to me i have seen but two ghosts i was a boy at school in auckland and one morning was asleep in bed when i found myself aroused by some one shaking me by the shoulder i looked up and saw bending over me the wellknown form of my uncle whom i supposed to be at the bay of islands i spoke to him but the form became dim and vanished the next mail brought me the news of his death years passed away and i saw no ghost or spiritnot even when my father and mother died and i was absent in each case then one day i was sitting reading when a dark shadow fell across my book i looked up and saw a man standing between me and the window his back was turned towards me i saw from his figure that he was a maori and i called out to him oh friend he turned round and i saw my other uncle ihaka the form faded away as the other had done i had not expected to hear of my uncles death for i had seen him hale and strong a few hours before however he had gone into the house of a missionary and he with several white people was poisoned by eating of a pie made from tinned meat the tin having been opened and the meat left in it all night that is all i myself had seen of spirits  one more maori example may be offered10  from mr francis dart fenton formerly in the native department of the government auckland new zealand he gave the account in writing to his friend captain jh crosse of monkstown cork from whom we received it in 1852 when the incident occurred mr fenton was engaged in forming a settlement on the banks of the waikato  march 25 1860  two sawyers frank philps and jack mulholland were engaged cutting timber for the rev r maunsell at the mouth of the awaroa creeka very lonely place a vast swamp no people within miles of them as usual they had a maori with them to assist in felling trees he came from tihorewam a village on the other side of the river about six miles off as frank and the native were crosscutting a tree the native stopped suddenly and said what are you come for looking in the direction of frank frank replied what do you mean he said i am not speaking to you i am speaking to my brother frank said where is he the native replied behind you what do you want to the other maori frank looked round and saw nobody the native no longer saw anyone but bid down the saw and said i shall go across the river my brother is dead  frank laughed at him and reminded him that be had left him quite well on sunday five days before and there had been no communication since the maori spoke no more but got into his canoe and pulled across when he arrived at the landingplace he met people coming to fetch him his brother had just died i knew him well  in answer to inquiries as to his authority for this narrative mr fenton writes  december 18 1883  i knew all the parties concerned well and it is quite true valeat quantum as the lawyers say incidents of this sort are not infrequent among the maoris  fd fenton  late chief judge native lawcourt of nz  here is a somewhat analogous example from tierra del fuego  jemmy button was very superstitious says admiral fitzroy speaking of a fuegian brought to england while at sea on board the beagle he said one morning to mr bynoe that in the night some man came to the side of his hammock and whispered in his ear that his father was dead he fully believed that such was the case and he was perfectly right he reminded bennett of the dream11  mr darwin also mentions this case a coincidental auditory hallucination  i have found no other savage cases quite to the point this is undeniably a puir show for kirkintilloch a meagre collection of savage deathwraiths but it may be so meagre by reason of want of research or of lack of records travellers usually poohpoohing the benighted superstitions of the heathen or fearing to seem superstitious if they chronicle instances however few the instances they are undeniably exact parallels to those recorded in civilised life  in filling up the lacuna in mr tylors anthropological work in asking questions as to the proportion between phantasms of the living which coincide with a crisis in the experience of the person seen and those which do not it is obviously necessary to reject all evidence of people who were ill or anxious or overworked or in poignant grief at the time of the hallucination it will be seen later that neither grief nor amatory passion dominating the association of our ideas as they do beget many phantasms our business however is with the false perceptions of persons trustworthy as far as we know sane healthy not usually visionary and in an unperturbed state of mind  there remains a normal cause of subjective hallucinations expectancy this appears to be a real cause of hallucination or at least of illusion waiting for the sound of a carriage you may hear it often before it comes you taking other sounds for that which you desire again in an inquiry embracing 17000 people the spr collected thirteen cases of an hallucinatory appearance of one person to another who was expecting his arrival once more it is very conceivable that a trifle the accidental opening of a door a noise of a familiar kind in an unfamiliar place may touch the brain into originating an hallucination of a person passing through the door or of the place where the sound now heard used once to be familiar expectancy again and nervousness might doubtless cause an hallucination to a person who felt uncomfortable in a house with a name to be haunted though as we have seen the effect is far less common than the cause all these sorts of causes are undoubtedly more apt to be prevalent among superstitious savages than among educated europeans and it stands to reason that savages where one man thinks he sees something will be readier than we are to think they see something too yet collective hallucinations which are shared by several persons at once are especially puzzling even if they occur when all are in a strained condition of expectancy it is odd that all see them in the same way12 examples will occur later when there is no excitement the mystery is increased we may note that among the expectant multitudes who looked on while bernadette was viewing the blessed virgin at lourdes not one person however superstitious or hysterical pretended to share the vision again only one person and he on doubtful evidence is asserted to have shared once the visions of jeanne darc in both cases all the conditions said to produce collective hallucination were present in the highest degree yet no collective hallucination occurred  narratives about hallucinations coincident with a death narratives well attested are abundant in modern times so abundant that one need only refer the curious to messrs gurney and myerss two large volumes phantasms of the living and to the spr report of census of hallucinations 1894 mr tylor says the spiritualistic theory specially insists on cases of apparitions where the persons death corresponds more or less nearly with the time when some friend perceives his phantom but visionaries he remarks truly often see phantoms of living persons when nothing occurs that is the case and the question arises whether more such phantoms are viewed not by visionaries in connection with the death or other crisis of the person whose hallucinatory appearance is perceived than ought to occur if there be no connection of some unknown cause between deaths and appearances as mr tylor observes man as yet in a low intellectual condition came to associate in thought those things which he found by experience to be connected in fact13 did early man then find in experience that apparitions of his friends were connected in fact with their deaths and if so was that discovered connection in fact the origin of his belief that an hallucinatory appearance of an absent person sometimes announced his death  that the belief exists in new zealand we saw and find confirmed by this instance one of many such relations says the author a maori chief was long absent on the warpath one day he entered his wifes hut and sat mute by the hearth she ran to bring witnesses but on her return the phantasm was no longer visible the woman soon afterwards married again  her husband then returned in perfect health and pardoned the lady as she had acted on what to a maori mind seemed good legal evidence of his decease of course even if she fabled the story is evidence to the existence of the belief14  what then is the cause of the belief that a phantom of a man is a token of his death on the theory of savage philosophy as explained by mr tylor himself a mans soul may leave his body and become visible to others not at death only but on many other occasions in dream trance lethargy all these are much more frequent conditions in every mans career than the fact of dying why then is the phantasm supposed by savages to announce death is it because in a sufficient ratio of cases to provoke remark early man has found the appearance and the death to be things connected in fact  i give an instance in which the philosophy of savages would lead them not to connect a phantasm of a living man with his death  the woi worung an australian tribe hold that the murup wraith of an individual could be sent from him by magic as for instance when a hunter incautiously went to sleep when out hunting15 in this case the hunter is exposed to the magic of his enemies but the murup or detached soul would be visible to people at a distance when its owner is only asleepaccording to the savage philosophy why then when the wraith is seen is the owner believed to be dying are the things bound to be connected in fact  as is well known the society for psychical research has attempted a little census for the purpose of discovering whether hallucinations representing persons at a distance coincided within twelve hours with their deaths in a larger ratio than the laws of chance allow as possible if it be so the maori might have some ground for his theory that such hallucinations betoken a decease i do not believe that any such census can enable us to reach an affirmative conclusion which science will accept in spite of all precautions taken all warnings before and allowances made later collectors of evidence will select affirmative cases already known or which is equally fatal will be suspected of doing so again illusions of memory increasing the closeness of the coincidence will come inor it will be easy to say that they came in allowances for them will not be accepted  once more 17000 cases though a larger number than is usual in biological inquiries are decidedly not enough for a popular argument on probabilities a million it will be said would not be too many finally granting honesty accurate memory and nonselection none of which will be granted by opponents it is easy to say that odd things must occur and that the large proportion of affirmative answers as to coincidental hallucinations is just a specimen of these odd things  other objections are put forward by teachers of popular science who have not examinedor having examined misreportthe results of the census in detail i may give an example of their method  mr edward clodd is the author of several handbooks of sciencethe story of creation a manual of evolution and others now in a signed review of a book a critique published in the sketch october 13 1897 mr clodd wrote about the census thousands of persons were asked whether they had ever seen apparitions and out of these some hundreds mostly unintelligent foreigners replied in the affirmative some eight or ten of the numberenvied mortalshad seen angels but the majority like the american in the mongoose story had seen only snakes in weighing evidence we have to take into account the competency as well as the integrity of the witnesses mr clodd has most frankly and goodhumouredly acknowledged the erroneousness of his remark otherwise we might ask does mr clodd prefer to be considered not competent or not veracious he cannot be both on this occasion for his signed and published remarks were absolutely inaccurate first thousands of persons were not asked whether they had seen apparitions they were asked have you ever when believing yourself to be perfectly awake had a vivid impression of seeing or being touched by a living being or inanimate object or of hearing a voice which impression so far as you could discover was not due to any external physical cause secondly it is not the fact that some hundreds mostly unintelligent foreigners replied in the affirmative of englishspeaking men and women 1499 answered the question quoted above in the affirmative of foreigners naturally unintelligent 185 returned affirmative answers thirdly when mr clodd says the majority had seen only snakes it is not easy to know what precise sense snakes bears in the terminology of popular science if mr clodd means by snakes fantastic hallucinations of animals these amounted to 25 as against 830 representing human forms of persons recognised unrecognised living or dead but if by snakes mr clodd means purely subjective hallucinations not known to coincide with any eventand this is his meaninghis statement agrees with that of the census his observations of course were purely accidental errors  the number of hallucinations representing living or dying recognised persons in the answers received was 352 of firsthand cases in which coincidence of the hallucination with the death of the person apparently seen was affirmed there were 80 of which 26 are given  the noncoincidental hallucinations were multiplied by four to allow for forgetfulness of misses the results being compared it was decided that the hallucinations collected coincided with death 440 more often than ought to be the case by the law of probabilities therefore there was proof or presumption in favour of some relation of cause and effect between as death and bs hallucination  if we were to attack the opinion of the committee on hallucinations that between deaths and apparitions of the dying a connection exists which is not due to chance alone the assault should be made not only on the method but on the details the events were never of very recent and often were of remote occurrence the remoteness was less than it seems however as the questions were often answered several years before the publication of the report 1894 there was scarcely any documentary evidence any note or letter written between the hallucination and the arrival of news of the death such letters the evidence alleged had in some cases existed but had been lost burnt eaten by white ants or written on a sheet of blotting paper or the whitewashed wall of a barrack room if i may judge by my own lifelong success in mislaying losing and casually destroying papers from cheques to notes made for literary purposes from interesting letters of friends to the manuscripts of novelists or if i may judge by sir walter scotts triumphs of the same kind i should not think much of the disappearance of documentary evidence to deathwraiths nobody supposed when these notes were written that science would ask for their production and even if people had guessed at this it is human to lose or destroy old papers  the remoteness of the occurrences is more remarkable for if these things happen why were so few recent cases discovered again the seers were sometimes under anxiety though such cases were excluded from the final computation they frequently knew that the person seen was in bad health they were often very familiar with his personal aspect now what are called subjective hallucinations noncoincidental hallucinations usually represent persons very familiar to us persons much in our minds i know seven cases in which such hallucinations occurred 1 2 of husband to wife 3 son to mother 4 brother to sister 5 sister to sister 6 cousin living in the same house to cousin 7 friend living a mile away to two friends in no case was there a deathcoincidence only in case 4 was there any kind of coincidence the brother having intended to do unknown to the sister what he was seen doingdriving in a dogcart with a lady but he had not driven we cannot of course prove that these seven cases were not telepathic but there is no proof that they were now most of the coincidental cases on which the committee relied as their choicest examples represented persons familiarly known to the seers this looks as if they were casual but of course if telepathy does exist it is most likely as hegel says to exist between kinsfolk and friends16  the dates might be fresher  in case 1 percipient knew that his aunt in england he being in australia was not very well no anxiety  2 casual acquaintance no anxiety case of accident or suicide  3 acquaintance who feared to die in childbed and did percipient not much interested nor at all anxious  4 father in england to son in india no anxiety  5 uncle to niece sudden death no anxiety no knowledge of illness  6 brotherinlaw to sisterinlaw and her maid no anxiety reported russian  7 father to son no anxiety reported russian  8 friend to friend no knowledge of illness or anxiety reported  9 grandmother to grandson no anxiety no knowledge of illness  10 casual acquaintance to seven people and apparently to a dog illness known russian  11 stepbrother to stepbrother no anxiety no knowledge of illness  12 friend to friend no anxiety or knowledge of illness  13 casual acquaintance no anxiety  14 aunt to nephew and to his wife illness known no anxiety  15 sister to brother illness known no anxiety  16 father to daughter no knowledge of illness no anxiety  17 father to son much anxiety uncounted  18 sister to sister illness known no immediate danger surmised  19 father to son much anxiety russian uncounted  20 friend to friend illness known percipient had been nursing patient brazilian very bad case  21 friend to friend illness known no anxiety  22 brother to brother illness known no anxiety  23 grandfather to granddaughter illness known no pressing anxiety  24 grandfather to grandson illness known no anxiety  25 fathers hand illness chronic no anxiety percipient a daughter russian  20 husband to wife anxiety in time of war  27 brother to sister slightly anxious from receiving no letter  28 friend to friend no anxiety  anxiety is only reported or to be surmised in two or three cases in a dozen the existence of illness was known  it may therefore be argued adversely that in the selected coincidental hallucinations the persons seen were in the class most usually beheld in noncoincidental and probably purely subjective hallucinations representing real persons also that knowledge of their illness even when no anxiety existed kept them in some cases before the mind also that several cases are foreign and that most foreigners are fools on the other hand affection familiarity and knowledge of illness had not produced hallucinations even in the case of these percipients till within the twelve hours often much less of the event of death  it would have been desirable of course to publish all the noncoincidental cases and show how far in these not veridical cases the recognised phantasms were those of kindred dear friends known to be ill and subjects of anxiety17  the census in fact does contain a chapter on mental and nervous conditions in connection with hallucinations such as anxiety grief and overwork do these produce or probably produce many empty hallucinations not coincident with death or any great crisis if they do then all cases in which a coincidental hallucination occurred to a person in anxiety or overstrained will seem to be probably fortuitous coincidences like the others all percipients of all sorts of hallucinations hits or misses were asked if they were in grief or anxiety now out of 1622 cases of hallucination of all known kinds coincidental or not mental strain was reported in 220 instances of which 131 were cases of grief about known deaths or anxiety these mental conditions therefore occur only in twelve per cent of the instances on the whole it does not seem fair to argue that anxiety produces so much hallucination that it will account by itself for those which we have analysed as coincidental  the impression left on my own mind by the census does pretty closely agree with that of its authors fairly well persuaded of the possibility of telepathy on other grounds and even inclined to believe that it does produce coincidental hallucinations the evidence of the census by itself would not convince me nor its authors we want better records we want documentary evidence recording cases before the arrival of news of the coincidence memories are very adaptive the authors however made a gallant effort at the cost of much labour and largely allowed for all conceivable drawbacks  i am personally illogical enough to agree with kant and to be more convinced by the cumulative weight of the hundreds of cases in phantasms of the living in other sources in my own circle of acquaintance and even by the coincident traditions of european and savage peoples than by the statistics of the census the whole mass census and all is of very considerable weight and there exist individual cases which one feels unable to dispute thus while i would never regard the hallucinatory figure of a friend perceived by myself as proof of his death i would entertain some slight anxiety till i heard of his wellbeing  on this topic i will offer in a kantian spirit an anecdote of the kind which occurring in great quantities disposes the mind to a sort of belief it is not given as evidence to go to a jury for i only received it from the lips of a very gallant and distinguished officer and vc whose own part in the affair will be described  this gentleman was in command of a small british force in one of the remotest and least accessible of our dependencies not connected by telegraph at the time of the incident with the distant mainland in the force was a particularly folly young captain one night he went to a dance and as the sleeping accommodation was exhausted he passed the night like a homeric hero on a couch beneath the echoing loggia next day contrary to his wont he was in the worst of spirits and after moping for some time asked leave to go a three days voyage to the nearest telegraph station his commanding officer my informant was goodnatured and gave leave at the end of a week captain  returned in his usual high spirits he now admitted that while lying awake in the verandah after the ball he had seen a favourite brother of his then in say peru he could not shake off the impression he had made the long voyage to the nearest telegraph station and thence had telegraphed to another brother in let us say hong kong is all well with john he received a reply all well by last mail and so returned relieved in mind to his duties but the next mail bringing letters from peru brought news of his peruvian brothers death on the night of the vision in the verandah  this of course is not offered as evidence for evidence we need captain s account his hong kong brothers account date of the dance official date of the peruvian brothers death and so on but the character of my informant indisposes me to disbelief the names of places are intentionally changed but the places were as remote from each other as those given in the text  we find ourselves able to understand the master of ravenswoods cogitations after he saw the best wraith in fiction  she died expressing her eager desire to see me can it be thencan strong and earnest wishes formed during the last agony of nature survive its catastrophe surmount the awful bounds of the spiritual world and place before us its inhabitants in the hues and colouring of life and why was that manifested to the eye which could not unfold its tale to the ear her withered lips moved fast although no sound issued from them and wherefore should a breach be made in the laws of nature yet its purpose remain unknown  the masters reasonings are such as in hearing similar anecdotes must have occurred to scott they no longer represent our views the death and apparition were coincidental almost to the minute it would be impossible to prove that life was utterly extinct when alice seemed to die as the clock in the distant village tolled one just before ravenswoods experience we do not like him postulate a breach in the laws of nature only a possible example of a law the tale was not unfolded to the ear as the telepathic impact only affected the sense of sight  here perhaps ought to follow a reply to certain scientific criticisms of the theory that telepathy or the action of one distant mind or brain upon another may be the cause of coincidental hallucinations whether among savage or civilised races but not to delay the argument by controversy the reply to objections has been relegated to the appendix18  footnote 1 the lady her husband and the lawyer all known to me gave me the story in

hardly be quoted as evidence for darwinism true but darwinism and totemism are matters of opinion not facts of personal experience to a believer in coincidental hallucinations at least the alleged parallel experiences of savages must yield some confirmation to his own his belief he thinks is warranted by human experience on what does he suppose that the belief of the savage is based do his

seems better to say nothing in this place if such phantasms are seen by savages when awake they will doubtless greatly corroborate that belief in the endurance of the soul after death which is undeniably suggested to the early reasoner by the phenomena of dreaming but while it is easy enough to produce evidence to recognised phantasms of the dead in civilised life it would be very difficult indeed to discover many good examples in what we know about savages some fijian instances are given by mr fison in his and mr howitts kamilaroi and kurnai others occur in the narrative of john tanner a captive from childhood among the red indians but the circumstance already noted that an australian lad became a wizard on the strength of having seen a phantasm of his dead mother proves that such experiences are not common and australian black fellows have admitted that they for their part never did see a ghost but only heard of ghosts from their old men mr david leslie previously cited gives some firsthand zulu evidence about a haunted wood where the esemkofu or ghosts of persons killed by a tyrannical chief were heard and felt by his native informant the percipient was also pelted with stones as by the european poltergeist the zulu who dies commonly becomes an ihlozi and receives his share of sacrifice the esemkofu on the other hand are disturbed and haunting spirits1  as a rule so far as our information goes it is not recognised phantasms of the dead in waking vision which corroborate the savage belief in the persistence of the spirit of the departed the savage reasoner rather rests his faith on the alleged phenomena of noises and physical movements of objects apparently untouched which cause so many houses in civilised society to be shut up or shunned as haunted such disturbances the savage naturally ascribes to spirits our evidence therefore for recognised phantasms of the savage dead is very meagre so it is unnecessary to examine the much more copious civilised evidence the facts attested may of course be theoretically explained as the result of telepathy from a mind no longer incarnate and were the evidence as copious as that for coincidental hallucinations of the living or dying it would be of extreme importance but it is not so copious and granting even that it is accurate various explanations not involving anything so distasteful to science as the action of a discarnate intelligence may be and have been put forward  we turn therefore from a theme in which civilised testimony is more bulky than that derived from savage life to a topic in which savage evidence is much more full than modern civilised records this topic is the socalled demoniacal possession  in the philosophy of animism and in the belief of many peoples savage and civilised spirits of the dead or spirits at large can take up their homes in the bodies of living men such men or women are spoken of as inspired or possessed they speak in voices not their own they act in a manner alien to their natural character they are said to utter prophecies and to display knowledge which they could not have normally acquired and in fact do not consciously possess in their normal condition all these and similar phenomena the savage explains by the hypothesis that an alien spiritperhaps a demon perhaps a ghost or a godhas taken possession of the patient the possessed being full of the spirit delivers sermons oracles prophecies and what the americans call inspirational addresses before he returns to his normal consciousness though many such prophets are conscious impostors others are sincere dr mason mentions a prophet who became converted to christianity he could not account for his former exercises but said that it certainly appeared to him as though a spirit spoke and he must tell what it communicated dr mason also gives the following anecdote  another individual had a familiar spirit that he consulted and with which he conversed but on hearing the gospel he professed to become converted and had no more communication with his spirit it had left him he said it spoke to him no more after a protracted trial i baptised him i watched his case with interest and for several years he led an unimpeachable christian life but on losing his religious zeal and disagreeing with some of the church members he removed to a distant village where he could not attend the services of the sabbath and it was soon after reported that he had communications with his familiar spirit again i sent a native preacher to visit him the man said he heard the voice which had conversed with him formerly but it spoke very differently its language was exceedingly pleasant to hear and produced great brokenness of heart it said love each other act righteouslyact uprightly with other exhortations such us he had heard from the teachers an assistant was placed in the village near him when the spirit left him again and ever since he has maintained the character of a consistent christian2  this anecdote illustrates what is called by spiritists change of control after receiving and deserting christian doctrine the patient again spoke unconsciously but under the influence of the faith which he had abandoned in the same way we shall find that a modern american medium after being for a time constantly in the society of educated and psychological observers obtained new controls of a character more urbane and civilised than her old familiar spirit3  it is admitted that the possessed sometimes display an eloquence which they are incapable of in their normal condition4 in china possessed women who never composed a line of poetry in their normal lives utter their thoughts in verse and are said to give evidence of clairvoyant powers5  the bookdemon possession in chinaof dr nevius for forty years a missionary was violently attacked by the medical journals of his native country the united states the doctor had the audacity to declare that he could find no better explanation of the phenomena than the theory of the apostlesnamely that the patients were possessed not having the fear of man before his eyes he also remarked that the current scientific explanations had the fault of not explaining anything  for example mr tylor intimates that all cases of supposed demoniacal possession are identical with hysteria delirium and mania and suchlike bodily and mental derangements dr nevius however gave what he conceived to be the notes of possession and in his diagnosis distinguished them from hysteria whatever that may mean delirium and mania nor can it honestly be denied that if the special notes of possession actually exist they do mark quite a distinct species of mental affection dr nevius then observed that according to mr tylor scientific physicians now explain the facts on a different principle but says dr nevius we search in vain to discover what this principle is6 dr nevius who had the courage of his opinions then consulted a work styled nervous derangement by dr hammond a professor in the medical school of the university of new york7 he found this scientific physician admitting that we know very little about the matter he knew what is very gratifying that mind is the result of nervous action and that socalled possession is the result of material derangements of the organs or functions of the system  dr nevius was ready to admit this latter doctrine in cases of idiocy insanity epilepsy and hysteria but then said he these are not what i call possession the chinese have names for all these maladies which they ascribe to physical causes but for possession they have a different name he expected dr hammond to account for the abnormal conditions in socalled possession but he has hardly even attempted to do this dr nevius next perused the works of dr griesinger dr baelz professor william james m ribot and generally the literature of alternating personality he found mr james professing his conviction that the alternating personality in popular phrase the demon or familiar spirit of mrs piper knew a great deal about things which mrs piper in her normal state did not and could not know thus after consulting many physicians dr nevius was none the better and came back to his faith in diabolical possession he was therefore informed that he had written one of the most extraordinarily perverted books of the present day on the evidence of transparent ghost storieswhich do not occur in his book  the attitude of dr nevius cannot be called strictly scientific because pathologists and psychologists are unable to explain or give the modus of a set of phenomena it does not follow that the devil or a god or a ghost is in it  but this of course was precisely the natural inference of savages  dr nevius catalogues the symptoms of possession thus  1 the automatic persistent and consistent acting out of a new personality which calls himself shieng genius and calls the patient hiang to incense burner medium  2 possession of knowledge and intellectual power not owned by the patient in his normal state nor explainable on the pathological hypothesis  3 complete change of moral character in the patient  of these notes the second would of course most confirm the savage belief that a new intelligence had entered into the patient if he displayed knowledge of the future or of the remote the inference that a novel and wiser intelligence had taken possession of the patients body would be to the savage irresistible but the more cautious modern even if he accepted the facts would be reduced to no such extreme conclusion he would say that knowledge of the remote in space or in the past might be telepathically communicated to the brain of some living person while for knowledge of the future he could fly with hartmann to contact with the absolute  but the question of evidence for the facts is of course the only real question now in dr neviuss book this evidence rests almost entirely on the written reports of native christian teachers for the chinese were strictly reticent when questioned by europeans my heathen brother you have a sister who is a demoniac asks the intelligent european the reply of the heathen brother is best left in the obscurity of a remarkably difficult and copious oriental language we are thus obliged to fall back on the reports of mr leng and other native christian teachers they are perfectly modest and rational in style we learn that mrs sen a lady in her normal state incapable of lyrical efforts lisped in numbers in her secondary personality and detected the circumstance that mr leng was on his way to see her when she could not have learned the fact in any normal way8 they are now crossing the stream and will be here when the sun is about so high which was correct the other witnesses were examined and corroborated9 dr nevius himself examined mrs kwo when possessed talking in verse and physically limp10  the narratives are of this type the patient on recovering consciousness knows nothing of what has occurred christian prayers are often efficacious and there are many anecdotes of movements of objects untouched11  by a happy accident as this chapter was passing through the press a scientific account of a demoniac and his cure was published by dr pierre janet12 dr janet has explained with complete success everything in the matter of possession except the facts which in the opinion of dr nevius were in need of explanation these facts did not occur in the case of the demoniac exorcised by dr janet thus the learned essay of that eminent authority would not have satisfied dr nevius the facts in which he was interested did not present themselves in dr janets patient and so dr janet does not explain them  the simplest plan here is to deny that the facts in which dr nevius believes ever present themselves at all but if they ever do dr janets explanation does not explain them  1 his patient achille did not act out a new personality  2 achille displayed no knowledge or intellectual power which he did not possess in his normal state  3 his moral character was not completely changed he was only more hypochondriacal and hysterical than usual  achille was a poor devil of a french tradesman who like captain booth had infringed the laws of strict chastity and virtue he brooded on this till he became deranged and thought that satan had him he was convulsed anaesthetic suicidal involuntarily blasphemous he was not exorcised by a prayer or by a command but after a long course of mental and physical treatment his cure does not explain the cures in which dr nevius believed his case did not present the features of which dr nevius asked science for an explanation dr janets essay is the dernier cri of science and leaves dr nevius just where it found him  science therefore can and does tell dr nevius that his evidence for his facts is worthless through the lips of professor w romaine newbold in proceedings spr february 1898 pp 602604 and the same number of the same periodical shows us dr hodgson accepting facts similar to those of dr nevius and explaining them bypossession p 406  dr neviuss observations practically cover the whole field of possession in noneuropean peoples but other examples from other areas are here included  a rather impressive example of possession may be selected from livingstones missionary travels p 86 the adventurous sebituane was harried by the matabele in a new land of his choice he thought of descending the zambesi till he was in touch with white men but tlap√°ne who held intercourse with gods turned his face westwards tlap√°ne used to retire perhaps into some cave to remain in a hypnotic or mesmeric state until the moon was full then he would return en proph√®te stamping leaping and shouting in a peculiarly violent manner or beating the ground with a club to summon those under earth they induce a kind of fit and while in it pretend that their utterances are unknown to themselves as they probably are when the condition is genuine tlap√°ne after inducing the possessed state pointed east there sebituane i behold a fire shun it it may scorch thee the gods say go not thither then pointing west he said i see a city and a nation of black men men of the water their cattle are red thine own tribe are perishing thou wilt govern black men spare thy future tribe  so far mere advice then  thou ramosinii thy village will perish utterly if mokari moves first from the village he will perish first and thou ramosinii wilt be the last to die  then    like some bold seer in a trance   seeing all his own mischance    the gods have given other men water to drink but to me they have given   bitter water they call me away i go13  tlap√°ne died mokari died ramosinii died their village was destroyed soon after and so sebituane wandered westward not disobedient to the voice was attacked by the baloiana conquered and spared them  such is possession among savages it is superfluous to multiply instances of this worldwide belief so freely illustrated in the new testament and in trials for witchcraft the scientific study of the phenomena as littr√© complained had hardly been sketched forty years ago in the intervening years psychologists and hypnotists have devoted much attention to the theme of these secondary personalities which animism explains by the theory of possession the explanations of modern philosophers differ and it is not our business to discuss their physiological and pathological ideas14 our affair is to ask whether in the field of experience there is any evidence that persons thus possessed really evince knowledge which they could not have acquired through normal channels if such evidence exists the facts would naturally strengthen the conviction that the possessed person was inspired by an intelligence not his own that is by a spirit now it is the firm conviction of several men of science that a certain mrs piper an american does display in her possessed condition knowledge which she could not normally acquire the case of this lady is precisely on a level with that of certain savage or barbaric seers thus the fijian priest sits looking steadily at a whales tooth ornament amid dead silence in a few minutes he trembles slight twitchings of face and limbs come on which increase to strong convulsions now the god has entered15  in china the professional woman sits at a table in contemplation till the soul of a deceased person from whom communication is desired enters her body and talks through her to the living16  the latter account exactly describes mrs piper when consulted she passes through convulsions into a trance after which she talks in a new voice assumes a fresh personality and affects to be possessed by the spirit of a french doctor who does not know frenchdr phinuit she then displays a varying amount of knowledge of dead and living people connected with her clients who are usually strangers often introduced under feigned names mrs piper and her husband have been watched by detectives and have not been discovered in any attempts to procure information she was for some months in england under the charge of the spr other ghosts besides dr phinuit ghosts more civilised than he now influence her and her latest performances are said to exceed her former efforts17  volumes of evidence about mrs piper have been published by dr hodgson who unmasked madame blavatsky and eusapia paladino18 he was at first convinced that mrs piper in her condition of trance obtains knowledge not otherwise and normally accessible to her it was admitted that her familiar spirit guesses attempts to extract information from the people who sit with her and tries sophistically to conceal his failures here follow the statements of professor james of harvard  the most convincing things said about my own immediate household were either very intimate or very trivial unfortunately the former things cannot well be published of the trivial things i have forgotten the greater number but the following rarae nantes may serve as samples of their class she said that we had lost recently a rug and i a waistcoat she wrongly accused a person of stealing the rug which was afterwards found in the house she told of my killing a greyandwhite cat with ether and described how it had spun round and round before dying she told how my new york aunt had written a letter to my wife warning her against all mediums and then went off on a most amusing criticism full of traits vifs of the excellent womans character of course no one but my wife and i knew the existence of the letter in question she was strong on the events in our nursery and gave striking advice during our first visit to her about the way to deal with certain tantrums of our second childlittle billyboy as she called him reproducing his nursery name she told how the crib creaked at night how a certain rockingchair creaked mysteriously how my wife had heard footsteps on a stair c c insignificant as these things sound when read the accumulation of them has an irresistible effect and i repeat again what i said before that taking everything that i know of mrs piper into account the result is to make me feel as absolutely certain as i am of any personal fact in the world that she knows things in her trances which she cannot possibly have heard in her waking state and that the definitive philosophy of her trances is yet to be found the limitations of her trance information its discontinuity and fitfulness and its apparent inability to develop beyond a certain point although they end by arousing ones moral and human impatience with the phenomenon yet are from a scientific point of view amongst its most interesting peculiarities since where there are limits there are conditions and the discovery of them is always the beginning of an explanation  this is all i cam tell you of mrs piper i wish it were more scientific but valcat quantum it is the best i can do  elsewhere mr james writes  mr hodgson and others have made prolonged study of this ladys trances and are all convinced that supernormal powers of cognition are displayed therein they are prima facie due to spirit control but the conditions are so complex that a dogmatic decision either for or against the hypothesis must as yet be postponed19  again  in the trances of this medium i cannot resist the conviction that knowledge appears which she has never gained by the ordinary waking use of her eyes ears and wits  the trances have broken down for my own mind the limits of the admitted order of nature  m paul bourget who is not superstitious after consulting mrs piper concludes  lesprit a des proc√©d√©s de conna√Ætre non soup√ßonn√©s par notre analyse20  in this treatise i may have shown the will to believe in an unusual degree but for me the interest of mrs piper is purely anthropological she exhibits a survival or recrudescence of savage phenomena real or feigned of convulsion and of secondary personality and entertains a survival of the animistic explanation  mrs pipers honesty and excellent character in her normal condition are vouched for by her friends and observers in england and america nor do i impeach her normal character but secondary personalities have often more of mr hyde than of dr jekyll in their composition it used to be admitted that when possessed mrs piper would cheat when she couldthat is to say she would make guesses try to worm information out of her sitter describe a friend of his alive or dead as ed who may be edgar edmund edward edith or anybody she would shuffle and repeat what she had picked up in a former sitting with the same person and the vast majority of her answers started from vague references to probable facts as that an elderly man is an orphan and so worked on to more precise statements professor macalister wrote  she is quite wideawake enough all through to profit by suggestions i let her see a blotch of ink on my finger and she said that i was a writer except the guess about my sister helen who is alive there was not a single guess which was nearly right mrs piper is not anaesthetic during the socalled trance and if you ask my private opinion it is that the whole thing is an imposture and a poor one21  mr barkworth said that as far as his experience went mrs pipers powers are of the ordinary thoughtreading ie musclereading kind dependent on her hold of the visitors hand each of these gentlemen had only one sitting m paul bourget also informed me in conversation that mrs piper held his hand while she told the melancholy tale connected with a key in his possession and that she did not tell the story promptly and fluently but very slowly and hesitatingly even so he declared that he did not feel able to account for her performance  as these pages were passing through the press dr hodgsons last report on mrs piper was published22 it is quite impossible within the space allotted to criticise this work it would be necessary to examine minutely scores of statements in which many facts are suppressed as too intimate while others are remarkably incoherent dr hodgson deserves the praise of extraordinary patience and industry displayed in the very distasteful task of watching an unfortunate lady in the vagaries of trance his reasonings are perfectly calm perfectly unimpassioned and his bias has not hitherto seemed to make for credulity we must in fact regard him as an expert in this branch of psychology but he himself makes it clear that in his opinion no written reports can convey the impressions produced by several years of personal experience the results of that experience he sums up in these words  at the present time i cannot profess to have any doubt but that the chief communicators to whom i have referred in the foregoing pages are veritably the personalities that they claim to be that they have survived the change we call death and that they have directly communicated with us whom we call living through mrs pipers entranced organism23  this means that dr hodgson at present in this case accepts the hypothesis of possession as understood by maoris and fijians chinese and karens  the published reports do not produce on me any such impression as a personal matter of opinion i am convinced that those whom i have honoured in this life would no more avail themselves of mrs pipers entranced organism if they had the chance than i would voluntarily find myself in a sitting with that lady it is unnecessary to wax eloquent on this head and the curious can consult the writings of dr hodgson for themselves meanwhile we have only to notice that an american possessed woman produces on a highly educated and sceptical modern intelligence the same impression as the zulu possessed produce on some zulu intelligences  the zulus admit possession and divination but are not the most credulous of mankind the ordinary possessed person is usually consulted as to the disease of an absent patient the inquirers do not assist the diviner by holding his hand but are expected to smite the ground violently if the guess made by the diviner is right gently if it is wrong a sceptical zulu named john having a shilling to expend on psychical research smote violently at every guess the diviner was hopelessly puzzled john kept his shilling and laid it out on a much more meritorious exhibition of animated sticks24  uguise gave dr callaway an account of a female possessed person with whom mrs piper could not compete her spirit spoke not from her mouth but from high in the roof it gave forth a kind of questioning remarks which were always correct it then reported correctly a number of singular circumstances ordered some remedies for a diseased child and offered to return the fee if ample satisfaction was not given25  in china and zululand as in mrs pipers case the spirits are fond of diagnosing and prescribing for absent patients  a good example of savage possession is given in his travels by captain jonathan carver 1763  carver was waiting impatiently for the arrival of traders with provisions near the thousand lakes a priest or jossakeed offered to interview the great spirit and obtain information a large lodge was arranged and the covering drawn up which is unusual so that what went on within might be observed in the centre was a chestshaped arrangement of stakes so far apart from each other that whatever lay within them was readily to be discerned the tent was illuminated by a great number of torches the priest came in and was first wrapped in an elks skin as highland seers were wrapped in a black bulls hide forty yards of rope made of elks hide were then coiled about him till he was wound up like an egyptian mummy  i have elsewhere shown26 that this custom of binding with bonds the seer who is to be inspired existed in graecoegyptian spiritualism among samoyeds eskimo canadian hareskin indians and among australian blacks  the head body and limbs are wound round with stringy bark cords27 this is an extraordinary range of diffusion of a ceremony apparently meaningless is the idea that by loosing the bonds the seer demonstrates the agency of spirits after the manner of the davenport brothers28 but the graecoegyptian medium did not undo the swathings of linen in which he was rolled like a mummy they had to be unswathed for him by others29 again a dead body among the australians is corded up tight as soon as the breath is out of it if it is to be buried or before being exposed on a platform if that is the custom30 again in the highlands secondsight was thus acquired the wouldbe seer must run a tedder tether of hair which bound a corpse to the bier about his middle from end to end and then look between his legs till he sees a funeral cross two marches31 the greenland seer is bound with his head between his legs32  can it be possible judging from australia scotland egypt that the binding as of a corpse or mummy is a symbolical way of putting the seer on a level with the dead who will then communicate with him in three remote points we find seerbinding and corpsebinding but we need to prove that corpses are or have been bound at the other points where the seer is tied upin a reindeer skin among the samoyeds an elk skin in north america a bulls hide in the highlands  binding the seer is not a universal red indian custom it seems to cease in labrador and elsewhere southwards where the prophet enters a magic lodge unbound among the narquapees he sits crosslegged and the lodge begins to answer questions by leaping about33 the eskimo bounds though he is tied up  it would be decisive if we could find that wherever the sorcerer is bound the dead are bound also i note the following examples but the creeks do not i think bind the magician  among the creeks  the corpse is placed in a hole with a blanket wrapped about it and the legs bent under it and tied together34 the dead greenlanders were wrapped and sewed up in their best deerskins35  carver could only learn that among the indians he knew dead bodies were wrapped in skins that they were also swathed with cords he does not allege but he was not permitted to see all the ceremonies  my theory is at least plausible for this manner of burying the dead tied tightly up with the head between the legs as in the practice of scottish and greenland seers is very old and widely diffused ellis says of the tahitians the body of the dead man was  placed in a sitting posture with the knees elevated the face pressed down between the knees and the whole body tied with cord or cinet wound repeatedly round36  the binding may originally have been meant to keep the corpse or ghost from walking i do not know that tahitian prophets were ever tied up to await inspiration but i submit that the frequency of the savage form of burial with the corpse tied up or swathed sometimes with the head between the legs and the recurrence of the savage practice of similarly binding the sorcerer probably points to a purpose of introducing the seer to the society of the dead the custom as applied to prophets might survive even where the burial rite had altered or cannot be ascertained and might survive for corpses where it had gone out of use for seers the scotch used to justify their practice of putting the head between the knees when bound with a corpses hair tether they learned to be secondsighted by what elijah did the prophet on the peak of carmel cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees37 but the cases are not analogous elijah had been hearing a premonitory sound of abundance of rain in a cloudless sky he was probably engaged in prayer not in prophecy  kirk by the way notes that if the wind changes while the scottish seer is bound he is in peril of his life so children are told in scotland that if the wind changes while they are making faces the grimace will be permanent the seer will in the same way become what he pretends to be a corpse  this desertion of carvers tale may be pardoned for the curiosity of the topic he goes on  being thus bound up like an egyptian mummy carver unconsciously making my point the seer was lifted into the chestlike enclosure i could now also discern him as plain as i had ever done and i took care not to turn my eyes away a momentin which effort he probably failed  the priest now began to mutter and finally spoke in a mixed jargon of scarcely intelligible dialects he now yelled prayed and foamed at the mouth till in about three quarters of an hour he was exhausted and speechless but in an instant he sprang upon his feet notwithstanding at the time he was put in it appeared impossible for him to move either his legs or arms and shaking off his covering as quick as if the bands with which it had been bound were burst asunder he prophesied the great spirit did not say when the traders would arrive but just after high noon next day a canoe would arrive and the people in it would tell when the traders were to appear  next day just after high noon a canoe came round a point of land about a league away and the men in it who had met the traders said they would come in two days which they did carver professing freedom from any tincture of credulity leaves us to draw what conclusions we please  the natural inference is private information about which the only difficulty is that carver who knew the topography and the chances of a secret messenger arriving to prompt the jossakeed does not allude to this theory38 he seems to think such successes not uncommon  all that psychology can teach anthropology on this whole topic of possession is that secondary or alternating personalities are facts in rerum natura that the man or woman in one personality may have no conscious memory of what was done or said in the other and that cases of knowledge said to be supernormally gained in the secondary state are worth inquiring about if there be a chance of getting good evidence  a few fairly respectable savage instances are given in dr gibiers le fakirisme occidental and in mr mannings old new zealand but while modern civilised parallels depend on the solitary case of mrs piper for no other case has been

pp 123 184     viii  fetishism and spiritualism  it has been shown how the doctrine of souls was developed according to the anthropological theory the hypothesis as to how souls of the dead were later elevated to the rank of gods or supplied models after which such gods might be inventively fashioned will be criticised in a later chapter here it must suffice to say that the conception of a separable surviving soul of a dead man was not only not essential to the savages idea of his supreme god as it seems to me but would have been wholly inconsistent with that conception there exist however numerous forms of savage religion in addition to the creed in a supreme being and these contribute their streams to the ocean of faith thus among the kinds of belief which served in the development of polytheism was fetishism itself an adaptation and extension of the idea of separable souls in this regard like ancestorworship it differs from the belief in a supreme being which as we shall try to demonstrate is not derived from the theory of ghosts or souls at all  fetish f√©tiche seems to come from portuguese feiti√ßo a talisman or amulet applied by the portuguese to various material objects regarded by the negroes of the west coast with more or less of religious reverence these objects may be held sacred in some degree for a number of incongruous reasons they may be tokens or may be of value in sympathetic magic or merely odd and therefore probably endowed with unknown mystic qualities or they may have been pointed out in a dream or met in a lucky hour and associated with good fortune or they may like a tree with an unexplained stir in its branches as reported by kohl have seemed to show signs of life by spontaneous movements in fact a thing may be what europeans call a fetish for scores of reasons for our present purpose as mr tylor says to class an object as a fetish demands explicit statement that a spirit is considered as embodied in it or acting through it or communicating by it or at least that the people it belongs to do habitually think this of such objects or it must be shown that the object is treated as having personal consciousness or power is talked with worshipped and so forth the indwelling spirit may be human as when a fetish is made out of a friends skull the spirit in which may even be asked for oracles like the head of bran in welsh legend  we have tried to show that the belief in human souls may be in part at least based on supernormal phenomena which materialism disregards we shall now endeavour to make it probable that fetishism the belief in the souls tenanting inanimate objects may also have sources which perhaps are not normal or which at all events seemed supernormal to savages we say perhaps not normal because the phenomena now to be discussed are of the most puzzling character we may lean to the belief in a supernormal cause of certain hallucinations but the alleged movements of inanimate objects which probably supply one origin of fetishism one suggestion of the presence of a spirit in things dead leave the inquiring mind in perplexity in following mr tylors discussion of the subject it is necessary to combine what he says about spiritualism in his fourth with what he says about fetishism in his fourteenth and later chapters for some reason his book is so arranged that he criticises spiritualism long before he puts forward his doctrine of the origin and development of the belief in spirits  we have seen a savage reason for supposing that human spirits inhabit certain lifeless things such as skulls and other relics of the dead but how did it come to be thought that a spirit dwelt in a lifeless and motionless piece of stone or stick mr tylor perhaps leads us to a plausible conjecture by writing mr darwin saw two malay women in keeling island who held a wooden spoon dressed in clothes like a doll this spoon had been carried to the grave of a dead man and becoming inspired at full moon in fact lunatic it danced about convulsively like a table or a hat at a modern spirit s√©ance1 now m lef√©bure has pointed out in m√©lusine that according to de brosses the african conjurers gave an appearance of independent motion to small objects which were then accepted as fetishes being visibly animated m lef√©bure next compares like mr tylor the alleged physical phenomena of spiritualism the flights and movements of inanimate objects apparently untouched  the question thus arises is there any truth whatever in these worldwide and worldold stories of inanimate objects acting like animated things has fetishism one of its origins in the actual field of supernormal experience in the x region this question we do not propose to answer as the evidence though practically universal may be said to rest on imposture and illusion but we can at least give a sketch of the nature of the evidence beginning with that as to the apparently voluntary movements of objects not untouched mr tylor quotes from john bells journey in asia 1719 an account of a mongol lama who wished to discover certain stolen pieces of damask his method was to sit on a bench when he carried it or as was commonly believed it carried him to the very tent of the thief here the bench is innocently believed to be selfmoving again mr rowley tells how in manganjah the sorcerer to find out a criminal placed with magical ceremonies two staffs of wood in the hands of some young men the sticks whirled and dragged the men round like mad and finally escaped and rolled to the feet of the wife of a chief who was then denounced as the guilty person2  mr duff macdonald describes the same practice among the yaos3  the sorcerer occasionally makes men take hold of a stick which after a time begins to move as if endowed with life and ultimately carries them off bodily and with great speed to the house of the thief  the process is just that of jacques aymard in the celebrated story of the detection of the lyons murderer4  in melanesia far enough away dr codrington found a similar practice and here the sticks are explicitly said by the natives to be moved by spirits5 the wizard and a friend hold a bamboo stick by each end and ask what mans ghost is afflicting a patient at the mention of the right ghost the stick becomes violently agitated in the same way the bamboo would run about with a man holding it only on the palms of his hands again a hut is built with a partition down the middle men sit there with their hands under one end of the bamboo while the other end is extended into the empty half of the hut they then call over the names of the recently dead till they feel the bamboo moving in their hands a bamboo placed on a sacred tree when the name of a ghost is called moves of itself and will lift and drag people about put up into a tree it would lift them from the ground in other cases the holding of the sticks produces convulsions and trance6 the divining sticks of the maori are also guided by spirits7 and those of the zulu sorcerers rise fall and jump about8  these zulu performances must be really very curious in the last chapter we told how a zulu named john having a shilling to lay out in the interests of psychical research declined to pay a perplexed diviner and reserved his capital far a more meritorious performance he tried a medium named unomantshintshi who divined by umabakula or dancing sticks  if they say no they fall suddenly if they say yes they arise and jump about very much and leap on the person who has come to inquire they fix themselves on the place where the sick man is affected  if the head they leap on his head many believe in umabakula more than in the diviner but there are not many who have the umabakula  dr callaways informant only knew two umabakulists john was quite satisfied paid his shilling and went home9  the sticks are about a foot long it is not reported that they are moved by spirits nor do they seem to be regarded as fetishes  mr tylor also cites a form of the familiar pendulum experiment among the karens a ring is suspended by a thread over a metal basin the relations of the dead strike the basin and when he who was dearest to the ghost touches it the spirit twists the thread till it breaks and the ring falls into the basin with us a ring is held by a thread over a tumbler and our unconscious movements swing it till it strikes the hour how the karens manage it is less obvious these savage devices with animated sticks clearly correspond to the more modern tableturning here when the players are honest the pushing is certainly unconscious  i have tested this in two waysfirst by trying the minimum of conscious muscular action that would stir a table at which i was alone and by comparing the absolute unconsciousness of muscular action when the table began to move in response to no voluntary push again i tried with a friend who said you are pushing when i gently removed my hands altogether though they seemed to rest on the table which still revolved my friend was himself unconsciously pushing it is undeniable that to a solitary experimenter the table seems to make little darts of its own will in a curious way thus the unconsciousness of muscular action on the part of savages engaged in the experiment with sticks would lead them to believe that spirits were animating the wood the same fallacy beset the tableturners of 185565 and was to some extent exposed by faraday of course savages would be even more convinced by the dancing spoon of mr darwins tale by the dancing sticks of the zulus and the rest whether the phenomena were supernormal or merely worked by unseen strings the same remark applies to modern experimenters when as they declare various objects move untouched without physical contact  still more analogous than turning tables to the savage use of inspired sticks for directing the inquirer to a lost object or to a criminal is the modern employment of the diviningroda forked twig which held by the ends revolves in the hands of the performer when he reaches the object of his quest he like the savage cited is occasionally agitated in a convulsive manner and cases are quoted in which the twig writhes when held in a pair of tongs the bestknown modern treatise on the diviningrod is that of m chevreul la baguette divinatoire 1854 we have also lhistoire du merveilleux dans les temps modernes by m figuier 1860 in 1781 thouvenel published his 600 experiments with bleton and others and hegel refers to amorettis collection of hundreds of cases the case of jacques aymard who in the seventeenth century discovered a murderer by the use of the rod in true savage fashion is well known in modern england the rod is used in the interests of private individuals and public bodies such as trinity college cambridge for the discovery of water  professor barrett has lately published a book of 280 pages in which evidence of failures and successes is collected10 professor barrett gives about one hundred and fifty cases in which he was only able to discover on good authority twelve failures he gives a variety of tests calculated to check frauds and chance coincidence and he publishes opinions hostile or agnostic by geologists the evidence as a general rule is what is called firsthand in other inquiries the actual spectators and often the owners of the land or the persons in whose interest water was wanted having been present give their testimony and it is certain that the diviner is called in by people of sense and education commonly too practical to have a theory and content with getting what they want especially where scientific experts have failed11  in mr barretts opinion the subconscious perception of indications of the presence of water produces an equally unconscious muscular spasm which twirls the rod till it often breaks yet it is almost impossible to imitate its characteristic movement by any voluntary effort i have myself held the hands of an amateur performer when the twig was moving and neither by sight nor touch could i detect any muscular movement on his part much less a spasm the person was bailiff on a large estate and having accidentally discovered that he possessed the gift used it when he wanted wells dug for the tenants on the property  the whole topic is obscure nor am i concerned here with the successes or failures of the diviningrod but the movements of the twig have never to my knowledge been attributed by modern english performers to the operation of spirits they say electricity mr tylor merely writes  the action of the famous diviningrod with its curiously versatile sensibility to water ore treasure and thieves seems to belong partly to trickery and partly to more or less conscious direction by honester operators  as the diviningrod is the only instance in which automatism whatever its nature and causes has been found of practical value by practical men and as it is obviously associated with a number of analogous phenomena both in civilised and savage life it certainly deserves the attention of science but no advance will be made till scientifically trained inquirers themselves arrange and test a large number of experiments knowledge of the geological ignorance of the dowsers examples of fraud on their part and cases of failure or reported failure with a general hostile bias may prevent such experiments from being made by scientific experts on an adequate scale such experts ought of course to avoid working the dowsers into a state of irritation  it is just worth while to notice cases in which the rod acts like those of the melanesians africans and other savages a mr thomas welton published an english translation of la verge de jacob lyon 1693 in 1651 he asked his servant to bring into the garden a stick that stood behind the parlour door in great terror she brought it to the garden her hand firmly clutched on it nor could she let it go when mrs welton took the stick it drew her with very considerable velocity to nearly the centre of the garden where a well was found mr welton is not likely to have known of the lately published savage examples the coincidence with the african and melanesian cases is therefore probably undesigned  again in 1694 the rod was used by le p√®re menestrier and others just as it is by savages to indicate by its movements answers to all sorts of questions experiments of this kind have not been made by professor barrett and other modern inquirers except by m richet as a mode of detecting automatic action but it would be just as sensible to use the twig as to use planchette or any other autoscopic apparatus if these elicit knowledge unconsciously present to the mind mere waterfinding ought not to be the sole province of the rod in the same class as these rods is the forked twig which in china is held at each end by two persons and made to write in the sand the little apparatus called planchette or the other the ouija is of course consciously or unconsciously pushed by the performers in the case of the twig as held by waterseekers the difficulty of consciously moving it so as to escape close observation is considerable  in the case of the ouija a little tripod which under the operators hands runs about a table inscribed with letters at which it points i have known curious successes to be achieved by amateurs thus in the house of a lady who owned an old ch√¢teau in another county the ouija operated on by two ladies known to myself wrote a number of details about a visit paid to the ch√¢teau for a certain purpose by mary stuart that visit and its object a purely personal one are unknown to history and the ch√¢teau is not spoken of in mr hay flemings careful but unavoidably incomplete itinerary of the queens residence in scotland after the communication had been made the owner of the ch√¢teau explained that she was already acquainted with the circumstances described as she had recently read them in documents in her charter chest where they remain  of course the belief we extend to such narratives is entirely conditioned by our knowledge of the personal character of the performers the point here is merely the civilised and savage practice of automatism the apparent eliciting of knowledge not otherwise accessible by the movements of a stick or a bit of wood these movements made without conscious exertion or direction seem to savage philosophy to be caused by indwelling spirits the sources of fetishism  these examples then demonstrating unconscious movement of objects by the operators make it clear that movements even of touched objects may be attributed by some civilised and by savage amateurs to spirits the objects so moved may by savages be regarded in some cases as fetishes and their movements may have helped to originate the belief that spirits can inhabit inanimate objects when objects apparently quite untouched become volatile the mystery is deeper this apparent animation and frolicsome behaviour of inanimate objects is reported all through history and attested by immense quantities of evidence of every degree it would be tedious to give a full account of the antiquity and diffusion of reports about such occurrences we find them among neoplatonists in the english and continental middle ages among eskimo hurons algonkins tartars zulus malays nasquapees maoris in witch trials in ancient peru immediately after the spanish conquest in china in modern russia in new england 1680 all through the career of modern spiritualism in hayti where they are attributed to obeah and sporadically everywhere12  among all these cases we must dismiss whatever the modern paid medium does in the dark the only thing to be done with the ethnographic and modern accounts of such marvels is to file them for reference if a spontaneous example occurs under proper inspection we can then compare our old tales professor james says their mutual resemblances suggest a natural type and i confess that till these records or others like them are positively explained away i cannot feel in spite of such vast amounts of detected frauds as if the case of physical mediumship itself as a freak of nature were definitely closed so long as the stories multiply in various lands and so few are positively explained away it is bad method to ignore them13 here they are not ignored because whatever the cause or causes of the phenomena they would buttress if they did not originate the savage belief in spirits tenanting inanimate matter whence came fetishism as to facts we cannot of course explain away events of this kind which we know only through report a conjurer cannot explain a trick merely from a description especially a description by a nonconjurer but as a rule nothing so much leads to doubt on this theme as the explanation givenexcept of course in the case of dark s√©ances got up and prepared by paid mediums we know sometimes how the explanation arose  thus the house of a certain m zoller a lawyer and member of the swiss federal council a house at stans in unterwalden was made simply uninhabitable in 18601862 the disturbances including movements of objects were of a truly odious description and occurred in full daylight m zoller deeply attached to his home which had many interesting associations with the part his family played in the struggle against revolutionary france was obliged to abandon the place he had made every conceivable sort of research and had called in the local police and savants to no purpose  but the affair was explained away thus while the phenomena could still be concealed from public curiosity a client called to see m zoller who was out the client therefore remained in the drawingroom loud and heavy blows resounded through the room the client as it chanced had once felt the effects of an electric battery for some medical reason apparently m zoller writes my eldest son was present at the time and when my client asked whether there was such a thing as an electrical machine in the house the family having been enjoined to keep the disturbances as secret as possible he allowed s to think that there was consequently the phenomena were set down to m zollers singular idea of making his house untenantable with an electric machinewhich he did not possess14 a number of the most respected citizens including the superintendent of police and the chief magistrate for law published a statement that neither zoller nor any of his family nor any of themselves produced or could have produced the phenomena witnessed by them in august 1862 this declaration they put forth in the schwytzer zeitung october 5 186315 no electric machine known to mortals could have produced the vast variety of alleged effects none was ever found and as m zoller changed his servants without escaping his tribulations they can hardly be blamed for what prima facie it seems that they could not possibly do however electricity like mesopotamia is a blessed word16  my own position in this matter of physical phenomena is i hope clear they interest me for my present purpose as being whatever their real nature and origin things which would suggest to a savage his theory of fetishism an inanimate object may be tenanted by a spirit as is proved by its extraordinary movements thus the early thinker might reason and go on to revere the object it is to be wished that competent observers would pay more attention to such savage practices as crystalgazing and automatism as illustrated by the sticks of the melanesians zulus and yaos our scanty information we pick up out of stray allusions but it has the advantage of being uncontaminated by theory the european spectator not knowing the wide range of such practices and their value in experimental psychology  we have now finished our study of the less normal and usual phenomena which gave rise to belief in separable selfexisting conscious and powerful souls we have shown that the supernormal factors which when reflected on probably supported this belief are represented in civilised as well as in savage life while as to their existence among the founders of religion we can historically know nothing at all if we may infer from certain considerations the supernormal experiences were possibly more prevalent among the remote ancestors of known savage races than among their modern descendants we have suggested that clairvoyance thought transference and telepathy cannot be dismissed as mere fables by a cautious inquirer while even the far more obscure stories of physical manifestations are but poorly explained away by those who cannot explain them17 again these faculties have presentedin the acquisition of otherwise unattainable knowledge in coincidental hallucinations and in other waysjust the kind of facts on which the savage doctrine of souls might be based or by which it might be buttressed thus while the actuality of the supernormal facts and faculties remains at least an open question the prevalent theory of materialism cannot be admitted as dogmatically certain in its present shape no more than any other theory nay less than some other theories can it account for the psychical facts which at the lowest we may not honestly leave out of the reckoning  we have therefore no more to say about the supernormal aspects of the origins of religion we are henceforth concerned with matters of verifiable belief and practice we have to ask whether when once the doctrine of souls was conceived by early men it took precisely the course of development usually indicated by anthropological science  footnote 1 darwin journal p 458 tylor prim

touched upon will be found in appendix b  footnote 17 see appendix b     ix  evolution of the idea of god  to the anthropological philosopher a plain man would naturally put the question having got your idea of spirit or soulyour theory of animismout of the idea of ghosts and having got your idea of ghosts out of dreams and visions how do you get at the idea of god now by god the proverbial plain man of controversy means a primal eternal being author of all things the father and friend of man the invisible omniscient guardian of morality  the usual though not invariable reply of the anthropologist might be given in the words of mr im thurn author of a most interesting work on the indians of british guiana  from the notion of ghosts says mr im thurn a belief has arisen but very gradually in higher spirits and eventually in a highest spirit and keeping pace with the growth of these beliefs a habit of reverence for and worship of spirits the indians of guiana know no god1  as another example of mr im thurns hypothesis that god is a late development from the idea of spirit may be cited mr paynes learned history of the new world a work of much research2  the lowest savages not only have no gods but do not even recognise those lower beings usually called spirits the conception of which has invariably preceded that of gods in the human mind  mr payne here differs toto caelo from mr tylor who finds no sufficient proof for wholly nonreligious savages and from roskoff who has disposed of the arguments of sir john lubbock mr payne then for ethnological purposes defines a god as a benevolent spirit permanently embodied in some tangible object usually an image and to whom food drink and so on are regularly offered for the purpose of securing assistance in the affairs of life  on this theory the lowest savages are devoid of the idea of god or of spirit later they develop the idea of spirit and when they have secured the spirit as it were in a tangible object and kept it on board wages then the spirit has attained to the dignity and the savage to the conception of a god but while a god of this kind is in mr paynes opinion relatively a late flower of culture for the hunting races generally with some exceptions have no gods yet the conception of a creator or maker of all things  obviously a great spirit is one of the earliest efforts of primitive logic3  mr paynes own logic is not very clear the primitive logic of the savage leads him to seek for a cause or maker of things which he finds in a great creative spirit yet the lowest savages have no idea even of spirit and the hunting races as a rule have no god does mr payne mean that a great creative spirit is not a god while a spirit kept on board wages in a tangible object is a god we are unable by reason of evidence later to be given to agree with mr paynes view of the facts while his reasoning appears somewhat inconsistent the lowest savages having in his opinion no idea of spirit though the idea of a creative spirit is for all that one of the earliest efforts of primitive logic  on any such theories as these the belief in a moral supreme being is a very late or a very early result of evolution due to the action of advancing thought upon the original conception of ghosts this opinion of mr im thurns is roughly stated the usual theory of anthropologists we wish on the other hand to show that the idea of god as he is conceived of by our inquiring plain man is shadowed forth among contradictory fables in the lowestknown grades of savagery and therefore cannot arise from the later speculation of men comparatively civilised and advanced on the original datum of ghosts we shall demonstrate contrary to the opinion of mr spencer mr huxley and even mr tylor that the supreme being and in one case at least the casual sprites of savage faith are active moral influences what is even more important we shall make it undeniable that anthropology has simplified her problem by neglecting or ignoring her facts while the real problem is to account for the evolution out of ghosts of the eternal creative moral god of the plain man the germ of such a god or being in the creeds of the lowest savages is by anthropologists denied or left out of sight or accounted for by theories contradicted by facts or at best is explained away as a result of european or islamite influences now as the problem is to account for the evolution of the highest conception of god as far as that conception exists among the most backward races the problem can never be solved while that highest conception of god is practically ignored  thus anthropologists as a rule in place of facing and solving their problem have merely evaded itdoubtless unwittingly this of course is not the practice of mr tylor though even his great work is professedly much more concerned with the development of the idea of spirit and with the lower forms of animism than with the real cruxthe evolution of the idea always obscured by mythology of a moral uncreated undying god among the lowest savages this negligence of anthropologists has arisen from a single circumstance they take it for granted that god is always except where the word for god is applied to a living human being regarded as spirit thus having accounted for the development of the idea of spirit they regard god as that idea carried to its highest power and as the final step in its evolution but if we can show that the early idea of an undying moral creative being does not necessarily or logically imply the doctrine of spirit or ghost then this idea of an eternal moral creative being may have existed even before the doctrine of spirit was evolved  we may admit that mr tylors account of the process by which gods were evolved out of ghosts is a little touffurather buried in facts we can scarcely see the wood for the trees we want to know how gods makers of things or of most things fathers in heaven and friends guardians of morality seeing what is good or bad in the hearts of men were evolved as is supposed out of ghosts or surviving souls of the dead that such moral practically omniscient gods are known to the very lowest savagesbushmen fuegians australianswe shall demonstrate  here the inquirer must be careful not to adopt the common opinion that gods improve morally and otherwise in direct ratio to the rising grades in the evolution of culture and civilisation that is not necessarily the case usually the reverse occurs still less must we take it for granted following mr tylor and mr huxley that the alliance of religion and morality belongs almost or wholly to religions above the savage levelnot to the earlier and lower creeds or that among the australian savages and in its simplest condition theology is wholly independent of ethics4 these statements can be proved by such evidence as anthropology is obliged to rely upon to be erroneous and just because these statements are put forward anthropology has an easier task in explaining the origin of religion while just because these statements are incorrect her conclusion being deduced from premises so far false is invalidated  given souls acquired by thinking on the lines already described mr tylor develops gods out of them but he is not one of the writers who is certain about every detail he scarcely attempts to clear away the haze that covers great parts of the subject5  the human soul he says has been the model on which man framed his ideas of spiritual beings in general from the tiniest elf that sports in the grass up to the heavenly creator and ruler of the world the great spirit here it is taken for granted that the heavenly ruler was from the first envisaged as a spiritual beingwhich is just the difficulty was he6  the process of framing these ideas is rather obscure the savage lives in terror of the souls of the dead as harmful spirits this might yield a devil it would not yield a god who makes for righteousness happily deified ancestors are regarded on the whole as kindly spirits the dead ancestor is now passed into a deity7 examples of ancestorworship follow but we are no nearer home for among the zulus many amatongo ancestral spirits are sacred yet their father ie the father of each actual family is far before all others when they worship the amatongo they do not know the ancients who are dead nor their laudgiving names nor their names8 thus each new generation of zulus must have a new first worshipful objectits own fathers itongo this father and his very name are in a generation or two forgotten the name of such a man therefore cannot survive as that of the god or supreme being from age to age and obviously such a real dead man while known at all is much too well known to be taken for the creator and ruler of the world despite some african flattering titles and superstitions about kings who control the weather the zulus about as godless a people as possible have a mythical first ancestor unkulunkulu but he is beyond the reach of rites and is a centre of myths rather than of worship or of moral ideas9  after other examples of ancestorworship mr tylor branches off into a long discussion of the theory of possession or inspiration10 which does not assist the argument at the present point thence he passes to fetishism already discussed by us and the transitions from the fetish1 to the idol 2 to the guardian angel subliminal self 3 to tree and river spirits and local spirits which cause volcanoes and 4 to polytheism a fetish may inhabit a tree trees being generalised the fetish of one oak becomes the god of the forest or again fetishes rise into species gods the gods of all bees owls or rabbits are thus evolved  next11  as chiefs and kings are among men so are the great gods among the lesser spirits with little exception wherever a savage or barbaric system of religion is thoroughly described great gods make their appearance in the spiritual world as distinctly as chiefs in the human tribe  very good but whence comes the great god among tribes which have neither chief nor king and probably never had as among the fuegians bushmen and australians the maker and ruler of the world known to these races cannot be the shadow of king or chief reflected and magnified on the mist of thought for chief or king these peoples have none this theory humes will not work where people have a great god but no king or chief nor where they have a king but no zeus or other supreme kinggod as i conceive among the aztecs  we now reach in mr tylors theory great fetish deities such as heaven and earth sun and moon and departmental deities gods of agriculture war and so forth unknown to low savages  next mr tylor introduces an important personage the theory of family manes carried back to tribal gods leads to the recognition of superior deities of the nature of divine ancestor or first man who sometimes ranks as lord of the dead as an instance mr tylor gives the maori maui who like the indian yama trod first of men the path of death but whether maui and yama are the sun or not both maori and sanskrit religion regard these heroes as much later than the original gods in kamschatka the first man is the son of the creator and it is about the origin of the idea of the creator not of the first man that we are inquiring adam is called the son of god in a biblical genealogy but of course adam was made not begotten the case of the zulu belief will be analysed later on the whole we cannot explain away the conception of the creator as a form of the conception of an idealised divine first ancestor because the conception of a creator occurs where ancestorworship does not occur and again because supposing that the idea of a creator came first and that ancestorworship later grew more popular the popular idea of ancestor might be transferred to the waning idea of creator the creator might be recognised as the first ancestor apr√®s coup  mr tylor next approaches dualism the idea of hostile good and bad beings we must as he says be careful to discount european teaching still he admits the savage has this dualistic belief in a primitive form but the savage conception is not merely that of good  friendly to me bad  hostile to me ethics as we shall show already come into play in his theology  mr tylor arrives at last at the supreme being of savage creeds his words well weighed must be cited textually  to mark off the doctrines of monotheism closer definition is required than the bare idea of a supreme creator assigning the distinctive attributes of deity to none save the almighty creator it may be declared that in this strict sense no savage tribe of monotheists has been ever known12 nor are any fair representatives of the lower culture in a strict sense pantheists the doctrine which they do widely hold and which opens to them a course tending in one or other of these directions is polytheism culminating in the rule of one supreme divinity high above the doctrine of souls of divine manes of local nature gods of the great gods of class and element there are to be discerned in barbaric theology shadowings quaint or majestic of the conception of a supreme deity henceforth to be traced onward in expanding power and brightening glory along the history of religion it is no unimportant task partial as it is to select and group the typical data which show the nature and position of the doctrine of supremacy as it comes into view within the lower culture13  we shall show that certain low savages are as monotheistic as some christians they have a supreme being and the distinctive attributes of deity are not by them assigned to other beings further than as christianity assigns them to angels saints the devil and strange as it appears among savages to mediating sons  it is not known that among the andamanese and other tribes this last notion is due to missionary influence but in regard to the whole chapter of savage supreme beings we must as mr tylor advises keep watching for christian and islamite contamination the savage notions as mr tylor says even when thus contaminated may have to some extent a native substratum we shall select such savage examples of the idea of a supreme being as are attested by ancient native hymns or are inculcated in the most sacred and secret savage institutions the religious mysteries manifestly the last things to be touched by missionary influence or are found among low insular races defended from european contact by the jealous ferocity and poisonous jungles of people and soil we also note cases in which missionaries found such native names as father ancient of heaven maker of all readymade to their hands  it is to be remarked that while this branch of the inquiry is practically omitted by mr spencer mr tylor can spare for it but some twenty pages out of his large work he arranges the probable germs of the savage idea of a supreme being thus a god of the polytheistic crowd is simply raised to the primacy which of course cannot occur where there is no polytheism or the principle of manes worship may make a supreme deity out of a primeval ancestor say unkulunkulu who is so far from being supreme that he is abject or again a great phenomenon or force in natureworship say sun or heaven is raised to supremacy or speculative philosophy ascends from the many to the one by trying to discern through and beyond the universe a first cause animistic conceptions thus reach their utmost limit in the notion of the anima mundi he may accumulate all powers of all polytheistic gods or he may loom vast shadowy and calm  too benevolent to need human worship  too merely existent to concern himself with the petty race of men14 but he is always animistic  now in addition to the objections already noted in passing how can we tell that the supreme being of low savages was in original conception animistic at all how can we know that he was envisaged originally as spirit we shall show that he probably was not that the question spirit or not spirit was not raised at all that the maker and father in heaven prior to death was merely regarded as a deathless being no question of spirit being raised if so animism was not needed for the earliest idea of a moral eternal this hypothesis will be found to lead to some very singular conclusions  it will be more fully stated and illustrated presently but i find that it had already occurred to dr brinton15 he is talking specially of a heavengod he says it came to pass that the idea of god was linked to the heavens long ere man asked himself are the heavens material and god spiritual dr brinton however does not develop his idea nor am i aware that it has been developed previously  the notion of a god about whose spirituality nobody has inquired is new to us to ourselves and doubtless or probably to barbarians on a certain level of culture such a divine being must be animistic must be a spirit to take only one case to which we shall return the banks islanders melanesia believe in ghosts and in the existence of beings who were not and never had been human all alike might be called spirits says dr codrington but ex hypothesi the beings who never were human are only called spirits by us because our habits of thought do not enable us to envisage them except as spirits they never were men the natives will always maintain that he the vui was something different and deny to him the fleshly body of a man while resolute that he was not a ghost16  this point will be amply illustrated later as we study that strangely neglected chapter that essential chapter the higher beliefs of the lowest savages of the existence of a belief in a supreme being not as merely alleged there is as good evidence as we possess for any fact in the ethnographic region  it is certain that savages when first approached by curious travellers and missionaries have again and again recognised our god in theirs  the mythical details and fables about the savage god are indeed different the ethical benevolent admonishing rewarding and creative aspects of the gods are apt to be the same17  there is no necessity for beginning to tell even the most degraded of these people of the existence of god or of a future state the facts being universally admitted18  intelligent men among the bakwains have scouted the idea of any of them ever having been without a tolerably clear conception of good and evil god and the future state nothing we indicate as sin ever appeared to them as otherwise except polygamy says livingstone  now we may agree with mr tylor that modern theologians familiar with savage creeds will scarcely argue that they are direct or nearly direct products of revelation vol ii p 356 but we may argue that considering their nascent ethics denied or minimised by many anthropologists and the distance which separates the high gods of savagery from the ghosts out of which they are said to have sprung considering too that the relatively pure and lofty element which ex hypothesi is most recent in evolution is also not the most honoured but often just the reverse remembering above all that we know nothing historically of the mental condition of the founders of religion we may hesitate to accept the anthropological hypothesis en masse at best it is conjectural and the facts are such that opponents have more justification than is commonly admitted for regarding the bulk of savage religion as degenerate or corrupted from its own highest elements i am by no means as yet arguing positively in favour of that hypothesis but i see what its advocates mean or ought to mean and the strength of their position mr tylor with his unique fairness says the degeneration theory no doubt in some instances with justice may claim such beliefs as mutilated and perverted remains of higher religion vol ii p 336  i do not pretend to know how the lowest savages evolved the theory of a god who reads the heart and makes for righteousness it is as easy almost for me to believe that they were not left without a witness as to believe that this god of theirs was evolved out of the maleficent ghost of a dirty mischievous medicineman  here one may repeat that while the quaint or majestic foreshadowings of a supreme being among very low savages are only sketched lightly by mr tylor in mr herbert spencers system they seem to be almost omitted in his principles of sociology and ecclesiastical institutions one looks in vain for an adequate notice in vain for almost any notice of this part of his topic the watcher of conduct the friendly creative being of low savage faith whence was he evolved the circumstance of his existence as far as i can see the chastity the unselfishness the pitifulness the loyalty to plighted word the prohibition of even extratribal homicide enjoined in various places on his worshippers are problems that appear somehow to have escaped mr spencers notice we are puzzled by endless difficulties in his system for example as to how savages can forget their greatgrandfathers very names and yet remember traditional persons from generation to generation so that in time any amount of expansion and idealisation can be reached19  again mr spencer will argue that it is a strange thing if primitive men had as some think the consciousness of a universal power whence they and all other things proceeded and yet spontaneously performed to that power an act like that performed by them to the dead body of a fellow savageby offerings of food20  now first there would be nothing strange in the matter if the crude idea of universal power came earliest and was superseded in part by a later propitiation of the dead and ghosts the new religious idea would soon refract back on and influence by its ritual the older conception and secondly it is precisely this universal power that is not propitiated by offerings of food in tonga despite mr huxley australia and africa for example we cannot escape the difficulty by saying that there the old ghost of universal power is regarded as dead decrepit or as a roifain√©ant not worth propitiating for that is not true of the punisher of sin the teacher of generosity and the solitary sanction of faith between men and peoples  it would appear then on the whole that the question of the plain man to the anthropologist having got your idea of spirit into the savages mind how does he develop out of it what i call god has not been answered god cannot be a reflection from human kings where there have been no kings nor a president elected out of a polytheistic society of gods where there is as yet no polytheism nor an ideal first ancestor where men do not worship their ancestors while again the spirit of a man who died real or ideal does not answer to a common savage conception of the creator all this will become much more obvious as we study in detail the highest gods of the lowest races  our study of course does not pretend to embrace the religion of all the savages in the world we are content with typical and as a rule wellobserved examples we range from the creeds of the most backward and worstequipped nomad races to those of peoples with an aristocracy hereditary kings houses and agriculture ending with the supreme being of the highly civilised incas

gods of low races  to avoid misconception we must repeat the necessary cautions about accepting evidence as to high gods of low races the missionary who does not see in every alien god a devil is apt to welcome traces of an original supernatural revelation darkened by all peoples but the jews we shall not however rely much on missionary evidence and when we do we must now be equally on our guard against the anthropological bias in the missionary himself having read mr spencer and mr tylor and finding himself among ancestorworshippers as he sometimes does he is apt to think that ancestorworship explains any traces of a belief in the supreme being against each and every bias of observers we must be watchful  it may be needful too to point out once again another weak point in all reasoning about savage religion namely that we cannot always tell what may have been borrowed from europeans thus the fuegians in 18301840 were far out of the way but one tribe near magellans straits worshipped an image called cristo fitzroy attributes this obvious trace of catholicism to a captain pelippa who visited the district some time before his own expedition it is less probable that spaniards established a belief in a moral deity in regions where they left no material traces of their faith the fuegians are not easily proselytised when discovered by strangers the instant impulse of a fuegian family is to run off into the woods occasionally they will emerge to barter but sometimes nothing will induce a single individual of the family to appear fitzroy thought they had no idea of a future state because among other reasons not given the evil spirit torments them in this world if they do wrong by storms hail snow c why the evil spirit should punish evil deeds is not evident a great black man is supposed to be always wandering about the woods and mountains who is certain of knowing every word and every action who cannot be escaped and who influences the weather according to mens conduct1  there are no traces of propitiation by food or sacrifice or anything but conduct to regard the deity as a magnified nonnatural man is not peculiar to fuegian theologians and does not imply animism but the reverse but the point is that this ethical judge of perhaps the lowest savages makes for righteousness and searches the heart his morality is so much above the ordinary savage standard that he regards the slaying of a stranger and an enemy caught redhanded in robbery as a sin yorks brother york was a fuegian brought to england by fitzroy killed a wild man who was stealing his birds rain come down snow come down hail come down wind blow blow very much blow very bad to kill man big man in woods no like it he very angry here be ethics in savage religion the sixth commandment is in force the being also prohibits the slaying of flappers before they can fly very bad to shoot little duck come wind come rain blow very much blow2  now this big man is not a deified chief for the fuegians have no superiority of one over another  but the doctorwizard of each party has much influence mr spencer disposes of this moral big man of the fuegians as evidently a deceased weatherdoctor3 but first there is no evidence that the being is regarded as ever having died again it is not shown that fuegians are ancestorworshippers next fitzroy did not think that the fuegians believed in a future life lastly when were medicinemen such notable moralists the worst spirits among the neighbouring patagonians are those of dead medicinemen as a rule everywhere the ghost of a doctorwizard shaman or whatever he may be called is the worst and wickedest of all ghosts how then the fuegians who are not proved to be ancestorworshippers evolved out of the malignant ghost of an ancestor a being whose strong point is morality one does not easily conceive the adjacent chonos have great faith in a good spirit whom they call yerri yuppon and consider to be the author of all good him they invoke in distress or danger however starved they do not touch food till a short prayer has been muttered over each portion the praying man looking upward4 they have magicians but no details are given as to spirits or ghosts if fuegian and chono religion is on this level and if this be the earliest then the theology of many other higher savages as of the zulus is decidedly degenerate the bantu gives one accustomed to the negro the impression that he once had the same set of ideas but has forgotten half of them says miss kingsley5  of all races now extant the australians are probably lowest in culture and like the fauna of the continent are nearest to the primitive model they have neither metals bows pottery agriculture nor fixed habitations and no traces of higher culture have anywhere been found above or in the soil of the continent this is important for in some respects their religious conceptions are so lofty that it would be natural to explain them as the result either of european influence or as relics of a higher civilisation in the past the former notion is discredited by the fact that their best religious ideas are imparted in connection with their ancient and secret mysteries while for the second idea that they are degenerate from a loftier civilisation there is absolutely no evidence  it has been suggested indeed by mr spencer that the singularly complex marriage customs of the australian blacks point to a more polite condition in their past history of this stage as we said no material traces have ever been discovered nor can degeneration be recent our earliest account of the australians is that of dampier who visited new holland in the unhappy year 1688 he found the natives the miserablest people in the world the hodmadods of mononamatapa though a nasty people yet for wealth are gentlemen to these who have no houses sheep poultry and fruits of the earth they have no houses but lie in the open air curiously enough dampier attests their unselfishness the main ethical feature in their religious teaching be it little or be it much they get every one has his part as well the young and tender as the old and feeble who are not able to go abroad as the strong and lusty dampier saw no metals used nor any bows merely boomerangs wooden cutlasses and lances with points hardened in the fire their place of dwelling was only a fire with a few boughs before it the gunyeh  this description remains accurate for most of the unsophisticated australian tribes but dampier appears only to have seen ichthyophagous coast blacks  there is one more important point in the bora or australian mysteries at which knowledge of the maker and of his commandments is imparted the front teeth of the initiated are still knocked out now dampier observed the two foreteeth of their upper jaw are wanting in all of them men and women old and young if this is to be taken quite literally the bora rite in 1688 must have included the women at least locally dampier was on the northwest coast in latitude 16 degrees longitude 12214 degrees east dampier land west australia the natives had neither boats canoes nor bark logs but it seems that they had their religious mysteries and their unselfishness two hundred years ago6  the australians have been very carefully studied by many observers and the results entirely overthrow mr huxleys bold statement that in its simplest condition such as may be met with among the australian savages theology is a mere belief in the existence powers and dispositions usually malignant of ghostlike entities who may be propitiated or scared away but no cult can properly be said to exist and in this stage theology is wholly independent of ethics  remarks more crudely in defiance of known facts could not be made the australians assuredly believe in spirits often malicious and probably in most cases regarded as ghosts of men these aid the wizard and occasionally inspire him that these ghosts are worshipped does not appear and is denied by waitz again in the matter of cult there is none in the way of sacrifice to higher gods as there should be if these gods were hungry ghosts the cult among the australians is the keeping of certain laws expressed in moral teaching supposed to be in conformity with the institutes of their god worship takes the form as at eleusis of tribal mysteries originally instituted as at eleusis by the god the young men are initiated with many ceremonies some of which are cruel and farcical but the initiation includes ethical instruction in conformity with the supposed commands of a god who watches over conduct as among ourselves the ethical ideal with its theological sanction is probably rather above the moral standard of ordinary practice what conclusion we should draw from these facts is uncertain but the facts at least cannot be disputed and precisely contradict the statement of mr huxley he was wholly in the wrong when he said the moral code such as is implied by public opinion derives no sanction from theological dogmas7 it reposes for its origin and sanction on such dogmas  the evidence as to australian religion is abundant and is being added to yearly i shall here content myself with mr howitts accounts8  as regards the possible evolution of the australian god from ancestorworship it must be noted that mr howitt credits the groups with possessing headmen a kind of chiefs whereas some inquirers in brough smyths collection disbelieve in regular chiefs mr howitt writes  the supreme spirit who is believed in by all the tribes i refer to here in southeastern australia either as a benevolent or more frequently as a malevolent being it seems to me represents the defunct headman  now the traces of headmanship among the tribes are extremely faint no such headman rules large areas of country none is known to be worshipped after death and the malevolence of the supreme spirit is not illustrated by the details of mr howitts own statement but the reverse indeed he goes on at once to remark that darumulun was not it seems to me everywhere thought a malevolent being but he was dreaded as one who could severely punish the trespasses committed against these tribal ordinances and customs whose first institution is ascribed to him  to punish transgressions of his law is not the essence of a malevolent being darumulun watched the youths from the sky prompt to punish by disease or death the breach of his ordinances moral or ritual his name is too sacred to be spoken except in whispers and the anthropologist will observe that the names of the human dead are also often tabooed but the divine name is not thus tabooed and sacred when the mere folklore about him is narrated the informants of mr howitt instinctively distinguished between the mythology and the religion of darumulun9 this distinction the secrecy about the religion the candour about the mythologyis essential and accounts for our ignorance about the inner religious beliefs of early races mr howitt himself knew little till he was initiated the grandfather of mr howitts friend before the white men came to melbourne took him out at night and pointing to a star said you will soon be a man you see bunjil supreme being of certain tribes up there and he can see you and all you do down here mr palmer speaking of the mysteries of northern australians mysteries under divine sanction mentions the nature of the moral instruction each lad is given by one of the elders advice so kindly fatherly and impressive as often to soften the heart and draw tears from the youth he is to avoid adultery not to take advantage of a woman if he finds her alone he is not to be quarrelsome10  at the mysteries darumuluns real name may be uttered at other times he is master biamban or father papang exactly as we say lord and father  it is known that all these things are not due to missionaries whose instructions would certainly not be conveyed in the bora or tribal mysteries which again are partly described by collins as early as 1798 and must have been practised in 1688 mr howitt mentions among moral lessons divinely sanctioned respect for old age abstinence from lawless love and avoidance of the sins so popular poetic and sanctioned by the example of gods in classical greece11 a representation is made of the master biamban and to make such idols except at the mysteries is forbidden under pain of death those which are made are destroyed as soon as the rites are ended12 the future life apparently is then illustrated by the burial of a living elder who rises from a grave this may however symbolise the new life of the mystae worse have i fled better have i found as was sung in an athenian rite the whole result is by what mr howitt calls a quasireligious element to impress upon the mind of the youth in an indelible manner those rules of conduct which form the moral law of the tribe13  many other authorities could be adduced for the religious sanction of morals in australia a watchful being observes and rewards the conduct or men he is named with reverence if named at all his abode is the heavens he is the master and lord of things his lessons soften the heart14    what wants this knave   that a god should have  i shall now demonstrate that the religion patronised by the australian supreme being and inculcated in his mysteries is actually used to counteract the immoral character which natives acquire by associating with anglosaxon christians15  mr howitt16 gives an account of the jeraeil or mysteries of the kurnai the old men deemed that through intercourse with whites the lads had become selfish and no longer inclined to share that which they obtained by their own exertions or had given them with their friends one need not say that selflessness is the very essence of goodness and the central moral doctrine of christianity so it is in the religious mysteries of the african yao a selfish man we shall see is spoken of as uninitiated so it is with the australian kurnai whose mysteries and ethical teaching are under the sanction of their supreme being so much for the anthropological dogma that early theology has no ethics  the kurnai began by kneading the stomachs of the lads about to be initiated that is if they have been associating with christians to expel selfishness and greed the chief rite later is to blindfold every lad with a blanket closely drawn over his head to make whirring sounds with the tundun or greek rhombos then to pluck off the blankets and bid the initiate raise their faces to the sky the initiator points to it calling out look there look there look there they have seen in this solemn way the home of the supreme being our father munganngaur mungan  father ngaur  our whose doctrine is then unfolded by the old initiator headman in an impressive manner17 long ago there was a great being munganngaur who lived on the earth his son tundun is direct ancestor of the kurnai mungan initiated the rites and destroyed earth by water when they were impiously revealed mungan left the earth and ascended to the sky where he still remains  here munganngaur a being not defined as spirit but immortal and dwelling in heaven is father or rather grandfather not maker of the kurnai this may be interpreted as ancestorworship but the opposite myth of making or creating is of frequent occurrence in many widelysevered australian districts and coexists with evolutionary myths munganngaurs precepts are    1 to listen to and obey the old men   2 to share everything they have with their friends   3 to live peaceably with their friends    4 not to interfere with girls or married women    5 to obey the food restrictions until they are released from them by      the old men  mr howitt concludes i venture to assert that it can no longer be maintained that the australians have no belief which can be called religious that is in the sense of beliefs which govern tribal and individual morality under a supernatural sanction on this topic mr hewitts opinion became more affirmative the more deeply he was initiated18  the australians are the lowest most primitive savages yet no propitiation by food is made to their moral ruler in heaven as if he were a ghost  the laws of these australian divine beings apply to ritual as well as to ethics as might naturally be expected but the moral element is conspicuous the reverence is conspicuous we have here no mere ghost propitiated by food or sacrifice or by purely magical rites his very image modelled on a large scale in earth is no vulgar idol to make such a thing except on the rare sacred occasions is a capital offence meanwhile the mythology of the god has often in or out of the rites nothing rational about it  on the whole it is evident that mr herbert spencer for example underrates the nature of australian religion he cites a case of addressing the ghost of a man recently dead which is asked not to bring sickness or make loud noises in the night and says here we may recognise the essential elements of a cult but mr spencer does not allude to the much more essentially religious elements which he might have found in the very authority whom he cites mr brough smyth19 this appears as far as my scrutiny goes to be mr spencers solitary reference to australia in the work on ecclesiastical institutions yet the facts which he and mr huxley ignore throw a light very different from theirs on what they consider the simplest condition of theology  among the causes of confusion in thought upon religion mr tylor mentions the partial and onesided application of the historical method of inquiry into theological doctrines20 here perhaps we have examples in its highest aspect that simplest theology of australia is free from the faults of popular theology in greece the god discourages sin though in myth he is far from impeccable he is almost too revered to be named except in mythology and is not to be represented by idols he is not moved by sacrifice he has not the chance like death in greece he only of all gods loves not gifts thus the status of theology does not correspond to what we look for in very low culture it would scarcely be a paradox to say that the popular zeus or ares is degenerate from munganngaur or the fuegian being who forbids the slaying of an enemy and almost literally marks the sparrows fall  if we knew all the mythology of darumulun we should probably find it like much of the myth of pundjel or bunjil on a very different level from the theology there are two currents the religious and the mythical flowing together through religion the former current religious even among very low savages is pure from the magical ghostpropitiating habit the latter current mythological is full of magic mummery and scandalous legend sometimes the latter stream quite pollutes the former sometimes they flow side by side perfectly distinguishable as in aztec ethical piety compared with the bloody aztec ritualism anthropology has mainly kept her eyes fixed on the impure stream the lusts mummeries conjurings and frauds of priesthoods while relatively or altogether neglecting as we have shown what is honest and of good report  the worse side of religion is the less sacred and therefore the more conspicuous both elements are found coexisting in almost all races and nobody in our total lack of historical information about the beginnings can say which if either element is the earlier or which if either is derived from the other to suppose that propitiation of corpses and then of ghosts came first is agreeable and seems logical to some writers who are not without a bias against all religion as an unscientific superstition but we know so little the first missionaries in greenland supposed that there was not there a trace of belief in a divine being but when they came to understand their language better they found quite the reverse to be true  and not only so but they could plainly gather from a free dialogue they had with some perfectly wild greenlanders at that time avoiding any direct application to their hearts that their ancestors must have believed in a supreme being and did render him some service which their posterity neglected little by little21 mr tylor does not refer to this as a trace of christian scandinavian influence on the eskimo22  that line of course may be taken but an eskimo said to a missionary thou must not imagine that no greenlander thinks about these things theology he then stated the argument from design certainly there must be some being who made all these things he must be very good too ah did i but know him how i would love and honour him as st paul writes that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath showed it unto them  being understood by the things which are made  but they became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened23 in fact mythology submerged religion st pauls theory of the origin of religion is not that of an innate idea nor of a direct revelation people he says reached the belief in a god from the argument for design science conceives herself to have annihilated teleological ideas but they are among the probable origins of religion and would lead to the belief in a creator whom the greenlander thought beneficent and after whom he yearned this is a very different initial step in religious development if initial it was from the feeding of a corpse or a ghost  from all this evidence it does not appear how nonpolytheistic nonmonarchical nonmanesworshipping savages evolved the idea of a relatively supreme moral and benevolent creator unborn undying watching mens lives he can go everywhere and do everything24  footnote 1 fitzroy ii 180 darwin descent of man p 67  footnote 2 ibid we seem to have little information about fuegian religion either before or after the cruise of the beagle  footnote

gods not necessarily developed out of spirits  before going on to examine the high gods of other low savages i must here again insist on and develop the theory not easily conceived by us that the supreme being of savages belongs to another branch of faith than ghosts or ghostgods or fetishes or totems and need not beprobably is notessentially derived from these we must try to get rid of our theory that a powerful moral eternal being was from the first ex officio conceived as spirit and so was necessarily derived from a ghost  first what was the process of development  we have examined mr tylors theory but to take a practical case here are the australians roaming in small bands without more formal rulers than headmen at most not ancestor worshippers not polytheists with no departmental deities to select and aggrandise not apt to speculate on the anima mundi how then did they bridge the gulf between the ghost of a soonforgotten fighting man and that conception of a father above allseeing moral which under various names is found all over a huge continent i cannot see that this problem has been solved or frankly faced  the distinction between the australian deity at his highest power unpropitiated by sacrifice and the ordinary waning easily forgotten cheaply propitiated ghost of a tribesman is essential it is not easy to show how in the dark backward of australian life the notion of munganngaur grew from the idea of the ghost of a warrior but there is no logical necessity for the belief in the evolution of this god out of that ghost these two factors in religionghost and godseem to have perfectly different sources and it appears extraordinary that anthropologists have not as far as i am aware observed this circumstance before  mr spencer indeed speaks frequently of living human beings adored as gods i do not know that these are found on the lowest levels of savagery and mr jevons has pointed out that before you can hail a man as a god you must have the idea of god the murder of captain cook notoriously resulted from a scientific experiment in theology if he is a god he cannot be killed so they tried with a dagger and found that the honest captain was but a mortal british marinerno god at all there are degrees mr spencers mengods become real godsafter death1  now the supreme being of savage faith as a rule never died at all he belonged to a world that knew not death  one cause of our blindness to the point appears to be this we have from childhood been taught that god is a spirit we now can only conceive of an eternal being as a spirit we know that legions of savage gods are now regarded as spirits and therefore we have never remarked that there is no reason why we should take it for granted that the earliest deities of the earliest men were supposed by them to be spirits at all these gods might most judiciously be spoken of not as spirits but as undefined eternal beings to us such a being is necessarily a spirit but he was by no means necessarily so to an early thinker who may not yet have reached the conception of a ghost  a ghost is said by anthropologists to have developed into a god now the very idea of a ghost apart from a wraith or fetch implies the previous death of his proprietor a ghost is the phantasm of a dead man but anthropologists continually tell us with truth that the idea of death as a universal ordinance is unknown to the savage diseases and death are things that once did not exist and that normally ought not to occur the savage thinks they are in his opinion supernormally caused by magicians and spirits death came into the world by a blunder an accident an error in ritual a decision of a god who was before death was scores of myths are told everywhere on this subject2  the savage supreme being with added power omniscience and morality is the idealisation of the savage as conceived of by himself minus fleshly body as a rule and minus death he is not necessarily a spirit though that term may now be applied to him he was not originally differentiated as spirit or not spirit he is a being conceived of without the question of spirit or no spirit being raised perhaps he was originally conceived of before that question could be raised by men when we call the supreme being of savages a spirit we introduce our own animistic ideas into a conception where it may not have originally existed if the god is the savage himself raised to the nth power so much the less of a spirit is he mr matthew arnold might as well have said the british philistine has no knowledge of god he believes that the creator is a magnified nonnatural man living in the sky the gippsland or fuegian or blackfoot supreme being is just a being anthropomorphic not a mrart or spirit the supreme being is a wesen being vui we have hardly a term for an immortal existence so undefined if the being is an idealised first ancestor as among the kurnai he is not on that account either man or ghost of man in the original conception he is a powerful intelligence who was from the first who was already active long before by a breach of his laws an error in the delivery of a message a breach of ritual or what not death entered the world he was not affected by the entry of death he still exists  modern minds need to become familiar with this indeterminate idea of the savage supreme being which logically may be prior to the evolution of the notion of ghost or spirit  but how does it apply when as by the kurnai the supreme being is reckoned an ancestor  it can very readily be shown that when the supreme being of a savage people is thus the idealised first ancestor he can never have been envisaged by his worshippers as at any time a ghost or at least cannot logically have been so envisaged where the nearly universal belief occurs that death came into the world by accident or needlessly  adam is the mythical first ancestor of the hebrews but he died greek uper moron and was not worshipped yama the first of aryan men who died was worshipped by vedic aryans but confessedly as a ghostgod mr tylor gives a list of first ancestors deified the ancestor of the maudans did not die consequently is no ghost emigravit he moved west where the first ancestor is also the creator dogrib indians he can hardly be and is not regarded as a mortal tamoi of the guaranis was the ancient of heaven clearly no mortal man the maori maui was the first who died but he is not one of the original maori gods haetsh among the kamchadals precisely answers to yama unkulunkulu will be described later3  this is the list where the first ancestor is equivalent to the creator and is supreme he isfrom the firstdeathless and immortal when he dies he is a confessed ghostgod  now ghostworship and dead ancestorworship are impossible before the ancestor is dead and is a ghost but the essential idea of munganngaur and baiame and most of the high gods of australia and of other low races is that they never died at all they belong to the period before death came into the world like qat among the melanesians they arise in an age that knew not death and had not reflected on phantasms nor evolved ghosts they could have been conceived of in the nature of the case by a race of immortals who never dreamed of such a thing as a ghost for these gods the ghosttheory is not required and is superfluous even contradictory the early thinkers who developed these beings did not need to know that men die though of course they did know it in practice still less did they need to have conceived by abstract speculation the hypothesis of ghosts baiame cagn bunjil in their adorers belief were there death later intruded among men but did not affect these divine beings in any way  the ghosttheory therefore by the evidence of anthropology itself is not needed for the evolution of the high gods of savages it is only needed for the evolution of ghostpropitiation and genuine deadancestor worship therefore the high gods described were not necessarily once ghostswere not idealised mortal ancestors they were naturally from the beginning from before the coming in of death immortal fathers now dwelling on high between them and apotheosised mortal ancestors there is a great gulf fixedthe river of death  the explicitly stated distinction that the high creative gods never were mortal men while other gods are spirits of mortal men is made in every quarter ancestors known to be human were not worshipped as original gods and ancestors worshipped as original gods were not believed to have been human4  both kinds may have a generic name such as kalou or wakan but the specific distinction is universally made by low savages on one hand original gods on the other nonoriginal gods that were once ghosts now this distinction is often calmly ignored whereas when any race has developed like late scandinavians the euhemeristic hypothesis all gods were once men that hypothesis is accepted as an historical statement of fact by some writers  it is part of my theory that the more popular ghostworship of souls of people whom men have loved invaded the possibly older religion of the supreme father mighty beings whether originally conceived of as spirits or not came later under the animistic theory to be reckoned as spirits they even but not among the lowest savages came to be propitiated by food and sacrifice the alternative for a supreme being when once animism prevailed was sacrifice as to more popular ghost deities or neglect we shall find examples of both alternatives but sacrifice does not prove that a god was in original conception a ghost or even a spirit the common doctrine of the old testament is not that god is spirit but that the spirit r√∫ah  wind living breath of jehovah going forth from him works in the world and among men5  to resume the high gods of savagerymoral allseeing directors of things and of menare not explicitly envisaged as spirits at all by their adorers the notion of soul or spirit is here out of place we can best describe pirnmeheal and n√°pi and baiame as magnified nonnatural men or undefined beings who were from the beginning and are undying they are like the easy epicurean gods nihil indiga nostri not being ghosts they crave no food from men and receive no sacrifice as do ghosts or gods developed out of ghosts or gods to whom the ghostritual has been transferred for this very reason apparently they seem to be spoken of by mr grant allen as gods to talk about not gods to adore mythological conceptions rather than religious beings6 all this is rather hard on the lowest savages if they sacrifice to a god then the god is a hungry ghost if they dont then the god is a god to talk about not to adore luckily the facts of the bora ritual and the instruction given there prove that mungannganr and other names are gods to adore by ethical conformity to their will and by solemn ceremony not merely gods to talk about  thus the highest element in the religion of the lowest savages does not appear to be derived from their theory of ghosts as far as we can say in the inevitable absence of historical evidence the highest gods of savages may have been believed in as makers and fathers and lords of an indeterminate nature before the savage had developed the idea of souls out of dreams and phantasms it is logically conceivable that savages may have worshipped deities like baiame and darumulun before they had evolved the notion that tom dick or harry has a separable soul capable of surviving his bodily decease deities of the higher sort by the very nature of savage reflections on death and on its nonoriginal casual character are prior or may be prior or cannot be shown not to be prior to the ghost theorythe alleged origin of religion for their evolution the ghost theory is not logically demanded they can do without it yet they and not the spirits bogles mrarts brewin and so forth are the high gods the gods who have most analogyas makers moral guides rewarders and punishers of conduct though that duty is also occasionally assumed by ancestral spiritswith our civilised conception of the divine our conception of god descends not from ghosts but from the supreme beings of nonancestorworshipping peoples  as it seems impossible to point out any method by which low chiefless nonpolytheistic nonmetaphysical savages if any such there be evolved out of ghosts the eternal beings who made the world and watch over morality as the people themselves unanimously distinguish such beings from ghostgods i take it that such beings never were ghosts in this case the animistic theory seems to me to break down completely yet these high gods of low savages preserve from dimmest ages of the meanest culture the sketch of a god which our highest religious thought can but fill up to its ideal come from what germ he may jehovah or allah does not come from a ghost  it may be retorted that this makes no real difference if savages did not invent gods in consequence of a fallacious belief in spirit and soul still in some other equally illogical way they came to indulge the hypothesis that they had a judge and father in heaven but if the ghost theory of the high gods is wrong as it is conspicuously superfluous that does make some difference it proves that a widely preached scientific conclusion may be as spectral as bathybius on other more important points therefore we may differ from the newest scientific opinion without too much diffident apprehensiveness  footnote 1 principles of sociology i 417 421 the medicine men are

supreme beings are most regarded as eternal moral as the morality of the tribe goes or above its habitual practice and powerful i have elsewhere described the bushman god cagn as he was portrayed to mr orpen by qing who had never before seen a white man except fighting mr orpen got the facts from qing by inducing him to explain the natives pictures on the walls of caves cagn made all things and we pray to him thus o cagn o cagn are we not thy children do you not see us hunger give us food as to ethics at first cagn was very good but he got spoilt through fighting so many things how came he into the world perhaps with those who brought the sun only the initiated know these things it appears that qing was not yet initiated in the dance answering to a high rite of the australian bora in which the most esoteric myths were unfolded1  in mr spencers descriptive sociology the religion of the bushmen is thus disposed of pray to an insect of the caterpillar kind for success in the chase that is rather meagre they make arrowpoison out of caterpillars2 though dr bleek perhaps correctly identifies cagn with ikaggen the insect  the case of the andaman islanders may be especially recommended to believers in the anthropological science of religion for long these natives were the joy of emancipated inquirers as the godless andamanese they only supply mr spencers ecclesiastical institutions with a few instances of the ghostbelief3 yet when the andamanese are scientifically studied in situ by an educated englishman mr man who knows their language has lived with them for eleven years and presided over our benevolent efforts to reclaim them from their savage state the andamanese turn out to be quite embarrassingly rich in the higher elements of faith they have not only a profoundly philosophical religion but an excessively absurd mythology like the australian blacks the greeks and other peoples if on the whole the student of the andamanese despairs of the possibility of an ethnological theory of religion he is hardly to be blamed  the people are probably negritos and probably the original inhabitants whose occupation dates from prehistoric times4 they use the bow they make pots and are considerably above the australian level they have secondsighted men who obtain status by relating an extraordinary dream the details of which are declared to have been borne out subsequently by some unforeseen event as for instance a sudden death or accident they have to produce fresh evidential dreams from time to time they see phantasms of the dead and coincidental hallucinations5 all this is as we should expect it to be  their religion is probably not due to missionaries as they always shot all foreigners and have no traditions of the presence of aliens on the islands before our recent arrival6 their god puluga is like fire but invisible he was never born and is immortal by him were all things created except the powers of evil he knows even the thoughts of the heart he is angered by yubda  sin or wrongdoing that is falsehood theft grave assault murder adultery bad carving of meat and as a crime of witchcraft by burning wax7 to those in pain or distress he is pitiful and sometimes deigns to afford relief he is judge of souls and the dread of future punishment to some extent is said to affect their course of action in the present life8  this being could not be evolved out of the ordinary ghost of a secondsighted man for i do not find that ancestral ghosts are worshipped nor is there a trace of early missionary influence while mr man consulted elderly and in native religion wellinstructed andamanese for his facts  yet puluga lives in a large stone house clearly derived from ours at port blair eats and drinks foraging for himself and is married to a green shrimp9 there is the usual story of a deluge caused by the moral wrath of puluga the whole theology was scrupulously collected from natives unacquainted with other races  the account of andamanese religion does not tally with the anthropological hypothesis foreign influence seems to be more than usually excluded by insular conditions and the jealousy of the original inhabitants the evidence ought to make us reflect on the extreme obscurity of the whole problem  anthropological study of religion has hitherto almost entirely overlooked the mysteries of various races except in so far as they confirm the entry of the young people into the ranks of the adult their esoteric moral and religious teaching is nearly unknown to us save in a few instances it is certain that the mysteries of greece were survivals of savage ceremonies because we know that they included specific savage rites such as the use of the rhombos to make a whirring noise and the custom of ritual daubing with dirt and the sacred ballets daction in which as lucian and qing say mystic facts are danced out10 but while greece retained these relics of savagery there was something taught at eleusis which filled minds like platos and pindars with a happy religious awe now similar softening of the heart was the result of the teaching in the australian bora the yao mysteries inculcate the victory over self and till we are admitted to the secrets of all other savage mysteries throughout the world we cannot tell whether among mummeries frivolities and even license high ethical doctrines are not presented under the sanction of religion the new life and perhaps the future life are undeniably indicated in the australian mysteries by the simulated resurrection  i would therefore no longer say as in 1887 that the hellenic genius must have added to an old medicine dance all that the eleusinian mysteries possessed of beauty counsel and consolation11 these elements as well as the barbaric factors in the rites may have been developed out of such savage doctrine as softens the hearts of australians and yaos that this kind of doctrine receives religious sanction is certain where we know the secret of savage mysteries it is therefore quite incorrect and strangely presumptuous to deny with almost all anthropologists the alliance of ethics with religion among the most backward races we must always remember their secrecy about their inner religion their frankness about their mythological tales these we know the inner religion we ought to begin to recognise that we do not know  the case of the andamanese has taught us how vague even now is our knowledge and how obscure is our problem the example of the melanesians enforces these lessons it is hard to bring the melanesians within any theory dr codrington has made them the subject of a careful study and reports that while the european inquirer can communicate pretty freely on common subjects the vocabulary of ordinary life in almost useless when the region of mysteries and superstitions is approached12 the banks islanders are most free from an asiatic element of population on one side and a polynesian element on the other  the banks islanders believe in two orders of intelligent beings different from living men 1 ghosts of the dead 2 beings who were not and never had been human this as we have shown and will continue to show is the usual savage doctrine on the one hand are separable souls of men surviving the death of the body on the other are beings creators who were before men were and before death entered the world it is impossible logically to argue that these beings are only ghosts of real remote ancestors or of ideal ancestors these higher beings are not safely to be defined as spirits their essence is vague and we repeat the idea of their existence might have been evolved before the ghost theory was attained by men dr codrington says the conception can hardly be that of a purely spiritual being yet by whatever name the natives call them they are such as in english must be called spirits  that is our point god is a spirit these beings are gods therefore these are spirits but to their initial conception our idea of spirit is lacking they are beings who existed before death and still exist  the beings which never were human never died are vui the ghosts are tamate dr codrington uses ghosts for tamate spirits for vui but as to render vui spirits is to yield the essential point we shall call vui beings or simply vui a vui is not a spirit that has been a ghost the story may represent him as if a man but the native will always maintain that he was something different and deny to him the fleshly body of a man13  this distinction ghost on one sideoriginal being not a man not a ghost of a man on the otheris radical and nearly universal in savage religion anthropology neglecting the essential distinction insisted on in this case by dr codrington confuses both kinds under the style of spirits and derives both from ghosts of the dead dr codrington it should be said does not generalise but confines himself to the savages of whom he has made a special study but from the other examples of the same distinction which we have offered and the rest which we shall offer we think ourselves justified in regarding the distinction between a primeval eternal being or beings on one hand and ghosts or spirits exalted from ghosts estate on the other as common if not universal  there are corporeal and incorporeal vuis but the body of the corporeal vui is not a human body14 the chief is qat still at hand to help and invoked in prayers qat marawa look down upon me smooth the sea for us two that i may go safely over the sea qat created men and animals though in a certain district he is claimed as an ancestor p 268 two strata of belief have here been confused  the myth of qat is a jungle of facetiae and frolic with one or two serious incidents such as the beginning of death and the coming of night his mother was or became a stone stones playing a considerable part in the superstitions  the incorporeal vuis with nothing like a human life have a much higher place than qat and his brothers in the religious system they have neither names nor shapes nor legends they receive sacrifice and are in some uncertain way connected with stones these stones usually bear a fanciful resemblance to fruits or animals p 275 the only sacrifice in banks islands is that of shellmoney the mischievous spirits are tamate ghosts of men there is a belief in mana magical rapport dr codrington cannot determine the connection of this belief with that in spirits mana is the uncanny is x the unknown a revived impression of sense is nunuai as when a tired fisher half asleep at night feels the draw of a salmon and automatically strikes15 the common ghost is a bag of nunuai as living man in the opinion of some philosophers is a bag of sensations ghosts are only seen as spiritual lights which so commonly attend hallucinations among the civilised except in the prayers to qat and marawa prayer only invokes the dead p 285 in the western islands the offerings are made to ghosts and consumed by fire in the eastern banks isles they are made to spirits beings vui and there is no sacrificial fire now the worship of ghosts goes in these isles with the higher culture a more considerable advance in the arts of life the worship of nonghosts vui goes with the lower material culture16 this is rather the reverse of what we should expect in accordance with the anthropological theory according however to our theory animism and ghostworship may be of later development and belong to a higher level of culture than worship of a being or beings that never were ghosts in lepers isle ghosts do not appear to have prayers or sacrifices offered to them but cause disease and work magic17  the belief in the soul in melanesia does not appear to proceed from their dreams or visions in which deceased or absent persons are presented to them for they do not appear to believe that the soul goes out from the dreamer or presents itself as an object in his dreams nor does belief in other spirits seem to be founded on the appearance of life or motion in inanimate things18  to myself it rather looks as if all impressions had their nunuai real bodiless persistent afterimages that the soul is the complex of all of these nunuai that there is in the universe a kind of magical other called mana possessed in different proportions by different men vui tamate and material objects and that the atai or ataro of a man dead his ghost retains its old and acquires new mana19 it is an odd kind of metaphysic to find among very backward and isolated savages but the lesson of melanesia teaches us how very little we really know of the religion of low races how complex it is how hardly it can be forced into our theories if we take it as given in our knowledge allow for our ignorance and are not content to select facts which suit our hypothesis while ignoring the rest on a higher level of material culture than the melanesians are the fijians  fijian religion as far as we understand resembles the others in drawing an impassable line between ghosts and eternal gods the word kalou is applied to all supernal beings and mystic or magical things alike it seems to answer to mana in new zealand and melanesia to wakan in north america and to f√©e in old french as when perrault says about bluebeards key now the key was f√©e all gods are kalou but all things that are kalou are not gods gods are kalou vu deified ghosts are kalou yalo the former are eternal without beginning of days or end of years the latter are subject to infirmity and even to death20  the supreme being if we can apply the term to him is ndengei or degei who seems to be an impersonation of the abstract idea of eternal existence this idea is not easily developed out of the conception of a human soul which has died into a ghost and may die again his myth represents him as a serpent emblem of eternity or a body of stone with a serpents head his one manifestation is given by eating so neglected is he that a song exists about his lack of worshippers and gifts we made men says ndengei placed them on earth and yet they share to us only the under shell21 here is an extreme case of the selfexistent creative eternal mythically lodged in a serpents body and reduced to a jest  it is not easy to see any explanation if we reject the hypothesis that this is an old fallen form of faith with scarcely a temple the other unborn immortals are mythical warriors and adulterers like the popular deities of greece yet ndengei receives prayers through two sons of his mediating deities the priests are possessed or inspired by spirits and gods one is not quite clear as to whether ndengei is an inspiring god or not but that prayers are made to him is inconsistent with the belief in his eternal inaction a priest is represented as speaking for ndengei probably by inspiration my own mind departs from me and then when it is truly gone my god speaks by me is the account of this alternating personality given by a priest22  after informing us that ndengei is starved mr williams next tells about offerings to him in earlier days of hundreds of hogs23 he sends rain on earth animals men stones may all be kalou there is a hades as fantastic as that in the egyptian book of the dead and second sight flourishes  the mysteries include the sham raising of the dead and appear to be directed at propitiatory ghosts rather than at ndengei there are scenes of license particulars of almost incredible indecency have been privately forwarded to dr tylor24  suppose a religious reformer were to arise in one of the many savage tribes who as we shall show possess but neglect an eternal creator he would do what in the secular sphere was done by the mikado of japan the mikado was a political dendid or ndengeian awful withdrawn impotent potentate power was wielded by the tycoon a mikado of genius asserted himself hence arose modern japan in the same way a religious reformer like khuen ahten in egypt would preach down minor gods ghosts and sacred beasts and proclaim the primal maker ndengei dendid mtanga the king shall hae his ain again had it not been for the prophets israel by the time that greece and rome knew israel would have been worshipping a horde of little gods and even beasts and ghosts while the eternal would have become a mere nameperhaps like ndengei and atahocan and unkulunkulu a jest the old testament is the story of the prolonged effort to keep jehovah in his supreme place to make and to succeed in that effort was the differentia of israel other peoples even the lowest had as we prove the germinal conception of a godassuredly not demonstrated to be derived from the ghost theory logically in no need of the ghost theory everywhere explicitly contrasted with the ghost theory but their foolish heart was darkened  it is impossible to prove historically which of the two main elements in beliefthe idea of an eternal being or beings or the idea of surviving ghostscame first into the minds of men the idea of primeval eternal beings as understood by savages does not depend on or require the ghost theory but as we almost always find ghosts and a supreme being together where we find either among the lowest savages we have no historical ground for asserting that either is prior to the other where we have no evidence to the belief in the maker we must not conclude that no such belief exists our knowledge is confused and scanty often it is derived from men who do not know the native language or the native sacred language or have not been trusted with what the savage treasures as his secret moreover if anywhere ghosts are found without gods it is an inference from the argument that an idea familiar to very low savage tribes like the australians and falling more and more into the background elsewhere though still extant and traceable might in certain cases be lost and forgotten altogether  to take an example of halfforgotten deity mr im thurn a good observer has written on the animism of the indians of british guiana mr im thurn justly says the man who above all others has made this study possible is mr tylor but it is not unfair to remark that mr im thurn naturally sees most distinctly that which mr tylor has taught him to seenamely animism he has also been persuaded by mr dorman that the great spirit of north american tribes is almost certainly nothing more than a figure of european origin reflected and transmitted almost beyond recognition on the mirror of the indian mind that is not my opinion i conceive that the red indians had their native eternal like the australians fijians andamanese dinkas yao and so forth as will be shown later  mr im thurn however dilates on the dream origin of the ghost theory giving examples from his own knowledge of the difficulty with which guiana indians discern the hallucinations of dreams from the facts of waking life their waking hallucinations are also so vivid as to be taken for realities25 mr im thurn adopts the hypothesis that from ghosts a belief has arisen but very gradually in higher spirits and eventually in a highest spirit and keeping pace with the growth of these beliefs a habit of reverence for and worship of spirits on this hypothesis the spirit latest evolved and most worshipful ought of course to be the highest spirit but the reverse as usual is the case the guiana indians believe in the continued but not in the everlasting existence of a mans ghost26 they believe in no spirits which were not once tenants of material bodies27  the belief in a supreme spirit is only attained in the highest form of religionandamanese for instanceas mr im thurn uses spirit where we should say being the indians of guiana know no god28  but it is true that various words have been found in all or nearly all the languages of guiana which have been supposed to be names of a supreme being god a great spirit in the sense which those phrases bear in the language of the higher religions  being interpreted these guiana names mean    the ancient one   the ancient one in skyland   our maker   our father   our great father  none of those in any way involves the attributes of a god  the ancient of days our father in skyland our maker do rather convoy the sense of god to a european mind mr im thurn however decides that the beings thus designated were supposed ancestors who came into guiana from some other country sometimes said to have been that entirely natural country  which is separated from guiana by the ocean of the air29  mr im thurn casually observed having said nothing about morals in alliance with animism  the fear of unwittingly offending the countless visible and invisible beings  kept the indians very strictly within their own rights and from offending against the rights of others  this remark dropped out at a discussion of mr im thurns paper and clearly demonstrated that even a very low creed makes for righteousness30  probably few who have followed the facts given here will agree with mr im thurns theory that our maker our father the ancient one of the heaven is merely an idealised human ancestor he falls naturally into his place with the other high gods of low savages but we need much more information on the subject than mr im thurn was able to give  his evidence is all the better because he is a loyal follower of mr tylor and mr tylor says savage animism is almost devoid of that ethical element which to the educated modern mind is the very mainspring of practical religion31 yet it keeps the indians very strictly within their own rights and from offending the rights of others our own religion is rarely so successful32  in the indians of guiana we have an alleged case of a people still deep in the animistic or ghostworshipping case who by the hypothesis have not yet evolved the idea of a god at all  when the familiar names for god such as maker father ancient of days occur in the indian language mr im thurn explains the neglected being who bears these titles as a remote deified ancestor of course when a being with similar titles occurs where ancestors are not worshipped as in australia and the andaman islands the explanation suggested by mr im thurn for the problem of religion in guiana will not fit the facts  it is plain that a priori another explanation is conceivable if a people like the andamanese or the australian tribes whom we have studied had such a conception as that of puluga or baiame or munganngaur and then later developed ancestorworship with its propitiatory sacrifices and ceremonies ancestorworship as the newest evolved and infinitely the most practical form of cult would gradually thrust the belief in a puluga or munganngaur or cagn into the shade the ancestral spirit to speak quite plainly can be squared by the people in whom he takes a special interest for family reasons the equal father of all men cannot be squared and declines till corrupted by the bad example of ancestral ghosts to make himself useful to one man rather than to another for these very intelligible simple and practical reasons if the belief in a munganngaur came first in evolution and the belief in a practicable bribable family ghost came second the ghostcult would inevitably crowd out the godcult33 the name of the father and maker would become a mere survival nominis umbra worship and sacrifice going to the ancestral ghost that explanation would fit the state of religion which mr im thurn has found rightly or wrongly in british guiana  but if the idea of a universal father and maker came last in evolution as a refinement then of course it ought to be the newest and therefore the most fashionable and potent of guianese cults precisely the reverse is said to be the case nor can the belief indicated in such names as father and maker be satisfactorily explained as a refinement of ancestorworship because we repeat it occurs where ancestors are not worshipped  these considerations however unpleasant to the devotees of animism or the ghost theory are not in themselves illogical nor contradictory of the theory of evolution which on the other hand fits them perfectly well that god thrives best who is most suited to his environment whether an easygoing hungry ghostgod with a liking for his family or a moral creator not to be bribed is better suited to an environment of not especially scrupulous savages any man can decide whether a set of not particularly scrupulous savages will readily evolve a moral unbribable creator when they have a serviceable family ghostgod eager to oblige is a question as easily resolved  beyond all doubt savages who find themselves under the watchful eye of a moral deity whom they cannot square will desert him as soon as they have evolved a practicable ghostgod useful for family purposes whom they can square no less manifestly savages who already possess a throng of serviceable ghostgods will not enthusiastically evolve a moral being who despises gifts and only cares for obedience there is a great deal of human nature in man and if mr im thurns description of the guianese be correct everything we know of human nature and of evolution assures us that the father or maker or ancient of days came first the ghostgods last what has here been said about the indians of guiana namely that they are now more ghost and spirit worshippers with only a name surviving to attest a knowledge of a father and maker in heaven applies equally well to the zulus the zulus are the great standing type of an animistic or ghostworshipping race without a god but had they a god on the australian pattern whom they have forgotten or have they not yet evolved a god out of animism  the evidence collected by dr callaway is honest but confused one native among others put forward the very theory here proposed by us as an alternative to that of mr im thurn unkulunkulu the idealised but despised first ancestor was not worshipped by men for it is not worship when people see things as rain or food or corn and say yes these things were made by unkulunkulu afterwards they men had power to change those things that they might become the amatongos might belong to the ancestral spirits they took them away from unkulunkulu34  animism supplanted theism nothing could be more explicit but though we have found an authentic zulu text to suit our provisional theory the most eminent philosophical example must not reduce us into supposing that this text settles the question dr callaway collected great masses of zulu answers to his inquiries and it is plain that a respondent like the native theologian whom we have cited may have adapted his reply to what he had learned of christian doctrine having now the christian notion of a divine creator and knowing too that the unworshipped unkulunkulu is said to have made things while only ancestral spirits are worshipped the native may have inferred that worship by christians given to the creator was at some time transferred by the zulus from unkulunkulu to the amatongo the truth is that both the anthropological theory spirits first gods last and our theory supreme being first spirits next can find warrant in dr callaways valuable collections for that reason the problem must be solved after a survey of the whole field of savage and barbaric religion it cannot be settled by the ambiguous case of the zulus alone  unkulunkulu is represented as the first man who broke off in the beginning they are ancestorworshippers says dr callaway and believe that their first ancestor the first man was the creator35 but they may like many other peoples have had a different original tradition and have altered it just because they are now such fervent ancestorworshippers unkulunkulu was prior to death which came among men in the usual mythical way36 whether unkulunkulu still exists is rather a moot question dr callaway thinks that he does not37 if not he is an exception to the rule in australia andaman among the bushmen the fuegians and savages in general who are less advanced in culture than the zulus the idea then of a maker of things who has ceased to exist occurs if at all not in a relatively primitive but in a relatively late religion on the analogy of pottery agriculture the use of iron villages hereditary kings and so on the notion of a dead maker is late not early it occurs where men have iron cattle agriculture kings houses a disciplined army not where men have none of these things the zulu godless ancestorworship then by parity of reasoning is like their material culture not an early but a late development the zulus hear of a king which is abovethe heavenly king38 we did not hear of him first from white men but he is not like unkulunkulu who we say made all things  here may be dimly descried the ideas of a god and a subordinate demiurge the king is above unkulunkulu is beneath the king above punishes sin striking the sinner by lightning nor do the zulus know how they have sinned there remained only that word about the heaven which says dr callaway implies that there might have been other words which are now lost there is great confusion of thought unkulunkulu made the heaven where the unknown king reigns a hard task for a first man39  in process of time we have come to worship the amadhlozi spirits only because we know not what to say about unkulunkulu40 it is on that account then that we seek out for ourselves the amadhlozi spirits that we may not always be thinking about unkulunkulu  all this attests a faint lingering shadow of a belief too ethereal too remote for a practical conquering race which prefers intelligible serviceable ghosts with a special regard for their own families  ukoto a very old zulu said when we were children it was said the lord is in heaven  they used to point to the lord on high we did not hear his name unkulunkulu was understood by this patriarch to refer to immediate ancestors whose mimes and genealogies he gave41 we heard it said that the creator of the world was the lord who is above people used always when i was growing up to point towards heaven  a very old woman was most reluctant to speak of unkulunkulu at last she said ah it is he in fact who is the creator who is in heaven of whom the ancients spoke then the old woman began to babble humorously of how the white men made all things again unkulunkulu is said to have been created by utilexo utilexo was invisible unkulunkulu was visible and so got credit not really his due42 when the heaven is said to be the chiefs the chief being a living zulu they do not believe what they say the phrase is a mere hyperbolical compliment43  on this examination of the evidence it certainly seems as logical to conjecture that the zulus had once such an idea of a supreme being as lower races entertain and then nearly lost it as to say that zulus though a monarchical race have not yet developed a kinggod out of the throng of spirits amatongo the zulus the norsemen of the south so to speak are a highly practical military race a deity at all abstract was not to their liking serviceable family spirits who continually provided an excuse for a dinner of roast beef were to their liking the less developed races do not kill their flocks commonly for food a sacrifice is needed as a pretext to the gods of andamanese bushmen australians no sacrifice is offered to the supreme being of most african peoples no sacrifice is offered there is no festivity in the worship of these supreme beings no feasting at all events they are not to be got at by gifts or sacrifices the amatongo are to be got at are bribable supply an excuse for a good dinner and thus the practical amatongo are honoured while in the present generation of zulus unkulunkulu is a joke and the lord in heaven is the shadow of a name clearly this does not point to the recent but to the remote development of the higher ideas now superseded by spiritworship  we shall next see how this view the opposite of the anthropological theory works when applied to other races especially to other african races  footnote 1 when i wrote myth ritual and religion ii 1113 i regarded cagn as only a successful and idealised medicine man but i now think that i confused in my mind the religious and the mythological aspects of cagn one of unknown origin existing before the sun a maker of all things prayed to but not in receipt of sacrifice is no medicine man except in his myth  footnote 2 the omissions in mr spencers system may possibly be explained by the circumstance that as he tells us he collected his facts by proxy while we find waitz much interested in and amazed by the benevolent supreme being of many african tribes that personage is only alluded to as alleged benevolent supreme being in mr spencers descriptive sociology and is usually left out of sight altogether in his principles of sociology and ecclesiastical institutions yet we have precisely the same kind of evidence of observers for this alleged benevolent supreme being as we have for the canaille of ghosts and fetishes if he is a deity of a rather lofty moral conception of course he need not be propitiated by human sacrifices or cold chickens that kind of material evidence to the faith in him must be absent by the nature of the case but the coincident testimony of travellers to belief in a supreme being cannot be dismissed as alleged  footnote 3 pp 676 677  footnote 4 man jai xii 70  footnote 5 man jai xii 9698

savages known to us entertain ideas of a supreme being such as we find among fuegians australians bushmen and andamanese are there examples besides the zulus of tribes higher in material culture who seem to have had such notions but to have partly forgotten or neglected them miss kingsley a lively observant and unprejudiced though rambling writer gives this very account of the bantu races oblivion or neglect will show itself in leaving the supreme being alone as he needs no propitiation while devoting sacrifice and ritual to fetishes and ghosts that this should be done is perfectly natural if the supreme being who wants no sacrifice were the first evolved in thought while venal fetishes and spirits came in as a result of the ghost theory but if as a result of the ghost theory the supreme being came last in evolution he ought to be the most fashionable object of worship the latest developed the most powerful and most to be propitiated he is the reverse  to take an example the dinkas of the upper nile godless says sir samuel baker pay a very theoretical kind of homage to the allpowerful being dwelling in heaven whence he sees all things he is called dendid great rain that is universal benediction he is omnipotent but being all beneficence can do no evil so not being feared he is not addressed in prayer the evil spirit on the other hand receives sacrifices the dinkas have a strange old chant    at the beginning when dendid made all things     he created the sun   and the sun is born and dies and comes again     he created the stars   and the stars are born and die and come again     he created man   and man is born and dies and returns no more  it is like the lament of moschus1  russegger compares the dinkas and all the neighbouring peoples who hold the same beliefs to modern deists2 they are remote from atheism and from cult suggestions about an ancient egyptian influence are made but popular egyptian religion was not monotheistic and priestly thought could scarcely influence the ancestors of the dinkas m lejean says these peoples are so practical and utilitarian that missionary religion takes no hold on them mr spencer does not give the ideas of the dinkas but it is not easy to see how the too beneficent dendid could be evolved out of ghostpropitiation the origin of all religions rather the dinkas a practical people seem to have simply forgotten to be grateful to their maker or have decided more to the credit of the clearness of their heads than the warmth of their hearts that gratitude he does not want like the french philosopher they cultivate lind√©pendance du coeur being in this matter strikingly unlike the pawnees  let us now take a case in which ancestorworship and no other form of religion beyond mere superstitions has been declared to be the practice of an african people mr spencer gives the example of natives of the southeastern district of central africa described by mr macdonald in africana3 the dead man becomes a ghostgod receives prayer and sacrifice is called a mulungu  great ancestor or  sky is preferred above older spirits now forgotten such old spirits may however have a mountain top for home a great chief being better remembered the mountain god is prayed to for rain higher gods were probably similar local gods in an older habitat of the yao4  such is in the main mr spencers r√©sum√© of mr duff macdonalds report he omits whatever mr macdonald says about a being among the yaos analogous to the dendid of the dinkas or the darumulun of australia or the huron ahone yet analysis detects in mr macdonalds report copious traces of such a being though mr macdonald himself believes in ancestorworship as the source of the local religion thus mulungu or mlungu used as a proper name is said to be the great spirit msimu of all men a spirit formed by adding all the departed spirits together5 this is a singular stretch of savage philosophy and indicates says mr macdonald a grasping after a being who is the totality of all individual existence if it fell from the lips of civilised men instead of savages it would be regarded as philosophy expressions of this kind among the natives are partly traditional and partly dictated by the big thoughts of the moment philosophy it is but a philosophy dependent on the ghost theory  i go on to show that the wayao have though mr spencer omits him a being who precisely answers to darumulun if stripped perhaps of his ethical aspect on this point we are left in uncertainty just because mr macdonald could not ascertain the secrets of his mysteries which in australia have been revealed to a few europeans  where mulungu is used as a proper name it certainly points to a personal being by the wayao sometimes said to be the same as mtanga at other times he is a being that possesses many powerful servants but is himself kept a good deal beyond the scene of earthly affairs like the gods of epicurus  this is of course precisely the feature in african theology which interests us the supreme being in spite of the potency which his supposed place as latest evolved out of the ghostworld should naturally give him is neglected either as half forgotten or for philosophical reasons for these reasons epicurus and lucretius make their gods otiosi unconcerned and the wayao with their universal collective spirit are no mean philosophers  this mulungu or mtanga in the world beyond the grave is represented as assigning to spirits their proper places whether for ethical reasons or not we are not informed6 santos 1586 says they acknowledge a god who both in this world and the next measures retribution for the good or evil done in this  in the native hypothesis about creation the people of mulungu play a very important part these ministers of his who do his pleasure are therefore as is mulungu himself regarded as prior to the existing world therefore they cannot in wayao opinion be ghosts of the dead at all nor can we properly call them spirits they are beings original creative but undefined the word mulungu however is now applied to spirits of individuals but whether it means sky salt or whether it means ancestor bleek it cannot be made to prove that mulungu himself was originally envisaged as spirit for manifestly suppose that the idea of powerful beings undefined came first in evolution and was followed by the ghost idea that idea might then be applied to explaining the preexistent creative powers  mtanga is by some localised as the god of mangochi an olympus left behind by the yao in their wanderings here some hold his voice is still audible others say that mtanga never was a man  he was concerned in the first introduction of men into the world he gets credit for  making mountains and rivers he is intimately associated with a year of plenty he is called mchimwene juene a very chief he has a kind of evil opposite chitowe but this being the satan of the creed is a child or subject of mtanga an evil angel in fact7  the thunder god mpambe in yao njasi lightning is also a minister of the supreme being he is sent by mtanga with rain europeans are cleverer than natives because we stayed longer with the people of god mulungu  i do not gather that though associated with good crops mtanga or mulungu receives any sacrifice or propitiation the chief addresses his own god8 the chief will not trouble himself about his greatgreatgrandfather he will present his offering to his own immediate predecessor saying o father i do not know all your relatives you know them all invite them to feast with you9  all the offerings are supposed to point to some want of the spirit mtanga on the other hand is nihil indiga nostri  a village god is given beer to drink as indra got soma a dead chief is propitiated by human sacrifices i find no trace of any gift to mtanga his mysteries are really unknown to mr macdonald they were laughed at by a travelled and emancipated yao10  these rites are supposed to be inviolably concealed by the initiated who often say that they would die if they revealed them11  how can we pretend to understand a religion if we do not know its secret that secret in australia yields the certainty of the ethical character of the supreme being mr macdonald says about the initiator a grotesque figure  he delivers lectures and is said to give much good advice  the lectures condemn selfishness and a selfish person is called mwisichana that is uninitiated  there could not be better evidence of the presence of the ethical element in the religious mysteries among the yao as among the australian kurnai the central secret lesson of religion is the lesson of unselfishness  it is not stated that mtanga instituted or presides over the mysteries judging from the analogy of eleusis the bora the red indian initiations and so on we may expect this to be the belief but mr macdonald knows very little about the matter  the legendary tales say all things in this world were made by god at first there were not people but god and beasts god here is mlungu the other statement is apparently derived from existing ancestorworship people who died became god mlungu but god is prior to death for the yao have a form of the usual myth of the origin of death also of sleep death and sleep are one word they are of one family god dwells on high while a malevolent great one who disturbed the mysteries and slew the initiated was turned into a mountain12  in spite of information confessedly defective i have extracted from mr spencers chosen authority a mass of facts pointing to a yao belief in a primal being maker of mountains and rivers existent before men were not liable to deathwhich came late among thembeneficent not propitiated by sacrifice as far as the evidence goes moral if we may judge by the analogy of the mysteries and yet occupying the religious background while the foreground is held by the most recent ghosts to prove mr spencers theory he ought to have given a full account of this being and to have shown how he was developed out of ghosts which are forgotten in inverse ratio to their distance from the actual generation i conceive that mr spencer would find a midpoint between a common ghost and mtanga in a ghost of a chief attached to a mountain the place and placename preserving the ghosts name and memory but it is i think a far cry from such a chiefs ghost to the prehuman angelserved mtanga  of ancestor worship and ghost worship we have abundant evidence but the position of mtanga raises one of these delicate and crucial questions which cannot be solved by ignoring their existence is mtanga evolved out of an ancestral ghost if so why as greatest of divine beings very chief and having powerful ministers under him is he left unpropitiated unless it be by moral discourses at the mysteries as a much more advanced idea than that of a real fathers ghost he ought to be much later in evolution fresher in conception and more adored how do we explain his lack of adoration was he originally envisaged as a ghost at all and if so by what curious but uniform freak of savage logic is he regarded as prior to men and though a ghost prior to death is it not certain that such a being could be conceived of by men who had never dreamed of ghosts is there any logical reason why mtanga should not be regarded as originally on the same footing as munganngaur but now half forgotten and neglected for practical or philosophical reasons  on these problems light is thrown by a successor of mr spencers authority mr duff macdonald in the blantyre mission this gentleman the rev david clement scott has published a cyclopaedic dictionary of the manganja language in british central africa13 looking at ancestral spirits first we find mzimu spirits of the departed supposed to come in dreams though abiding in the spirit world they also haunt thickets they inspire mlauli prophets and make them rave and utter predictions offerings are made to them here is a prayer watch over me my ancestor who died long ago tell the great spirit at the head of my race from whom my mother came there are little huttemples and the chief directs the sacrifices of food or of animals there are religious pilgrimages with sacrifice to mountains god like men in this region has various names as chiuta god in space and the rainbow sign across mpambe god almighty or rather preexcellent mlezi god the sustainer and mulungu god who is spirit mulungu  god not spirits or fetish you cant put the plural as god is one say the natives there are no idols called gods and spirits are spirits of people who have died not gods idols are zitunzizitunzi spirits are supposed to be with mulungu god made the world and man our author says when the chief or people sacrifice it is to god but he also says that they sacrifice to ancestral spirits there is some confusion of ideas here mr macdonald says nothing of sacrifice to mtanga  mr scott does not seem to know more about the mysteries than mr macdonald and his article on mulungu does not much enlighten us does mulungu as creative god receive sacrifice or not14 mr scott gives no instance of this under nsembe sacrifice where ancestors or hilldwelling ghosts of chiefs are offered food yet as we have seen under mulungu he avers that the chiefs and people do sacrifice to god he appears to be confusing the creator with spirits and no reliance can be placed on this part of his evidence at the back of all this sacrifice to spirits there is god if i understand mr scott sacrifices are really made only to spirits but he is trying to argue that after all the theistic conception is at the back of the animistic practice thus importing his theory into his facts his theory would really be in a better way if sacrifice is not offered to the creator but this had not occurred to mr scott  it is plain in any case that the religion of the africans in the blantyre region has an element not easily to be derived from ancestral spiritworship an element not observed by mr spencer  nobody who has followed the examples already adduced will be amazed by what waitz calls the surprising result of recent inquiries among the great negro race among the branches where foreign influence is least to be suspected we discover behind their more conspicuous fetishisms and superstitions something which we cannot exactly call monotheism yet which tends in that direction15 waitz quotes wilson for the fact that their fetishism apart they adore a supreme being as the creator and do not honour him with sacrifice  the remarks of waitz may be cited in full  the religion of the negro may be considered by some as a particularly rude form of polytheism and may be branded with the special name of fetishism it would follow from a minute examination of it thatapart from the extravagant and fantastic traits which are rooted in the character of the negro and which radiate therefrom over all his creationsin comparison with the religions of other savages it is neither very specially differentiated nor very specially crude in form  but this opinion can be held to be quite true only while we look at the outside of the negros religion or estimate its significance from arbitrary presuppositions as is specially the case with ad wuttke  by a deeper insight which of late several scientific investigators have succeeded in attaining we reach rather the surprising conclusion that several of the negro raceson whom we cannot as yet prove and can hardly conjecture the influence of a more civilised peoplein the embodying of their religious conceptions are further advanced than almost all other savages so far that even if we do not call them monotheists we may still think of them as standing on the boundary of monotheism seeing that their religion is also mixed with a great mass of rude superstition which in turn among other peoples seems to overrun completely the purer religious conceptions  this conclusion as to an element of pure faith in negro religion would not have surprised waitz had recent evidence as to the same creed among lower savages lain before him as he worked  this volume of his book was composed in 1860 in 1872 he had become well aware of the belief in a good maker among the australian natives and of the absence among them of ancestor worship16  waitzs remarks on the supreme being of the negro are well worth noting from his unconcealed astonishment at the discovery  wilsons observations on north and south guinea religion were published in 1856 after commenting on the delicate task of finding out what a savage religion really is he writes the belief in one great supreme being who made and upholds all things is universal17 the names of the being are translated maker preserver benefactor great friend though compact of all good qualities the being has allowed the world to come under the control of evil spirits who alone receive religious worship though he leaves things uncontrolled yet the chief being as in homer ratifies the oath at a treaty and is invoked to punish criminals when ordeal water is to be drunk so far then he has an ethical influence grossly wicked people are buried outside of the regular place fetishism prevails with spiritualism and wilson thinks that mediums might pick up some good tricks in guinea he gives no examples their inspired men do things that cannot be accounted for by the use of narcotics  the south guinea creator anyambia  good spirit is good but capricious he has a good deputy ombwiri spelled mbuiri by miss kingsley he alone has no priests but communicates directly with men the neighbouring shekuni have mysteries of the great spirit no details are given this great being mwetyi witnesses covenants and punishes perjury this people are ancestorworshippers but their supreme being is not said to receive sacrifice as ghosts do while he is so far from being powerless like unkulunkulu that but for fear of his wrath their national treaties would have little or no force18 having no information about the mysteries of course we know nothing of other moral influences which are or may be exercised by these great powerful and not wholly otiose beings  the celebrated traveller mungo park who visited africa in 1805 had good opportunities of understanding the natives he did not hurry through the land with a large armed force but alone or almost alone paid his way with his brass buttons i have conversed with all ranks and conditions upon the subject of their faith he says and can pronounce without the smallest shadow of doubt that the belief in one god and in a future state of reward and punishment is entire and universal among them this cannot strictly be called monotheism as there are many subordinate spirits who may be influenced by magical ceremonies but if monotheism means belief in one spirit alone or religious regard paid to one spirit alone it exists nowhereno not in islam  park thinks it remarkable that the almighty only receives prayers at the new moon of sacrifice to the almighty he says nothing and that being the creator and preserver of all things he is of so exalted a nature that it is idle to imagine the feeble supplications of wretched mortals can reverse the decrees and change the purpose of unerring wisdom the new moon prayers are mere matters of tradition our fathers did it before us such is the blindness of unassisted nature says park who is not satirising in swifts manner the prayers of presbyterians at home on yarrow  thus the african supreme being is unpropitiated while inferior spirits are constrained by magic or propitiated with food  we meet our old problem how has this god in the conception of whom there is so much philosophy developed out of these hungry ghosts the influence of islam can scarcely be suspected allah being addressed of course in endless prayers while the african god receives none indeed it would be more plausible to say that mahomet borrowed allah from the widespread belief which we are studying than that the negros supreme being was borrowed from allah  park had as we saw many opportunities of familiar discussion with the people on whose mercies he threw himself  but it is not often that the negroes make their religious opinions the subject of conversation when interrogated in particular concerning their ideas of a future state they express themselves with great reverence but endeavour to shorten the discussion by saying mo o mo inta allo no man knows anything about it19  park himself in extreme distress and almost in despair chanced to observe the delicate beauty of a small mossplant and reflecting that the creator of so frail a thing could not be indifferent to any of his creatures plucked up courage and reached safety20 he was not of the negro philosophy and is the less likely to have invented it the new moon prayer said in a whisper was reported to park by many different people to contain thanks to god for his kindness during the existence of the past moon and to solicit a continuation of his favour during the new one this of course may prove islamite influence and is at variance with the general tendency of the religious philosophy as described  we now arrive at a theory of the supreme being among a certain african race which would be entirely fatal to my whole hypothesis on this topic if it could be demonstrated correct in fact and if it could be stretched so as to apply to the australians fuegians andamanese and other very backward peoples it is the hypothesis that the supreme being is a loangod borrowed from europeans  the theory is very lucidly set forth in major elliss tshispeaking peoples of the gold coast21 major elliss opinion coincides with that of waitz in his introduction to anthropology an opinion to which waitz does not seem bigotednamely that the original form of all religion is a raw unsystematic polytheism nature being peopled by inimical powers or spirits and everyone worshipping what he thinks most dangerous or most serviceable there are few general many local or personal objects of veneration22 major ellis only met this passage when he had formed his own ideas by observation of the tshi race we do not pretend to guess what the original form of all religion may have been but we have given and shall give abundant evidence for the existence of a loftier faith than this among peoples much lower in material culture than the tshi races who have metals and an organised priesthood they occupy in small villages except coomassie and djuabin the forests of the gold coast the mere mention of coomassie shows how vastly superior in civilisation the tshis ashantis and fantis are to the naked houseless australians their inland communities however are mere specks in a vast tract of impenetrable forest the coast people have for centuries been in touch with europeans but the tshispeaking races are now much in the same condition both socially and morally as they were at the time of the portuguese discovery23  nevertheless major ellis explains their supreme being as the result of european influence a priori this appears highly improbable that a belief should sweep over all these specks in impenetrable forest from the coasttribes in contact with europeans and that this belief should though the most recent be infinitely the least powerful cannot be regarded as a plausible hypothesis moreover on major elliss theory the supreme beings of races which but recently came for the first time in contact with europeans supreme beings kept jealously apart from european ken and revered in the secrecy of ancient mysteries must also by parity of reason be the result of european influence unfortunately major ellis gives no evidence for his statements about the past history of tshi religion authorities he must have and references would be welcome  with people in the condition in which the natives of the gold coast now are religion is not in any way allied with moral ideas24 we have given abundant evidence that among much more backward tribes morals rest on a religious sanction if this be not so on the gold coast we cannot accept these relatively advanced fantis and ashantis as representing the original state of ethics and religion any more than those people with cities a king a priesthood iron and gold represent the original material condition of society major ellis also shows that the gods exact chastity from aspirants to the priesthood25 the present beliefs of the gold coast are kept up by organised priesthoods as lucrative business26 where there is no lucre and no priesthood as among more backward races this kind of business cannot be done on the gold coast men can only approach gods through priests27 this is degeneration  obviously if religion began in a form relatively pure and moral it must degenerate as civilisation advances under priests who exploit the lucrative and can see no money in the pure elements of belief and practice that the lucrative elements in christianity were exploited by the clergy to the neglect of ethics was precisely the complaint of the reformers from these lucrative elements the creed of the apostles was free and a similar freedom marks the religion of australia or of the pawnees we cannot possibly then expect to find the original state of religion among a people subdued to a moneygrubbing priesthood like the tshi races let religion begin as pure as snow it would be corrupted by priestly trafficking in its lucrative animistic aspect and priests are developed relatively late  major ellis discriminates tshi gods as    1 general worshipped by an entire tribe or more tribes   2 local deities of river hill forest or sea   3 deities of families or corporations   4 tutelary deities of individuals  the second class according to the natives were appointed by the first class who are too distant or indifferent to interfere ordinarily in human affairs thus the huron god ahone punishes nobody he is all sweetness and light but has a deputy god called okeus on our hypothesis this indifference of high gods suggests the crowding out of the great disinterested god by venal animistic competition all of class ii appear to have been originally malignant though in native belief class i was prior to and appointed class ii major ellis thinks that malignant spirits of class ii were raised to class i as if to the peerage while classes iii and iv are clearly the product of priesthoodtherefore late  major ellis then avers that when europeans reached the gold coast in the fifteenth century they appear to have found a northern god tando and a southern god bobowissi still adored bobowissi makes thunder and rain lives on a hill and receives or received human sacrifices but after an intercourse of some years with europeans the villagers near european forts added to their system a new deity whom they termed nana nyankupon this was the god of the christians borrowed from them and adapted under a new designation meaning lord of the sky this is conjectural nyankum  rain nyansa has a later meaning craft28  now major ellis later has to contrast bosmans account of fetishism 1700 with his own observations according to bosmans native source of information men then selected their own fetishes these are now selected by priests bosmans authority was wrongor priesthood has extended its field of business major ellis argues that the revolution from amateur to priestly selection of fetishes could not occur in 190 years over a vast tract of country amongst peoples living in semiisolated communities in the midst of pathless forests where there is but little opportunity for the exchange of ideas and where we know they have been uninfluenced by any higher race  yet major elliss theory is that this isolated people were influenced by a higher race to the extent of adopting a totally new supreme being from europeans a being whom they in no way sought to propitiate and who was of no practical use and this they did he says not under priestly influence but in the face of priestly opposition29  major elliss logic does not appear to be consistent in any case we ask for evidence how in the impenetrable forests did a new supreme deity become universally known are we certain that travellers unquoted did not discover a deity with no priests or ritual or money in the concern later than they discovered the bloodstained conspicuous lucrative bobowissi why was nyankupon the supposed new god of a new powerful set of strangers left wholly unpropitiated the reverse was to be expected  major ellis writes almost certainly the addition of one more to an already numerous family of gods was strenuously resisted by the priesthood who confessedly are adding now lower gods every day yet nyankupon is universally known in spite of priestly resistance nyankupon i presume  anzambi anyambi nyambi nzambi anzam nyam the nzam of the fans and of all bantu coast races the creator of man plants animals and the earth he takes no further interest in the affair30 the crowd of spirits take only too much interest and therefore are the lucrative element in religion  it is not very easy to believe that nyam under all his names was picked up from the portuguese and passed apparently from negroes to bantu all over west africa despite the isolation of the groups and the resistance of the priesthood among tribes uninfluenced by any higher race  nyam like major elliss class i appoints a subordinate god to do his work he is truly good and governs the malevolent spirits31  the spread of nyankupon as described by major ellis is the more remarkable since five or six miles from the sea or even less the country was a terra incognita to europeans32 nyankupon was it is alleged adopted because our superiority proved europeans to be protected by a deity of greater power than any of those to which they themselves the tshi races offered sacrifices  then of course nyankupon would receive the best sacrifices of all as the most powerful deity far from that nyankupon received no sacrifice and had no priests no priest would have a traditional way of serving him as the unlucky man in voltaire says to his guardian angel it is well worth while to have a presiding genius so the tshis and bantu might ironically remark a useful thing a new supreme being a quarter of a continent or so adopts a new foreign god and leaves him plant√© l√† unserved unhonoured and unsung he therefore came to be thought too remote or too indifferent to interfere directly in the affairs of the world this idea was probably caused by the fact that the natives had not experienced any material improvement in their condition  although they also had become followers of the god of the whites33  but that was just what they had not done even at magellans straits the fuegians picked up from a casual spanish seacaptain and adored an image of cristo name and effigy they accepted the tshi people took neither effigy nor name of a deity from the portuguese settled among them they neither imitated catholic rites nor adapted their own they prayed not nor sacrificed to the new nyankupon only his name and the idea of his nature are universally diffused in west african belief he lives in no definite home or hill but in nyankupons country nyankupon at the present day is ignored rather than worshipped while bobowissi has priests and offerings  it is clear that major ellis is endeavouring to explain by a singular solution namely the borrowing of a god from europeans and that a solution improbable and inadequate a phenomenon of very wide distribution nyankupon cannot be explained apart from taaroa puluga ahone ndengei dendid and taliytochoo gods to be later described who cannot by any stretch of probabilities be regarded as of european origin all of these represent the primeval supreme being more or less or altogether stripped under advancing conditions of culture of his ethical influence and crowded out by the horde of useful greedy ghosts or ghost gods whose business is lucrative nyankupon has no pretensions to be or to have been a spirit34  major elliss theory is a natural result of his belief in a tangle of polytheism as the original state of religion if so there was not much room for the natural development of nyankupon in whom the missionaries find a parallel to the jahveh of the jews35 on our theory nyankupon takes his place in the regular process of the corruption of theism by animism  the parallel case of nzambi mpungu the creator among the fiorts a bantu stock is thus stated by miss kingsley  i have no hesitation in saying i fully believe nzambi mpungu to be a purely native god and that he is a great god over all things but the study of him is even more difficult than the study of nzambi because the jesuit missionaries who gained so great an influence over the fiorts in the sixteenth century identified him with jehovah and worked on the native mind from that standpoint consequently semimythical traces of jesuit teaching linger even now in the religious ideas of the fiorts36  nzambi mpungu lives behind the firmament he takes next to no interest in human affairs which is not a jesuit idea of god  in all missionary accounts of savage religion we have to guard against two kinds of bias one is the bias which makes the observer deny any religion to the native race except devilworship the other is the bias which lends him to look for traces of a pure primitive religious tradition yet we cannot but observe this reciprocal phenomenon missionaries often find a native name and idea which answer so nearly to their conception of god that they adopt the idea and the name in teaching again on the other side the savages when first they hear the missionaries account of god recognise it as do the hurons and bakwain for what has always been familiar to them this is recorded in very early premissionary travels as in the book of william strachey on virginia 1612 to which we now turn the god found by strachey in virginia cannot by any latitude of conjecture be regarded as the result of contact with europeans yet he almost exactly answers to the african nyankupon who is explained away as a loangod for the belief in relatively pure creative beings whether they are morally adored without sacrifice or merely neglected is so widely diffused that anthropology must ignore them or account for them as loangodsor give up her theory  footnote 1 lejean rev des deux mondes april 1862 p 760 citing for the chant beltrame dictionario della lingua denka ms  footnote 2 waitz ii 74  footnote 3 1882

been examining we shall range from hurons to pawnees and blackfeet and end with pachacamac the supreme being of the old inca civilisation with tui laga and taaroa it will be seen that the hurons have been accidentally deprived of their benevolent creator by a bibliographical accident while that creator corresponds very well with the peruvian pachucamac often regarded as a mere philosophical abstraction the pawnees will show us a creator involved in a sacrificial ritual which is not common while the blackfeet present a creator who is not envisaged as a spirit at all and on our theory represents a very early stage of the theistic conception  to continue the argument from analogy against major elliss theory of the european origin of nyankupon it seems desirable first to produce a parallel to his case and to that of his bloodstained subordinate deity bobowissi from a quarter where european influence is absolutely out of the question virginia was first permanently colonised by englishmen in 1607 and the historie of travaile into virginia by william strachey gent first secretary of the colony dates from the earliest years 16121616 it will hardly be suggested then that the natives had already adopted our supreme being especially as strachey says that the native priests strenuously opposed the christian god strachey found a houseinhabiting agricultural and settled population under chiefs one of whom powhattan was a kind of bretwalda the temples contained the dried bodies of the weroances or aristocracy beside which was their okeus or oki an image ill favouredly carved all black dressed who doth them all the harm they suffer he is propitiated by sacrifices of their own children probably an error and of strangers  mr tylor quotes a description of this oki or okeus with his idol and bloody rites from smiths history of virginia 16321 the two books stracheys and smiths are here slightly varying copies of one original but after censuring smiths and stracheys hasty theory that okeus is no other than a devil mr tylor did not find in smith what follows in strachey okeus has human sacrifices like bobowissi whilst the great god the priests tell them who governes all the world and makes the son to shine creatyng the moone and starrs his companyons  they calling sic ahone the good and peaceable god requires no such dutyes nor needs to be sacrificed unto for he intendeth all good unto them okeus on the contrary looking into all mens accions and examining the same according to the severe scheme of justice punisheth them such is the misery and thraldome under which sathan hath bound these wretched miscreants  as if in mr stracheys own creed satan does not punish in hell the offences of men against god  here then in addition to a devil or rather a divine police magistrate and general fetishism and nature worship we find that the untutored virginian is equipped with a merciful creator without idol temple or sacrifice as needing nought of ours it is by the merest accident the use of smiths book 1632 instead of stracheys book 1612 that mr tylor is unaware of these essential facts2  dr brinton like mr tylor cites smith for the nefarious or severe okeus and omits any mention of ahone the benevolent creator3 now stracheys evidence is early 1612 is that of a welleducated man fond of airing his greek and not prejudiced in favour of these worshippers of sathan in virginia he found the unpropitiated loving supreme being beside a subordinate like nyankupon beside bobowissi in africa  each highest deity in virginia or on the gold coast is more or less eclipsed in popular esteem by nascent polytheism and nature worship this is precisely what we should expect to find if ahone the creator were earlier in evolution while okeus and the rest were of the usual greedy class of animistic corruptible deities useful to priests this could not be understood while ahone was left out of the statement4  probably mr stracheys narrative justifies by analogy our suspicion of major elliss theory that the african supreme being is of european origin the purpose in the ahoneokeus creed is clear god ahone is omnipotent and good yet calamities beset mankind how are these to be explained clearly as penalties for mens sins inflicted not by ahone but by his lieutenant okeus but that magistrate can be and is appeased by sacrifices which it would be impious or at all events useless to offer to the supreme being ahone it is a logical creed but how was the supreme being evolved out of the ghost of a peopledevouring king like powhattan the facts very fairly attested do not fit the anthropological theory it is to be remarked that stracheys ahone is a much less mythological conception than that which on very good evidence he attributes to the indians of the patowemeck river their creator is spoken of as a godly hare who receives their souls into paradise whence they are reborn on earth again as in platos myth they also regard the four winds as four gods how the god took the mythological form of a hare is diversely explained5  meanwhile the ahoneokeus creed corresponds to the nyankuponbobowissi creed the american faith is certainly not borrowed from europe so it is less likely that the african creed is borrowed  as illustrations of the general theory here presented we may now take two tribal religions among the north american indians the first is that of the equestrian pawnees who thirty years ago were dwelling on the loup fork in nebraska the buffaloes have since been destroyed the lands seized and the pawnees driven into a reservation where they are or lately were cheated and oppressed in the usual way they were originally known to europeans in four hordes the fourth being the skidi or wolf pawnees they seem to have come into kansas and nebraska at a date relatively remote from mexico and are allied with the lipans and tonkaways of that region the tonkaways are a tribe who in a sacred mystery are admonished to live like the wolves in exactly the same way as were the hirpi wolf tribe of mount soracte who practised the feat of walking unhurt through fire6 the tonkaways regard the pawnees who also have a wolf tribe as a longseparated branch of their race if then they are of mexican origin we might expect to find traces of aztec ritual among the pawnees  long after they obtained better weapons they used flintheaded arrows for slaying the only two beasts which it was lawful to sacrifice the deer and the buffalo they have long been a hunting and also an agricultural people the corn was given to them originally by the ruler their god tiraw√° the spirit father they offer the sacrifice of a deer with peculiar solemnity and are a very prayerful people the priest held a relation to the pawnees and their deity not unlike that occupied by moses to jehovah and the israelites a feature in ritual is the sacred bundles of unknown contents brought from the original home in mexico the pawnees were created by tiraw√° they believe in a happy future life while the wicked die and there is an end of them they cite their dreams of the dead as an argument for a life beyond the tomb we see ourselves living with tiraw√° an evil earlier race which knew not tiraw√° was destroyed by him in the deluge evidence is found in large fossil bones and it would be an interesting inquiry whether such fossils are always found where the story of a sinflood occurs if so fossils must be universally diffused  as is common the future life is attested not only by dreams but in the experience of men who have died and come back to life like secret pipe chief who told the story to mr grinnell these visions in a state of apparent death are not peculiar to savages and no doubt have had much effect on beliefs about the next world7 ghosts are rarely seen but auditory hallucinations as of a voice giving good advice in time of peril are regarded as the speech of ghosts the beasts are also friendly as fellow children with men of tiraw√° to the morning star the skidi or wolf pawnees offered on rare occasions a captive man the ceremony was not unlike that of the aztecs though less cruel curiously enough the slayer of the captive had instantly to make a mock flight as in the attic bouphonia this however was a rite paid to the morning star not to tiraw√° the power above that moves the universe and controls all things sacrifice to tiraw√° was made on rare and solemn occasions out of his two chief gifts deer and buffalo through corn deer buffalo and the sacred bundles we worship tiraw√°  the flesh was burned in the fire while prayers were made with great earnestness in the old skidi rite the women told the fattened captive what they desired to gain from the ruler it is occasionally said that the human sacrifice was made to tiraw√° himself the sacrificer not only fled but fasted and mourned it is possible that as among the aztecs the victim was regarded as also an embodiment of the god but this is not certain the rite having long been disused mr grinnell got the description from a very old skidi there was also a festival of thanks to tiraw√° for corn during a sacred dance and hymn the corn is held up to the ruler by a woman corn is ritually called the mother as in peru8 we are like seed and we worship through the corn  disease is caused by evil spirits and many american soldiers were healed by pawnee doctors though their hurts had refused to yield to the treatment of the united states army surgeons9  the miracles wrought by pawnee medicine men under the eyes of major north far surpass what is told of indian jugglery but this was forty years ago and it is probably too late to learn anything of these astounding performances of naked men on the hard floor of a lodge major north told me mr grinnell that he saw with his own eyes the doctors make the corn grow the doctor not manipulating the plant as in the mango trick but standing apart and singing mr grinnell says i have never found any one who could even suggest an explanation  this art places great power in the hands of the doctors who exhibit many other prodigies it is notable that in this religion we hear nothing of ancestorworship all that is stated as to ghosts has been reported we find the cult of an allpowerful being in whose ritual sacrifice is the only feature that suggests ghostworship the popular tales and historical reminiscences of the last generation entirely bear out by their allusions mr grinnells account of the pawnee faith in which the ethical element chiefly consists in a sense of dependence on and touching gratitude to tiraw√° as shown in fervent prayer theft he abhors he applauds valour he punishes the wicked by annihilation the good dwell with him in his heavenly home he is addressed as atius takawa our father in all places  it is not so easy to see how this being was developed out of ancestorworship of which we find no traces among pawnees for ancestorworship among the sioux it is usual to quote a remark of one prescott an interpreter sometimes an indian will say wah negh on she wan da which means spirits of the dead have mercy on me then they will add what they want that is about the amount of an indians prayer10 obviously when we compare mr grinnells account of pawnee religion based on his own observations and those of major north and mr dunbar who has written on the language of the tribe we are on much safer ground than when we follow a contemptuous halfeducated european  the religion of the blackfoot indians appears to be a ruder form of the pawnee faith whether the differences arise from tribal character or from decadence or because the blackfoot belief is in an earlier and more backward condition than that of the pawnees it is not easy to be certain as in china there exists a difficulty in deciding whether the supreme being is identical with the great naturegod in china the heaven among the blackfeet the sun or is prior to him in conception or has been later substituted for him or placed beside him the blackfoot mythology is low crude and except in tales of creation is derisive as in australia there is a specific difference of tone between mythology and religion  the blackfoot country runs east from the summit of the rocky mountains to the mouth of the yellowstone river on the missouri then west to the yellowstone sources across the rocky mountains to the beaverhead thence to their summit  as to spirits the blackfeet believe in or at least tell stories of ghosts which conduct themselves much as in our oldfashioned ghost stories they haunt people in a rather sportive and irresponsible way the souls or shadows of respectable persons go to the bleak country called the sand hills where they live in a dull monotonous kind of sheol the shades of the wicked are earthbound and mischievous especially ghosts of men slain in battle they cause paralysis and madness but dread interiors of lodges they only tap on the lodgeskins like many indian tribes the blackfeet have the eurydice legend a man grieving for his dead wife finds his way to hades is pitied by the dead and allowed to carry the woman back with him under certain ritual prohibitions one of which he unhappily infringes the range of this deeply touching story among the red men and its close resemblance to the tale of orpheus is one of the most curious facts in mythology mr grinnells friend young bear when lost with his wife in a fog heard a voice it is well go on you are going right the top of my head seemed to lift up it seemed as if a lot of needles were running into it this must have been a ghost as the wife also heard the voice it was probably human not hallucinatory  animals receive the usual amount of friendly respect from the blackfeet they have also an inchoate polytheism above persons ground persons and under water persons of the first thunder is most important and is worshipped there is the cold maker a white figure on a white horse the wind and so on  the creator is n√†pi old man dr brinton thinks he is a personification of light but mr grinnell reckons it absurd to attribute so abstract a conception to the blackfeet n√†pi is simply a primal being an immortal man11 who was before death came into the world concerning which one of the usual tales of the origin of death is told all things that he had made understood him when he spoke to thembirds animals and people as in the first chapters of genesis with n√†pi creation worked on the lines of adaptation to environment he put the bighorn on the prairie there it was awkward so he set it on rocky places where it skipped about with ease the antelope fell on the rocks so he removed it to the level prairie n√†pi created man and woman out of clay but the folly of the woman introduced death n√†pi as a prometheus gave fire and taught the forest arts he inculcated the duty of prayer his will should be done by emissaries in the shape of animals then he went to other peoples the misfortunes of the indians arise from disobedience to his laws  chiefs were elective for conduct courage and charity  though weapons and utensils were buried with the dead or exposed on platforms and though great men were left to sleep in their lodges henceforth never to be entered by the living there is no trace known to me of continued ancestorworship as many blackfeet change their names yearly ancestral names are not likely to become those of gods  the sun is by many believed to have taken the previous place of n√†pi in religion or perhaps n√†pi is the sun however he is still separately addressed in prayer the sun receives presents of furs and so forth a finger when the prayer is for life has been offered to him fetishism probably shows itself in gifts to a great rock there is daily prayer both to the sun and to n√†pi women institute medicine lodges praying pity me sun you have seen my life you know that i am pure we look on the medicine lodge woman as you white people do on the roman catholic sisters being virtuous in deed serious and cleanminded the medical lodge woman is in spiritual rapport with n√†pi and the sun to this extent at least blackfoot religion is an ethical influence  the creed seems to be a nascent polytheism subordinate to n√†pi as supreme maker and to the personified sun as blackfoot ghosts are vaporous ineffectual for good there seems to be nothing like ancestor worship  these two cults and beliefs pawnee and blackfoot may be regarded as fairly well authenticated examples of unchristianised american religion among races on the borderland of agriculture and the chase it would be difficult to maintain that ghostworship or ancestorworship is a potent factor in the evolution of the deathless tiraw√° or the immortal creator n√†pi who has nothing of the spirit about him especially as ghosts are not worshipped12  let us now look at the supreme being of a civilised american people there are few more interesting accounts of religion than garcilasso de la vegas description of faith in peru garcilasso was of inca parentage on the spindle side he was born in 1540 and his book taken from the traditions of an uncle and aided by the fragmentary collections of father blas valera was published in 1609 in garcilassos theory the original people of peru totemists and worshippers of hills and streams earth and sea were converted to sun worship by the first inca a child of the sun even the new religion included ancestorworship and other superstitions but behind sun worship was the faith in a being who advanced the sun so far above all the stars of heaven13 this being was pachacamac the sustainer of the world the question then arises is pachacamac a form of the same creative being whom we find among the lowest savages or is he the result of philosophical reflection the latter was the opinion of garcilasso the incas and their amautas learned class were philosophers14  pacha he says  universe and cama  soul pachacamac then is anima mundi they did not even take the name of pachacamac into their mouths or but seldom and reverently as the australians will not in religious matters mention darumulun pachacamac had no temple but they worshipped him in their hearts that he was the creator appears in an earlier writer cited by garcilasso agustin de zarate ii ch 5 garcilasso after denying the existence of temples to pachacamac mentions one but only one he insists at length and with much logic that he whom as a christian he worships is in quichua styled pachacamac moreover the one temple to pachacamac was not built by an inca but by a race which having heard of the inca god borrowed his name without understanding his nature that of a being who dwells not in temples made with hands ii 186 in the temple this people the yuncas offered even human sacrifices by the incas to pachacamac no sacrifice was offered ii 189 this negative custom they also imposed upon the yuncas and they removed idols from the yunca temple of pachacamac ii 190 yunca superstitions however infested the temple and a voice gave oracles therein15 the yuncas also had a talking idol which the inca in accordance with a religious treaty occasionally consulted  while pachacamac without temple or rite was reckoned the creator we must understand that sunworship and ancestorworship were the practical elements of the inca cult this appears to have been distasteful to the inca huayna ccapac for at a sun feast he gazed hard on the sun was remonstrated with by a priest and replied that the restless sun must have another lord more powerful than himself16  this remark could not have been necessary if pachacamac were really an article of living and universal belief perhaps we are to understand that this inca like his father who seems to have been the original author of the saying meant to sneer at the elaborate worship bestowed on the sun while pachacamac was neglected as far as ritual went  in garcilassos book we have to allow for his desire to justify the creed of his maternal ancestors his criticism of spanish versions is acute and he often appeals to his knowledge of quichua and to the direct traditions received by him from his uncle against his theory of pachacamac as a result of philosophical thought it may be urged that similar conceptions or nearly similar exist among races not civilised like the incas and not provided with colleges of learned priests in fact the position of pachacamac and the sun is very nearly that of the blackfoot creator n√†pi and the sun or of shangti and the heaven in china we have the creative being whose creed is invaded by that of a worshipped aspect of nature and whose cult quite logically is nil or nearly nil there are also in different strata of the inca empire ancestorworship or mummyworship totemism and polytheism with a vague mass of huaca  elohim kalou wakan  perhaps it would not be too rash to conjecture that pachacamac is not a merely philosophical abstraction but a survival of a being like n√†pi or ahone cieza de leon calls pachacamac a devil whose name means creator of the world17 the name when it was uttered was spoken with genuflexions and signs of reverence so closely did pachacamac resemble the christian deity that cieza de leon declares the devil to have forged and insisted on the resemblance18 it was open to spanish missionaries to use pachacamac as to the jesuits among the bantu to use mpungu as a fulcrum for the introduction of christianity they preferred to regard pachacamac as a fraudulent fiend now nzambi mpungu among the bantu is assuredly not a creation of a learned priesthood for the bantu have no learned priests and mpungu would be useless to the greedy conjurers whom they do consult as he is not propitiated on grounds of analogy then pachacamac may be said to resemble a savage supreme being somewhat etherealised either by garcilasso or by the amautas the learned class among the subjects of the incas he does not seem even so much superior to the ahone of the virginians  we possess however a different account of inca religion from which garcilasso strongly dissents the best version is that of christoval de molina who was chaplain of the hospital for natives and wrote between 1570 and 158419 christoval assembled a number of old priests and other natives who had taken part in the ancient services and collected their evidence he calls the creator not born of woman unchangeable and eternal by the name pachayachachi teacher of the world and tecsiviracocha which garcilasso dismisses as meaningless20 he also tells the tale of the inca yupanqui and the lord of the sun but says that the incas had already knowledge of the creator to yupanqui he attributes the erection of a gold image of the creator utterly denied by garcilasso21 christoval declares again contradicted by garcilasso that sacrifices were offered to the creator unlike the sun christoval says the creator had no woman assigned to him because as he created them they all belonged to him p 26 which of course is an idea that would also make sacrifice superfluous  christoval gives prayers in quichua wherein the creator is addressed as uiracocha  christoval assigns images sacrifice and even human sacrifice to the creator uiracocha garcilasso denies that the creator pachacamac had any of these things he denies that uiracocha was the name of the creator and he denies it knowing that the spaniards made the assertion22 who is right uiracocha says garcilasso is one thing with his sacrifices the creator pachacamac without sacrifices is another is god  mr markham thinks that garcilasso writing when he did and not consciously exaggerating was yet less trustworthy though wonderfully accurate than christoval garcilasso however is scrupulously truthful23 the excellence of his memory is perhaps best shown in his topographical details he does not make a single mistake in the topography of three hundred and twenty places a scrupulously truthful gentleman endowed with an amazing memory and a master of his native language flatly contradicts the version of a spanish priest who also appears to have been careful and honourable  i shall now show that christoval and garcilasso have different versions of the same historical events and that garcilasso bases his confutation of the spanish theory of the inca creator on his form of this historical tradition which follows  the inca yahuarhuaccac like george ii was at odds with his prince of wales he therefore banished the prince to chita and made him serve as shepherd of the llamas of the sun three years later the disgraced prince came to court with what the inca regarded as a cockandbull story of an apparition of the kind technically styled borderland asleep or awake he knew not he saw a bearded robed man holding a strange animal the appearance declared himself as uiracocha christovals name for the creator a child of the sun by no means as pachacamac the creator of the sun he announced a distant rebellion and promised his aid to the prince the inca hearing this narrative replied in the tones of charles ii when he said about monmouth tell james to go to hell24 the predicted rebellion however broke out the inca fled the prince saved the city dethroned his father and sent him into the country he then adopted from the apparition the thronename uiracocha grew a beard and dressed like the apparition to whom he erected a temple roofless and unique in construction therein he had an image of the god for which he himself gave frequent sittings when the spaniards arrived bearded men the indians called them uiracochas as all the spanish historians say and to flatter them declared falsely that uiracocha was their word for the creator garcilasso explodes the spanish etymology of the name in the language of cuzco which he sucked in with his mothers milk the indians said that the chief spaniards were children of the sun to make gods of them just as they said they were children of the apparition uiracocha25 moreover garcilasso and cieza de leon agree in their descriptions of the image of uiracocha which both assert the spaniards conceived to represent a christian early missionary perhaps st bartholomew26 garcilasso had seen the mummy of the inca uiracocha and relates the whole tale from the oral version of his uncle adding many native comments on the court revolution described  to garcilasso then the invocations of uiracocha in christovals collection of prayers are a native adaptation to spanish prejudice even in them pachacamac occurs27  now christoval has got hold of a variant of garcilassos narrative which in garcilasso has plenty of humour and human nature according to christoval it was not the prince later inca uiracocha who beheld the apparition but the inca uiracochas son prince of wales as it were of the period later the inca yupanqui  garcilasso corrects christoval uiracocha saw the apparition as p√®re acosta rightly says and yupanqui was not the son but the grandson of this inca uiracocha28 uiracochas own son was pachacutec which simply means revolution they say by way of byword pachamcutin which means the world changes  christovals form of the story is peculiarly gratifying in one way yupanqui saw the apparition in a piece of crystal the apparition vanished while the piece of crystal remained the inca took care of it and they say that he afterwards saw everything he wanted in it the apparition in human form and in inca dress gave itself out for the sun and yupanqui when he came to the throne ordered a statue of the sun to be made as nearly as possible resembling the figure he had seen in the crystal he bade his subjects to reverence the new deity as they had heretofore worshipped the creator29 who therefore was prior to uiracocha  interesting as a proof of inca crystalgazing this legend of christovals cannot compete as evidence with acosta and garcilasso the reader however must decide as to whether he prefers garcilassos unpropitiated pachacamac or christovals uiracocha human sacrifices and all30  mr tylor prefers the version of christoval making pachacamac a title of uiracocha31 he thinks that we have in inca religion an example of a subordinate god the sun usurping the place of the supreme deity the rivalry between the creator and the divine sun in china as we shall see mr tylor thinks on the other hand that heaven is the elder god and that shangti the supreme being is the usurper  the truth in the uiracocha versus pachacamac controversy is difficult to ascertain i confess a leaning toward garcilasso so truthful and so wonderfully accurate rather than to the spanish priest christoval it will be remarked says that chancauiracocha was a huaca sacred place in chuquichaca32 now chuquichaca is the very place where according to garcilasso the inca uiracocha erected a temple to his uncle the apparition33 uiracocha then the deity who receives human sacrifice would be a late royally introduced ancestral god no real rival of the creator who receives no sacrifice at all and as he was bearded his name would be easily transferred to the bearded spaniards whose arrival the inca uiracocha was said to have predicted but to call several or all spaniards by the name given to the creator would be absurd mr tylor and mr markham do not refer to the passage in which christoval obviously gets hold of a wrong version of the story of the apparition  there is yet another version of this historical legend written forty years after christovals date by don juan de santa cruz pachacutiyamqui salcamayhua he ranks after garcilasso and christoval but before earlier spanish writers such as acosta who knew not quichua according to salcamayhuia the inca uiracocha was like james iii fond of architecture and averse to war he gave the realm to his bastard urca who was defeated and killed by the chancas uiracocha meant to abandon the contest but his legitimate son yupanqui saw a fair youth on a rock who promised him success in the name of the creator and then vanished the prince was victorious and the inca uiracocha retired into private life this appears to be a mixture of the stories of garcilasso and christoval34  it is not in itself a point of much importance whether the creator was called uiracocha which if it means anything means sea of grease or whether he was called pachacamac maker of the world or by both names the important question is as to whether the creator received even human sacrifices christoval or none at all garcilasso as to pachacamac we must consult mr payne who has the advantage of being a quichua scholar he considers that pachacamac combines the conception of a general spirit of living things with that of a creator or maker of all things pachacamac and the creator are one and the same but the conception of pachayachacic ruler of the world belongs to the later period of the incas35 mr payne appears to prefer christovals legend of the inca crystalgazer to the rival version of garcilasso the yunca form of the worship of pachacamac mr payne regards as an example of degradation36 he disbelieves garcilassos statement that human sacrifices were not made to the sun garcilasso must if mr payne is right have been a deliberate liar unless indeed he was deceived by his inca kinsfolk the reader can now estimate for himself the difficulty of knowing much about peruvian religion or indeed of any religion for if mr payne is right about the lowest savages having no conception of god or even of spirit though the idea of a great creator a spirit is one of the earliest efforts of primitive logic we of course have been merely fabling throughout  garcilassos evidence however seems untainted by christian attempts to find a primitive divine tradition garcilasso may possibly be refining on facts but he asks for no theory of divine primitive tradition in the case of pachacamac whom he attributes to philosophical reflection  in the following chapter we discuss the old degeneration theory and contrast it with the scheme provisionally offered in this book we have already observed that the degeneration theory biasses the accounts of some missionaries who are obviously anxious to find traces of a primitive tradition originally revealed to all men but only preserved in a pure form by the jews to avoid deception by means of this bias we have chosen examples of savage creative beings from wide areas from diverse ages from nonmissionary statements from the least contaminated backward peoples and from their secret mysteries and hymns  thus still confining ourselves to the american continent we have the ancient hymns of the zu√±is in no way christianised and never chanted in the presence of the mexican spanish these hymns run thus before the beginning of the new making awonawilona the maker and container of all the allfather solely had being he then evolved all things by thinking himself outward in space hegelian but so are the dateless hymns of the maoris despite the savage mythology which intrudes into both sets of traditions the old fable of ouranos and gaia recurs in zu√±i as in maori37  i fail to see how awonawilona could be developed out of the ghost of chief or conjurer that in which all things potentially existed yet who was more than all is not the ghost of a conjurer or chief he certainly is not due to missionary influence no authority can be better than that of traditional sacred chants found among a populace which will not sing them before one of their mexican masters  we have tried to escape from the bias of belief in a primitive divine tradition but bias of every kind exists and must exist at present the anthropological hypothesis of ancestorworship as the basis perhaps as in mr spencers theory the only basis of religion affects observers  before treating the theory of degeneration let us examine a case of the anthropological bias the fijians as we learned from williams have ancestral gods and also a singular form of the creative being ndengei or as mr basil thomson calls him degei mr thomson writes it is clear that the fijians humanised their gods because they had once existed on earth in human form like other primitive people the fijians deified their ancestors yet the fijians may have forgotten the names of their ancestors three generations back how in the world can you deify a person whom you dont remember moreover only malevolent chiefs were deified so apparently a fijian god is really a wellborn human scoundrel so considerable that he for one is not forgottenjust as if we worshipped the wicked lord lyttelton of course a god like ahone could not be made out of such materials as these and in fact we learn from mr thomson that there are other fijian gods of a different origin  it is probable that there were here and there gods that were the creation of the priests that ministered to them and were not the spirits of dead chiefs such was the god of the bure tribe on the ra coast who was called tui laga or lord of heaven when the missionaries first went to convert this town they found the heathen priest their staunch ally he declared that they had come to preach the same god that he had been preaching the tui laga and that more had been revealed to them than to him of the mysteries of the god  mr thomson is reminded of st paul at athens whom then ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you38  mr thomson has clearly no bias in favour of a god like our own known to savages and not derived from ghostworship he deduces this god tui laga from priestly reflection and speculation but we find such a god where we find no priests where a priesthood has not been developed such a god being usually unpropitiated by sacrifice and lucrative private practice is precisely the kind of deity who does not suit a priesthood for these reasonsthat a priesthood sees no money in a god of this kind and that gods of this kind ethical and creative are found where there are no priesthoodswe cannot look on the conception as a late one of priestly origin as mr thomson does though a learned caste like the peruvian amantas may refine on the idea least of all can such a god be the creation of the priests that minister to him when as in peru the andaman isles and much of africa this god is ministered to by no priests nor lastly can we regard the absence of sacrifice to the creative being as a mere proof that he is an ancestral ghost who had lived on earth at too remote a time for this absence of sacrifice occurs where ghosts are dreaded but are not propitiated by offerings of food as among australians andamanese and blackfoot indians while the creative being is not and never was a ghost according to his worshippers  at this point criticism may naturally remark that whether the savage supreme being is f√™ted as by the comanches who offer puffs of smoke or is apparently half forgotten as by the algonquins and zulus whether he is propitiated by sacrifice which is very rare indeed or only by conduct i equally claim him as the probable descendant in evolution of the primitive undifferentiated not necessarily spiritual being of such creeds as the australian  one must reply that this pedigree cannot indeed be historically traced but that it presents none of the logical difficulties inherent in the animistic pedigreenamely that the savage supreme being is the last and highest result of evolution on animistic lines out of ghosts it does not run counter to the evidence universally offered by savages that their supreme being never was mortal man it is consistent whereas the animistic hypothesis is in this case inconsistent with the universal savage theory of death finally as has been said before granting my opinion that there are two streams of religious thought one rising in the conception of an undifferentiated being eternal moral and creative the other rising in the ghostdoctrine it stands to reason that the latter as best adapted to everyday needs and experiences normal and supernormal may contaminate the former and introduce sacrifice and foodpropitiation into the ritual of beings who by the original conception need nothing of ours at the same time the conception of spirit once attained would inevitably come to be attached to the idea of the supreme being even though he was not at first conceived of as a spirit we know by our own experience how difficult it has become for us to think of an eternal powerful and immortal being except as a spirit yet this way of looking at the supreme being merely as being not as spirit must have existed granting that the idea of spirit has ghost for its first expression as by their very definition the high gods of savages are not ghosts and never were ghosts but are prior to death  here let me introduce by way of example a supreme being not of the lowest savage level metaphysically he is improved on in statement morally he is stained with the worst crimes of the hungry ghostgod or god framed on the lines of animism this very interesting supreme being in a middle barbaric race is the polynesian taaroa as described by ellis in that fascinating book polynesian researches39 several of their taatapaari or wise men pretend that according to other traditions taaroa was only a man who was deified after death euhemerism in fact is a natural theory of men acquainted with ancestorworship but a euhemeristic hypothesis by a polynesian thinker is not a statement of national belief taaroa was uncreated existing from the beginning or from the time he emerges from the po or world of darkness in the leeward isles taaroa was toivi fatherless and motherless from all eternity in the highest heavens he dwells alone he created the gods of polytheism the gods of war of peace and so on says a native hymn he was he abode in the void no earth no sky no men he became the universe in the windward isles he has a wife papa the rock  papa earth wife of rangi heaven in maori mythology thus it may be argued taaroa is no primaeval theistic idea but merely the heavengod ouranos in greece but we may distinguish in the zu√±i hymn we have the myth of the marriage of heaven and earth but heaven is not the eternal awonawilona who thought himself out into the void before which as in the polynesian hymn there was no sky40  whence came the idea of taaroa the euhemeristic theory that he was a ghost of a dead man is absurd but as we are now among polytheists it may be argued that given a crowd of gods on the animistic model an origin had to be found for them and that origin was taaroa this would be more plausible if we did not find supreme beings where there is no departmental polytheism to develop them out of in tahiti atuas are gods oramutuas tiis are spirits the chief of the spirits were ghosts of warriors these were mischievous they their images and the skulls of the dead needed propitiation and these ideas perhaps were reflected on to taaroa to whom human victims were sacrificed41  now this kind of horror human sacrifice is unknown i think in early savage religions of supreme beings as in australia among the bushmen the andamanese and so on i therefore suggest that in an advanced polytheism such as that of polynesia the evil sacrificial rites unpractised by low savages come to be attached to the worship even of the supreme being ghosts and ghostgods demanded food and food was therefore also offered to the supreme being  it was found difficult or impossible to induce christian converts in polynesia to repeat the old prayers they began trembled and abstained they had a ritual for almost every act of their lives a thing unfamiliar to low savages in fact beyond all doubt religious criminal acts from human sacrifice to the burning of jeanne darc increase as religion and culture move away from the stage of bushmen and andamanese to the stage of aztec and polynesian culture the supreme being is succeeded in advancing civilisation and under the influences of animism by ruthless and insatiable ghostgods full of the worst human qualities thus there is what we may really call degeneration moral and religious inevitably accompanying early progress  that this is the case that the first advances in culture necessarily introduce religious degeneration we shall now try to demonstrate but we may observe in passing that our array of moral or august savage supreme beings the first who came to hand will for some reason not be found in anthropological treatises on the origin of religion they appear somehow to have been overlooked by philosophers yet the evidence for them is sufficiently good its excellence is proved by its very uniformity assuredly undesigned an old nay an obsolete theorythat of degeneration in religionhas facts at its basis which its very supporters have ignored which orthodoxy has overlooked thus the rev professor flint informs the audience in the cathedral of st giless that in the religions at the bottom of the religious scale it is always easy to see how wretchedly the divine is conceived of how little conscious of his own true wants  is the poor worshipper the poor worshipper of baiame wishes to obey his law which makes to some extent for righteousness42  footnote 1 in pinkerton xiii pp 13

have murmured to himself the old degeneration theory on this dr brinton remarked in 1868  the supposition that in ancient times and in very unenlightened conditions before mythology had grown a monotheism prevailed which afterwards at various times was revived by reformers is a belief that should have passed away when the delights of savage life and the praises of a state of nature ceased to be the theme of philosophers1  the old degeneration theory practically and fallaciously resolved itself as mr tylor says into two assumptionsfirst that the history of culture began with the appearance on earth of a semicivilised race of men and second that from this stage culture has proceeded in two waysbackward to produce savages and forward to produce civilised men2 that hypothesis is false to all our knowledge of evolution  the hypothesis here provisionally advocated makes no assumptions at all it is a positive fact that among some of the lowest savages there exists not a doctrinal and abstract monotheism but a belief in a moral powerful kindly creative being while this faith is found in juxtaposition with belief in unworshipped ghosts totems fetishes and so on the powerful creative being of savage belief sanctions truth unselfishness loyalty chastity and other virtues i have set forth the difficulties involved in the attempt to derive this being from ghosts and other lower forms of belief  now it is mere matter of fact and not of assumption that the supreme being of many rather higher savages differs from the supreme being of certain lower savages by the neglect in which he is left by the epicurean repose with which he is credited and by his comparative lack of moral control over human conduct in his place a mob of ghosts and spirits supposed to be potent and helpful in everyday life attract mens regard and adoration and get paid by sacrificeeven by human sacrifice  turning to races yet higher in material culture we find a crowd of hungry and cruel gods  on this point mr jevons remarks in accordance with my own observation that human sacrifice appears at a much earlier period in the rites for the dead than it does in the ritual of the gods3 the dead chief needs servants and wives in hades who are offered to him the australians have some elements of cannibalism but do not as a general rule offer any human victims so far then ancestorworship introduced a sadly degenerate rite compared with the moral faith in unfed gods  to gods the human sacrifice was probably extended in some cases either by a cannibal civilised race like the aztecs or by way of piacula the god being conciliated for mans sin by the offering of what man most prized the jealousy of the god being appeased in a similar way but these are relatively advanced conceptions not to be found to my knowledge among the lowest and most backward races therefore advance to the idea of spirit at one point meant degeneration at another point to the extent of human sacrifice  thus on looking at relatively advanced races we find them worshipping polytheistic deities and ghosts of the kings just dead who are often propitiated by terrible massacres of human victims while as in the case of taaroa the blood spurts back even on the uncreated creator who was before earth was or sea sun or sky  undeniably the hungry cruel gods are degenerate from the australian father in heaven who receives no sacrifice but that of mens lusts and selfishness who desires obedience not the fat of kangaroos who needs nothing of ours is unfed and unbribed thus in this particular respect the degeneration of religion from the australian or andamanese to the dinka standardand infinitely more to the polynesian or aztec or popular greek standardis as undeniable as any fact in human history  anthropology has only escaped the knowledge of this circumstance by laying down the rule demonstrably unbased on facts that the divine sanction of ethical laws  belongs almost or wholly to religions above the savage level not to the earlier and lower creeds that savage animism is almost devoid of that ethical element which to the educated modern mind is the very mainspring of practical religion4  i have argued indeed that the god of low savages who imparts the divine sanction of ethical laws is not of animistic origin but even where mr im thurn finds in guiana nothing but animism of the lowest conceivable type he also finds in that animism the only or most potent moral restraint on the conduct of men  while anthropology holds the certainly erroneous idea that the religion of the most backward races is always nonmoral of course she cannot know that there has in fact been great degeneration in religion if religion began on the australian and andamanese level or even higher wherever religion is nonmoral or immoral  again anthropology while fixing her gaze on totems on worshipped mummies adored ghosts and treasured fetishes has not to my knowledge made a comparative study of the higher and purer religious ideas of savages these have been passed by with a word about credulous missionaries and christian influences except in the brief summary for which mr tylor found room in this work i only take a handful of cases of the higher religious opinions of savages and set them side by side for purposes of comparison much more remains to be done in this field but the area covered is wide the evidence is the best attainable and it seems proved beyond doubt that savages have felt after a conception of a creator much higher than that for which they commonly get credit now if that conception is original or is very early and nothing in it suggests lateness of development then the other elements of their faith and practice are degenerate  how it has been asked could all mankind forget a pure religion5 that is what i now try to explain that degeneration i would account for by the attractions which animism when once developed possessed for the naughty natural man the old adam a moral creator in need of no gifts and opposed to lust and mischief will not help a man with lovespells or with malevolent sendings of disease by witchcraft will not favour one man above his neighbour or one tribe above its rivals as a reward for sacrifice which he does not accept or as constrained by charms which do not touch his omnipotence ghosts and ghostgods on the other hand in need of food and blood afraid of spells and binding charms6 are a corrupt but to man a useful constituency man being what he is man was certain to go awhoring after practically useful ghosts ghostgods and fetishes which he could keep in his wallet or medicine bag for these he was sure in the long run first to neglect his idea of his creator next perhaps to reckon him as only one if the highest of the venal rabble of spirits or deities and to sacrifice to him as to them and this is exactly what happened if we are not to call it degeneration what are we to call it it may be an old theory but facts winna ding and are on the side of an old theory meanwhile on the material plane culture kept advancing the crafts and arts arose departments arose each needing a god thought grew clearer such admirable ethics as those of the aztecs were developed and while bleeding human hearts smoked on every altar nezahuatl conceived and erected a bloodless fane to the unknown god cause of causes without altar or idol and the inca yupanqui or another declared that our father and master the sun must have a lord7  but at this stage of culture the luck of the state and the interests of a rich and powerful clergy were involved in the maintenance of the old animistic relatively nonmoral system as in cuzco greece and rome that popular and political regard for the luck of the state that priestly selfinterest quite natural could only be swept away by the moral monotheism of christianity or of islam nothing else could do it in the case of christianity the central and most potent of many combined influences apart from the life and death of our lord was the moral monotheism of the hebrew religion of jehovah  now it is undeniable that jehovah at a certain period of hebrew history had become degraded and anthropomorphized far below darumulun and puluga and pachacamac and ahone as conceived of in their purest form and in the high mood of savage mysteries which yet contain so much that is grotesque even the big black man of the fuegians is on a higher level as we reckon morals when he forbids the slaying of a robber enemy than certain examples of early hebrew conduct but our knowledge of the fuegians is lamentably scanty  again traces of human sacrifice appear in the ritual of israel and it is only relatively late that the great prophets justly declaring jehovah to be indifferent to the blood of bulls and rams try to bring back his service to that of the unpropitiated unbought dendid or ahone or pundjel here is degeneration even in israel how the conception of jehovah arose in israel whether it was a revival of a halfobliterated idea such as we find among low savages or whether it was borrowed from some foreign creed or was the result of meditation on the philosophical supreme being of high egyptian theology is another question the biblical statement leans to the first alternative jehovah not by that name had been the god of israels fathers the question will be discussed later but unless new facts are discovered we must accept the version of the pentateuch or take refuge in conjecture  not only is there degeneration from the australian conception of mungangnaur at its best to the conception of the semitic gods in general but humanly speaking if religion began in a pure form among low savages degeneration was inevitable advancing social conditions compelled men into degeneration munganngaur is so far in line with our own ideas of divinity because he is not localised he dwelleth not in temples made with hands it is not likely that he should when his worshippers have neither house tent nor tabernacle as mr robertson smith says where the god had a house or a temple we recognise the work of men who were no longer pure nomads but had begun to form fixed homes by the nature of australian society a deity could not be tied to a temple and templeritual and consequent myths to explain that ritual could not arise nor could darumulun be attached to a district just as the nomad arabs could not assimilate the conception of a god as a landowner and apply it to their own tribal deities for the simple reason that in the desert private property in land was unknown8  darumulun is thus not capable of degenerating into a local god as baal or lord of the land because this involves a series of ideas unknown to the primitive life of the savage huntsman like the widely spread murring tribes9  nor could darumulun be tied down to a place in semitic fashion first by manifesting himself there therefore by receiving an altar of sacrifice there and in the end a sanctuary for darumulun receives no sacrifice at all  again the scene of the bora could not become a permanent home of darumulun because when the rites are over the effigy of the god is scrupulously destroyed thus darumulun in his own abode beyond the sky can go everywhere and do everything is omnipresent and omnipotent dwells in no earthly places has no temple nor tabernacle nor sacred mount nor like jehovah any limit of land10  the early hebrew conception of jehovah then is infinitely more conditioned practically by space than the supreme being the master in the conception of some australian blacks  by a prophet like isaiah the residence of jehovah in zion is almost wholly dematerialised conceiving jehovah as the king of israel he necessarily conceives his kingly activity as going forth from the capital of the nation11  but nomad hunter tribes with no ancestorworship no king and no capital cannot lower their deity by the conditions or limit him by the limitations of an earthly monarchy  in precisely the same way major ellis proves the degeneration of deity in africa so far as being localised in place of being the universal god implies degeneration as it certainly does to our minds by being attached to a given hill or river the gods instead of being regarded as being interested in the whole of mankind would eventually come to be regarded as being interested in separate tribes or nations alone  to us milton seems nobly chauvinistic when he talks of what god has done by his english but this localised and essentially degenerate conception was inevitable as soon as in advancing civilisation the god who had been interested in the whole of known mankind was settled on a hill river or lagoon amidst a nation of worshippers  in the course of the education of mankind this form of degeneration abstractly so considered was to work as nothing else could have worked towards the lofty conception of universal deity for that conception was only brought into practical religion as apart from philosophic speculation by the union between israel and the god of sinai and zion the prophets recognising in the god of sinai their nations godone to whom righteousness was infinitely dearer than even his chosen peoplefreed the conception of god from local ties and made it overspread the world  mr robertson smith has pointed out again the manner in which the different political development of east and west affected the religion of greece and of the semites in greece monarchy fell at an early period before the aristocratic houses the result was a divine aristocracy of many gods only modified by a weak reminiscence of the old kingship in the not very effective sovereignty or prytany of zeus in the east the national god tended to acquire a really monarchic sway12 australia escaped polytheistic degeneracy by having no aristocracy as in polynesia where aristocracy as in early greece had developed polytheism ghosts and spirits the australians knew but not polytheistic gods nor departmental deities as of war agriculture art the savage had no agriculture and his social condition was not departmental in yet another way political advance produces religious degeneration if polytheism be degeneration from the conception of one relatively supreme moral being to make a nation several tribes must unite each has its god and the nation is apt to receive them all equally into its pantheon thus if worshippers of baiame pundjel and darumulun coalesced into a nation we might find all three gods living together in a new polytheism in fact granting a relatively pure startingpoint degeneration from it must accompany every step of civilisation to a certain distance  unlike semitic gods darumulun receives no sacrifice as we have said he has no kin with ghosts and their sacrifices could not be carried on into his cult if waitzgerland vi 811 are right in saying that the australians have no ancestorworship the kurnai ghosts were believed to live upon plants13 which are not offered to them chill ghosts unfed by men would come to waning campfires and batten on the broken meats the ngarego and wolgal held more handsomely that tharamulun darumulun met the just departed spirit and conducted it to its future home beyond the sky14 ghosts might also accompany relics of the body such as the dead hand carried about by the family who would wave the black fragment at the dreaded aurora borealis crying send it away i am unacquainted with any sacrifices to ancestral ghosts among this people who cannot long remember their ancestors consequently the practice has not been refracted on their supreme masters cult in the cult of darumulun and of other highest gods of lowest savages nothing answers to the hebrew technical priestly word for sacrifice food of the deity15 nobody feeds puluga nobody fed ahone we hear of no fuegian sacrifices mr robertson smith says in all religions in which the gods have been developed out of totems worshipped animals and other things regarded as akin to human stocks the ritual act of laying food before the deity is perfectly intelligible pundjel an australian supreme being is mixed up with animals in some myths but it is not easy to see how such supreme beings as he could be developed out of totems i am not aware again that any australian tribe feeds the animals who are its totems so darumulun could not and did not inherit sacrifice through them mr robertson smith had a celebrated theory that cereal sacrifice is a tribute to a god while sacrifice of a beast or man is an act of communion with the god16 men and gods dined together17 the god himself was conceived of as a being of the same stock as his comrades beasts were also of the same stock one beast say a lobster was of the same blood as a lobster kin and its god18 occasionally the sacred beast of the kin usually not to be slain or tasted is eaten as a kind of mystic sacrament a most dubious fact19  now there is i believe some evidence lately collected if not published which makes in favour of the eating of totems by australians at a certain very rare and solemn mystery it would not even surprise me from information received if a very deeply initiated person were occasionally slain as the highest degree of initiation on certain most unusual occasions this remains uncertain but i have at present no evidence that either by one road or another either from ghostfeeding or totemfeeding or feeding on totems any australian supreme being receives any sacrifice at all much less as among pawnees and semitic peoples to judge from certain traces is the australian supreme being a cause of and partaker in human sacrifice20 the horrible idea of the man who is the god and is eaten in the gods honour occurs among polytheistic aztecs on a high level of material culture not among australians andamanese bushmen or fuegians21  thus in religion the darumulun or other supreme being of the lowest known savages men roaming wild when originally met on a continent peopled by older kinds of animals than ours was as we regard purity on a higher plane by far than the gods of greeks and semites in their earliest known myths setting mythology aside and looking only at cult the god of the murring or the kurnai whose precepts soften the heart who knows the hearts secrets who inculcates chastity respect of age unselfishness who is not bound by conditions of space or place who receives no blood of slaughtered man or beast is a conception from which the ordinary polytheistic gods of infinitely more polite peoples are frankly degenerate the animistic superstitions wildly based on the belief in the soul have not soiled him and the social conditions of aristocracy agriculture architecture have not made him one in a polytheistic crowd of rapacious gods nor fettered him as a baal to his estate nor localised him in a temple built with hands he cannot appear as a god of battles no te deum can be sung to him for victory in a cause perhaps unjust for he is the supreme being of a certain group of allied local tribes one of these tribes has no more interest with him than another and the whole group do not as a body wage war on another alien group the social conditions of his worshippers then preserve darumulun from the patent blots on the escutcheon of gods among much more advanced races  once more the idea of animism admits of endless expansion a spirit can be located anywhere in any stone stick bush person hill or river a god made on the animistic model can be assigned to any department of human activity down to sports or lusts or the province of cloacina thus religion becomes a mere haunted and pestilential jungle of beliefs but the theistic conception when not yet envisaged as spiritual cannot be subdivided and √©parpill√© thus from every point of view and on every side animism is full of the seeds of religious degeneration which do not and cannot exist in what i take to be the earliest known form of the theistic conception that of a being about whose metaphysical naturespirit or not spiritno questions were asked as dr brinton long ago remarked  that conception alone could neither supply the moral motive of a soul to be saved nor satisfy the metaphysical instinct of advancing mankind to meet these wants to supply soul with its moral stimulus and to provide a phrase or idea under which the deity could be envisaged ie as a spirit by advancing thought animism was necessary the blending of the theistic and the animistic beliefs was indispensable to religion but in the process of animistic development under advancing social conditions degeneration was necessarily implied degeneration of the theistic conception for a while therefore occurred the facts are the proofs and only contradictory facts in sufficient quantity can annihilate the old theory of degeneration when it is presented in this form  it mast be repeated that on this theory an explanation is given of what the old degeneration hypothesis does not explain granting a primal religion relatively pure in its beginnings why did it degenerate  mr max mullet looking on religion as the development of the sentiment of the infinite regards fetishism as a secondary and comparatively late form of belief we find it he observes in various forms of christianity christianity therefore is primary there relic worship is secondary religion beginning according to him in the sense of the infinite as awakened in man by tall trees high hills and so on it advances to the infinite of space and sky and so to the infinitely divine this is primary fetishism is secondary arguing elsewhere against this idea i have asked what was the modus of degeneration which produced similar results in christianity and in african and other religions how did it work i am not aware that mr max m√ºller has answered this question but how degeneration workednamely by animism supplanting theismis conspicuously plain on our theory  take the early chapters of genesis or any savage cosmogonic myth you please deathless man is face to face with the creator he cannot degenerate in religion he cannot offer sacrifice for the creator obviously needs nothing and again as there is no death he cannot slay animals for the creator but in one way or another usually by breach of a taboo death enters the world then comes by process of evolution belief in hungry spirits belief in spirits who may inhabit stones or sticks again there arise priests who know how to propitiate spirits and how to tempt them into sticks and stones these arts become lucrative and are backed by the cleverest men and by the apparent evidence of prophecies by convulsionaries thus every known kind of degeneration in religion is inevitably introduced as a result of the theory of animism we do not need an hypothesis of original sin as a cause of degeneration and if mr max m√ºllers doctrine of the infinite were viable we have supplied in animism under advancing social conditions what he does not seem to provide a cause and modus of degeneration fetishism would thus be really secondary ex hypothesi but as we nowhere find fetishism alone without the other elements of religion we cannot say historically whether it is secondary or not fetishism logically needs in some of its aspects the doctrine of spirits and theism in what we take to be its earliest known form does not logically need the doctrine of spirits as given matter so far we can go but not farther as to the fact of priority in evolution nevertheless we meet among the most backward peoples known to us among men just emerged from the palaeolithic stage of culture men who are involved in dread of ghosts a religious idea which certainly is not born of ghostworship for by these men ancestral ghosts are not worshipped  in their hearts on their lips in their moral training we find however blended with barbarous absurdities and obscured by rites of another origin the faith in a being who created or constructed the world who was from time beyond memory or conjecture who is primal who makes for righteousness and who loves mankind this being has not the notes of degeneration his home is among the stars not in a hill or in a house to him no altar smokes and for him no blood is shed  god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing  and hath made of one blood all nations of men  that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being  that the words of st paul are literally true as to the feeling after a god who needs not anything at mans hands the study of anthropology seems to us to demonstrate that in this god we have our being in so far as somewhat of ours may escape at moments from the bonds of time and the manacles of space the earlier part of this treatise is intended to suggest as a thing by no means necessarily beyond a reasonable mans power to conceive that these two beliefs however attained a point on which we possess no positive evidence have commonly been subject to degeneration in the religions of the world is only too obvious  so far then the nature of things and of the reasoning faculty does not seem to give the lie to the old degeneration theory  to these conclusions as far as they are matters of scientific opinion we have been led by nothing but the study of anthropology  footnote 1 myths of the new world p 44  footnote 2 prim cult i 35  footnote 3 introduction p 199 also

evidence is always upsetting anthropological theories     xvi  theories of jehovah  all speculation on the curly history of religion is apt to end in the endeavour to see how far the conclusions can be made to illustrate the faith of israel thus the theorist who believes in ancestorworship as the key of all the creeds will see in jehovah a developed ancestral ghost or a kind of fetishgod attached to a stoneperhaps an ancient sepulchral stele of some desert sheikh  the exclusive admirer of the hypothesis of totemism will find evidence for his belief in worship of the golden calf and the bulls the partisan of natureworship will insist on jehovahs connection with storm thunder and the fire of sinai on the other hand whoever accepts our suggestions will incline to see in the early forms of belief in jehovah a shape of the widely diffused conception of a moral supreme being at first or at least when our information begins envisaged in anthropomorphic form but gradually purged of all local traits by the unexampled and unique inspiration of the great prophets they as far as our knowledge extends were strangely indifferent to the animistic element in religion to the doctrine of surviving human souls and so of course to that element of animism which is pricelessthe purification of the soul in the light of the hope of eternal life just as the hunger after righteousness of the prophets is intense so their hope of finally sating that hunger in an eternity of sinless bliss and enjoyment of god is confessedly inconspicuous in short they have carried theism to its austere extremethough he slay me yet will i trust in himwhile unconcerned about the rewards of animism this is certainly a strange result of a religion which according to the anthropological theory has animism for its basis  we therefore examine certain forms of the animistic hypothesis as applied to account for the religion of israel the topic is one in which special knowledge of hebrew and other oriental languages seems absolutely indispensable but anthropological speculators have not been oriental scholars with rare exceptions while some oriental scholars have borrowed from popular anthropology without much critical discrimination these circumstances must be our excuse for venturing on to this difficult ground  it is probably impossible for us to trace with accuracy the rise of the religion of jehovah the wise and learned dispute endlessly over dates of documents over the amount of later doctrine interpolated into the earlier texts over the nature source and quantity of foreign influencechaldaean accadian egyptian or assyrian we know that israel had in an early age the conception of the moral eternal we know that at an early age that conception was contaminated and anthropomorphised and we know that it was rescued in a great degree from this corruption while always retaining its original ethical aspect and sanction why matters went thus in israel and not elsewhere we know not except that such was the will of god in the mysterious education of the world how mysterious that education has been is best known to all who have studied the political and social results of totemism on the face of it a perfectly crazy and degrading beliefon the face of it meant for nothing but to make the family a hell of internecine hatredtotemism rendered possiblenay inevitablethe union of hostile groups into large and relatively peaceful tribal societies given the materials as we know them we never should have educated the world thus and we do not see why it should thus have been done but we are very anthropomorphic and totally ignorant of the conditions of the problem  an example of anthropological theory concerning jehovah was put forth by mr huxley1 mr huxleys general idea of religion as it is on the lowest known level of material culturethrough which the ancestors of israel must have passed like other peoplehas already been criticised he denied to the most backward races both cult and religious sanction of ethics he was demonstrably though unconsciously in error as to the facts and therefore could not start from the idea that israel in the lowest historically known condition of savagery possessed or like other races might possess the belief in an eternal making for righteousness for my part he says i see no reason to doubt that like the rest of the world the israelites had passed through a period of mere ghostworship and had advanced through ancestorworship and fetishism and totemism to the theological level at which we find them in the books of judges and samuel2  but why does he think the israelites did all this the hebrew ghosts abiding according to mr huxley in a rather torpid condition in sheol would not be of much practical use to a worshipper a reference in deuteronomy xxvi 14 deuteronomy being ex hypothesi a late pious imposture does not prove much the hebrew is there bidden to remind himself of the stay of his ancestors in egypt and to say of the hallowed things i have not given aught for the deadnamely of the tithes dedicated to the levites and the poor a race which abode for centuries among the egyptians as israel didamong a people who elaborately fed the kas of the departedmight pick up a trace of a custom the giving of food for the dead still persevered in by st monica till st ambrose admonished her but mr huxley is hard put to it for evidence of ancestorworship or ghostworship in israel when he looks for indications of these rites in the singular weight attached to the veneration of parents in the fourth commandment3 the fourth commandment of course is a slip of the pen he adds the fifth commandment as it stands would be an excellent compromise between ancestorworship and monotheism long may children practise this excellent compromise it is really too farfetched to reason thus people were bidden to honour their parents as a compromise between monotheism and ghostworship hard hard bestead is he who has to reason in that fashion this comes of training in the use of the weapons of precision of science  mr huxley goes on the ark of the covenant may have been a relic of ancestorworship there is a good deal to be said for that speculation possibly there is by way of the valuable hypothesis that jehovah was a fetish stone which had been a gravestone or perhaps a lingam and was kept in the ark on the plausible pretext that it was the two tables of the law  however mr huxley really finds it safer to suppose that references to ancestorworship in the bible were obliterated by late monotheistic editors who none the less are so full and minute in their descriptions of the various heresies into which israel was eternally lapsing and must not be allowed to lapse again had ancestorworship been a p√©ch√© mignon of israel the prophets would have let israel hear their mind on it  the hebrews indifference to the departed soul is in fact a puzzle especially when we consider their egyptian educationso important an element in mr huxleys theory  mr herbert spencer is not more successful than mr huxley in finding ancestorworship among the hebrews on the whole subject he writes  where the levels of mental nature and social progress are lowest we usually find along with an absence of religious ideas generally an absence or very slight development of ancestorworship cook captain cook telling us what the fuegians were before contact with europeans had introduced foreign ideas said there were no appearances of religion among them and we are not told by him or others that they were ancestorworshippers4  probably they are not but they do possess a being who reads their hearts and who certainly shows no traces of european ideas if the fuegians are not ancestorworshippers this being was not developed out of ancestorworship  the evidence of captain cook no anthropologist but a mariner who saw and knew little of the fuegians is precisely of the sort against which major ellis warns us5 the more a religion consists in fear of a moral guardian of conduct the less does it show itself by sacrifice or rite to the eyes of captain cook of his majestys ship endeavour mr spencer places the andamanese on the same level as the fuegians so far as the scanty evidence may be trusted we have shown that as known to mr spencer in 1876 it may not be trusted at all the andamanese possessing a moral supreme being though they are not apparently ancestorworshippers the australians show us not much persistence in ghostpropitiation which if it exists ceases when the corpses are tied up and buried or after they are burned or after the bones carried about for a while are exposed on platforms yet many australian tribes possess a moral supreme being  in fact ghostworship in mr spencers scheme cannot be fairly well developed till society reaches the level of settled groups whose burialplaces are in their midst hence the development of a moral supreme being among tribes not thus settled is inconceivable on mr spencers hypothesis6 by that hypothesis worshipped ancestors according to their remoteness were regarded as divine semidivine and human7 where we find then the divine being among nomads who do not remember their greatgrandfathers the spencerian theory is refuted by facts we have the effect the divine being without the cause worship of ancestors  coming to the hebrews mr spencer argues that the silence of their legends as to ancestorworship is but a negative fact which may be as misleading as negative facts usually are they are indeed witness mr spencers own silence about savage supreme beings but we may fairly argue that if israel had been given to ancestorworship as might partly be surmised from the mystery about the grave of moses the prophets would not have spared them for their crying the prophets were unusually outspoken men and as they undeniably do scold israel for every other kind of conceivable heresy they were not likely to be silent about ancestorworship if ancestorworship existed mr spencer then rather heedlessly though correctly argues that nomadic habits are unfavourable to evolution of the ghosttheory8 alas this gives away the whole case for if all men began as nomads and nomadic habits are unfavourable even to the ordinary ghost how did the australian and other nomads develop the supreme being who ex hypothesi is the final fruit of the ghostflower if you cannot have an established ancestorworship till you abandon nomadic habits how while still nomadic do you evolve a supreme being obviously not out of ancestorworship  mr spencer then assigns as evidence for ancestorworship in israel mourning dresses fasting the law against selfbleeding and cutting off the hair for the dead and the text deut xxvi 14 about i have not given aught thereof for the dead hence the conclusion must be that ancestorworship had developed as far as nomadic habits allowed before it was repressed by a higher worship9 but whence came that higher worship which seems to have intervened immediately after the cessation of nomadic habits  there are obvious traces of grief expressed in a primitive way among the hebrews ye shall not cut yourselves nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead deut xiv 1 neither shall men lament for them nor cut themselves nor make themselves bald for them neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead by way of counterirritant to grief neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or their mother because the jews were to be removed from their homes10 ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead nor print any marks upon you11  it may be usual to regard inflictions such as cutting by mourners as sacrifices to the ghost of the dead but one has seen a man strike himself a heavy blow on receiving news of a loss not by death and i venture to fancy that cuttings and gashings at funerals are merely a more violent form of appeal to a counterirritant of grief and again a token of recklessness caused by a sorrow which makes void the world one of john nicholsons native adorers killed himself on news of that warriors death saying what is left worth living for this was not a sacrifice to the manes of nicholson the sacrifice of the mourners hair as by achilles argues a similar indifference to personal charm once more the text in psalm cvi 28 they joined themselves unto baalpeor and ate the sacrifices of the dead is usually taken by commentators as a reference to the ritual of gods who are no gods but it rather seems to indicate an acquiescence in foreign burial rites all this additional evidence does not do much to prove ancestorworship in israel though the secrecy of the burial of moses in a valley of the land of moab over against bethpeor but no man knoweth of his sepulchre to this day may indicate a dread of a nascent worship of the great leader12 the scene of the defection in psalm cvi bethpeor is indicated in numbers xxv where israel runs after the girls and the gods of moab and moab called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods and israel joined himself unto baalpeor psalm cvi is obviously a later restatement of this addiction to the moabite gods and the psalm adds they ate the sacrifices of the dead  it is plain that for whatever reason ancestorworship among the hebrews was at the utmost rudimentary otherwise it must have been clearly denounced by the prophets among the other heresies of israel therefore as being at the most rudimentary ancestorworship in israel could not be developed at once into the worship of jehovah  though ancestorworship among the hebrews could not be fully developed according to mr spencer because of their nomadic habits it was fully developed according to the rev aw oxford every family like every old roman and greek family was firmly held together by the worship of its ancestors the hearth was the altar the head of the family the priest the bond which kept together the families of a tribe was its common religion the worship of its reputed ancestor the chief of the tribe was of course the priest of the cult of course but what a pity that mr huxley and mr spencer omitted facts so invaluable to their theory and how does the rev mr oxford know well there is no direct proof oddly enough of so marked a feature in hebrew religion but we are referred to 1 sam xx 29 and judges xviii 19 1 sam xx 29 makes jonathan say that david wants to go to a family sacrifice that is a family dinner party this hardly covers the large assertions made by mr oxford his second citation is so unlucky as to contradict his observation that of course the chief of the tribe was the priest of the cult micah in judges xvii xviii is not the chief of his tribe ephraim neither is he even the priest in his own house he consecrated one of his own sons who became his priest till he got hold of a casual young levite and said be unto me a father and a priest for ten shekels per annum a suit of clothes and board and lodging  in place then of any remote reference to a chiefs being priest of his ancestral ghosts we have here a man of one tribe who is paid rather handsomely to be family chaplain to a member of another tribe some mosstroopers of the tribe of dan then kidnapped this valuable young levite and seized a few idols which micah had permitted himself to make and all this according to our clerical authority is evidence for ancestorworship13  all this appears to be derived from some incoherent speculations of stade for example that learned german cites the story of micah as a proof that the different tribes or clans had different religions this must be so because the danites asked the young levite whether it was not better to be priest to a clan than to an individual it is as if a patron offered a rich living to somebodys private chaplain saying that the new position was more creditable and lucrative this would hardly prove a difference of religion between the individual and the parish14  mr oxford next avers that the earliest form of the israelite religion was fetishism or totemism this is another example of stades logic finding as he believes names suggestive of totemism in simeon levi rachel and so on stade leaps to the conclusion that totemism in israel was prior to anything resembling monotheism for monotheism he argues could not give the germs of the clan or tribal organisation while totemism could do so certainly it could but as in many regions america australia we find totemism and the belief in a benevolent supreme being coexisting among savages when first observed by europeans we cannot possibly say dogmatically whether a rough monotheism or whether totemism came first in order of evolution this holds as good of israel if once totemistic as it does of pawnees or kurnai stade has overlooked these wellknown facts and his opinion filters into a cheap handbook and is set in examinations15  we also learn from mr oxfords popular manual of german biblical conjecture that jehovah was not represented as a loving father but as a being easily roused to wrath a thing most incident to loving fathers  again mr oxford avers that the old israelites knew no distinction between physical and moral evil the conception of jehovahs holiness had nothing moral in it p 90 this rather contradicts wellhausen in all ancient primitive peoples  religion furnishes a motive for law and morals in the case of none did it become so with such purity and power as in that of the israelites16  we began by examining mr huxleys endeavours to find traces of ancestorworship in his opinion the origin of jehovahworship among the israelites we next criticised mr spencers efforts in the same quest and the more dogmatic assertions of mr oxford and stade we now return to mr huxleys account of the evolution from ghostcult to the cult of jehovah  from the history of the witch of endor which mr huxley sees no reason to regard as other than a sincere statement of what really occurred he gathers that the witch cried out i see elohim these elohim proved to be the phantasm of the dead samuel moved by this hallucination the witch uttered a veridical premonition totally adverse to her own interests and uncommonly dangerous to her life this is psychically interesting the point however is that elohim is a term equivalent to red indian wakan fijian kahu maori or melanesian mana meaning the supernatural the vaguely powerfulin fact x this particular example of elohim was a phantasm of the dead but elohim is also used of the highest divine being therefore the highest divine being is of the same genus as a ghostso mr huxley reasons the difference which was supposed to exist between the different elohim was one of degree not of kind17  if jehovah was thus supposed to differ only in degree from the undoubtedly zoomorphic or anthropomorphic gods of the nations why is it to be assumed that he also was not thought to have a human shape he was thought to have a human shape at one time by some theorists no doubt exists on that head that however is not where we demur we demur when because an hallucination of the witch of endor probably still incompletely developed is called by her elohim therefore the highest elohim is said by mr huxley to differ from a ghost only in degree not in kind elohim or el the creative differs from a ghost in kind because he in hebrew belief never was a ghost he is immortal and without beginning  mr huxley now enforces his theory by a parallel between the religion of tonga and the religion of israel under the judges he quotes mariner18 whose statement avers that there is a supreme tongan being of his origin they had no idea rather supposing him to be eternal his name is t√°liytooboo  waittheretooboo he is a great chief from the top of the sky down to the bottom of the earth he and other original gods of his making are carefully and absolutely discriminated from the atua which are the human soul after its separation from the body all tongan gods are atua elohim but all atua are not original gods unserved by priests and unpropitiated by food or libation like the highest god t√°liytooboo the eternal of tonga he occasionally inspires the how elective king but often a how is not inspired at all by t√°liytooboo any more than saul at last was inspired by jehovah  surely there is a difference in kind between an eternal immortal god and a ghost though both are atua or both are elohimthe unknown x  many people call a ghost supernatural they also call god supernatural but the difference between a phantasm of a dead man and the deity they would admit i conceive to be a difference of kind we have shown or tried to show that the conceptions of ghost and supreme being are different not only in kind but in origin the ghost comes from and depends on the animistic theory the supreme being as originally thought of does not all gods are elohim kalou wakan all elohim kalou wakan are not gods  a ghostgod should receive food or libation mr huxley says that t√°liytooboo did so if the god like t√°liytooboo had no priest then the chief place was left vacant and was supposed to be occupied by the god himself when the first cup of kava was filled the mataboole who acted as master of the ceremonies said give it to your god and it was offered though only as a matter of form19  this is incorrect in the case of t√°liytooboo there is no cup filled for the god20 before any cup is filled the man by the side of the bowl says the kava is in the cup which it is not and the mataboole answers give it to your god but the kava is not in the cup and the tongan eternal receives no oblation  the sacrifice says mr huxley meant that the god was either a deified ghost or at any rate a being of like nature to these21 but as t√°liytooboo had no sacrifice contrary to mr huxleys averment he was not a deified ghost or a being of like nature to these to the lower nonghostly tongan gods the animistic habit of sacrifice had been extended but not yet to the supreme being  ah if mr gladstone or the duke of argyll or some bishop had made a misstatement of this kind how mr huxley would have crushed him but it is a mere error of careless reading such as we all make daily  it is manifest that we cannot prove jehovah to be a ghost by the parallel of a tongan god who by ritual and by definition was not a ghost the proof therefore rests on the anthropomorphised preprophetic accounts and on the ritual of jehovah but man naturally anthropises his deities he does not thereby demonstrate that they were once ghosts  as regards the sacrifices to jehovah the sweet savour which he was supposed to enjoy contrary to the opinion of the prophets these sacrifices afford the best presumption that jehovah was a ghostgod or a god constructed on ghostly lines  but we have shown that among the lowest races neither are ghosts worshipped by sacrifice nor does the supreme being darumulun or puluga receive food offerings we have also instanced many supreme beings of more advanced races ahone and dendid and nyankupon who do not sniff the savour of any offerings if then as in the case of taaroa a supreme being does receive sacrifice we may argue that a piece of animistic ritual not connected with the supreme being in australia or andaman not connected with his creed in virginia or africa where ghostgods do receive sacrifice may in other regions be transferred from ghostgods to the supreme being who never was a ghost there seems to be nothing incredible or illogical in the theory of such transference  on a god who never was a ghost men may come to confer sacrifices which are not made to baiame and the rest because being in the habit of thus propitiating one set of bodiless powers men may not think it civil or safe to leave another set of powers out by his very nature man must clothe all gods with some human passions and attributes unless like a large number of savages he leaves his high god severely alone and is the slave of fetishes and spectres but that practice makes against the ghosttheory  in the attempt to account thus namely by transference for the sacrifices to jehovah we are met by a difficulty of our own making if the israelites did not sacrifice to ancestors as we have shown that there is very scant reason for supposing that they did how could they transfer to jehovah the rite which by our hypothesis they are not proved to have offered to ancestors  this is certainly a hard problem harder or perhaps easier because we know so very little of the early history of the hebrews according to their own traditions israel had been in touch with all manner of races much more advanced than themselves in material culture and steeped in highly developed polytheistic animism according to their history the israelites went awhoring incorrigibly after strange gods it is impossible perhaps to disentangle the foreign and the native elements  it may therefore be tentatively suggested that early israel had its ahone in a being perhaps not yet named jehovah israel entertained however perhaps by reason of nomadic habits only the scantiest concern about ancestral ghosts we then find an historical tradition of secular contact between israel and egypt from which israel emerges with jehovah for god and a system of sacrifices regarding jehovah as a revived memory of the moral supreme being whom israel must have known in extremely remote ages unless israel was less favoured than australians bushmen or andamanese we might look on the sacrifices to him as an adaptation from the practices of religion among races more settled than israel and more civilised22  speculation on subjects so remote must be conjectural but our suggestion would perhaps account for sacrifices to jehovah paid by a race which by reason of nomadic habits was never much given to ancestorworship but had been in contact with great sacrificing polytheistic civilisations mr huxley however while he seems to slur the essential distinction between ghostgods and the eternal grants later that there are very few peoples without additional gods which cannot with certainty be accounted for as deified ancestors t√°liytooboo of course is one of these gods as is jehovah mr huxley gives no theory of how these gods came into belief except the suggestion that the polytheistic theology has become modified by the selection of the cosmic or tribal god as the only god to whom worship is due on the part of that nation without prejudice to the right of other nations to worship other gods23 this is monolatry and the ethical code often of a very high order comes into closer relation with the theological creed why we are not informed nor do we learn out of what polytheistic deities jehovah was selected nor for what reason the hypothesis as usual breaks down on the close relation between the ethical code and the theological creed among low savages with a relatively supreme being but without ancestorworship and without polytheistic gods from whom to select a heavenly chief  whence came the moral element in the idea of jehovah mr huxley supposes that during their residence in the land of goshen and a fortiori before it the israelites knew nothing of jehovah24 they were polytheistic idolaters this follows apparently from ezekiel xx 5 in the day when i chose israel and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of jacob and made myself known unto them in the land of egypt the biblical account is that the god of mosess fathers the god of abraham enlightened moses in sinai giving his name as i am that i am exodus iii 6 14 translation uncertain we are to understand that moses a religious reformer revived an old and in the egyptian bondage a halfobliterated creed of the ancient nomadic beniisrael they were no longer to defile themselves with the idols of egypt as they had obviously done we really know no more about the matter wellhausen says that jehovah was originally a family or tribal god either of the family of moses or of the tribe of joseph how a family could develop a supreme being all to itself we are not informed and we know of no such analogous case in the ethnographic field again jehovah was only a special name of el current within a powerful circle and who was el25 moses was not the first discoverer of the faith probably not but mr huxley seems to think that he was  wellhausens and other german ideas filter into popular traditions as we saw through a short introduction to the history of ancient israel pp 19 20 by the rev aw oxford ma vicar of st lukes soho here follows mr oxfords undeniably short way with jehovah moses was the founder of the israelite religion jehovah his family or tribal god perhaps originally the god of the kenites was taken as a tribal god by all the israelite tribes that jehovah was not the original god of israel as the bible impudently alleges but was the god of the kenites we see mainly from deut xxxiii 2 judges v 4 5 and from the history of jethro who according to judges i 16 was a kenite  the first text says that according to moses the lord came from sinai rose up from seir and shone from mount paran the second text mentions jehovahs going up out of seir and sinai the third text says that jethro mosess kenite or midianite fatherinlaw dwelt among the people of judah jethro being a priest of midian how all this proves that moses was a great impostor as the poet says and that jehovah was not the original god of israel but 1 mosess family or tribal god or 2 the god of the kenites i profess my inability to comprehend  wellhausen himself had explained jehovah as a family or tribal god either of the family of moses tribe of levi or of the tribe of joseph it seems to be all one to mr oxford whether jehovah was a god of mosess tribe or quite the reverse a kenite god yet it really makes a good deal of difference for in a complex of tribes speaking one language it is to the last degree unexampled within my knowledge that one tribe or family possesses all to itself a family god who is also the creator and is later accepted as such by all the other tribes one may ask for instances of such a thing in any known race in any stage of culture peru will not help usnot the creator pachacamac but the sun is the god of the inca family if on the other hand jehovah was a kenite god the kenites were a halfarab semitic people connected with israel and may very well have retained traditions of a supreme being which in egypt were likely to be dimmed as exodus asserts by foreign religions the learned stade to be sure may disbelieve in israels sojourn in egypt but that revolutionary opinion is not necessarily binding on us and involves a few difficulties  have critics and manualmakers no knowledge of the science of comparative religion are they unaware that peoples infinitely more backward than israel was at the date supposed have already moral supreme beings acknowledged over vast tracts of territory have they a tittle of positive evidence that early israel was benighted beyond the darkness of bushmen andamanese pawnees blackfeet hurons indians of british guiana dinkas negroes and so forth unless israel had this rare illluck which israel denies of course israel must have had a secular tradition however dim of a supreme being we must ask for a single instance of a family or tribe in a complex of semibarbaric but not savage tribes of one speech owning a private deity who happened to be the maker and ruler of the world and as such was accepted by all the tribes jehovah came out from sinai because there having been a theophany at sinai that mountain was regarded as one of his seats26  we have seen that it seemed to make no difference to mr oxford whether jehovah was a god of mosess family or tribe or a kenite god the former with the alternative of josephs family or tribal god is wellhausens theory the latter is stades27 each is inconsistent with the other wellhausens fancy is inconsistent with all that we know of religious development stades is hopelessly inconsistent with exodus iv 2426 where mosess kenite wife reproaches him for a ceremony of his not of her religion therefore the kenite differed from the hebrew sacra  the passage is very extraordinary and is said by critics to be very archaic after the revelation of the burning bush jehovah met moses and his kenite wife zipporah and their child at a khan jehovah was anxious to slay moses nobody ever knew why so zipporah appeased jehovahs wrath by circumcising her boy with a flint a bloody husband art thou to me she said because of the circumcisionan egyptian but clearly not a kenite practice whatever all this may mean it does not look as if zipporah expected such rites as circumcision in the faith of a kenite husband nor does it favour the idea that the sacra of moses were of kenite origin  without being a scholar or an expert in biblical criticism one may protest against the presentation to the manualreading intellectual middle classes of a theory so vague contradictory and by all analogy so impossible as mr oxford collects from german writers of course the whole subject so dogmatically handled is mere matter of dissentient opinion among scholars thus m renan derives the name of jehovah from assyria from aramaised chaldaeanism28 in that case the name was long anterior to the residence in egypt but again perhaps jehovah was a local god of sinai or a provincial deity in palestine29 he was known to very ancient sages who preferred such names as el shaddai and elohim in short we have no certainty on the subject30  i need hardly say perhaps that i have no antiquated prejudice against biblical criticism assuredly the bible must be studied like any other collection of documents linguistically historically and in the light of the comparative method the leading ideas of wellhausen for example are conspicuous for acumen the humblest layman can see that but one may protest against criticising the bible or homer by methods like those which prove shakspeare to have been bacon one must protest too against the presentation of inconsistent and probably baseless critical hypotheses in the dogmatic brevity of cheap handbooks  yet again whence comes the moral element in jehovah mr huxley thinks that it possibly came from the ethical practice and theory of egypt in the egyptian book of the dead a sort of guide to spirit land there are moral chapters the ghost tells his judges in amenti what sins he has not committed many of these sins are forbidden in the ten commandments  they are just as much forbidden in the nascent morality of savage peoples moses did not need the book of the dead to teach him elementary morals from the mysteries of mtanga he might have learned also had he been present the virtue of unselfish generosity if the creed of jehovah or of el retained only as much of ethics as is under divine sanction among the kurnai adaptation from the book of the dead was superfluous  the care for the departed the ritual of the ka the intense preoccupation with the future life which far more than its morality are the essential characteristics of the book of the deadisrael cared for none of these animistic things brought none of these or very little of these out of the land of egypt moses was certainly very eclectic he took only the morality of egypt but as mr huxley advances this opinion tentatively as having no secure historical authority about moses it hardly answers our question whence came the moral element in jehovah one may surmise that it was the survival of the primitive divinely sanctioned ethics of the ancient savage ancestors of the israelite known to them as to the kurnai before they had a pot or a bronze knife or seed to sow or sheep to herd or even a tent over their heads in the counsels of eternity israel was chosen to keep burning however obscured with smoke of sacrifice that flame which illumines the darkest places of the earth a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israela flame how litten a light whence shining history cannot inform us and anthropology can but conjecture here scientific nescience is wiser than the cocksureness of popular science with her ghosts and fetishstones and gods that sprang from ghosts which ghosts however could not be developed owing to nomadic habits  it appears then if our general suggestion meets with any acceptance that what occurred in the development of hebrew religion was precisely what the bible tells us did occur this must necessarily seem highly paradoxical to our generation but the whole trend of our provisional system makes in favour of the paradox if savage nomadic israel had the higher religious conceptions proved to exist among several of the lowest known races these conceptions might be revived by a leader of genius they might in a crisis of tribal fortunes become the rallying point of a new national sentiment obscured in some degree by acquaintance with the idols of egypt and restricted and localised by the very national sentiment which they fostered these conceptions were purified and widened far beyond any local tribal or national restrictionswidened far as the flammantia moenia mundiby the historically unique genius of the prophets blended with the doctrine of our lord and recommended by the addition of animism in its pure and priceless formthe reward of faith hope and charity in eternal lifethe faith of israel enlightened the world  all this is precisely what occurred according to the old and new testaments all this is just what on our hypothesis might be expected to occur if out of the many races which in their most backward culture had a rude conception of a moral creative being relatively supreme one race endured the education of israel showed the comparative indifference of israel to animism and ghostgods listened to the prophets of israel and gave birth to a greater than moses and the prophets  to this result the logos as socrates says has led us by the path of anthropology  footnote 1 science and

view the conception of a supreme or practically supreme being from the lowest stages of human culture up to christianity in polytheism that conception is necessarily obscured showing itself dimly either in the prytanis or president of the immortals such as zeus or in fate behind and above the immortals or in mr max m√ºllers henotheism where the god addressedindra or soma or agniis for the moment envisaged as supreme and is adored in something like a monotheistic spirit or finally in the etherealised deity of advanced philosophic speculation  it has not been necessary for our purpose to dwell on these civilised religions granting our hypothesis of an early supreme being among savages obscured later by ancestorworship and ghostgods but not often absolutely lost to religious tradition the barbaric and the civilised polytheisms easily take their position in line and are easily intelligible space forbids a discussion of all known religions only typical specimens have been selected thus nothing has been said of the religion of the great chinese empire it appears to consist on its higher plane of the worship of heaven as a great fetishgoda worship which may well have begun in days as dr brinton says long ere man had asked himself are the heavens material and god spiritualperhaps for all we know before the idea of spirit had been evolved thus if it contains nothing more august the chinese religion is so far beneath that of the zu√±is or the creed in taaroa in beings who are eternal who were before earth was or sky was the chinese religion of heaven is also coloured by chinese political conditions heaven tien corresponds to the emperor and tends to be confounded with shangti the emperor above dr legge charges confucius says mr tylor with an inclination to substitute in his religious teaching the name of tien heaven for that known to more ancient religion and used in more ancient booksshangti the personal ruling deity if so china too has its ancient supreme being who is not a divinised aspect of nature  but mr tylors reading in harmony with his general theory is different  it seems rather that the sage was in fact upholding the tradition of the ancient faith thus acting according to the character on which he prided himselfthat of a transmitter not a maker a preserver of old knowledge not a new revealer1  this of course is purely a question of evidence to be settled by sinologists if the personal supreme being shangti occupies in older documents the situation held by tien heaven in confuciuss later system why are we to say that confucius by putting forward heaven in place of shangti was restoring an older conception mr tylors affection for his theory leads him perhaps to that opinion while my affection for my theory leads me to prefer documentary evidence in its favour  the question can only be settled by specialists as matters stand it seems to me probable that ancient china possessed a supreme personal being more remote and original than heaven just as the zu√±is do on the lower plane chinese religion is overrun as everyone knows by animism and ancestorworship this is so powerful that it has given rise to a native theory of euhemerism the departmental deities of chinese polytheism are explained by the chinese on euhemeristic principles  according to legend the war god or military sage was once in human life a distinguished soldier the swine god was a hogbreeder who lost his pigs and died of sorrow the god of gamblers was un d√©cav√©2  these are not statements of fact but of chinese euhemeristic theory on that hypothesis confucius should now be a god but of course he is not his spirit is merely localised in his temple where the emperor worships him twice a year as ancestral spirits are worshipped  every theorist will force facts into harmony with his system but i do not see that the chinese facts are contrary to mine on the highest plane is either a personal supreme being shangti or there is tien heaven with earth parent of men neither of them necessarily owing in origin anything to animism then there is the political reflection of the emperor on religion which cannot exist where there is no emperor king or chief and therefore must be late there is the animistic rabble of spirits ancestral or not and there is departmental polytheism the spirits are of course fed and furnished by men in the usual symbolical way nothing shows or hints that shangti is merely an imaginary idealised first ancestor indeed about all such explanations of the supreme being say among the kurnai as an idealised imaginary first ancestor m r√©ville justly observes as follows not only have we seen that in wide regions of the uncivilised world the worship of ancestors has invaded a domain previously occupied by naturism and animism properly so called that it is therefore posterior to these but farther we do not understand in mr spencers system why in so many places the first ancestor is the maker if not the creator of the world master of life and death and possessor of divine powers not held by any of his descendants this proves that it was not the first ancestor who became god in the belief of his descendants but much rather the divine maker and beginner of all who in the creed of his adorers became the first ancestor3  our task has been limited in this way mainly to examination of the religion of some of the very lowest races and of the highest worldreligions such as judaism the historical aspect of christianity as arising in the life death and resurrection of our lord would demand a separate treatise this would in part be concerned with the attempts to find in the narratives concerning our lord a large admixture of the mythology and ritual connected with the sacrificed rex nemorensis and whatever else survives in peasant folklore of spring and harvest4  after these apologies for the limitations of this essay we may survey the backward track we began by showing that savages may stumble and have stumbled on theories not inconsistent with science but not till recently discovered by science the electric origin of the aurora borealis whether absolutely certain or not was an example another was the efficacy of suggestion especially for curative purposes it was therefore hinted that if savages blundered if you please into a belief in god and the soul however obscurely envisaged these beliefs were not therefore necessarily and essentially false we then stated our purpose of examining the alleged supernormal phenomena savage or civilised which on mr tylors hypothesis help to originate the conception of spirits we defended the nature of our evidence as before anthropologists by showing that for the savage belief in the supernormal phenomena we have exactly the kind of evidence on which all anthropological science reposes the relative weakness of that evidence our need of more and better evidence we would be the very last to deny indeed it is part of our case our existing evidence will hardly support any theory of religion anyone who is in doubt on that head has only to read m r√©villes les religions des peuples noncivilis√©s under the heads m√©lan√©siens mincopies les australiens ii 116143 when he will observe that this eminent french authority is ignorant of the facts about these races here produced in 1883 they had not come within his ken such minute and careful inquiries by men closely intimate with the peoples concerned as dr codringtons mr hewitts mr mans and the authorities compiled by mr brough smyth were unfamiliar to m r√©ville thus in turn new facts or facts unknown to us may upset my theory this peril is of the essence of scientific theorising on the history of religion  having thus justified our evidence for the savage belief in supernormal phenomena as before anthropologists we turned to a court of psychologists in defence of our evidence for the fact of exactly the same supernormal phenomena in civilised experience we pointed out that for subjective psychological experiences say of telepathy we had precisely the same evidence as all nonexperimental psychology must and does rest upon nay we have even experimental evidence in experiments in thoughttransference we have chiefly however statements of subjective experience for the coincidence of such experience with unknown events we have such evidence as in practical life is admitted by courts of law  experimental psychology of course relies on experiments conducted under the eyes of the expert for example by hypnotism or otherwise under dr hack tuke professor james m richet m janet the evidence is the conduct rather than the statements of the subject there is also physiological experiment by vivisection i regret to say and postmortem dissection but nonexperimental psychology reposes on the selfexamination of the student and on the statements of psychological experiences made to him by persons whom he thinks he can trust the psychologist however if he be as mr galton says unimaginative in the strict but unusual sense of that ambiguous word needs mr galtons word of warning he is asked to resist a too frequent tendency to assume that the minds of every other sane and healthy person must be like his own the psychologist should inquire into the minds of others as he should into those of animals of different races and be prepared to find much to which his own experience can afford little if any clue5 mr galton had to warn the unimaginative psychologist in this way because he was about to unfold his discovery of the faculty which presents numbers to some minds as visualised coloured numerals so vivid as to be undistinguishable from reality except by the aid of accidental circumstances  mr galton also found in his inquiries that occasional hallucinations of the sane are much more prevalent than he had supposed or than science had ever taken into account all this was entirely new to psychologists many of whom still at least many popular psychologists of the press appear to be unacquainted with the circumstances one of them informed me quite gravely that he never had an hallucination thereforehis mind being sane and healthythe inference seemed to be that no sane and healthy mind was ever hallucinated mr galton has replied to that argument his reply covers logically the whole field of psychological faculties little regarded for example by mr sully who is not exactly an imaginative psychologist  it covers the whole field of automatism as in automatic writing perhaps of the divining rod certainly of crystal visions and of occasional hallucinations as mr galton in this last case expressly declares psychologists at least need not be told that such faculties cannot any more than other human faculties be always evoked for study and experiment our evidence for these faculties and experiences then is usually of the class on which the psychologist relies but when the psychologist following leibnitz sir william hamilton and kant discusses the subconscious for example knowledge often complex and abundant unconsciously acquired we demonstrated by examples that the psychologist will contentedly repose on evidence which is not evidence at all he will swallow an undated unlocalised legend of coleridge reaching coleridge on the testimony of rumour and told at least twenty years after the unverified occurrences nay the psychologist will never dream of procuring contemporary evidence for such a monstrous statement as that an ignorant german wench unconsciously acquired and afterwards subconsciously reproduced huge cantles of dead languages by virtue of having casually heard a former master recite or read aloud from hebrew and greek books this legend do psychologists accept on no evidence at all because it illustrates a theory which is doubtless a very good theory though in this case carried to an extent imagination boggles at  here the psychologist may reply that much less evidence will content him for a fact to which he possesses at least analogies in accredited experience than for a fact say telepathic crystalgazing to which he knows in experience nothing analogous thus for the mythical german handmaid he has the analogy of languages learned in childhood or passages got up by rote being forgotten and brought back to ordinary conscious memory or delirious memory during an illness or shortly before death strong in these analogies the psychologist will venture to accept a case of language not learned but reproduced in delirious memory on no evidence at all but not possessing analogies for telepathic crystalgazing he will probably decline to examine ours  i would first draw his attention to the difference between revived memory of a language once known breton and welsh in known examples or learned by rote as greek in an anecdote of goethes and verbal reproduction of a language not known or learned by rote but overheardeach passage probably but onceas somebody recited fragments in this instance that of the mythical maid the difficulty  is that the original impressions had not the strengththat is the distinctnessof the reproduction an unknown language overheard is a mere sound6  the distinction here drawn is so great and obvious that for proof of the german girls case we need better evidence than coleridges rumour of a rumour cited as it is by hamilton maudsley carpenter du prel and the common run of manuals  not that i deny a priori the possibility of coleridges story as mr huxley says strictly speaking i am unaware of anything that has a right to the title of an impossibility except a contradiction in terms7 to the horror of some of his admirers mr huxley would not call the existence of demons and demoniacal possession impossible8 mr huxley was no blind follower of hume i too do not call coleridges tale impossible but unlike the psychologists i refuse to accept it on bardolphs security and i contrast their conduct in swallowing coleridges legend with their refusal if they do refuse to accept the evidence for the automatic writing of notconsciouslyknown languages as of eleventhcentury french poetry and prose by mr schiller or their refusal if they do refuse to look at the evidence for telepathic crystalgazing or any other supernormal exhibitions of faculty attested by living and honourable persons  i wish i saw a way for orthodox unimaginative psychology out of its dilemma  after offering to anthropologists and psychologists these considerations which i purposely reiterate we examined historically the relations of science to the marvellous showing for example how hume following his a priori theory of the impossible would have declined to investigate because they were miraculous certain occurrences which to charcot were ordinary incidents in medical experience  we next took up and criticised the anthropological theory of religion as expounded by mr tylor we then collected from his work a series of alleged supernormal phenomena in savage belief all making for the foundation of animistic religion through several chapters we pursued the study of these phenomena choosing savage instances and setting beside them civilised testimony to facts of experience our conclusion was that such civilised experiences if they occurred as they are universally said to do among savages would help to originate and would very strongly support the savage doctrine of souls the base of religion in the theory of english anthropologists but apart from the savage doctrine of spirits whether they exist or not the evidence points to the existence of human faculties not allowed for in the current systems of materialism  we next turned from the subject of supernormal experiences to the admitted facts about early religion granting the belief in souls and ghosts and spirits however attained how was the idea of a supreme being to be evolved out of that belief we showed that taking the creed as found in the lowest races the processes put forward by anthropologists could not account for its evolution the facts would not fit into but contradicted the anthropological theory the necessary social conditions postulated were not found in places where the belief is found nay the necessary social conditions for the evolution even of ancestorworship were confessedly not found where the supposed ultimate result of ancestorworship the belief in a supreme being flourished abundantly  again the belief in a supreme being ex hypothesi the latest in evolution therefore the most potent was often shelved and half forgotten or neglected or ridiculed where the belief in animism ex hypothesi the earlier was in full vigour we demonstrated by facts that anthropology had simplified her task by ignoring that essential feature the prevalent alliance of ethics with religion in the creed of the lowest and least developed races here happily we have not only the evidence of an earnest animist mr im thurn on our side but that of a distinguished semitic scholar the late mr robertson smith we see that even in its rudest forms religion was a moral force the powers that man reveres were on the side of social order and moral law and the fear of the gods was a motive to enforce the laws of society which were also the laws of morality9 wellhausen has already been cited to the same effect  however the facts proving that truth and unselfishness surely a large element of christian ethics are divinely sanctioned in savage religion are more potent than the most learned opinion on that side  our next step was to examine in detail several religions of the most remote and backward races of races least contaminated with christian or islamite teaching our evidence when possible was derived from ancient and secret tribal mysteries and sacred native hymns we found a relatively supreme being a maker sanctioning morality and unpropitiated by sacrifice among peoples who go in dread of ghosts and wizards but do not always worship ancestors we showed that the anthropological theory of the evolution of god out of ghosts in no way explains the facts in the savage conception of a supreme being we then argued that the notion of spirit derived from ghostbelief was not logically needed for the conception of a supreme being in its earliest form was detrimental to the conception and by much evidence was denied to be part of the conception the supreme being thus regarded may be though he cannot historically be shown to be prior to the first notion of ghost and separable souls  we then traced the idea of such a supreme being through the creeds of races rising in the scale of material culture demonstrating that he was thrust aside by the competition of ravenous but serviceable ghosts ghostgods and shades of kingly ancestors with their magic and their bloody rites these rites and the animistic conception behind them were next in rare cases reflected or refracted back on the supreme eternal aristocratic institutions fostered polytheism with the old supreme being obscured or superseded or enthroned as emperorgod or kinggod we saw how and in what sense the old degeneration theory could be defined and defended we observed traces of degeneration in certain archaic aspects of the faith in jehovah and we proved that given a tolerably pure low savage belief in a supreme being that belief must degenerate under social conditions as civilisation advanced next studying what we may call the restoration of jehovah under the great prophets of israel we noted that they and israel generally were strangely indifferent to that priceless aspect of animism the care for the future happiness as conditioned by the conduct of the individual soul that aspect had been neglected neither by the popular instinct nor the priestly and philosophic reflection of egypt greece and rome christianity last combined what was good in animism the care for the individual soul as an immortal spirit under eternal responsibilities with the one righteous eternal of prophetic israel and so ended the long intricate and mysterious theological education of humanity such is our theory which does not to us appear to lack evidence nor to be inconsistent as the anthropological theory is apparently inconsistent with the hypothesis of evolution  all this it must be emphatically insisted on is propounded under all reserves while these four stages say 1 the australian unpropitiated moral being 2 the african neglected being still somewhat moral 3 the relatively supreme being involved in human sacrifice as in polynesia and 4 the moral being reinstated philosophically as in israel do suggest steps in evolution we desire to base no hardandfast system of ascending and descending degrees upon our present evidence the real object is to show that facts may be regarded in this light as well as in the light thrown by the anthropological theory in the hands whether of mr tylor mr spencer m r√©ville or mr jevons whose interesting work comes nearest to our provisional hypothesis  we only ask for suspense of judgment and for hesitation in accepting the dogmas of modern manual makers an exception to them certainly appears to be mr clodd if we may safely attribute to him a review signed c of mr grant allens evolution of the idea of god  we fear that all our speculations will remain summaries of probabilities no documents are extant to enlighten us we have only mobile complex and confused ideas incarnate in eccentric often contradictory theories that this character attaches to such ideas should keep us on guard against framing theories whose symmetry is sometimes their condemnation daily chronicle december 10 1897  nothing excites my own suspicion of my provisional hypothesis more than its symmetry it really seems to fit the facts as they appear to me too neatly i would suggest however that ancient savage sacred hymns and practices in the mysteries are really rather of the nature of documents more so at least than the casual observations of some travellers or the gossip extracted from natives much in contact with europeans  supposing that the arguments in this essay met with some acceptance what effect would they have if any on our thoughts about religion what is their practical tendency the least dubious effect would be i hope to prevent us from accepting the anthropological theory of religion or any other theory as a foregone conclusion i have tried to show how dim is our knowledge how weak often is our evidence and that finding among the lowest savages all the elements of all religions already developed in different degrees we cannot historically say that one is earlier than another this point of priority we can never historically settle if we met savages with ghosts and no gods we could not be sure but that they once possessed a god and forgot him if we met savages with a god and no ghosts we could not be historically certain that a higher had not obliterated a lower creed for these reasons dogmatic decisions about the origin of religion seem unworthy of science they will appear yet more futile to any student who goes so far with me as to doubt whether the highest gods of the lowest races could be developed or can be shown to have been developed by way of the ghosttheory to him who reaches this point the whole animistic doctrine of ghosts as the one germ of religion will appear to be imperilled the main practical result then will be hesitation about accepting the latest scientific opinion even when backed by great names and published in little primers  on the hypothesis here offered to criticism there are two chief sources of religion 1 the belief how attained we know not10 in a powerful moral eternal omniscient father and judge of men 2 the belief probably developed out of experiences normal and supernormal in somewhat of man which may survive the grave this second belief is not logically needed as given material for the first in its apparently earliest form it may for all we know be the later of the two beliefs chronologically but this belief too was necessary to religion first as finally supplying a formula by which advancing intellects could conceive of the mighty being involved in the former creed next as elevating mans conception of his own nature by the second belief he becomes the child of the god in whom perhaps he already trusted and in whom he has his being a being not destined to perish with the death of the body man is thus not only the child but the heir of god a nurseling of immortality capable of entering into eternal life on the moral influence of this belief it is superfluous to dwell  from the most backward races historically known to us to those of our own status all have been more or less washed by the waters of this double stream of religion the hebrews as far as our information goes were chiefly influenced by the first belief the faith in the eternal and had comparatively slight interest in whatever posthumous fortunes might await individual souls other civilised peoples say the greeks extended the second or animistic theory into forms of beautiful fantasy the material of art yet both in greece and rome as we learn from the republic books i iii of plato and from the whole scope of the poem of lucretius and from the painted porch at delphi answering to the frescoes of the pisan campo santo there existed among the people what was unknown to the hebrews an extreme anxiety about the posthumous fortunes and possible punishment of the individual soul a kind of pardoners and indulgencesellers made a living out of that anxiety in greece for the greek pardoners who testify to an interest in the future happiness of the soul not found in israel mr jevons may be cited  the agyrtes professed by means of his rites to purify men from the sins they had themselves committed  and so to secure to those whom he purified an exemption from the evil lot in the next world which awaited those who were not initiated a magic mirror crystalgazing was among his properties11  in egypt a moral life did not suffice to secure immortal reward there was also required knowledge of the spells that baffle the demons who in amenti as in the red indian and polynesian hades lie in wait for souls that knowledge was contained in copies of the book of the deadthe gagnepain of priests and scribes  early israel having as far as we know a singular lack of interest in the future of the soul was born to give himself up to developing undisturbed the theistic conception the belief in a righteous eternal  polytheism everywherein greece especiallyheld of the animistic conception with its freakish corruptible deities greek philosophy could hardly restore that eternal for whom the prophets battled in israel whom some of the lowest savages know and fear whom the animistic theory or cult everywhere obscures with its crowd of hungry cruel interested foodpropitiated ghostgods in the religion of our lord and the apostles the two currents of faith in one righteous god and care for the individual soul were purified and combined god is a spirit and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth man also is a spirit and as such is in the hands of a god not to be propitiated by mans sacrifice or monks ritual we know how this doctrine was again disturbed by the animism in effect and by the sacrifice and ritual of the mediaeval church too eager to be all things to all men the august and beneficent mother of christendom readmitted the earlier animism in new forms of saintworship pilgrimage and popular ceremonialthings apart from but commonly supposed to be substitutes for righteousness of life and the selflessness enjoined in savage mysteries for the softness no less than for the hardness of mens hearts these things were ordained such as masses for the beloved dead  modern thought has deanthropomorphised what was left of anthropomorphic in religion and in the end has left us for god at most a stream of tendency making for righteousness or an energy unknown and unknowablethe ghost of a ghost for the soul by virtue of his belief in which man raised himself in his own esteem and more or less in ethical standing is left to us a negation or a wistful doubt  to this part of modern scientific teaching the earlier position of this essay suggests a demurrer by aid of the tradition of and belief in supernormal phenomena among the low races by attested phenomena of the same kinds of experience among the higher races i have ventured to try to suggest that we are not merely brain that man has his part we know not how in we know not whathas faculties and vision scarcely conditioned by the limits of his normal purview the evidence of all this deals with matters often trivial like the electric sparks rubbed from the deers hide which yet are cognate with an illimitable essential potency of the universe not being able to explain away these facts or in this place to offer what would necessarily be a premature theory of them i regard them though they seem shadowy as grounds of hope or at least as tokens that men need not yet despair not now for the first time have weak things of the earth been chosen to confound things strong nor have men of this opinion been always the weakest not among the feeblest are socrates pascal napoleon cromwell charles gordon st theresa and jeanne darc  i am perfectly aware that the superstitiousness of the earlier part of this essay must injure any effect which the argument of the latter part might possibly produce on critical opinion yet that argument in no way depends on what we think about the phenomenanormal supernormal or illusoryon which the theory of ghost soul or spirit may have been based it exhibits religion as probably beginning in a kind of theism which is then superseded in some degree or even corrupted by animism in all its varieties finally the exclusive theism of israel receives its complement in a purified animism and emerges as christianity  quite apart too from any favourable conclusion which may by some be drawn from the phenomena and quite apart from the more general opinion that all modern instances are compact of imposture malobservation mythopoeic memory and superstitious bias the systematic comparison of civilised and savage beliefs and alleged experiences of this kind cannot wisely be neglected by anthropology humani nihil a se alienum putat

frogs 159     appendices  appendix a  oppositions of science  the most elaborate reply to the arguments for telepathy based on the report of the census of hallucinations is that of herr parish in his hallucinations and illusions1  herr parish is at present opposed to the theory that the census establishes a telepathic cause in the socalled coincidental stories put forward as he says with due reserve and based on an astonishing mass of materials to some extent critically handled  he first demurs to an allowance of twelve hours for the coincidence of hallucination and death but if we reflect that twelve hours is little even in a year coincidences within twelve hours it may be admitted donnent √† penser even if we reject the theory that granted a real telepathic impact it may need time and quiet for its development into a complete hallucination we need not linger over the very queer cases from munich as these are not in the selected thirty of the report herr parish then dwells on that hallucination of memory in which we feel as if everything that is going on had happened before it may have occurred to most of us to be reminded by some association of ideas during the day of some dream of the previous night which we had forgotten for instance looking at a brook from a bridge and thinking of how i would fish it i remembered that i had dreamed on the previous night of casting a fly for practice on a lawn nobody would think of disputing the fact that i really had such a dream forgot it and remembered it when reminded of it by association of ideas but if the forgotten dream had been fulfilled and been recalled to memory only in the moment of fulfilment science would deny that i ever had such a dream at all the alleged dream would be described as an hallucination of memory something occurring it would be said i had the not very unusual sensation this has occurred to me before and the sensation would become a false memory that it had occurredin a dream this theory will be advanced i think not when an ordinary dream is recalled by a waking experience but only when the dream coincides with and foreruns that experience which is a thing that dreams have no business to do such coincidental dreams are necessarily false memories scientifically speaking now how does this theory of false memory bear on coincidental hallucinations  the insane it seems are apt to have the false memory this occurred before and then to say that the event was revealed to them in a vision2 the insane may be recommended to make a note of the vision and have it properly attested before the event the same remark applies to the presentiments of the sane but it does not apply if jones tells me i saw my great aunt last night and if news comes after this remark that joness aunt died on that night in timbuctoo yet herr parish p 282 seems to think that the argument of fallacious memory comes in part even when an hallucination has been reported to another person before its fulfilment of course all depends on the veracity of the narrator and the person to whom he told his tale to take a case given3 brown say travelling with his wife dreams that a mad dog bit his boy at home on the elbow he tells his wife arriving at home brown finds that it was so herr parish appears to argue thus  brown dreamed nothing at all but he gets excited when he hears the bad news at home he thinks by false memory that he has a recollection of it he says to his wife my dear didnt i tell you last night i had dreamed all this and his equally excited wife replies true my brown you did and i said it was only one of your dreams and both now believe that the dream occurred this is very plausible is it not only science would not say anything about it if the dream had not been fulfilledif brown had remarked egad my dear seeing that horse reminds me that i was dreaming last night of driving in a dogcart for then brown was not excited  none of this exquisite reasoning as to dreams applies to waking hallucinations reported before the alleged coincidence unless we accept a collective hallucination of memory in seer or seers and also in the persons to whom their story was told  but it is obvious memory is apt to become mythopoeic so far as to exaggerate closeness of coincidence and to add romantic details we do not need herr parish to tell us that we meet the circumstance in all narratives from memory whatever the topic even in herr parishs own writings  we must admit that the public in ghostly as in all narratives on all topics is given to fanciful addenda therefore as herr parish justly remarks we should maintain a very sceptical attitude to all accounts of veridical hallucinations not that we should dismiss them as old wives fablesan all too common methodor even doubt the narrators good faith we should treat them like tales of big fish that get away sometimes there is good corroborative evidence that they really were big fish sometimes not we shall return to these false memories  was there a coincidence at all in the societys cases printed in the census herr parish thinks three of the selected twentysix cases very dubious in one case is a possible margin of four days another wrongly numbered by the way does not occur at all among the twentysix in the third herr parish is wrong in his statement4 this is a lovely example of the sceptical slipshod and accompanied by the miscitation of the second case shows that inexactitude is not all on the side of the seers however the case is not very good the two percipients fancying that the date of the event was less remote than it really was unluckily herr parish only criticises these three cases how accurately we have remarked he had no room for more  herr parish next censures the probable selection of good cases by collectors on which the editors of the census have already made observations as they have also made large allowances for this cause of error he then offers the astonishing statement that in the view of the english authors a view which is of course assumed in all calculations of the kind an hallucination persists equally long in the memory and is equally readily recalled in reply to a question whether the experience made but a slight impression on the percipient or affected him deeply as would be the case for instance if the hallucination had been found to coincide with the death of a near relative or friend5 this assertion of herr parishs is so erroneous that the report expressly says as years recede into the distance the proportion of the hallucinations that are remembered in them to those which are forgotten or at least ignored is very large again hallucinations of the most impressive class will not only be better remembered than others but will we may reasonably suppose be more often mentioned by the percipients to their friends6  yet herr parish avers that in all calculations it is assumed that hallucinations are equally readily recalled whether impressive or not once more the report says p 246 it is not the case that coincidental and impressive hallucinations are as easily subject to oblivion as noncoincidental and nonimpressive ones the editors therefore multiply the noncoincidental cases by four arguing that no coincidental cases hits are forgotten while three out of four noncoincidentals misses are forgotten or may be supposed likely to be forgotten immediately after declaring that the english authors suppose all hallucinations to be equally well remembered which is the precise reverse of what they do say herr parish admits that the authors multiply the misses by four influenced by other considerations p 289 by what other considerations they give their reason that very reason which they decline to entertain says herr parish namely that misses are four times as likely to be forgotten as hits to go into the reason for adopting this plan would lead us too far he writes why it is the very reason which he says does not find favour with the english authors  how curiously remote from being coincidental with plain facts or veridical at all is this scientific criticism herr parish says that a view which does not exist is of course assumed in all calculations and on the very same page he says that it is not assumed the witnesses of the reportinfluenced it is true by other considerations which is not the case have sought to turn the point of this objection by multiplying the whole number of noncoincidental cases by four then the view is not assumed in all calculations as herr parish has just asserted  what led herr parish an honourable and clearheaded critic into this maze of incorrect and contradictory assertions it is interesting to try to trace the causes of such nonveridical illusions to find the points de rep√®re of these literary hallucinations one may suggest that when herr parish recast the chapters of his german edition as he says in his preface to the english version he accidentally left in a passage based on an earlier paper by mr gurney7 not observing that it was no longer accurate or appropriate  after this odd passage herr parish argues that a veridical hallucination is regarded by the english authors as coincidental even when external circumstances have made that very hallucination a probable occurrence by producing tension of the corresponding nerve element groups that is to say a person is in a conditiona nervous condition likely a priori to beget an hallucination an hallucination is begotten quite naturally and so if it happens to coincide with an event the coincidence should not countit is purely fortuitous8  here is an example a lady facing an old sideboard saw a friend with no coat on and in a waistcoat with a back of shiny material within an hour she was taken to where her friend lay dying without a coat and in a waistcoat with a shiny back9 here is the scientific explanation of herr parish the shimmer of a reflecting surface the sideboard formed the occasion for the hallucinatory emergence of a subconsciously perceived shiny black waistcoat quotation incorrect of course and an individual subconsciously associated with that impression10 i ask any lady whether she consciously or subconsciously associates the men she knows with the backs of their waistcoats herr parishs would be a brilliantly satisfactory explanation if it were only true to the printed words that lay under his eyes when he wrote there was no shiny black waistcoat in the case but a waistcoat with a shiny back gentlemen and especially old gentlemen who go about in bathchairs like the man in this story dont habitually take off their coats and show the backs of their waistcoats to ladies of nineteen in england and if herr parish had cared to read his case he would have found it expressly stated that the lady had never seen the man without his coat and so could not associate him with an impression of a shiny back to his waistcoat till after the hallucination when she saw him coatless on his deathbed in this instance herr parish had an hallucinatory memory all wrong of the page under his eyes the case is got rid of then by aid of the fanciful addenda to which herr parish justly objects he first gives the facts incorrectly and then explains an occurrence which as reported by him did not occur and was not asserted to occur  i confess that if herr parishs version were as correct as it is essentially inaccurate his explanation would leave me doubtful for the circumstances were that the old gentleman of the story lunched daily with the young ladys mother suppose that she was familiar which she was not with the shiny back of his waistcoat still she saw him daily and daily too was in the way of seeing the hypothetically shiny surface of the sideboard that being the case she had every day the materials subjective and objective of the hallucination yet it only occurred once and then it precisely coincided with the death agony of the old gentleman and with his coatless condition why only that once cest l√† le miracle how much for this little veskit as the man asked david copperfield  herr parish next invents a cause for an hallucination which i myself think ought not to have been reckoned because the percipient had been sitting up with the sick man this he would class as a suspicious case but even granting him his own way of handling the statistics he would still have far too large a proportion of coincidences for the laws of chance to allow if we are to go by these statistics at all  his next argument practically is that hallucinations are always only a kind of dreams11 he proves this by the large number of coincidental hallucinations which occurred in sleepy circumstances one man went to bed early and woke up early another was roused from sleep two ladies were sitting up in bed giving their babies nourishment a man was reading a newspaper on a sofa a lady was lying awake at seven in the morning and there are eight other english cases of people awake in bed during an hallucination now in dr parishs opinion we must argue that they were not awake or not much so the hallucinations were mere dreams dreams are so numerous that coincidences in dreams can be got rid of as pure flukes people may say to be sure i am used to dreams and dont regard them this was something solitary in my experience but we must not mind what people say  yet i fear we must mind what they say at least we must remember that sleeping dreams are of all things most easily forgotten while a fullbodied hallucination when we at least believe ourselves awake seems to us on a perfectly different plane of impressiveness and experto crede is really very difficult to forget herr parish cannot be allowed therefore to use the regular eighteenthcentury argument all dreams for the two sorts of dreams in sleep and in apparent wakefulness seem to the subject to differ in kind and they really do differ in kind it is the essence of the every night dream that we are unconscious of our actual surroundings and conscious of a fantastic environment it is the essence of wideawakeness to be conscious of our actual surroundings in the ordinary dream nothing actual competes with its visions when we are conscious of our surroundings everything actual does compete with any hallucination therefore an hallucination which when we are conscious of our material environment does compete with it in reality is different in kind from an ordinary dream science gains nothing by arbitrarily declaring that two experiences so radically different are identical anybody would see this if he were not arguing under a dominant idea  herr parish next contends that people who see pictures in crystal balls and so on are not so wide awake as to be in their normal consciousness there is dissociation practically drowsiness even if only a little herr moll also speaks of crystalgazing pictures as hypnotic phenomena12 possibly neither of these learned men has ever seen a person attempt crystalgazing herr parish never asserts any such personal experience as the basis of his opinion about the nonnormal state of the gazer he reaches this conclusion from an anecdote reported as a not unfamiliar phenomenon by a friend of miss x but the phenomenon occurred when miss x was not crystalgazing at all she was looking out of a window in a brown study this is a noble example of logic some one says that miss x was not in her normal consciousness on a certain occasion when she was not crystalgazing and that this condition is familiar to the observer therefore argues herr parish nobody is in his normal consciousness when he is crystalgazing  in vain may so good an observer as miss x think herself fully awake as she does think herself when crystalgazing because once when she happened to have her eyes fixed on the window her expression was associated by a friend with something uncanny and she afterwards spoke in a dreamy faraway tone p 297 miss x though extremely wide awake may have looked dreamily at a window and may have seen mountains and marvels but the point is that she was not voluntarily gazing at a crystal for amusement or experimentperhaps trying to see how a microscope affected the picturesor to divert a friend  i appeal to the shades of aristotle and bacon against scientific logic in the hands of herr parish here is his syllogism    a is occasionally dreamy when not crystalgazing   a is human   therefore every human being when crystalgazing is more or less   asleep  he infers a general affirmative from a single affirmative which happens not to be to the point it is exactly as if herr parish argued    mrs b spends hours in shopping   mrs b is human   therefore every human being is always late for dinner  miss x i think uplifted her voice in some review and maintained that when crystalgazing she was quite in her normal state dans son assiette  yet herr parish would probably say to any crystalgazer who argued thus oh no pardon me you were not wholly awakeyou were adream i know better than you but as he has not seen crystalgazers while i have many scores of times i prefer my own opinion and so as this assertion about the percipients being dissociated or asleep or not awake is certainly untrue of all crystalgazers in my considerable experience i cannot accept it on the authority of herr parish who makes no claim to any personal experience at all  as to crystalgazing when the gazer is talking laughing chatting making experiments in turning the ball changing the light using prisms and magnifyingglasses dropping matches into the waterjug and so on how can we possibly say that it is impossible to distinguish between waking hallucinations and those of sleep p 300 if so it is impossible to distinguish between sleeping and waking altogether we are all like the dormouse herr parish is reasoning here a priori without any personal knowledge of the facts and above all he is under the dominant idea of his own theorythat of dissociation  herr parish next crushes telepathy by an argument whichlike one of the reasons why the bells were not rung for queen elizabeth namely that there were no bells to ringmight have come first and alone we are told in italicsvery impressive to the popular mind no matter how great the number of coincidences they afford not even the shadow of a proof for telepathy p 301 what not even if all hallucinations or ninetynine per cent coincided with the death of the person seen in heavens name why not why because the weightiest cause of all has been omitted from our calculations namely our good old friend the association of ideas p 302 our side cannot prove the absence italics of the association of ideas certainly we cannot but ideas in endless millions are being associated all day long a hundred thousand different unnoticed associations may bring jones to my mind or brown but i dont therefore see brown or jones who is not there still less do i see dr parish or nebuchadnezzar or a monkey or a salmon or a golf ball or arthurs seat all of which may be brought to my mind by association of ideas when they are not present  suppose then that once in my life i see the absent jones who dies in that hour or within twelve hours i am puzzled why did association choose that day of all days in my life for her solitary freak and if this choice of freaks by association occurs among other people say two hundred times more often than chance allows the freak begins to suggest that it may have a cause  not even the circumstance cited by herr parish that a drowsy tailor sewing on in a dream poor fellow saw a client in his shop while the client was dying solves the problem the tailor is not said even once to have seen a customer who was not dying yet he writes i was accustomed to work all night frequently the tailor thinks he was asleep because he had been making irregular stitches and perhaps he was but out of all his vigils and all his customers association only formed one hallucination and that was of a dying client whom he supposed to be perfectly well why on earth is association so fond of dying people granting the statistics which are another story the explanation explains nothing herr parish only moves the difficulty back a step and as we cannot live without association of ideas they are taken for granted by our side association of ideas does not cause hallucinations as mrs sidgwick remarks though it may determine their contents  the difficult theme of coincidental collective hallucinations as when two or more people at once have or profess to have the same false perception of a person who is really absent and dying is next disposed of by herr parish the same points de rep√®re the same sound or flicker of light or arrangement of shadow may beget the same or a similar false perception in two or more people at once thus two girls in different rooms are looking out on different parts of the hall in their house both heard at the same time an objective noise p 313 then says herr parish the one sister saw her father cross the hall after entering the other saw the dog the usual companion of his walks run past her door father and dog had not left the diningroom herr parish decides that the same point de rep√®re the apparent noise of a key in the lock of the front door acted by way of suggestion on both sisters producing however different hallucinations in virtue of the difference of the connected associations one girl associated the sound with her honoured sire the other with his faithful hound so one saw a dog and the other saw an elderly gentleman now first if so this should always be occurring for we all have different associations of ideas thus we are in a haunted house there is a noise of a rattling window i associate it with a burglar brown with a milkman miss jones with a lady in green miss smith with a knight in armour that collection of phantasms should then be simultaneously on view like the dog and old gentleman all our reports should vary but this does not occur most unluckily for herr parish he illustrates his theory by telling a story which happens not to be correctly reported at first i thought that a fallacy of memory or an optical delusion had betrayed him again as in his legend of the waistcoat but i am now inclined to believe that what really occurred was this herr parish brought out his book in german before the report of the census of hallucinations was published in his german edition he probably quoted a story which precisely suited his theory of the origin of collective hallucinations this anecdote he had found in prof sidgwicks presidential address of july 189013 as stated by prof sidgwick the case just fitted herr parish who refers to it on p 190 and again on p 314 he gives no reference but his version reads like a traditional variant of prof sidgwicks now prof sidgwicks version was erroneous as is proved by the elaborate account of the case in the report of the census which herr parish had before him but neglected when he prepared his english edition the story was wrong alas in the very point where for herr parishs purpose it ought to have been right the hallucination is believed not to have been collective yet herr parish uses it to explain collective hallucinations doubtless he overlooked the accurate version in the report14  the facts as there reported were not what he narrates but as follows  miss ce was in the breakfastroom about 630 pm in january 1883 and supposed her father to be taking a walk with his dog she heard noises which may have had any other cause but which she took to be the sounds of a key in the door lock a stick tapping the tiles of the hall and the patter of the dogs feet on the tiles she then saw the dog pass the door miss ce next entered the hall where she found nobody but in the pantry she met her sistersmiss e miss hgeand a workingwoman miss e and the workingwoman had been in the hall and there had heard the sound which they like miss ce took for that of a key in the lock they were breaking a little household rule in the hall so they ran straightway into the pantry meeting miss hge on the way miss ce and miss e and the workingwoman all heard the noise as of a key in the lock but nobody is said to have seen the father cross the hall as herr parish asserts miss hge was of opinion that miss e now dead saw nothing and miss ce was inclined to agree with her miss e and the workwoman now dead were emphatic as to the father having entered the house but this the two only inferred from hearing the noise after which they fled to the pantry now granting that some other noise was mistaken for that of the key in the lock we have here not as herr parish declares a collective yet discrepant hallucinationthe discrepancy being caused by the difference of connected associations but a solitary hallucination herr parish however inadvertently converts a solitary into a collective hallucination and then uses the example to explain collective hallucinations in general he asserts that miss e saw her father cross the hall miss es sisters think that she saw no such matter now suppose that mr e had died at the moment and that the case was claimed on our part as a collective coincidental hallucination how righteously herr parish might exclaim that all the evidence was against its being collective the sound in the lock heard by three persons would be and probably was another noise misinterpreted and in any case there is no evidence for its having produced two hallucinations the evidence is in exactly the opposite direction  here then herr parish with the printed story under his eyes once more illustrates want of attention in one way his errors improve his case if i a grave man of science go on telling distorted legends out of my own head while the facts are plain in print before me herr parish may reason how much more are the popular tales about coincidental hallucinations likely to be distorted it is really a very strong argument but not exactly the argument which herr parish conceives himself to be presenting15  this unlucky inexactitude is chronic as we have shown in herr parishs work and is probably to be explained by inattention to facts by expectation of suitable facts and by anxiety to prove a theory he explains the similar or identical reports of witnesses to a collective hallucination by the case with which such appearances adapt themselves in recollection p 313 especially of course after lapse of time and then he unconsciously illustrates his case by the case with which printed facts under his very eyes adapt themselves quite erroneously to his own memory and personal bias as he copies them on to his paper  finally he argues that even if collective hallucinations are also with comparative frequency coincidental that is to be explained thus the rarity and the degree of interest compelled by it by such an hallucination will naturally tend to connect itself with some other prominent event and conversely the occurrence of such an event as the death or mortal danger of a friend is most calculated to produce memory illusions of this kind  in the second case the excitement caused by the death of a friend is likely it seems to make two or more sane people say and believe that they saw him somewhere else when he was really dying the only evidence for this fact is that such illusions occasionally occur not collectively in some lunatic asylums it is not however a form of mnemonic error often observed among the insane kraepelin gives two cases the process occurs sporadically in certain sane people under certain exciting conditions no examples are given what is rare as an individual folly among lunatics is supposed by herr parish to explain the theoretically false memory whereby sane people persuade themselves that they had an hallucination and persuade others that they were told of it when no such thing occurred  to return to our old example jones tells me that he has just seen his aunt whom he knows to be in timbuctoo news comes that the lady died when jones beheld her in his smokingroom oh nonsense herr parish would argue you jones saw nothing of the kind nor did you tell mr lang who i am sorry to find agrees with you what happened was this when the awful news came today of your aunts death you were naturally and even creditably excited especially as the poor lady was killed by being pegged down on an antheap this excitement rather praiseworthy than otherwise made you believe you had seen your aunt and believe you had told mr lang he also is a most excitable person though i admit he never saw your dear aunt in his life he therefore by virtue of his excitement now believes you told him about seeing your unhappy kinswoman this kind of false memory is very common two cases are recorded by kraepelin among the insane surely you quite understand my reasoning  i quite understand it but i dont see how it comes to seem good logic to herr parish  the other theory is funnier still jones never had an hallucination before the rarity and the degree of interest compelled by it made jones connect it with some other prominent event say the death of his aunt which really occurred say nine months afterwards but this is a mere case of evidence which it is the affair of the spr to criticise  herr parish is in the happy position called in american speculative circles a straddle if a man has an hallucination when alone he was in circumstances conducive to the sleeping state so the hallucination is probably a dream but if the seer was in company who all had the same hallucination then they all had the same points de rep√®re and the same adaptive memories so herr parish kills with both barrels  if anything extraneous could encourage a belief in coincidental and veridical hallucinations it would be these oppositions of science if a learned and fair opponent can find no better proofs than logic and unconscious perversions of facts like the logic and the statements of herr parish the case for telepathic hallucinations may seem strong indeed but we must grant him the existence of the adaptive and mythopoeic powers of memory which he asserts and also illustrates i grant too that a census of 17000 inquiries may only have skimmed the cream off p 87 another dip of the net bringing up 17000 fresh answers might alter the whole aspect of the case one way or the other moreover we cannot get scientific evidence in this way of inquiry if the public were interested in the question and understood its nature and if everybody who had an hallucination at once recorded it in black and white duly attested on oath before a magistrate by persons to whom he reported before the coincidence was known and if all such records coincidental or not were kept in the british museum for fifty years then an examination of them might teach us something but all this is quite impossible we may form a belief on this point of veridical hallucinations for ourselves but beyond that it is impossible to advance still science might read her brief  footnote 1 walter scott  footnote 2 parish p 278  footnote 3 ibid pp 282 283  footnote 4 p 287 mr sims proceedings x 230  footnote 5 parish pp

fetishism and spiritualism it was suggested that the movements of inanimate objects apparently without contact may have been one of the causes leading to fetishism to the opinion that a spirit may inhabit a stick stone or what not we added that whether such movements were caused by trickery or not was inessential as long as the savage did not discover the imposture  the evidence for the genuine supernormal character of such phenomena was not discussed that we might preserve the continuity of the general argument the history of such phenomena is too long for statement here the same reports are found from china to peru from eskimo to the cape from egyptian magical papyri to yesterdays provincial newspaper1  about 18501870 phenomena which had previously been reported as of sporadic and spontaneous occurrence were domesticated and organised by mediums generally american these were imitators of the enigmatic david dunglas home who was certainly a most oddly gifted man or a most successful impostor a good deal of scientific attention was given to the occurrences mr darwin mr tyndall dr carpenter mr huxley had all glanced at the phenomena and been present at s√©ances in most cases the exhibitions in the dark or in a very bad light were impudent impostures and were so regarded by the savants who looked into them a series of exposures culminated in the recent detection of eusapia paladino by dr hodgson and other members of the spr at cambridge  there was however an apparent exception the arch mystagogue home though by no means a clever man was never detected in fraudulent productions of fetishistic phenomena this is asserted here because several thirdhand stories of detected frauds by home are in circulation and it is hoped that a wellattested firsthand case of detection may be elicited  of homes successes with sir william crookes lord crawford and others something remains to be said but first we shall look into attempted explanations of alleged physical phenomena occurring not in the presence of a paid or even of a recognised medium it will appear we think that the explanations of evidence so widely diffused so uniform so old and so new are far from satisfactory our inference would be no more than that our eyes should be kept on such phenomena if they are reported to recur  mr tylor says i am well aware that the problem of these phenomena is one to be discussed on its merits in order to arrive at a distinct opinion how far it may be connected with facts insufficiently appreciated and explained by science and how far with superstition delusion and sheer knavery such investigation pursued by careful observation in a scientific spirit would seem apt to throw light on some interesting psychological questions  acting on mr tylors hint mr podmore puts forward as explanations 1 fraud 2 hallucinations caused by excited expectation and by the schw√§rmerei consequent on sitting in hushed hope of marvels  to take fraud first mr podmore has collected and analyses eleven recent sporadic cases of volatile objects2 his first instance worksop 1883 yields no proof of fraud and can only be dismissed by reason of the bad character of the other cases and because mr podmore took the evidence five weeks after the events to this example we confine ourselves this case appears to have been first reported in the retford and gainsborough times early in march 1883 really march 9 it does not seem to have struck mr podmore that he should publish these contemporary reports to show us how far they agree with evidence collected by him on the spot five weeks later to do this was the more necessary as he lays so much stress on failure of memory i have therefore secured the original newspaper report by the courtesy of the editor to be brief the phenomena began on february 20 or 21 by the table voluntarily tipping up and upsetting a candle while mrs white only saved the wash tub by alacrity and address the whole incident struck her as very extraordinary it is not in the newspaper report on february 26 mr white left his home and a girl eliza rose child of a halfimbecile mother was admitted by the kindness of mrs white to share her bed the girl was eighteen years of age was looking for a place as servant and nothing is said in the newspaper about her mother mr white returned on wednesday night but left on thursday morning returning on friday afternoon on thursday in mr whites absence phenomena set in on thursday night in mr whites presence they increased in vigour a doctor was called in also a policeman on saturday at 8 am the row recommenced at 4 pm mr white sent eliza rose away and peace returned we now offer the  statement of police constable higgs a man of good intelligence and believed to be entirely honest  on the night of friday march 2nd i heard of the disturbances at joe whites house from his young brother tom i went round to the house at 1155 pm as near as i can judge and found joe white in the kitchen of his house there was one candle lighted in the room and a good fire burning so that one could see things pretty clearly the cupboard doors were open and white went and shut them and then came and stood against the chest of drawers i stood near the outer door no one else was in the room at the time white had hardly shut the cupboard doors when they flew open and a large glass jar came out past me and pitched in the yard outside smashing itself i didnt see the jar leave the cupboard or fly through the air it went too quick but i am quite sure that it wasnt thrown by white or any one else white couldnt have done it without my seeing him the jar couldnt go in a straight line from the cupboard out of the door but it certainly did go  then white asked me to come and see the things which had been smashed in the inner room he led the way and i followed as i passed the chest of drawers in the kitchen i noticed a tumbler standing on it just after i passed i heard a crash and looking round i saw that the tumbler had fallen on the ground in the direction of the fireplace and was broken i dont know how it happened there was no one else in the room  i went into the inner room and saw the bits of pots and things on the floor and then i came back with white into the kitchen the girl rose had come into the kitchen during our absence she was standing with her back against the bin near the fire there was a cup standing on the bin rather nearer the door she said to me cupll go soon it has been down three times already she then pushed it a little farther on the bin and turned round and stood talking to me by the fire she had hardly done so when the cup jumped up suddenly about four or five feet into the air and then fell on the floor and smashed itself white was sitting on the other side of the fire  then mrs white came in with dr lloyd also tom white and solomon wass after they had been in two or three minutes something else happened tom white and wass were standing with their backs to the fire just in front of it eliza rose and dr lloyd were near them with their backs turned towards the bin the doctor nearer to the door i stood by the drawers and mrs white was by me near the inner door then suddenly a basin which stood on the end of the bin near the door got up into the air turning over and over as it went it went up not very quickly not as quickly as if it had been thrown when it reached the ceiling it fell plump and smashed i called dr lloyds attention to it and we all saw it no one was near it and i dont know how it happened i stayed about ten minutes more but saw nothing else i dont know what to make of it all i dont think white or the girl could possibly have done the things which i saw  this statement was made five weeks after date to mr podmore we compare it with the intelligent constables statement made between march 3 and march 8 that is immediately after the events and reported in the local paper of march 9  statement by police constable higgsduring friday night police constable higgs visited the house and concerning the visit he makes the following statement  about ten minutes past to twelve on friday night i was met in bridge street by buck ford and joes brother tom white and dr lloyd tom said to me will you go with us to joes and you will see something you have never seen before i went and when i got into the house joe went and shut the cupboard doors no sooner had he done so than the doors flew open again and an ordinary sized glass jar flew across the kitchen out of the door into the yard a sugar jar also flew out of the cupboard unseen in fact we saw nothing and heard nothing until we heard it smash the distance travelled by the articles was about seven yards i stood a minute or two and then the glass which i noticed on the drawers jumped off the drawers a yard away and broke in about a hundred bits the next thing was a cup which stood on the flourbin just beyond the yard door it flew upwards and then fell to the ground and broke the girl said that this cup had been on the floor three times and that she had picked it up just before it went off the bench i said i suppose the cup will be the next the cup fell a distance of two yards away from the flourbin dr lloyd had been in the next house lancing the back of a little boy who had been removed there he now came in and we began talking the doctor saying it is a most mysterious thing he turned with his back to the flourbin on which stood a basin the basin flew up into the air obliquely went over the doctors head and fell at his feet in pieces the doctor then went out i stood a short time longer but saw nothing farther there were six persons in the room while these things were going on and so far as i could see there was no human agency at work i had not the slightest belief in anything appertaining to the supernatural i left just before one oclock having been in the house thirty minutes  as the policeman says there was nothing supernatural but there was an appearance of something rather supernormal on the afternoon of saturday white sent the girl rose away and a number of people watched in his house till after midnight though the sceptical reporter thought that objects were placed where they might easily be upset none were upset the ghost was laid excited expectation was so false to its function as to beget no phenomena  the newspaper reports contain no theory that will account for whites breaking his furniture and crockery nor for roses securing her own dismissal from a house where she was kindly received by wilfully destroying the property of her hostess an amateur published a theory of silken threads attached to light articles and thick cords to heavy articles whereof no trace was found by witnesses who examined the volatile objects an elaborate machinery of pulleys fixed in the ceiling the presence of a trickster in a locked pantry apparent errors in the account of the flight of the objects and a number of accomplices were all involved in this local explanation the explainer admitting that he could not imagine why the tricks were played six or eight pounds worth of goods were destroyed nor is it singular that poor mrs white wept over her shattered penates  the destruction began of course in the absence of white the girl rose gave to the newspaper the same account as the other witnesses but as white thought she was the agent so she suspected white though she admitted that he was not at home when the trouble arose  mr podmore reviewing the case says the phenomena described are quite inexplicable by ordinary mechanical means3 yet he elsewhere4 suggests that rose herself as the instrument of mysterious agencies or simply as a halfwitted girl gifted with abnormal cunning and love of mischief may have been directly responsible for all that took place that is to say a halfwitted girl could do barring mysterious agencies what is quite inexplicable by ordinary mechanical means while according to the policeman she was not even present on some occasions but it is not easy to make out in the evidence of white the other witness whether this girl rose was present or not when the jar flew circuitously out of the cupboard a thing easily worked by a halfwitted girl such discrepancies are common in all evidence to the most ordinary events in any case a halfwitted girl in mr podmores theory can do what is quite inexplicable by ordinary mechanical means there is not the shadow of evidence that the girl rose had the inestimable advantage of being halfwitted she is described by mr podmore as the child of an imbecile mother the phenomena began in an isolated case the tilted table before rose entered the house she was admitted in kindness acted as a maid and her interest was not to break the crockery and upset furniture the troubles which began before the girls arrival were apparently active when she was not present and if she was present she could not have caused them by ordinary mechanical means while of extraordinary mechanical means there was confessedly no trace the disturbances ceased after she was dismissednothing else connects her with them  mr podmores attempt at a normal explanation by fraud therefore is of no weight he has to exaggerate the value as disproof of such discrepancies as occur in all human evidence on all subjects he has to lay stress on the interval of five weeks between the events and the collection of testimony by himself but contemporary accounts appeared in the local newspapers and he does not compare the contemporary with the later evidence as we have done there is one discrepancy which looks as if a witness not here cited came to think he had seen what he heard talked about finally after abandoning the idea that mechanical means can possibly have produced the effect mr podmore falls back on the cunning of a halfwitted girl whom nothing shows to have been halfwitted the alternative is that the girl was the instrument of mysterious agencies  so much for the hypothesis of a fraud which has been identical in results from china to peru and from greenland to the cape  we now turn to the other and concomitantly active cause in mr podmores theory hallucination many of the witnesses described the articles as moving slowly through the air or exhibiting some peculiarity of flight see eg the worksop case mr podmore adds another english case presently to be noted and a german one in default of any experimental evidence how about mr william crookess that disturbances of this kind are ever due to abnormal agency i am disposed to explain the appearance of moving slowly or flying as a sensory illusion conditioned by the excited state of the percipient studies 157 158  before criticising this explanation let us give the english affair alluded to by mr podmore  the most curious modern case known to me is not of recent date but it occurred in full daylight in the presence of many witnesses and the phenomena continued for weeks the events were of 1849 and the record is expanded by mr bristow a spectator from an account written by him in 1854 the scene was swanland near hull in a carpenters shop where mr bristow was employed with two fellow workmen to be brief they were pelted by odds and ends of wood about the size of a common matchbox each blamed the others till this explanation became untenable the workrooms and space above were searched to no purpose the bits of wood sometimes danced along the floor more commonly sailed gently along or moved as if borne on gently heaving waves this sort of thing was repeated during six weeks one piece of wood came from a distant corner of the room towards me describing what may be likened to a geometrical square or corkscrew of about eighteen inches diameter never was a piece seen to come in at the doorway mr bristow deems this period the most remarkable episode in my life june 27 1891 the phenomena did not depend on the presence of any one person or number of persons  going to swanland in 1891 mr sidgwick found one surviving witness of these occurrences who averred that the objects could not have been thrown because of the eccentricities of their course which he described in the same way as mr bristow the thrower must certainly have had a native genius for pitching at baseball this witness named andrews was mentioned by mr bristow in his report but not referred to by him for confirmation those to whom he referred were found to be dead or had emigrated the villagers had a superstitious theory about the phenomena being provoked by a dead man whose affairs had not been settled to his liking so mr darwins spoon dancedon a grave5  this case has a certain interest √† propos of mr podmores surmise that all such phenomena arise in trickery which produces excitement in the spectators while excitement begets hallucination and hallucination takes the form of seeing the thrown objects move in a nonnatural way thus i keep throwing things about you not detecting this stratagem get excited consequently hallucinated and you believe you see the things move in spirals or undulate as if on waves or hop or float or glide in an impossible way so close is the uniformity of hallucination that these phenomena are described in similar terms by witnesses hallucinated of course in times old and new as in cases cited by glanvil increase mather telfer of rerrick and generally in works of the seventeenth century nor is this uniform hallucination confined to england mr podmore quotes a german example and i received a similar testimony to the flight of an object round a corner from a gentleman who employed esther teed the amherst mystery in his service he was not excited for he was normally engaged in his normal stable when the incident occurred unexpectedly as he was looking after his live stock one may add the case of cideville 1851 and sir w crookess evidence and that of mr schhapoff  mr podmore must therefore suppose that in states of excitement the same peculiar form of hallucination develops itself uniformly in america france germany and england not to speak of russia and persists through different ages this is a novel and valuable psychological law moreover mr podmore must hold that excitement lasted for six weeks among the carpenters in the shop at swanland one of whom writes like a man of much intelligence and has thriven to be a master in his craft it is difficult to believe that he was excited for six weeks and we still marvel that excitement produces the same uniformity of hallucination affecting policemen carpenters marquises and a frs we allude to sir w crookess case  strictly scientific examination of these prodigies has been very rare the best examples are the experiments of sir william crookes frs with home6 he demonstrated by means of a machine constructed for the purpose and automatically registering that in homes presence a balance was affected to the extent of two pounds when home was not in contact with the table on which the machine was placed he also saw objects float in air with a motion like that of a piece of wood on small waves of the sea clearly excitement producing hallucination while home was at a distance other spectators holding his hands and his feet being visibly enclosed in a kind of cage all present held each others hands and all witnessed the phenomena sir w crookes being professionally celebrated for the accuracy of his observations these circumstances are difficult to explain and these are but a few cases among multitudes  i venture to conceive that on reflection mr podmore will doubt whether he has discovered an universal law of excited malperception or whether the remarkable and certainly undesigned coincidence of testimony to the singular flight of objects does not rather point to an abnormal agency uniform in its effects contagious hallucination cannot affect witnesses ignorant of each others existence in many lands and ages nor could they cook their reports to suit reports of which they never heard  we now turn to peculiarities in the socalled medium such as floating in air change of bulk and escape from lesion when handling or treading in fire mr tylor says nothing of sir william crookess cases 1871 but speaks of the alleged levitation or floating in air of savages and civilised men these are recorded in buddhist and neoplatonic writings and among red indians in tonquin where a jesuit saw and described the phenomena 1730 in the acta sanctorum and among modern spiritualists in 1760 lord elcho being at home was present at the proc√®s for canonising a saint unnamed and heard witnesses swear to having seen the holy man levitated sir w crookes attests having seen home float in air on several occasions in 1871 the master of lindsay now lord crawford and balcarres frs gave the following evidence which was corroborated by the two other spectators lord adare and captain wynne  i was sitting with mr home and lord adare and a cousin of his during the sitting mr home went into a trance and in that state was carried out of the window in the room next to where we were and was brought in at our window the distance between the windows was about seven feet six inches and there was not the slightest foothold between them nor was there more than a twelveinch projection to each window which served as a ledge to put flowers on we heard the window in the next room lifted up and almost immediately after we saw home floating in the air outside our window the moon was shining full into the room my back was to the light and i saw the shadow on the wall of the window sill and homes feet about six inches above it he remained in this position for a few seconds then raised the window and glided into the room feet foremost and sat down  lord adare then went into the next room to look at the window from which he had been carried it was raised about eighteen inches and he expressed his wonder how mr home had been taken through so narrow an aperture home said still entranced i will show you and then with his back to the window he leaned back and was shot out of the aperture head first with the body rigid and then returned quite quietly the window is about seventy feet from the ground the hypothesis of a mechanical arrangement of ropes or supports outside has been suggested but does not cover the facts as described  mr podmore who quotes this offers the explanation that the witnesses were excited and that home thrust his head and shoulders out of the window but if he did they could not see him do it for he was in the next room a brick wall was between them and him their first view of home was floating in the air outside our window it is not very easy to hold that a belief to which the collective evidence is so large and universal as the belief in levitation was caused by a series of saints sorcerers and others thrusting their heads and shoulders out of windows where the observers could not see them nor in lord crawfords case is it easy to suppose that three educated men if hallucinated would all be hallucinated in the same way  the argument of excited expectation and consequent hallucination does not apply to mr hamilton a√Ød√© and m alphonse karr neither of whom was a man of science both were extremely prejudiced against home and at nice went to see and if possible to expose him home was a guest at a large villa in nice m karr and mr a√Ød√© were two of a party in a spacious brilliantly lighted salon where home received them a large heavy table remote from their group moved towards them m karr then got under a table which rose in air and carefully examined the space beneath while mr a√Ød√© observed it from above neither of them could discover any explanation of the phenomenon and they walked away together disgusted disappointed and reviling home7  in this case there was neither excitement nor desire to believe but a strong wish to disbelieve and to expose home if two such witnesses could be hallucinated we must greatly extend our notion of the limits of the capacity for entertaining hallucinations  one singular phenomenon was reported in homes case which has however little to do with any conceivable theory of spirits he was said to become elongated in trance8 mr podmore explains that perhaps he really stretched himself to his full heightone of the easiest ways conceivable of working a miracle iamblichus reports the same phenomenon in his possessed men9 iamblichus adds that they were sometimes broadened as well as lengthened now m f√©r√© observes that any part of the body of an hysterical patient may change in volume simply owing to the fact that the patients attention is fixed on that part10 conceivably the elongation of home and the ancient egyptian mediums may have been an extreme case of this change of volume could this be proved by examples homes elongation would cease to be a miracle but it would follow that in this case observers were not hallucinated and the presumption would be raised that they were not hallucinated in the other cases indeed this argument is of universal application  there is another class of physical phenomena which has no direct bearing on our subject many persons in many ages are said to have handled or walked through fire not only without suffering pain but without lesion of the skin iamblichus mentions this as among the peculiarities of his possessed men and in modern mythology 1897 i have collected firsthand evidence for the feat in classical times and in india fiji bulgaria trinidad the straits settlements and many other places the evidence is that of travellers officials missionaries and others and is backed for what photographic testimony is worth by photographs of the performance to hold glowing coals in his hand and to communicate the power of doing so to others was in homes r√©pertoire lord crawford saw it done on eight occasions and himself received from homes hand the glowing coal unharmed a friend of my own however still bears the blister of the hurt received in the process sir w crookess evidence follows  at mr homes request whilst he was entranced i went with him to the fireplace in the back drawingroom he said we want you to notice particularly what dan is doing accordingly i stood close to the fire and stooped down to it when he put his hands in  mr home then waved the handkerchief about in the air two or three times held it above his head and then folded it up and laid it on his hand like a cushion putting his other hand into the fire he took out a large lump of cinder redhot at the lower part and placed the red part on the handkerchief under ordinary circumstances it would have been in a blaze in about half a minute he took it off the handkerchief with his hand saying as the power is not strong if we leave the coal longer it will burn he then put it on his hand and brought it to the table in the front room where all but myself had remained seated  mr podmore explains that only two candles and the fire gave light on one occasion and that possibly homes hands were protected by some nonconducting substance he does not explain how this substance was put on lord crawfords hands nor tell us what this valuable substance may be none is known to science though it seems to be known to fijians tongans klings and bulgarians who walk through fire unhurt  it is not necessary to believe sir w crookess assertions that he saw home perform the firetricks for we can fall back on the lack of light only two candles and the firelight as also on the law of hallucination caused by excitement but it is necessary to believe this distinguished authoritys statement about his ignorance of some nonconducting substance  schoolboys books and mediaeval tales describe how this can be done with alum and other ingredients it is possible that the skin may be so hardened and thickened by such preparations that superficial charring might take place without the pain becoming great but the surface of the skin would certainly suffer severely after home had recovered from the trance i examined his hand with care to see if there were any signs of burning or of previous preparation i could detect no trace or injury to the skin which was soft and delicate like a womans neither were there signs of any preparation having been previously applied i have often seen conjurers and others handle redhot coals and iron but there were always palpable signs of burning11  in september 1897 a crew of passengers went from new zealand to see the fijian rites which as reported in the fiji times corresponded exactly with the description published by mr basil thomson himself a witness the interesting point historically is the combination in home of all the r√©pertoire of the possessed men in iamblichus we certainly cannot get rid of the firetrick by aid of a hypothetical nonconducting substance till the substance is tested experimentally it is not a vera causa we might as well say spirits at once both that substance and those spirits are equally in the air yet mr podmores explanations not satisfactory to himself are conceived so thoroughly in the spirit of popular scienceone of them casually discovering a new psychological law a second contradicting the facts it seeks to account for a third generously inventing an unknown substancethat they ought to be welcomed by reviewers and lecturers  it seems wiser to admit our ignorance and suspend our belief  here closes the futile chapter of explanations fraud is a vera causa but an hypothesis difficult of application when it is admitted that the effects could not be caused by ordinary mechanical means hallucination through excitement is a vera causa but its remarkable uniformity as described by witnesses from different lands and ages knowing nothing of each other makes us hesitate to accept a sweeping hypothesis of hallucination the case for it is not confirmed when we have the same reports from witnesses certainly not excited  this extraordinary bundle then of reports practically identical of facts paralysing to belief this bundle made up of statements from so many ages and countries can only be filed for reference but it is manifest that any savage who shared the experiences of sir w crookes lord crawford mr hamilton a√Ød√© m robert de

on crystalgazing the opinion of dr janet as that of a savant familiar at the salp√™tri√®re with neurotic visionaries cannot but be interesting unluckily the essay must be regarded as seriously impaired in value by dr janets singular treatment of his subject nothing is more necessary in these researches than accuracy of statement now dr janet has taken a set of experiences or experiments of miss xs from that ladys interesting essay already cited has attributed them not to miss x but to various peoplefor example to une jeune fille une pauvre voyante une personne un peu mystique has altered the facts in the spirit of romance and has triumphantly given that explanation revival of memory which was assigned by miss x herself  throughout his paper dr janet appears as the calm man of science pronouncing judgment on the visionary vagaries of haunted young girls and disappointed seeresses no such persons were concerned no such hauntings supposed premonitions or disillusions occurred the romantic and marvellous circumstances are mythopoeic accretions due to dr janets own memory or fancy his scientific explanation is that given by his trinity of jeune fille pauvre voyante and personne un peu mystique  being much engaged in the study of neurotic and hysterical patients dr janet thinks that they are most apt to see crystal visions perhaps they are and one doubts if their descriptions are more to be trusted than the romantic essay of their medical attendant in citing miss xs paper as he did dr janet ought to have reported her experiments correctly ought to have attributed them to herself and should decidedly have remarked that the explanation he offered was her own hypothesis verified by her own exertions  not having any acquaintances in neurotic circles i am unable to say whether such persons supply more cases of the faculty of crystal vision than ordinary people while their word one would think is much less to be trusted than that of men and women in excellent health the crystal visions which i have cited from my own knowledge and i could cite scores of others were beheld by men and women engaged in the ordinary duties of life students barristers novelists lawyers schoolmasters schoolmistresses golfersto all of whom the topic was perfectly newhave all exhibited the faculty it is curious that an arabian author of the thirteenth century ibn

inconspicuous and that a dead chief cannot have thriven into a supreme being attention should be called however to mr howitts remarks on australian headmen in his tract on the organisation of australian tribes pp 103113  he attaches more of the idea of power to headmen than does mr curr in his work the australian race the headmen as a rule arrive at such influence as they possess by seniority if accompanied by courage wisdom and in some cases by magical acquirements there are traces of a tendency to keep the office if it may be called one in the same kinship but vich ian vohr or chingahgook are not to be found in australian tribes p 113 i do not observe that the manes or ghost of a dead headman receives any worship or service calculated to fix him in the tribal memory and so lead to the evolution of a deity though one headman was potent through the whole dieyri tribe over three hundred miles of country such a person if propitiated after death might conceivably develop
