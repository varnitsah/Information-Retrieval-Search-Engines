parish has one or more of them they are young enough to be very active and ought to be doing a great deal of good but not of late years are we about to speak we are going back to the beginning of this century late yearspresent years are dusty sunburnt hot arid we will evade the noon forget it in siesta pass the midday in slumber and dream of dawn  if you think from this prelude that anything like a romance is preparing for you reader you never were more mistaken do you anticipate sentiment and poetry and reverie do you expect passion and stimulus and melodrama calm your expectations reduce them to a lowly standard something real cool and solid lies before you something unromantic as monday morning when all who have work wake with the consciousness that they must rise and betake themselves thereto it is not positively affirmed that you shall not have a taste of the exciting perhaps towards the middle and close of the meal but it is resolved that the first dish set upon the table shall be one that a catholicay even an anglocatholicmight eat on good friday in passion week it shall be cold lentils and vinegar without oil it shall be unleavened bread with bitter herbs and no roast lamb  of late years i say an abundant shower of curates has fallen upon the north of england but in eighteenhundredeleventwelve that affluent rain had not descended curates were scarce then there was no pastoral aidno additional curates society to stretch a helping hand to wornout old rectors and incumbents and give them the wherewithal to pay a vigorous young colleague from oxford or cambridge the present successors of the apostles disciples of dr pusey and tools of the propaganda were at that time being hatched under cradleblankets or undergoing regeneration by nurserybaptism in washhand basins you could not have guessed by looking at any one of them that the italianironed double frills of its netcap surrounded the brows of a preordained speciallysanctified successor of st paul st peter or st john nor could you have foreseen in the folds of its long nightgown the white surplice in which it was hereafter cruelly to exercise the souls of its parishioners and strangely to nonplus its oldfashioned vicar by flourishing aloft in a pulpit the shirtlike raiment which had never before waved higher than the readingdesk  yet even in those days of scarcity there were curates the precious plant was rare but it might be found a certain favoured district in the west riding of yorkshire could boast three rods of aaron blossoming within a circuit of twenty miles you shall see them reader step into this neat gardenhouse on the skirts of whinbury walk forward into the little parlour there they are at dinner allow me to introduce them to you mr donne curate of whinbury mr malone curate of briarfield mr sweeting curate of nunnely these are mr donnes lodgings being the habitation of one john gale a small clothier mr donne has kindly invited his brethren to regale with him you and i will join the party see what is to be seen and hear what is to be heard at present however they are only eating and while they eat we will talk aside  these gentlemen are in the bloom of youth they possess all the activity of that interesting agean activity which their moping old vicars would fain turn into the channel of their pastoral duties often expressing a wish to see it expended in a diligent superintendence of the schools and in frequent visits to the sick of their respective parishes but the youthful levites feel this to be dull work they prefer lavishing their energies on a course of proceeding which though to other eyes it appear more heavy with ennui more cursed with monotony than the toil of the weaver at his loom seems to yield them an unfailing supply of enjoyment and occupation  i allude to a rushing backwards and forwards amongst themselves to and from their respective lodgingsnot a round but a triangle of visits which they keep up all the year through in winter spring summer and autumn season and weather make no difference with unintelligible zeal they dare snow and hail wind and rain mire and dust to go and dine or drink tea or sup with each other what attracts them it would be difficult to say it is not friendship for whenever they meet they quarrel it is not religionthe thing is never named amongst them theology they may discuss occasionally but pietynever it is not the love of eating and drinking each might have as good a joint and pudding tea as potent and toast as succulent at his own lodgings as is served to him at his brothers mrs gale mrs hogg and mrs whipptheir respective landladiesaffirm that it is just for naught else but to give folk trouble by folk the good ladies of course mean themselves for indeed they are kept in a continual fry by this system of mutual invasion  mr donne and his guests as i have said are at dinner mrs gale waits on them but a spark of the hot kitchen fire is in her eye she considers that the privilege of inviting a friend to a meal occasionally without additional charge a privilege included in the terms on which she lets her lodgings has been quite sufficiently exercised of late the present week is yet but at thursday and on monday mr malone the curate of briarfield came to breakfast and stayed dinner on tuesday mr malone and mr sweeting of nunnely came to tea remained to supper occupied the spare bed and favoured her with their company to breakfast on wednesday morning now on thursday they are both here at dinner and she is almost certain they will stay all night cen est trop she would say if she could speak french  mr sweeting is mincing the slice of roast beef on his plate and complaining that it is very tough mr donne says the beer is flat ay that is the worst of it if they would only be civil mrs gale wouldnt mind it so much if they would only seem satisfied with what they get she wouldnt care but these young parsons is so high and so scornful they set everybody beneath their fit they treat her with less than civility just because she doesnt keep a servant but does the work of the house herself as her mother did afore her then they are always speaking against yorkshire ways and yorkshire folk and by that very token mrs gale does not believe one of them to be a real gentleman or come of gentle kin the old parsons is worth the whole lump of college lads they know what belongs to good manners and is kind to high and low  more bread cries mr malone in a tone which though prolonged but to utter two syllables proclaims him at once a native of the land of shamrocks and potatoes mrs gale hates mr malone more than either of the other two but she fears him also for he is a tall stronglybuilt personage with real irish legs and arms and a face as genuinely nationalnot the milesian face not daniel oconnells style but the highfeatured northamericanindian sort of visage which belongs to a certain class of the irish gentry and has a petrified and proud look better suited to the owner of an estate of slaves than to the landlord of a free peasantry mr malones father termed himself a gentleman he was poor and in debt and besottedly arrogant and his son was like him  mrs gale offered the loaf  cut it woman said her guest and the woman cut it accordingly had she followed her inclinations she would have cut the parson also her yorkshire soul revolted absolutely from his manner of command  the curates had good appetites and though the beef was tough they ate a great deal of it they swallowed too a tolerable allowance of the flat beer while a dish of yorkshire pudding and two tureens of vegetables disappeared like leaves before locusts the cheese too received distinguished marks of their attention and a spicecake which followed by way of dessert vanished like a vision and was no more found its elegy was chanted in the kitchen by abraham mrs gales son and heir a youth of six summers he had reckoned upon the reversion thereof and when his mother brought down the empty platter he lifted up his voice and wept sore  the curates meantime sat and sipped their wine a liquor of unpretending vintage moderately enjoyed mr malone indeed would much rather have had whisky but mr donne being an englishman did not keep the beverage while they sipped they argued not on politics nor on philosophy nor on literaturethese topics were now as ever totally without interest for themnot even on theology practical or doctrinal but on minute points of ecclesiastical discipline frivolities which seemed empty as bubbles to all save themselves mr malone who contrived to secure two glasses of wine when his brethren contented themselves with one waxed by degrees hilarious after his fashion that is he grew a little insolent said rude things in a hectoring tone and laughed clamorously at his own brilliancy  each of his companions became in turn his butt malone had a stock of jokes at their service which he was accustomed to serve out regularly on convivial occasions like the present seldom varying his wit for which indeed there was no necessity as he never appeared to consider himself monotonous and did not at all care what others thought mr donne he favoured with hints about his extreme meagreness allusions to his turnedup nose cutting sarcasms on a certain threadbare chocolate surtout which that gentleman was accustomed to sport whenever it rained or seemed likely to rain and criticisms on a choice set of cockney phrases and modes of pronunciation mr donnes own property and certainly deserving of remark for the elegance and finish they communicated to his style  mr sweeting was bantered about his staturehe was a little man a mere boy in height and breadth compared with the athletic malone rallied on his musical accomplishmentshe played the flute and sang hymns like a seraph some young ladies of his parish thought sneered at as the ladies pet teased about his mamma and sisters for whom poor mr sweeting had some lingering regard and of whom he was foolish enough now and then to speak in the presence of the priestly paddy from whose anatomy the bowels of natural affection had somehow been omitted  the victims met these attacks each in his own way mr donne with a stilted selfcomplacency and halfsullen phlegm the sole props of his otherwise somewhat rickety dignity mr sweeting with the indifference of a light easy disposition which never professed to have any dignity to maintain  when malones raillery became rather too offensive which it soon did they joined in an attempt to turn the tables on him by asking him how many boys had shouted irish peter after him as he came along the road that day malones name was peterthe rev peter augustus malone requesting to be informed whether it was the mode in ireland for clergymen to carry loaded pistols in their pockets and a shillelah in their hands when they made pastoral visits inquiring the signification of such words as vele firrum hellum storrum so mr malone invariably pronounced veil firm helm storm and employing such other methods of retaliation as the innate refinement of their minds suggested  this of course would not do malone being neither goodnatured nor phlegmatic was presently in a towering passion he vociferated gesticulated donne and sweeting laughed he reviled them as saxons and snobs at the very top pitch of his high celtic voice they taunted him with being the native of a conquered land he menaced rebellion in the name of his counthry vented bitter hatred against english rule they spoke of rags beggary and pestilence the little parlour was in an uproar you would have thought a duel must follow such virulent abuse it seemed a wonder that mr and mrs gale did not take alarm at the noise and send for a constable to keep the peace but they were accustomed to such demonstrations they well knew that the curates never dined or took tea together without a little exercise of the sort and were quite easy as to consequences knowing that these clerical quarrels were as harmless as they were noisy that they resulted in nothing and that on whatever terms the curates might part tonight they would be sure to meet the best friends in the world tomorrow morning  as the worthy pair were sitting by their kitchen fire listening to the repeated and sonorous contact of malones fist with the mahogany plane of the parlour table and to the consequent start and jingle of decanters and glasses following each assault to the mocking laughter of the allied english disputants and the stuttering declamation of the isolated hibernianas they thus sat a foot was heard on the outer doorstep and the knocker quivered to a sharp appeal  mr gale went and opened  whom have you upstairs in the parlour asked a voicea rather remarkable voice nasal in tone abrupt in utterance  o mr helstone is it you sir i could hardly see you for the darkness it is so soon dark now will you walk in sir  i want to know first whether it is worth my while walking in whom have you upstairs  the curates sir  what all of them  yes sir  been dining here  yes sir  that will do  with these words a person entereda middleaged man in black he walked straight across the kitchen to an inner door opened it inclined his head forward and stood listening there was something to listen to for the noise above was just then louder than ever  hey he ejaculated to himself then turning to mr galehave you often this sort of work  mr gale had been a churchwarden and was indulgent to the clergy  theyre young you know sirtheyre young said he deprecatingly  young they want caning bad boysbad boys and if you were a dissenter john gale instead of being a good churchman theyd do the liketheyd expose themselves but ill  by way of finish to this sentence he passed through the inner door drew it after him and mounted the stair again he listened a few minutes when he arrived at the upper room making entrance without warning he stood before the curates  and they were silent they were transfixed and so was the invader hea personage short of stature but straight of port and bearing on broad shoulders a hawks head beak and eye the whole surmounted by a rehoboam or shovel hat which he did not seem to think it necessary to lift or remove before the presence in which he then stoodhe folded his arms on his chest and surveyed his young friends if friends they were much at his leisure  what he began delivering his words in a voice no longer nasal but deepmore than deepa voice made purposely hollow and cavernouswhat has the miracle of pentecost been renewed have the cloven tongues come down again where are they the sound filled the whole house just now i heard the seventeen languages in full action parthians and medes and elamites the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judea and cappadocia in pontus and asia phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene strangers of rome jews and proselytes cretes and arabians every one of these must have had its representative in this room two minutes since  i beg your pardon mr helstone began mr donne take a seat pray sir have a glass of wine  his civilities received no answer the falcon in the black coat proceeded  what do i talk about the gift of tongues gift indeed i mistook the chapter and book and testamentgospel for law acts for genesis the city of jerusalem for the plain of shinar it was no gift but the confusion of tongues which has gabbled me deaf as a post you apostles what you three certainly not three presumptuous babylonish masonsneither more nor less  i assure you sir we were only having a little chat together over a glass of wine after a friendly dinnersettling the dissenters  oh settling the dissenters were you was malone settling the dissenters it sounded to me much more like settling his coapostles you were quarrelling together making almost as much noiseyou three aloneas moses barraclough the preaching tailor and all his hearers are making in the methodist chapel down yonder where they are in the thick of a revival i know whose fault it isit is yours malone  mine sir  yours sir donne and sweeting were quiet before you came and would be quiet if you were gone i wish when you crossed the channel you had left your irish habits behind you dublin student ways wont do here the proceedings which might pass unnoticed in a wild bog and mountain district in connaught will in a decent english parish bring disgrace on those who indulge in them and what is far worse on the sacred institution of which they are merely the humble appendages  there was a certain dignity in the little elderly gentlemans manner of rebuking these youths though it was not perhaps quite the dignity most appropriate to the occasion mr helstone standing straight as a ramrod looking keen as a kite presented despite his clerical hat black coat and gaiters more the air of a veteran officer chiding his subalterns than of a venerable priest exhorting his sons in the faith gospel mildness apostolic benignity never seemed to have breathed their influence over that keen brown visage but firmness had fixed the features and sagacity had carved her own lines about them  i met supplehough he continued plodding through the mud this wet night going to preach at milldean opposition shop as i told you i heard barraclough bellowing in the midst of a conventicle like a possessed bull and i find you gentlemen tarrying over your halfpint of muddy port wine and scolding like angry old women no wonder supplehough should have dipped sixteen adult converts in a daywhich he did a fortnight since no wonder barraclough scamp and hypocrite as he is should attract all the weavergirls in their flowers and ribbons to witness how much harder are his knuckles than the wooden brim of his tub as little wonder that you when you are left to yourselves without your rectorsmyself and hall and boultbyto back you should too often perform the holy service of our church to bare walls and read your bit of a dry discourse to the clerk and the organist and the beadle but enough of the subject i came to see malonei have an errand unto thee o captain  what is it inquired malone discontentedly there can be no funeral to take at this time of day  have you any arms about you  arms siryes and legs and he advanced the mighty members  bah weapons i mean  i have the pistols you gave me yourself i never part with them i lay them ready cocked on a chair by my bedside at night i have my blackthorn  very good will you go to hollows mill  what is stirring at hollows mill  nothing as yet nor perhaps will be but moore is alone there he has sent all the workmen he can trust to stilbro there are only two women left about the place it would be a nice opportunity for any of his wellwishers to pay him a visit if they knew how straight the path was made before them  i am none of his wellwishers sir i dont care for him  soh malone you are afraid  you know me better than that if i really thought there was a chance of a row i would go but moore is a strange shy man whom i never pretend to understand and for the sake of his sweet company only i would not stir a step  but there is a chance of a row if a positive riot does not take placeof which indeed i see no signsyet it is unlikely this night will pass quite tranquilly you know moor has resolved to have new machinery and he expects two wagonloads of frames and shears from stilbro this evening scott the overlooker and a few picked men are gone to fetch them  they will bring them in safely and quietly enough sir  moore says so and affirms he wants nobody some one however he must have if it were only to bear evidence in case anything should happen i call him very careless he sits in the countinghouse with the shutters unclosed he goes out here and there after dark wanders right up the hollow down fieldhead lane among the plantations just as if he were the darling of the neighbourhood orbeing as he is its detestationbore a charmed life as they say in talebooks he takes no warning from the fate of pearson nor from that of armitageshot one in his own house and the other on the moor  but he should take warning sir and use precautions too interposed mr sweeting and i think he would if he heard what i heard the other day  what did you hear davy  you know mike hartley sir  the antinomian weaver yes  when mike has been drinking for a few weeks together he generally winds up by a visit to nunnely vicarage to tell mr hall a piece of his mind about his sermons to denounce the horrible tendency of his doctrine of works and warn him that he and all his hearers are sitting in outer darkness  well that has nothing to do with moore  besides being an antinomian he is a violent jacobin and leveller sir  i know when he is very drunk his mind is always running on regicide mike is not unacquainted with history and it is rich to hear him going over the list of tyrants of whom as he says the revenger of blood has obtained satisfaction the fellow exults strangely in murder done on crowned heads or on any head for political reasons i have already heard it hinted that he seems to have a queer hankering after moore is that what you allude to sweeting  you use the proper term sir mr hall thinks mike has no personal hatred of moore mike says he even likes to talk to him and run after him but he has a hankering that moore should be made an example of he was extolling him to mr hall the other day as the millowner with the most brains in yorkshire and for that reason he affirms moore should be chosen as a sacrifice an oblation of a sweet savour is mike hartley in his right mind do you think sir inquired sweeting simply  cant tell davy he may be crazed or he may be only crafty or perhaps a little of both  he talks of seeing visions sir  ay he is a very ezekiel or daniel for visions he came just when i was going to bed last friday night to describe one that had been revealed to him in nunnely park that very afternoon  tell it sir what was it urged sweeting  davy thou hast an enormous organ of wonder in thy cranium malone you see has none neither murders nor visions interest him see what a big vacant saph he looks at this moment  saph who was saph sir  i thought you would not know you may find it out it is biblical i know nothing more of him than his name and race but from a boy upwards i have always attached a personality to saph depend on it he was honest heavy and luckless he met his end at gob by the hand of sibbechai  but the vision sir  davy thou shalt hear donne is biting his nails and malone yawning so i will tell it but to thee mike is out of work like many others unfortunately mr grame sir philip nunnelys steward gave him a job about the priory according to his account mike was busy hedging rather late in the afternoon but before dark when he heard what he thought was a band at a distancebugles fifes and the sound of a trumpet it came from the forest and he wondered that there should be music there he looked up all amongst the trees he saw moving objects red like poppies or white like mayblossom the wood was full of them they poured out and filled the park he then perceived they were soldiersthousands and tens of thousands but they made no more noise than a swarm of midges on a summer evening they formed in order he affirmed and marched regiment after regiment across the park he followed them to nunnely common the music still played soft and distant on the common he watched them go through a number of evolutions a man clothed in scarlet stood in the centre and directed them they extended he declared over fifty acres they were in sight half an hour then they marched away quite silently the whole time he heard neither voice nor treadnothing but the faint music playing a solemn march  where did they go sir  towards briarfield mike followed them they seemed passing fieldhead when a column of smoke such as might be vomited by a park of artillery spread noiseless over the fields the road the common and rolled he said blue and dim to his very feet as it cleared away he looked again for the soldiers but they were vanished he saw them no more mike like a wise daniel as he is not only rehearsed the vision but gave the interpretation thereof it signifies he intimated bloodshed and civil conflict  do you credit it sir asked sweeting  do you davybut come malone why are you not off  i am rather surprised sir you did not stay with moore yourself you like this kind of thing  so i should have done had i not unfortunately happened to engage boultby to sup with me on his way home from the bible society meeting at nunnely i promised to send you as my substitute for which bythebye he did not thank me he would much rather have had me than you peter should there be any real need of help i shall join you the millbell will give warning meantime gounless turning suddenly to messrs sweeting and donneunless davy sweeting or joseph donne prefers goingwhat do you say gentlemen the commission is an honourable one not without the seasoning of a little real peril for the country is in a queer state as you all know and moore and his mill and his machinery are held in sufficient odium there are chivalric sentiments there is highbeating courage under those waistcoats of yours i doubt not perhaps i am too partial to my favourite peter little david shall be the champion or spotless josephmalone you are but a great floundering saul after all good only to lend your armour out with your firearms fetch your shillelah it is therein the corner  with a significant grin malone produced his pistols offering one to each of his brethren they were not readily seized on with graceful modesty each gentleman retired a step from the presented weapon  i never touch them i never did touch anything of the kind said mr donne  i am almost a stranger to mr moore murmured sweeting  if you never touched a pistol try the feel of it now great satrap of egypt as to the little minstrel he probably prefers encountering the philistines with no other weapon than his fluteget their hats peter theyll both of em go  no sir no mr helstone my mother wouldnt like it pleaded sweeting  and i make it a rule never to get mixed up in affairs of the kind observed donne  helstone smiled sardonically malone laughed a horselaugh he then replaced his arms took his hat and cudgel and saying that he never felt more in tune for a shindy in his life and that he wished a score of greasy clothdressers might beat up moores quarters that night he made his exit clearing the stairs at a stride or two and making the house shake with the bang of the frontdoor behind him     chapter ii  the wagons   the evening was pitch dark star and moon were quenched in gray raincloudsgray they would have been by day by night they looked sable malone was not a man given to close observation of nature her changes passed for the most part unnoticed by him he could walk miles on the most varying april day and never see the beautiful dallying of earth and heavennever mark when a sunbeam kissed the hilltops making them smile clear in green light or when a shower wept over them hiding their crests with the lowhanging dishevelled tresses of a cloud he did not therefore care to contrast the sky as it now appeareda muffled streaming vault all black save where towards the east the furnaces of stilbro ironworks threw a tremulous lurid shimmer on the horizonwith the same sky on an unclouded frosty night he did not trouble himself to ask where the constellations and the planets were gone or to regret the blackblue serenity of the airocean which those white islets stud and which another ocean of heavier and denser element now rolled below and concealed he just doggedly pursued his way leaning a little forward as he walked and wearing his hat on the back of his head as his irish manner was tramp tramp he went along the causeway where the road boasted the privilege of such an accommodation splash splash through the mirefilled cart ruts where the flags were exchanged for soft mud he looked but for certain landmarksthe spire of briarfield church farther on the lights of redhouse this was an inn and when he reached it the glow of a fire through a halfcurtained window a vision of glasses on a round table and of revellers on an oaken settle had nearly drawn aside the curate from his course he thought longingly of a tumbler of whiskyandwater in a strange place he would instantly have realized the dream but the company assembled in that kitchen were mr helstones own parishioners they all knew him he sighed and passed on  the highroad was now to be quitted as the remaining distance to hollows mill might be considerably reduced by a short cut across fields these fields were level and monotonous malone took a direct course through them jumping hedge and wall he passed but one building here and that seemed large and halllike though irregular you could see a high gable then a long front then a low gable then a thick lofty stack of chimneys there were some trees behind it it was dark not a candle shone from any window it was absolutely still the rain running from the eaves and the rather wild but very low whistle of the wind round the chimneys and through the boughs were the sole sounds in its neighbourhood  this building passed the fields hitherto flat declined in a rapid descent evidently a vale lay below through which you could hear the water run one light glimmered in the depth for that beacon malone steered  he came to a little white houseyou could see it was white even through this dense darknessand knocked at the door a freshfaced servant opened it by the candle she held was revealed a narrow passage terminating in a narrow stair two doors covered with crimson baize a strip of crimson carpet down the steps contrasted with lightcoloured walls and white floor made the little interior look clean and fresh  mr moore is at home i suppose  yes sir but he is not in  not in where is he then  at the millin the countinghouse  here one of the crimson doors opened  are the wagons come sarah asked a female voice and a female head at the same time was apparent it might not be the head of a goddessindeed a screw of curlpaper on each side the temples quite forbade that suppositionbut neither was it the head of a gorgon yet malone seemed to take it in the latter light big as he was he shrank bashfully back into the rain at the view thereof and saying ill go to him hurried in seeming trepidation down a short lane across an obscure yard towards a huge black mill  the workhours were over the hands were gone the machinery was at rest the mill shut up malone walked round it somewhere in its great sooty flank he found another chink of light he knocked at another door using for the purpose the thick end of his shillelah with which he beat a rousing tattoo a key turned the door unclosed  is it joe scott what news of the wagons joe  no its myself mr helstone would send me  oh mr malone the voice in uttering this name had the slightest possible cadence of disappointment after a moments pause it continued politely but a little formally  i beg you will come in mr malone i regret extremely mr helstone should have thought it necessary to trouble you so far there was no necessityi told him soand on such a night but walk forwards  through a dark apartment of aspect undistinguishable malone followed the speaker into a light and bright room withinvery light and bright indeed it seemed to eyes which for the last hour had been striving to penetrate the double darkness of night and fog but except for its excellent fire and for a lamp of elegant design and vivid lustre burning on a table it was a very plain place the boarded floor was carpetless the three or four stiffbacked greenpainted chairs seemed once to have furnished the kitchen of some farmhouse a desk of strong solid formation the table aforesaid and some framed sheets on the stonecoloured walls bearing plans for building for gardening designs of machinery etc completed the furniture of the place  plain as it was it seemed to satisfy malone who when he had removed and hung up his wet surtout and hat drew one of the rheumaticlooking chairs to the hearth and set his knees almost within the bars of the red grate  comfortable quarters you have here mr moore and all snug to yourself  yes but my sister would be glad to see you if you would prefer stepping into the house  oh no the ladies are best alone i never was a ladys man you dont mistake me for my friend sweeting do you mr moore  sweeting which of them is that the gentleman in the chocolate overcoat or the little gentleman  the little onehe of nunnely the cavalier of the misses sykes with the whole six of whom he is in love ha ha  better be generally in love with all than specially with one i should think in that quarter  but he is specially in love with one besides for when i and donne urged him to make a choice amongst the fair bevy he namedwhich do you think  with a queer quiet smile mr moore replied dora of course or harriet  ha ha youve an excellent guess but what made you hit on those two  because they are the tallest the handsomest and dora at least is the stoutest and as your friend mr sweeting is but a little slight figure i concluded that according to a frequent rule in such cases he preferred his contrast  you are right dora it is but he has no chance has he moore  what has mr sweeting besides his curacy  this question seemed to tickle malone amazingly he laughed for full three minutes before he answered it  what has sweeting why david has his harp or flute which comes to the same thing he has a sort of pinchbeck watch ditto ring ditto eyeglass thats what he has  how would he propose to keep miss sykes in gowns only  ha ha excellent ill ask him that next time i see him ill roast him for his presumption but no doubt he expects old christopher sykes would do something handsome he is rich is he not they live in a large house  sykes carries on an extensive concern  therefore he must be wealthy eh  therefore he must have plenty to do with his wealth and in these times would be about as likely to think of drawing money from the business to give dowries to his daughters as i should be to dream of pulling down the cottage there and constructing on its ruins a house as large as fieldhead  do you know what i heard moore the other day  no perhaps that i was about to effect some such change your briarfield gossips are capable of saying that or sillier things  that you were going to take fieldhead on a lease i thought it looked a dismal place bythebye tonight as i passed it and that it was your intention to settle a miss sykes there as mistressto be married in short ha ha now which is it dora i am sure you said she was the handsomest  i wonder how often it has been settled that i was to be married since i came to briarfield they have assigned me every marriageable single woman by turns in the district now it was the two misses wynnsfirst the dark then the light one now the redhaired miss armitage then the mature ann pearson at present you throw on my shoulders all the tribe of the misses sykes on what grounds this gossip rests god knows i visit nowhere i seek female society about as assiduously as you do mr malone if ever i go to whinbury it is only to give sykes or pearson a call in their countinghouse where our discussions run on other topics than matrimony and our thoughts are occupied with other things than courtships establishments dowries the cloth we cant sell the hands we cant employ the mills we cant run the perverse course of events generally which we cannot alter fill our hearts i take it pretty well at present to the tolerably complete exclusion of such figments as lovemaking etc  i go along with you completely moore if there is one notion i hate more than another it is that of marriagei mean marriage in the vulgar weak sense as a mere matter of sentimenttwo beggarly fools agreeing to unite their indigence by some fantastic tie of feeling humbug but an advantageous connection such as can be formed in consonance with dignity of views and permanency of solid interests is not so badeh  no responded moore in an absent manner the subject seemed to have no interest for him he did not pursue it after sitting for some time gazing at the fire with a preoccupied air he suddenly turned his head  hark said he did you hear wheels  rising he went to the window opened it and listened he soon closed it it is only the sound of the wind rising he remarked and the rivulet a little swollen rushing down the hollow i expected those wagons at six it is near nine now  seriously do you suppose that the putting up of this new machinery will bring you into danger inquired malone helstone seems to think it will  i only wish the machinesthe frameswere safe here and lodged within the walls of this mill once put up i defy the framebreakers let them only pay me a visit and take the consequences my mill is my castle  one despises such low scoundrels observed malone in a profound vein of reflection i almost wish a party would call upon you tonight but the road seemed extremely quiet as i came along i saw nothing astir  you came by the redhouse  yes  there would be nothing on that road it is in the direction of stilbro the risk lies  and you think there is risk  what these fellows have done to others they may do to me there is only this difference most of the manufacturers seem paralyzed when they are attacked sykes for instance when his dressingshop was set on fire and burned to the ground when the cloth was torn from his tenters and left in shreds in the field took no steps to discover or punish the miscreants he gave up as tamely as a rabbit under the jaws of a ferret now i if i know myself should stand by my trade my mill and my machinery  helstone says these three are your gods that the orders in council are with you another name for the seven deadly sins that castlereagh is your antichrist and the warparty his legions  yes i abhor all these things because they ruin me they stand in my way i cannot get on i cannot execute my plans because of them i see myself baffled at every turn by their untoward effects  but you are rich and thriving moore  i am very rich in cloth i cannot sell you should step into my warehouse yonder and observe how it is piled to the roof with pieces roakes and pearson are in the same condition america used to be their market but the orders in council have cut that off  malone did not seem prepared to carry on briskly a conversation of this sort he began to knock the heels of his boots together and to yawn  and then to think continued mr moore who seemed too much taken up with the current of his own thoughts to note the symptoms of his guests ennuito think that these ridiculous gossips of whinbury and briarfield will keep pestering one about being married as if there was nothing to be done in life but to pay attention as they say to some young lady and then to go to church with her and then to start on a bridal tour and then to run through a round of visits and then i suppose to be having a family oh que le diable emporte he broke off the aspiration into which he was launching with a certain energy and added more calmly i believe women talk and think only of these things and they naturally fancy mens minds similarly occupied  of courseof course assented malone but never mind them and he whistled looked impatiently round and seemed to feel a great want of something this time moore caught and it appeared comprehended his demonstrations  mr malone said he you must require refreshment after your wet walk i forget hospitality  not at all rejoined malone but he looked as if the right nail was at last hit on the head nevertheless moore rose and opened a cupboard  it is my fancy said he to have every convenience within myself and not to be dependent on the feminity in the cottage yonder for every mouthful i eat or every drop i drink i often spend the evening and sup here alone and sleep with joe scott in the mill sometimes i am my own watchman i require little sleep and it pleases me on a fine night to wander for an hour or two with my musket about the hollow mr malone can you cook a mutton chop  try me ive done it hundreds of times at college  theres a dishful then and theres the gridiron turn them quickly you know the secret of keeping the juices in  never fear me you shall see hand a knife and fork please  the curate turned up his coatcuffs and applied himself to the cookery with vigour the manufacturer placed on the table plates a loaf of bread a black bottle and two tumblers he then produced a small copper kettlestill from the same wellstored recess his cupboardfilled it with water from a large stone jar in a corner set it on the fire beside the hissing gridiron got lemons sugar and a small china punchbowl but while he was brewing the punch a tap at the door called him away  is it you sarah  yes sir will you come to supper please sir  no i shall not be in tonight i shall sleep in the mill so lock the doors and tell your mistress to go to bed  he returned  you have your household in proper order observed malone approvingly as with his fine face ruddy as the embers over which he bent he assiduously turned the mutton chops you are not under petticoat government like poor sweeting a manwhew how the fat spits it has burnt my handdestined to be ruled by women now you and i mooretheres a fine brown one for you and full of gravyyou and i will have no gray mares in our stables when we marry  i dont know i never think about it if the gray mare is handsome and tractable why not  the chops are done is the punch brewed  there is a glassful taste it when joe scott and his minions return they shall have a share of this provided they bring home the frames intact  malone waxed very exultant over the supper he laughed aloud at trifles made bad jokes and applauded them himself and in short grew unmeaningly noisy his host on the contrary remained quiet as before it is time reader that you should have some idea of the appearance of this same host i must endeavour to sketch him as he sits at table  he is what you would probably call at first view rather a strangelooking man for he is thin dark sallow very foreign of aspect with shadowy hair carelessly streaking his forehead it appears that he spends but little time at his toilet or he would arrange it with more taste he seems unconscious that his features are fine that they have a southern symmetry clearness regularity in their chiselling nor does a spectator become aware of this advantage till he has examined him well for an anxious countenance and a hollow somewhat haggard outline of face disturb the idea of beauty with one of care his eyes are large and grave and gray their expression is intent and meditative rather searching than soft rather thoughtful than genial when he parts his lips in a smile his physiognomy is agreeablenot that it is frank or cheerful even then but you feel the influence of a certain sedate charm suggestive whether truly or delusively of a considerate perhaps a kind nature of feelings that may wear well at homepatient forbearing possibly faithful feelings he is still youngnot more than thirty his stature is tall his figure slender his manner of speaking displeases he has an outlandish accent which notwithstanding a studied carelessness of pronunciation and diction grates on a british and especially on a yorkshire ear  mr moore indeed was but half a briton and scarcely that he came of a foreign ancestry by the mothers side and was himself born and partly reared on a foreign soil a hybrid in nature it is probable he had a hybrids feeling on many pointspatriotism for one it is likely that he was unapt to attach himself to parties to sects even to climes and customs it is not impossible that he had a tendency to isolate his individual person from any community amidst which his lot might temporarily happen to be thrown and that he felt it to be his best wisdom to push the interests of robert gérard moore to the exclusion of philanthropic consideration for general interests with which he regarded the said gérard moore as in a great measure disconnected trade was mr moores hereditary calling the gérards of antwerp had been merchants for two centuries back once they had been wealthy merchants but the uncertainties the involvements of business had come upon them disastrous speculations had loosened by degrees the foundations of their credit the house had stood on a tottering base for a dozen years and at last in the shock of the french revolution it had rushed down a total ruin in its fall was involved the english and yorkshire firm of moore closely connected with the antwerp house and of which one of the partners resident in antwerp robert moore had married hortense gérard with the prospect of his bride inheriting her father constantine gérards share in the business she inherited as we have seen but his share in the liabilities of the firm and these liabilities though duly set aside by a composition with creditors some said her son robert accepted in his turn as a legacy and that he aspired one day to discharge them and to rebuild the fallen house of gérard and moore on a scale at least equal to its former greatness it was even supposed that he took bypast circumstances much to heart and if a childhood passed at the side of a saturnine mother under foreboding of coming evil and a manhood drenched and blighted by the pitiless descent of the storm could painfully impress the mind his probably was impressed in no golden characters  if however he had a great end of restoration in view it was not in his power to employ great means for its attainment he was obliged to be content with the day of small things when he came to yorkshire hewhose ancestors had owned warehouses in this seaport and factories in that inland town had possessed their townhouse and their countryseatsaw no way open to him but to rent a clothmill in an outoftheway nook of an outoftheway district to take a cottage adjoining it for his residence and to add to his possessions as pasture for his horse and space for his clothtenters a few acres of the steep rugged land that lined the hollow through which his millstream brawled all this he held at a somewhat high rent for these war times were hard and everything was dear of the trustees of the fieldhead estate then the property of a minor  at the time this history commences robert moore had lived but two years in the district during which period he had at least proved himself possessed of the quality of activity the dingy cottage was converted into a neat tasteful residence of part of the rough land he had made gardenground which he cultivated with singular even with flemish exactness and care as to the mill which was an old structure and fitted up with old machinery now become inefficient and out of date he had from the first evinced the strongest contempt for all its arrangements and appointments his aim had been to effect a radical reform which he had executed as fast as his very limited capital would allow and the narrowness of that capital and consequent check on his progress was a restraint which galled his spirit sorely moore ever wanted to push on forward was the device stamped upon his soul but poverty curbed him sometimes figuratively he foamed at the mouth when the reins were drawn very tight  in this state of feeling it is not to be expected that he would deliberate much as to whether his advance was or was not prejudicial to others not being a native nor for any length of time a resident of the neighbourhood he did not sufficiently care when the new inventions threw the old workpeople out of employ he never asked himself where those to whom he no longer paid weekly wages found daily bread and in this negligence he only resembled thousands besides on whom the starving poor of yorkshire seemed to have a closer claim  the period of which i write was an overshadowed one in british history and especially in the history of the northern provinces war was then at its height europe was all involved therein england if not weary was worn with long resistanceyes and half her people were weary too and cried out for peace on any terms national honour was become a mere empty name of no value in the eyes of many because their sight was dim with famine and for a morsel of meat they would have sold their birthright  the orders in council provoked by napoleons milan and berlin decrees and forbidding neutral powers to trade with france had by offending america cut off the principal market of the yorkshire woollen trade and brought it consequently to the verge of ruin minor foreign markets were glutted and would receive no more the brazils portugal sicily were all overstocked by nearly two years consumption at this crisis certain inventions in machinery were introduced into the staple manufactures of the north which greatly reducing the number of hands necessary to be employed threw thousands out of work and left them without legitimate means of sustaining life a bad harvest supervened distress reached its climax endurance overgoaded stretched the hand of fraternity to sedition the throes of a sort of moral earthquake were felt heaving under the hills of the northern counties but as is usual in such cases nobody took much notice when a foodriot broke out in a manufacturing town when a gigmill was burnt to the ground or a manufacturers house was attacked the furniture thrown into the streets and the family forced to flee for their lives some local measures were or were not taken by the local magistracy a ringleader was detected or more frequently suffered to elude detection newspaper paragraphs were written on the subject and there the thing stopped as to the sufferers whose sole inheritance was labour and who had lost that inheritancewho could not get work and consequently could not get wages and consequently could not get breadthey were left to suffer on perhaps inevitably left it would not do to stop the progress of invention to damage science by discouraging its improvements the war could not be terminated efficient relief could not be raised there was no help then so the unemployed underwent their destinyate the bread and drank the waters of affliction  misery generates hate these sufferers hated the machines which they believed took their bread from them they hated the buildings which contained those machines they hated the manufacturers who owned those buildings in the parish of briarfield with which we have at present to do hollows mill was the place held most abominable gérard moore in his double character of semiforeigner and thoroughgoing progressist the man most abominated and it perhaps rather agreed with moores temperament than otherwise to be generally hated especially when he believed the thing for which he was hated a right and an expedient thing and it was with a sense of warlike excitement he on this night sat in his countinghouse waiting the arrival of his frameladen wagons malones coming and company were it may be most unwelcome to him he would have preferred sitting alone for he liked a silent sombre unsafe solitude his watchmans musket would have been company enough for him the fullflowing beck in the den would have delivered continuously the discourse most genial to his ear                                       with the queerest look in the world had the manufacturer for some ten minutes been watching the irish curate as the latter made free with the punch when suddenly that steady gray eye changed as if another vision came between it and malone moore raised his hand  chut he said in his french fashion as malone made a noise with his glass he listened a moment then rose put his hat on and went out at the countinghouse door  the night was still dark and stagnant the water yet rushed on full and fast its flow almost seemed a flood in the utter silence moores ear however caught another sound very distant but yet dissimilar broken and ruggedin short a sound of heavy wheels crunching a stony road he returned to the countinghouse and lit a lantern with which he walked down the millyard and proceeded to open the gates the big wagons were coming on the drayhorses huge hoofs were heard splashing in the mud and water moore hailed them  hey joe scott is all right  probably joe scott was yet at too great a distance to hear the inquiry he did not answer it  is all right i say again asked moore when the elephantlike leaders nose almost touched his  some one jumped out from the foremost wagon into the road a voice cried aloud ay ay divil alls raight weve smashed em  and there was a run the wagons stood still they were now deserted  joe scott no joe scott answered murgatroyd pighills sykes no reply mr moore lifted his lantern and looked into the vehicles there was neither man nor machinery they were empty and abandoned  now mr moore loved his machinery he had risked the last of his capital on the purchase of these frames and shears which tonight had been expected speculations most important to his interests depended on the results to be wrought by them where were they  the words weve smashed em rang in his ears how did the catastrophe affect him by the light of the lantern he held were his features visible relaxing to a singular smilethe smile the man of determined spirit wears when he reaches a juncture in his life where this determined spirit is to feel a demand on its strength when the strain is to be made and the faculty must bear or break yet he remained silent and even motionless for at the instant he neither knew what to say nor what to do he placed the lantern on the ground and stood with his arms folded gazing down and reflecting  an impatient trampling of one of the horses made him presently look up his eye in the moment caught the gleam of something white attached to a part of the harness examined by the light of the lantern this proved to be a folded papera billet it bore no address without within was the superscription  to the divil of hollows miln  we will not copy the rest of the orthography which was very peculiar but translate it into legible english it ran thus  your hellish machinery is shivered to smash on stilbro moor and your men are lying bound hand and foot in a ditch by the roadside take this as a warning from men that are starving and have starving wives and children to go home to when they have done this deed if you get new machines or if you otherwise go on as you have done you shall hear from us again beware  hear from you again yes ill hear from you again and you shall hear from me ill speak to you directly on stilbro moor you shall hear from me in a moment  having led the wagons within the gates he hastened towards the cottage opening the door he spoke a few words quickly but quietly to two females who ran to meet him in the passage he calmed the seeming alarm of one by a brief palliative account of what had taken place to the other he said go into the mill sarahthere is the keyand ring the millbell as loud as you can afterwards you will get another lantern and help me to light up the front  returning to his horses he unharnessed fed and stabled them with equal speed and care pausing occasionally while so occupied as if to listen for the millbell it clanged out presently with irregular but loud and alarming din the hurried agitated peal seemed more urgent than if the summons had been steadily given by a practised hand on that still night at that unusual hour it was heard a long way round the guests in the kitchen of the redhouse were startled by the clamour and declaring that there must be summat more nor common to do at hollows miln they called for lanterns and hurried to the spot in a body and scarcely had they thronged into the yard with their gleaming lights when the tramp of horses was heard and a little man in a shovel hat sitting erect on the back of a shaggy pony rode lightly in followed by an aidedecamp mounted on a larger steed  mr moore meantime after stabling his drayhorses had saddled his hackney and with the aid of sarah the servant lit up his mill whose wide and long front now glared one great illumination throwing a sufficient light on the yard to obviate all fear of confusion arising from obscurity already a deep hum of voices became audible mr malone had at length issued from the countinghouse previously taking the precaution to dip his head and face in the stone waterjug and this precaution together with the sudden alarm had nearly restored to him the possession of those senses which the punch had partially scattered he stood with his hat on the back of his head and his shillelah grasped in his dexter fist answering much at random the questions of the newlyarrived party from the redhouse mr moore now appeared and was immediately confronted by the shovel hat and the shaggy pony  well moore what is your business with us i thought you would want us tonightme and the hetman here patting his ponys neck and tom and his charger when i heard your millbell i could sit still no longer so i left boultby to finish his supper alone but where is the enemy i do not see a mask or a smutted face present and there is not a pane of glass broken in your windows have you had an attack or do you expect one  oh not at all i have neither had one nor expect one answered moore coolly i only ordered the bell to be rung because i want two or three neighbours to stay here in the hollow while i and a couple or so more go over to stilbro moor  to stilbro moor what to do to meet the wagons  the wagons are come home an hour ago  then alls right what more would you have  they came home empty and joe scott and company are left on the moor and so are the frames read that scrawl  mr helstone received and perused the document of which the contents have before been given  hum theyve only served you as they serve others but however the poor fellows in the ditch will be expecting help with some impatience this is a wet night for such a berth i and tom will go with you malone may stay behind and take care of the mill what is the matter with him his eyes seem starting out of his head  he has been eating a mutton chop  indeedpeter augustus be on your guard eat no more mutton chops tonight you are left here in command of these premisesan honourable post  is anybody to stay with me  as many of the present assemblage as choosemy lads how many of you will remain here and how many will go a little way with me and mr moore on the stilbro road to meet some men who have been waylaid and assaulted by framebreakers  the small number of three volunteered to go the rest preferred staying behind as mr moore mounted his horse the rector asked him in a low voice whether he had locked up the mutton chops so that peter augustus could not get at them the manufacturer nodded an affirmative and the rescueparty set out     chapter iii  mr yorke   cheerfulness it would appear is a matter which depends fully as much on the state of things within as on the state of things without and around us i make this trite remark because i happen to know that messrs helstone and moore trotted forth from the millyard gates at the head of their very small company in the best possible spirits when a ray from a lantern the three pedestrians of the party carried each one fell on mr moores face you could see an unusual because a lively spark dancing in his eyes and a newfound vivacity mantling on his dark physiognomy and when the rectors visage was illuminated his hard features were revealed all agrin and ashine with glee yet a drizzling night a somewhat perilous expedition you would think were not circumstances calculated to enliven those exposed to the wet and engaged in the adventure if any member or members of the crew who had been at work on stilbro moor had caught a view of this party they would have had great pleasure in shooting either of the leaders from behind a wall and the leaders knew this and the fact is being both men of steely nerves and steadybeating hearts were elate with the knowledge  i am aware reader and you need not remind me that it is a dreadful thing for a parson to be warlike i am aware that he should be a man of peace i have some faint outline of an idea of what a clergymans mission is amongst mankind and i remember distinctly whose servant he is whose message he delivers whose example he should follow yet with all this if you are a parsonhater you need not expect me to go along with you every step of your dismal downwardtending unchristian road you need not expect me to join in your deep anathemas at once so narrow and so sweeping in your poisonous rancour so intense and so absurd against the cloth to lift up my eyes and hands with a supplehough or to inflate my lungs with a barraclough in horror and denunciation of the diabolical rector of briarfield  he was not diabolical at all the evil simply washe had missed his vocation he should have been a soldier and circumstances had made him a priest for the rest he was a conscientious hardheaded hardhanded brave stern implacable faithful little man a man almost without sympathy ungentle prejudiced and rigid but a man true to principle honourable sagacious and sincere it seems to me reader that you cannot always cut out men to fit their profession and that you ought not to curse them because their profession sometimes hangs on them ungracefully nor will i curse helstone clerical cossack as he was yet he was cursed and by many of his own parishioners as by others he was adoredwhich is the frequent fate of men who show partiality in friendship and bitterness in enmity who are equally attached to principles and adherent to prejudices  helstone and moore being both in excellent spirits and united for the present in one cause you would expect that as they rode side by side they would converse amicably oh no these two men of hard bilious natures both rarely came into contact but they chafed each others moods their frequent bone of contention was the war helstone was a high tory there were tories in those days and moore was a bitter whiga whig at least as far as opposition to the warparty was concerned that being the question which affected his own interest and only on that question did he profess any british politics at all he liked to infuriate helstone by declaring his belief in the invincibility of bonaparte by taunting england and europe with the impotence of their efforts to withstand him and by coolly advancing the opinion that it was as well to yield to him soon as late since he must in the end crush every antagonist and reign supreme  helstone could not bear these sentiments it was only on the consideration of moore being a sort of outcast and alien and having but half measure of british blood to temper the foreign gall which corroded his veins that he brought himself to listen to them without indulging the wish he felt to cane the speaker another thing too somewhat allayed his disgustnamely a fellowfeeling for the dogged tone with which these opinions were asserted and a respect for the consistency of moores crabbed contumacy  as the party turned into the stilbro road they met what little wind there was the rain dashed in their faces moore had been fretting his companion previously and now braced up by the raw breeze and perhaps irritated by the sharp drizzle he began to goad him  does your peninsular news please you still he asked  what do you mean was the surly demand of the rector  i mean have you still faith in that baal of a lord wellington  and what do you mean now  do you still believe that this woodenfaced and pebblehearted idol of england has power to send fire down from heaven to consume the french holocaust you want to offer up  i believe wellington will flog bonapartes marshals into the sea the day it pleases him to lift his arm  but my dear sir you cant be serious in what you say bonapartes marshals are great men who act under the guidance of an omnipotent masterspirit your wellington is the most humdrum of commonplace martinets whose slow mechanical movements are further cramped by an ignorant home government  wellington is the soul of england wellington is the right champion of a good cause the fit representative of a powerful a resolute a sensible and an honest nation  your good cause as far as i understand it is simply the restoration of that filthy feeble ferdinand to a throne which he disgraced your fit representative of an honest people is a dullwitted drover acting for a dullerwitted farmer and against these are arrayed victorious supremacy and invincible genius  against legitimacy is arrayed usurpation against modest singleminded righteous and brave resistance to encroachment is arrayed boastful doubletongued selfish and treacherous ambition to possess god defend the right  god often defends the powerful  what i suppose the handful of israelites standing dryshod on the asiatic side of the red sea was more powerful than the host of the egyptians drawn up on the african side were they more numerous were they better appointed were they more mighty in a wordeh dont speak or youll tell a lie moore you know you will they were a poor overwrought band of bondsmen tyrants had oppressed them through four hundred years a feeble mixture of women and children diluted their thin ranks their masters who roared to follow them through the divided flood were a set of pampered ethiops about as strong and brutal as the lions of libya they were armed horsed and charioted the poor hebrew wanderers were afoot few of them it is likely had better weapons than their shepherds crooks or their masons buildingtools their meek and mighty leader himself had only his rod but bethink you robert moore right was with them the god of battles was on their side crime and the lost archangel generalled the ranks of pharaoh and which triumphed we know that well the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the seashoreyea the depths covered them they sank to the bottom as a stone the right hand of the lord became glorious in power the right hand of the lord dashed in pieces the enemy  you are all right only you forget the true parallel france is israel and napoleon is moses europe with her old overgorged empires and rotten dynasties is corrupt egypt gallant france is the twelve tribes and her fresh and vigorous usurper the shepherd of horeb  i scorn to answer you  moore accordingly answered himselfat least he subjoined to what he had just said an additional observation in a lower voice  oh in italy he was as great as any moses he was the right thing there fit to head and organize measures for the regeneration of nations it puzzles me to this day how the conqueror of lodi should have condescended to become an emperor a vulgar a stupid humbug and still more how a people who had once called themselves republicans should have sunk again to the grade of mere slaves i despise france if england had gone as far on the march of civilization as france did she would hardly have retreated so shamelessly  you dont mean to say that besotted imperial france is any worse than bloody republican france demanded helstone fiercely  i mean to say nothing but i can think what i please you know mr helstone both about france and england and about revolutions and regicides and restorations in general and about the divine right of kings which you often stickle for in your sermons and the duty of nonresistance and the sanity of war and  mr moores sentence was here cut short by the rapid rolling up of a gig and its sudden stoppage in the middle of the road both he and the rector had been too much occupied with their discourse to notice its approach till it was close upon them  nah maister did th wagons hit home demanded a voice from the vehicle  can that be joe scott  ay ay returned another voice for the gig contained two persons as was seen by the glimmer of its lamp the men with the lanterns had now fallen into the rear or rather the equestrians of the rescueparty had outridden the pedestrians ay mr moore its joe scott im bringing him back to you in a bonny pickle i fand him on the top of the moor yonder him and three others what will you give me for restoring him to you  why my thanks i believe for i could better have afforded to lose a better man that is you i suppose mr yorke by your voice  ay lad its me i was coming home from stilbro market and just as i got to the middle of the moor and was whipping on as swift as the wind for these they say are not safe times thanks to a bad government i heard a groan i

am greatly obliged to you mr yorke  are you my lad you know youre not however here are the rest approaching and here by the lord is another set with lights in their pitchers like the army of gideon and as weve th parson wi usgoodevening mr helstonewese do  mr helstone returned the salutation of the individual in the gig very stiffly indeed that individual proceeded  were eleven strong men and theres both horses and chariots amang us if we could only fall in wi some of these starved ragamuffins of framebreakers we could win a grand victory we could ivry one be a wellingtonthat would please ye mr helstoneand sich paragraphs as we could contrive for t papers briarfield suld be famous but wese hev a column and a half i th stilbro courier ower this job as it is i dare say ise expect no less  and ill promise you no less mr yorke for ill write the article myself returned the rector  to be suresartainly and mind ye recommend weel that them at brake t bits o frames and teed joe scotts legs wi band suld be hung without benefit o clergy its a hanging matter or suld be no doubt o that  if i judged them id give them short shrift cried moore but i mean to let them quite alone this bout to give them rope enough certain that in the end they will hang themselves  let them alone will ye moore do you promise that  promise no all i mean to say is i shall give myself no particular trouble to catch them but if one falls in my way  youll snap him up of course only you would rather they would do something worse than merely stop a wagon before you reckon with them well well say no more on the subject at present here we are at my door gentlemen and i hope you and the men will step in you will none of you be the worse of a little refreshment  moore and helstone opposed this proposition as unnecessary it was however pressed on them so courteously and the night besides was so inclement and the gleam from the muslincurtained windows of the house before which they had halted looked so inviting that at length they yielded mr yorke after having alighted from his gig which he left in charge of a man who issued from an outbuilding on his arrival led the way in  it will have been remarked that mr yorke varied a little in his phraseology now he spoke broad yorkshire and anon he expressed himself in very pure english his manner seemed liable to equal alternations he could be polite and affable and he could be blunt and rough his station then you could not easily determine by his speech and demeanour perhaps the appearance of his residence may decide it  the men he recommended to take the kitchen way saying that he would see them served wi summat to taste presently the gentlemen were ushered in at the front entrance they found themselves in a matted hall lined almost to the ceiling with pictures through this they were conducted to a large parlour with a magnificent fire in the gratethe most cheerful of rooms it appeared as a whole and when you came to examine details the enlivening effect was not diminished there was no splendour but there was taste everywhere unusual tastethe taste you would have said of a travelled man a scholar and a gentleman a series of italian views decked the walls each of these was a specimen of true art a connoisseur had selected them they were genuine and valuable even by candlelight the bright clear skies the soft distances with blue air quivering between the eye and the hills the fresh tints and wellmassed lights and shadows charmed the view the subjects were all pastoral the scenes were all sunny there was a guitar and some music on a sofa there were cameos beautiful miniatures a set of grecianlooking vases on the mantelpiece there were books well arranged in two elegant bookcases  mr yorke bade his guests be seated he then rang for wine to the servant who brought it he gave hospitable orders for the refreshment of the men in the kitchen the rector remained standing he seemed not to like his quarters he would not touch the wine his host offered him  een as you will remarked mr yorke i reckon youre thinking of eastern customs mr helstone and youll not eat nor drink under my roof feared we suld be forced to be friends but i am not so particular or superstitious you might sup the contents of that decanter and you might give me a bottle of the best in your own cellar and id hold myself free to oppose you at every turn stillin every vestrymeeting and justicemeeting where we encountered one another  it is just what i should expect of you mr yorke  does it agree wi ye now mr helstone to be riding out after rioters of a wet night at your age  it always agrees with me to be doing my duty and in this case my duty is a thorough pleasure to hunt down vermin is a noble occupation fit for an archbishop  fit for ye at ony rate but wheres t curate hes happen gone to visit some poor body in a sick gird or hes happen hunting down vermin in another direction  he is doing garrisonduty at hollows mill  you left him a sup o wine i hope bob turning to mr moore to keep his courage up  he did not pause for an answer but continued quickly still addressing moore who had thrown himself into an oldfashioned chair by the firesidemove it robert get up my lad that place is mine take the sofa or three other chairs if you will but not this it belangs to me and nobdy else  why are you so particular to that chair mr yorke asked moore lazily vacating the place in obedience to orders  my father war afore me and thats all t answer i sall gie thee and its as good a reason as mr helstone can give for the main feck o his notions  moore are you ready to go inquired the rector  nay roberts not ready or rather im not ready to part wi him hes an ill lad and wants correcting  why sir what have i done  made thyself enemies on every hand  what do i care for that what difference does it make to me whether your yorkshire louts hate me or like me  ay there it is the lad is a mak of an alien amang us his father would never have talked i that waygo back to antwerp where you were born and bred mauvaise tête  mauvaise tête vousmême je ne fais que mon devoir quant à vos lourdauds de paysans je men moque  en ravanche mon garçon nos lourdauds de paysans se moqueront de toi sois en certain replied yorke speaking with nearly as pure a french accent as gérard moore  cest bon cest bon et puisque cela mest égal que mes amis ne sen inquiètent pas  tes amis où sontils tes amis  je fais écho où sontils et je suis fort aise que lécho seul y répond au diable les amis je me souviens encore du moment où mon père et mes oncles gérard appellèrent autour deux leurs amis et dieu sait si les amis se sont empressés daccourir à leur secours tenez m yorke ce mot ami mirrite trop ne men parlez plus  comme tu voudras  and here mr yorke held his peace and while he sits leaning back in his threecornered carved oak chair i will snatch my opportunity to sketch the portrait of this frenchspeaking yorkshire gentleman     chapter iv  mr yorke continued   a yorkshire gentleman he was par excellence in every point about fiftyfive years old but looking at first sight still older for his hair was silver white his forehead was broad not high his face fresh and hale the harshness of the north was seen in his features as it was heard in his voice every trait was thoroughly englishnot a norman line anywhere it was an inelegant unclassic unaristocratic mould of visage fine people would perhaps have called it vulgar sensible people would have termed it characteristic shrewd people would have delighted in it for the pith sagacity intelligence the rude yet real originality marked in every lineament latent in every furrow but it was an indocile a scornful and a sarcastic facethe face of a man difficult to lead and impossible to drive his stature was rather tall and he was well made and wiry and had a stately integrity of port there was not a suspicion of the clown about him anywhere  i did not find it easy to sketch mr yorkes person but it is more difficult to indicate his mind if you expect to be treated to a perfection reader or even to a benevolent philanthropic old gentleman in him you are mistaken he has spoken with some sense and with some good feeling to mr moore but you are not thence to conclude that he always spoke and thought justly and kindly  mr yorke in the first place was without the organ of venerationa great want and which throws a man wrong on every point where veneration is required secondly he was without the organ of comparisona deficiency which strips a man of sympathy and thirdly he had too little of the organs of benevolence and ideality which took the glory and softness from his nature and for him diminished those divine qualities throughout the universe  the want of veneration made him intolerant to those above himkings and nobles and priests dynasties and parliaments and establishments with all their doings most of their enactments their forms their rights their claims were to him an abomination all rubbish he found no use or pleasure in them and believed it would be clear gain and no damage to the world if its high places were razed and their occupants crushed in the fall the want of veneration too made him dead at heart to the electric delight of admiring what is admirable it dried up a thousand pure sources of enjoyment it withered a thousand vivid pleasures he was not irreligious though a member of no sect but his religion could not be that of one who knows how to venerate he believed in god and heaven but his god and heaven were those of a man in whom awe imagination and tenderness lack  the weakness of his powers of comparison made him inconsistent while he professed some excellent general doctrines of mutual toleration and forbearance he cherished towards certain classes a bigoted antipathy he spoke of parsons and all who belonged to parsons of lords and the appendages of lords with a harshness sometimes an insolence as unjust as it was insufferable he could not place himself in the position of those he vituperated he could not compare their errors with their temptations their defects with their disadvantages he could not realize the effect of such and such circumstances on himself similarly situated and he would often express the most ferocious and tyrannical wishes regarding those who had acted as he thought ferociously and tyrannically to judge by his threats he would have employed arbitrary even cruel means to advance the cause of freedom and equality equality yes mr yorke talked about equality but at heart he was a proud manvery friendly to his workpeople very good to all who were beneath him and submitted quietly to be beneath him but haughty as beelzebub to whomsoever the world deemed for he deemed no man his superior revolt was in his blood he could not bear control his father his grandfather before him could not bear it and his children after him never could  the want of general benevolence made him very impatient of imbecility and of all faults which grated on his strong shrewd nature it left no check to his cutting sarcasm as he was not merciful he would sometimes wound and wound again without noticing how much he hurt or caring how deep he thrust  as to the paucity of ideality in his mind that can scarcely be called a fault a fine ear for music a correct eye for colour and form left him the quality of taste and who cares for imagination who does not think it a rather dangerous senseless attribute akin to weakness perhaps partaking of frenzya disease rather than a gift of the mind  probably all think it so but those who possess or fancy they possess it to hear them speak you would believe that their hearts would be cold if that elixir did not flow about them that their eyes would be dim if that flame did not refine their vision that they would be lonely if this strange companion abandoned them you would suppose that it imparted some glad hope to spring some fine charm to summer some tranquil joy to autumn some consolation to winter which you do not feel an illusion of course but the fanatics cling to their dream and would not give it for gold  as mr yorke did not possess poetic imagination himself he considered it a most superfluous quality in others painters and musicians he could tolerate and even encourage because he could relish the results of their art he could see the charm of a fine picture and feel the pleasure of good music but a quiet poetwhatever force struggled whatever fire glowed in his breastif he could not have played the man in the countinghouse of the tradesman in the piece hall might have lived despised and died scorned under the eyes of hiram yorke  and as there are many hiram yorkes in the world it is well that the true poet quiet externally though he may be has often a truculent spirit under his placidity and is full of shrewdness in his meekness and can measure the whole stature of those who look down on him and correctly ascertain the weight and value of the pursuits they disdain him for not having followed it is happy that he can have his own bliss his own society with his great friend and goddess nature quite independent of those who find little pleasure in him and in whom he finds no pleasure at all it is just that while the world and circumstances often turn a dark cold side to himand properly too because he first turns a dark cold careless side to themhe should be able to maintain a festal brightness and cherishing glow in his bosom which makes all bright and genial for him while strangers perhaps deem his existence a polar winter never gladdened by a sun the true poet is not one whit to be pitied and he is apt to laugh in his sleeve when any misguided sympathizer whines over his wrongs even when utilitarians sit in judgment on him and pronounce him and his art useless he hears the sentence with such a hard derision such a broad deep comprehensive and merciless contempt of the unhappy pharisees who pronounce it that he is rather to be chidden than condoled with these however are not mr yorkes reflections and it is with mr yorke we have at present to do  i have told you some of his faults reader as to his good points he was one of the most honourable and capable men in yorkshire even those who disliked him were forced to respect him he was much beloved by the poor because he was thoroughly kind and very fatherly to them to his workmen he was considerate and cordial when he dismissed them from an occupation he would try to set them on to something else or if that was impossible help them to remove with their families to a district where work might possibly be had it must also be remarked that if as sometimes chanced any individual amongst his hands showed signs of insubordination yorkewho like many who abhor being controlled knew how to control with vigourhad the secret of crushing rebellion in the germ of eradicating it like a bad weed so that it never spread or developed within the sphere of his authority such being the happy state of his own affairs he felt himself at liberty to speak with the utmost severity of those who were differently situated to ascribe whatever was unpleasant in their position entirely to their own fault to sever himself from the masters and advocate freely the cause of the operatives  mr yorkes family was the first and oldest in the district and he though not the wealthiest was one of the most influential men his education had been good in his youth before the french revolution he had travelled on the continent he was an adept in the french and italian languages during a two years sojourn in italy he had collected many good paintings and tasteful rarities with which his residence was now adorned his manners when he liked were those of a finished gentleman of the old school his conversation when he was disposed to please was singularly interesting and original and if he usually expressed himself in the yorkshire dialect it was because he chose to do so preferring his native doric to a more refined vocabulary a yorkshire burr he affirmed was as much better than a cockneys lisp as a bulls bellow than a ratons squeak  mr yorke knew every one and was known by every one for miles round yet his intimate acquaintances were very few himself thoroughly original he had no taste for what was ordinary a racy rough character high or low ever found acceptance with him a refined insipid personage however exalted in station was his aversion he would spend an hour any time in talking freely with a shrewd workman of his own or with some queer sagacious old woman amongst his cottagers when he would have grudged a moment to a commonplace fine gentleman or to the most fashionable and elegant if frivolous lady his preferences on these points he carried to an extreme forgetting that there may be amiable and even admirable characters amongst those who cannot be original yet he made exceptions to his own rule there was a certain order of mind plain ingenuous neglecting refinement almost devoid of intellectuality and quite incapable of appreciating what was intellectual in him but which at the same time never felt disgust at his rudeness was not easily wounded by his sarcasm did not closely analyze his sayings doings or opinions with which he was peculiarly at ease and consequently which he peculiarly preferred he was lord amongst such characters they while submitting implicitly to his influence never acknowledged because they never reflected on his superiority they were quite tractable therefore without running the smallest danger of being servile and their unthinking easy artless insensibility was as acceptable because as convenient to mr yorke as that of the chair he sat on or of the floor he trod  it will have been observed that he was not quite uncordial with mr moore he had two or three reasons for entertaining a faint partiality to that gentleman it may sound odd but the first of these was that moore spoke english with a foreign and french with a perfectly pure accent and that his dark thin face with its fine though rather wasted lines had a most antibritish and antiyorkshire look these points seem frivolous unlikely to influence a character like yorkes but the fact is they recalled old perhaps pleasurable associationsthey brought back his travelling his youthful days he had seen amidst italian cities and scenes faces like moores he had heard in parisian cafés and theatres voices like his he was young then and when he looked at and listened to the alien he seemed young again  secondly he had known moores father and had had dealings with him that was a more substantial though by no means a more agreeable tie for as his firm had been connected with moores in business it had also in some measure been implicated in its losses  thirdly he had found robert himself a sharp man of business he saw reason to anticipate that he would in the end by one means or another make money and he respected both his resolution and acutenessperhaps also his hardness a fourth circumstance which drew them together was that of mr yorke being one of the guardians of the minor on whose estate hollows mill was situated consequently moore in the course of his alterations and improvements had frequent occasion to consult him  as to the other guest now present in mr yorkes parlour mr helstone between him and his host there existed a double antipathythe antipathy of nature and that of circumstances the freethinker hated the formalist the lover of liberty detested the disciplinarian besides it was said that in former years they had been rival suitors of the same lady  mr yorke as a general rule was when young noted for his preference of sprightly and dashing women a showy shape and air a lively wit a ready tongue chiefly seemed to attract him he never however proposed to any of these brilliant belles whose society he sought and all at once he seriously fell in love with and eagerly wooed a girl who presented a complete contrast to those he had hitherto noticeda girl with the face of a madonna a girl of living marblestillness personified no matter that when he spoke to her she only answered him in monosyllables no matter that his sighs seemed unheard that his glances were unreturned that she never responded to his opinions rarely smiled at his jests paid him no respect and no attention no matter that she seemed the opposite of everything feminine he had ever in his whole life been known to admire for him mary cave was perfect because somehow for some reasonno doubt he had a reasonhe loved her  mr helstone at that time curate of briarfield loved mary tooor at any rate he fancied her several others admired her for she was beautiful as a monumental angel but the clergyman was preferred for his offices sakethat office probably investing him with some of the illusion necessary to allure to the commission of matrimony and which miss cave did not find in any of the young woolstaplers her other adorers mr helstone neither had nor professed to have mr yorkes absorbing passion for her he had none of the humble reverence which seemed to subdue most of her suitors he saw her more as she really was than the rest did he was consequently more master of her and himself she accepted him at the first offer and they were married  nature never intended mr helstone to make a very good husband especially to a quiet wife he thought so long as a woman was silent nothing ailed her and she wanted nothing if she did not complain of solitude solitude however continued could not be irksome to her if she did not talk and put herself forward express a partiality for this an aversion to that she had no partialities or aversions and it was useless to consult her tastes he made no pretence of comprehending women or comparing them with men they were a different probably a very inferior order of existence a wife could not be her husbands companion much less his confidante much less his stay his wife after a year or two was of no great importance to him in any shape and when she one day as he thought suddenlyfor he had scarcely noticed her declinebut as others thought gradually took her leave of him and of life and there was only a still beautifulfeatured mould of clay left cold and white in the conjugal couch he felt his bereavementwho shall say how little yet perhaps more than he seemed to feel it for he was not a man from whom grief easily wrung tears  his dryeyed and sober mourning scandalized an old housekeeper and likewise a female attendant who had waited upon mrs helstone in her sickness and who perhaps had had opportunities of learning more of the deceased ladys nature of her capacity for feeling and loving than her husband knew they gossiped together over the corpse related anecdotes with embellishments of her lingering decline and its real or supposed cause in short they worked each other up to some indignation against the austere little man who sat examining papers in an adjoining room unconscious of what opprobrium he was the object  mrs helstone was hardly under the sod when rumours began to be rife in the neighbourhood that she had died of a broken heart these magnified quickly into reports of hard usage and finally details of harsh treatment on the part of her husbandreports grossly untrue but not the less eagerly received on that account mr yorke heard them partly believed them already of course he had no friendly feeling to his successful rival though himself a married man now and united to a woman who seemed a complete contrast to mary cave in all respects he could not forget the great disappointment of his life and when he heard that what would have been so precious to him had been neglected perhaps abused by another he conceived for that other a rooted and bitter animosity  of the nature and strength of this animosity mr helstone was but half aware he neither knew how much yorke had loved mary cave what he had felt on losing her nor was he conscious of the calumnies concerning his treatment of her familiar to every ear in the neighbourhood but his own he believed political and religious differences alone separated him and mr yorke had he known how the case really stood he would hardly have been induced by any persuasion to cross his former rivals threshold                                       mr yorke did not resume his lecture of robert moore the conversation ere long recommenced in a more general form though still in a somewhat disputative tone the unquiet state of the country the various depredations lately committed on millproperty in the district supplied abundant matter for disagreement especially as each of the three gentlemen present differed more or less in his views on these subjects mr helstone thought the masters aggrieved the workpeople unreasonable he condemned sweepingly the widespread spirit of disaffection against constituted authorities the growing indisposition to bear with patience evils he regarded as inevitable the cures he prescribed were vigorous government interference strict magisterial vigilance when necessary prompt military coercion  mr yorke wished to know whether this interference vigilance and coercion would feed those who were hungry give work to those who wanted work and whom no man would hire he scouted the idea of inevitable evils he said public patience was a camel on whose back the last atom that could be borne had already been laid and that resistance was now a duty the widespread spirit of disaffection against constituted authorities he regarded as the most promising sign of the times the masters he allowed were truly aggrieved but their main grievances had been heaped on them by a corrupt base and bloody government these were mr yorkes epithets madmen like pitt demons like castlereagh mischievous idiots like perceval were the tyrants the curses of the country the destroyers of her trade it was their infatuated perseverance in an unjustifiable a hopeless a ruinous war which had brought the nation to its present pass it was their monstrously oppressive taxation it was the infamous orders in councilthe originators of which deserved impeachment and the scaffold if ever public men didthat hung a millstone about englands neck  but where was the use of talking he demanded what chance was there of reason being heard in a land that was kingridden priestridden peerridden where a lunatic was the nominal monarch an unprincipled debauchee the real ruler where such an insult to common sense as hereditary legislators was tolerated where such a humbug as a bench of bishops such an arrogant abuse as a pampered persecuting established church was endured and venerated where a standing army was maintained and a host of lazy parsons and their pauper families were kept on the fat of the land  mr helstone rising up and putting on his shovelhat observed in reply that in the course of his life he had met with two or three instances where sentiments of this sort had been very bravely maintained so long as health strength and worldly prosperity had been the allies of him who professed them but there came a time he said to all men when the keepers of the house should tremble when they should be afraid of that which is high and fear should be in the way and that time was the test of the advocate of anarchy and rebellion the enemy of religion and order ere now he affirmed he had been called upon to read those prayers our church has provided for the sick by the miserable dyingbed of one of her most rancorous foes he had seen such a one stricken with remorse solicitous to discover a place for repentance and unable to find any though he sought it carefully with tears he must forewarn mr yorke that blasphemy against god and the king was a deadly sin and that there was such a thing as judgment to come  mr yorke believed fully that there was such a thing as judgment to come if it were otherwise it would be difficult to imagine how all the scoundrels who seemed triumphant in this world who broke innocent hearts with impunity abused unmerited privileges were a scandal to honourable callings took the bread out of the mouths of the poor browbeat the humble and truckled meanly to the rich and proud were to be properly paid off in such coin as they had earned but he added whenever he got lowspirited about suchlike goingson and their seeming success in this mucky lump of a planet he just reached down t owd book pointing to a great bible in the bookcase opened it like at a chance and he was sure to light of a verse blazing wi a blue brimstone low that set all straight he knew he said where some folk war bound for just as weel as if an angel wi great white wings had come in ower t doorstone and told him  sir said mr helstone collecting all his dignitysir the great knowledge of man is to know himself and the bourne whither his own steps tend  ay ay youll recollect mr helstone that ignorance was carried away from the very gates of heaven borne through the air and thrust in at a door in the side of the hill which led down to hell  nor have i forgotten mr yorke that vainconfidence not seeing the way before him fell into a deep pit which was on purpose there made by the prince of the grounds to catch vainglorious fools withal and was dashed to pieces with his fall  now interposed mr moore who had hitherto sat a silent but amused spectator of this worldly combat and whose indifference to the party politics of the day as well as to the gossip of the neighbourhood made him an impartial if apathetic judge of the merits of such an encounter you have both sufficiently blackballed each other and proved how cordially you detest each other and how wicked you think each other for my part my hate is still running in such a strong current against the fellows who have broken my frames that i have none to spare for my private acquaintance and still less for such a vague thing as a sect or a government but really gentlemen you both seem very bad by your own showingworse than ever i suspected you to bei dare not stay all night with a rebel and blasphemer like you yorke and i hardly dare ride home with a cruel and tyrannical ecclesiastic like mr helstone  i am going however mr moore said the rector sternly come with me or not as you please  nay he shall not have the choice he shall go with you responded yorke its midnight and past and ill have nobdy staying up i my house any longer ye mun all go  he rang the bell  deb said he to the servant who answered it clear them folk out o t kitchen and lock t doors and be off to bedhere is your way gentlemen he continued to his guests and lighting them through the passage he fairly put them out at his front door  they met their party hurrying out pellmell by the back way their horses stood at the gate they mounted and rode off moore laughing at their abrupt dismissal helstone deeply indignant thereat     chapter v  hollows cottage   moores good spirits were still with him when he rose next morning he and joe scott had both spent the night in the mill availing themselves of certain sleeping accommodations producible from recesses in the front and back countinghouses the master always an early riser was up somewhat sooner even than usual he awoke his man by singing a french song as he made his toilet  yere not custen dahn then maister cried joe  not a stiver mon

thats better  youre a great manyoure a sublime fellow but youre a prig a conceited noodle with it all joe you need not to think that because youve picked up a little knowledge of practical mathematics and because you have found some scantling of the elements of chemistry at the bottom of a dyeing vat that therefore youre a neglected man of science and you need not to suppose that because the course of trade does not always run smooth and you and such as you are sometimes short of work and of bread that therefore your class are martyrs and that the whole form of government under which you live is wrong and moreover you need not for a moment to insinuate that the virtues have taken refuge in cottages and wholly abandoned slated houses let me tell you i particularly abominate that sort of trash because i know so well that human nature is human nature everywhere whether under tile or thatch and that in every specimen of human nature that breathes vice and virtue are ever found blended in smaller or greater proportions and that the proportion is not determined by station i have seen villains who were rich and i have seen villains who were poor and i have seen villains who were neither rich nor poor but who had realized agars wish and lived in fair and modest competency the clock is going to strike six away with you joe and ring the mill bell  it was now the middle of the month of february by six oclock therefore dawn was just beginning to steal on night to penetrate with a pale ray its brown obscurity and give a demitranslucence to its opaque shadows pale enough that ray was on this particular morning no colour tinged the east no flush warmed it to see what a heavy lid day slowly lifted what a wan glance she flung along the hills you would have thought the suns fire quenched in last nights floods the breath of this morning was chill as its aspect a raw wind stirred the mass of nightcloud and showed as it slowly rose leaving a colourless silvergleaming ring all round the horizon not blue sky but a stratum of paler vapour beyond it had ceased to rain but the earth was sodden and the pools and rivulets were full  the millwindows were alight the bell still rung loud and now the little children came running in in too great a hurry let us hope to feel very much nipped by the inclement air and indeed by contrast perhaps the morning appeared rather favourable to them than otherwise for they had often come to their work that winter through snowstorms through heavy rain through hard frost  mr moore stood at the entrance to watch them pass he counted them as they went by to those who came rather late he said a word of reprimand which was a little more sharply repeated by joe scott when the lingerers reached the workrooms neither master nor overlooker spoke savagely they were not savage men either of them though it appeared both were rigid for they fined a delinquent who came considerably too late mr moore made him pay his penny down ere he entered and informed him that the next repetition of the fault would cost him twopence  rules no doubt are necessary in such cases and coarse and cruel masters will make coarse and cruel rules which at the time we treat of at least they used sometimes to enforce tyrannically but though i describe imperfect characters every character in this book will be found to be more or less imperfect my pen refusing to draw anything in the model line i have not undertaken to handle degraded or utterly infamous ones childtorturers slave masters and drivers i consign to the hands of jailers the novelist may be excused from sullying his page with the record of their deeds  instead then of harrowing up my readers soul and delighting his organ of wonder with effective descriptions of stripes and scourgings i am happy to be able to inform him that neither mr moore nor his overlooker ever struck a child in their mill joe had indeed once very severely flogged a son of his own for telling a lie and persisting in it but like his employer he was too phlegmatic too calm as well as too reasonable a man to make corporal chastisement other than the exception to his treatment of the young  mr moore haunted his mill his millyard his dyehouse and his warehouse till the sickly dawn strengthened into day the sun even roseat least a white disc clear tintless and almost chilllooking as ice peeped over the dark crest of a hill changed to silver the livid edge of the cloud above it and looked solemnly down the whole length of the den or narrow dale to whose strait bounds we are at present limited it was eight oclock the mill lights were all extinguished the signal was given for breakfast the children released for half an hour from toil betook themselves to the little tin cans which held their coffee and to the small baskets which contained their allowance of bread let us hope they have enough to eat it would be a pity were it otherwise  and now at last mr moore quitted the millyard and bent his steps to his dwellinghouse it was only a short distance from the factory but the hedge and high bank on each side of the lane which conducted to it seemed to give it something of the appearance and feeling of seclusion it was a small whitewashed place with a green porch over the door scanty brown stalks showed in the garden soil near this porch and likewise beneath the windowsstalks budless and flowerless now but giving dim prediction of trained and blooming creepers for summer days a grass plat and borders fronted the cottage the borders presented only black mould yet except where in sheltered nooks the first shoots of snowdrop or crocus peeped green as emerald from the earth the spring was late it had been a severe and prolonged winter the last deep snow had but just disappeared before yesterdays rains on the hills indeed white remnants of it yet gleamed flecking the hollows and crowning the peaks the lawn was not verdant but bleached as was the grass on the bank and under the hedge in the lane three trees gracefully grouped rose beside the cottage they were not lofty but having no rivals near they looked well and imposing where they grew such was mr moores homea snug nest for content and contemplation but one within which the wings of action and ambition could not long lie folded  its air of modest comfort seemed to possess no particular attraction for its owner instead of entering the house at once he fetched a spade from a little shed and began to work in the garden for about a quarter of an hour he dug on uninterrupted at length however a window opened and a female voice called to him  eh bien tu ne déjeûnes pas ce matin  the answer and the rest of the conversation was in french but as this is an english book i shall translate it into english  is breakfast ready hortense  certainly it has been ready half an hour  then i am ready too i have a canine hunger  he threw down his spade and entered the house the narrow passage conducted him to a small parlour where a breakfast of coffee and bread and butter with the somewhat unenglish accompaniment of stewed pears was spread on the table over these viands presided the lady who had spoken from the window i must describe her before i go any farther  she seemed a little older than mr mooreperhaps she was thirtyfive tall and proportionately stout she had very black hair for the present twisted up in curlpapers a high colour in her cheeks a small nose a pair of little black eyes the lower part of her face was large in proportion to the upper her forehead was small and rather corrugated she had a fretful though not an illnatured expression of countenance there was something in her whole appearance one felt inclined to be half provoked with and half amused at the strangest point was her dressa stuff petticoat and a striped cotton camisole the petticoat was short displaying well a pair of feet and ankles which left much to be desired in the article of symmetry  you will think i have depicted a remarkable slattern reader not at all hortense moore she was mr moores sister was a very orderly economical person the petticoat camisole and curlpapers were her morning costume in which of forenoons she had always been accustomed to go her household ways in her own country she did not choose to adopt english fashions because she was obliged to live in england she adhered to her old belgian modes quite satisfied that there was a merit in so doing  mademoiselle had an excellent opinion of herselfan opinion not wholly undeserved for she possessed some good and sterling qualities but she rather overestimated the kind and degree of these qualities and quite left out of the account sundry little defects which accompanied them you could never have persuaded her that she was a prejudiced and narrowminded person that she was too susceptible on the subject of her own dignity and importance and too apt to take offence about trifles yet all this was true however where her claims to distinction were not opposed and where her prejudices were not offended she could be kind and friendly enough to her two brothers for there was another gérard moore besides robert she was very much attached as the sole remaining representatives of their decayed family the persons of both were almost sacred in her eyes of louis however she knew less than of robert he had been sent to england when a mere boy and had received his education at an english school his education not being such as to adapt him for trade perhaps too his natural bent not inclining him to mercantile pursuits he had when the blight of hereditary prospects rendered it necessary for him to push his own fortune adopted the very arduous and very modest career of a teacher he had been usher in a school and was said now to be tutor in a private family hortense when she mentioned louis described him as having what she called des moyens but as being too backward and quiet her praise of robert was in a different strain less qualified she was very proud of him she regarded him as the greatest man in europe all he said and did was remarkable in her eyes and she expected others to behold him from the same point of view nothing could be more irrational monstrous and infamous than opposition from any quarter to robert unless it were opposition to herself  accordingly as soon as the said robert was seated at the breakfasttable and she had helped him to a portion of stewed pears and cut him a goodsized belgian tartine she began to pour out a flood of amazement and horror at the transaction of last night the destruction of the frames  quelle idée to destroy them quelle action honteuse on voyait bien que les ouvriers de ce pays étaient à la fois betes et méchants cétait absolument comme les domestiques anglais les servantes surtout rien dinsupportable comme cette sara par exemple  she looks clean and industrious mr moore remarked  looks i dont know how she looks and i do not say that she is altogether dirty or idle mais elle est dune insolence she disputed with me a quarter of an hour yesterday about the cooking of the beef she said i boiled it to rags that english people would never be able to eat such a dish as our bouilli that the bouillon was no better than greasy warm water and as to the choucroute she affirms she cannot touch it that barrel we have in the cellardelightfully prepared by my own handsshe termed a tub of hogwash which means food for pigs i am harassed with the girl and yet i cannot part with her lest i should get a worse you are in the same position with your workmen pauvre cher frère  i am afraid you are not very happy in england hortense  it is my duty to be happy where you are brother but otherwise there are certainly a thousand things which make me regret our native town all the world here appears to me illbred malélevé i find my habits considered ridiculous if a girl out of your mill chances to come into the kitchen and find me in my jupon and camisole preparing dinner for you know i cannot trust sarah to cook a single dish she sneers if i accept an invitation out to tea which i have done once or twice i perceive i am put quite into the background i have not that attention paid me which decidedly is my due of what an excellent family are the gérards as we know and the moores also they have a right to claim a certain respect and to feel wounded when it is withheld from them in antwerp i was always treated with distinction here one would think that when i open my lips in company i speak english with a ridiculous accent whereas i am quite assured that i pronounce it perfectly  hortense in antwerp we were known rich in england we were never known but poor  precisely and thus mercenary are mankind again dear brother last sunday if you recollect was very wet accordingly i went to church in my neat black sabots objects one would not indeed wear in a fashionable city but which in the country i have ever been accustomed to use for walking in dirty roads believe me as i paced up the aisle composed and tranquil as i am always four ladies and as many gentlemen laughed and hid their faces behind their prayerbooks  well well dont put on the sabots again i told you before i thought they were not quite the thing for this country  but brother they are not common sabots such as the peasantry wear i tell you they are sabots noirs très propres très convenables at mons and leuzecities not very far removed from the elegant capital of brusselsit is very seldom that the respectable people wear anything else for walking in winter let any one try to wade the mud of the flemish chaussées in a pair of paris brodequins on men dirait des nouvelles  never mind mons and leuze and the flemish chaussées do at rome as the romans do and as to the camisole and jupon i am not quite sure about them either i never see an english lady dressed in such garments ask caroline helstone  caroline i ask caroline i consult her about my dress it is she who on all points should consult me she is a child  she is eighteen or at least seventeenold enough to know all about gowns petticoats and chaussures  do not spoil caroline i entreat you brother do not make her of more consequence than she ought to be at present she is modest and unassuming let us keep her so  with all my heart is she coming this morning  she will come at ten as usual to take her french lesson  you dont find that she sneers at you do you  she does not she appreciates me better than any one else here but then she has more intimate opportunities of knowing me she sees that i have education intelligence manner principlesall in short which belongs to a person well born and well bred  are you at all fond of her  for fond i cannot say i am not one who is prone to take violent fancies and consequently my friendship is the more to be depended on i have a regard for her as my relative her position also inspires interest and her conduct as my pupil has hitherto been such as rather to enhance than diminish the attachment that springs from other causes  she behaves pretty well at lessons  to me she behaves very well but you are conscious brother that i have a manner calculated to repel overfamiliarity to win esteem and to command respect yet possessed of penetration i perceive clearly that caroline is not perfect that there is much to be desired in her  give me a last cup of coffee and while i am drinking it amuse me with an account of her faults  dear brother i am happy to see you eat your breakfast with relish after the fatiguing night you have passed caroline then is defective but with my forming hand and almost motherly care she may improve there is about her an occasional somethinga reserve i thinkwhich i do not quite like because it is not sufficiently girlish and submissive and there are glimpses of an unsettled hurry in her nature which put me out yet she is usually most tranquil too dejected and thoughtful indeed sometimes in time i doubt not i shall make her uniformly sedate and decorous without being unaccountably pensive i ever disapprove what is not intelligible  i dont understand your account in the least what do you mean by unsettled hurries for instance  an example will perhaps be the most satisfactory explanation i sometimes you are aware make her read french poetry by way of practice in pronunciation she has in the course of her lessons gone through much of corneille and racine in a very steady sober spirit such as i approve occasionally she showed indeed a degree of languor in the perusal of those esteemed authors partaking rather of apathy than sobriety and apathy is what i cannot tolerate in those who have the benefit of my instructionsbesides one should not be apathetic in studying standard works the other day i put into her hands a volume of short fugitive pieces i sent her to the window to learn one by heart and when i looked up i saw her turning the leaves over impatiently and curling her lip absolutely with scorn as she surveyed the little poems cursorily i chid her ma cousine said she tout cela mennuie à la mort i told her this was improper language dieu she exclaimed il ny a donc pas deux lignes de poësie dans toute la littérature française i inquired what she meant she begged my pardon with proper submission ere long she was still i saw her smiling to herself over the book she began to learn assiduously in half an hour she came and stood before me presented the volume folded her hands as i always require her to do and commenced the repetition of that short thing by chénier la jeune captive if you had heard the manner in which she went through this and in which she uttered a few incoherent comments when she had done you would have known what i meant by the phrase unsettled hurry one would have thought chénier was more moving than all racine and all corneille you brother who have so much sagacity will discern that this disproportionate preference argues an illregulated mind but she is fortunate in her preceptress i will give her a system a method of thought a set of opinions i will give her the perfect control and guidance of her feelings  be sure you do hortense here she comes that was her shadow passed the window i believe  ah truly she is too earlyhalf an hour before her timemy child what brings you here before i have breakfasted  this question was addressed to an individual who now entered the room a young girl wrapped in a winter mantle the folds of which were gathered with some grace round an apparently slender figure  i came in haste to see how you were hortense and how robert was too i was sure you would be both grieved by what happened last night i did not hear till this morning my uncle told me at breakfast  ah it is unspeakable you sympathize with us your uncle sympathizes with us  my uncle is very angrybut he was with robert i believe was he notdid he not go with you to stilbro moor  yes we set out in very martial style caroline but the prisoners we went to rescue met us halfway  of course nobody was hurt  why no only joe scotts wrists were a little galled with being pinioned too tightly behind his back  you were not there you were not with the wagons when they were attacked  no one seldom has the fortune to be present at occurrences at which one would particularly wish to assist  where are you going this morning i saw murgatroyd saddling your horse in the yard  to whinbury it is market day  mr yorke is going too i met him in his gig come home with him  why  two are better than one and nobody dislikes mr yorkeat least poor people do not dislike him  therefore he would be a protection to me who am hated  who are misunderstood that probably is the word shall you be latewill he be late cousin hortense  it is too probable he has often much business to transact at whinbury have you brought your exercisebook child  yeswhat time will you return robert  i generally return at seven do you wish me to be at home earlier  try rather to be back by six it is not absolutely dark at six now but by seven daylight is quite gone  and what danger is to be apprehended caroline when daylight is gone what peril do you conceive comes as the companion of darkness for me  i am not sure that i can define my fears but we all have a certain anxiety at present about our friends my uncle calls these times dangerous he says too that millowners are unpopular  and i am one of the most unpopular is not that the fact you are reluctant to speak out plainly but at heart you think me liable to pearsons fate who was shot atnot indeed from behind a hedge but in his own house through his staircase window as he was going to bed  anne pearson showed me the bullet in the chamberdoor remarked caroline gravely as she folded her mantle and arranged it and her muff on a sidetable you know she continued there is a hedge all the way along the road from here to whinbury and there are the fieldhead plantations to pass but you will be back by sixor before  certainly he will affirmed hortense and now my child prepare your lessons for repetition while i put the peas to soak for the purée at dinner  with this direction she left the room  you suspect i have many enemies then caroline said mr moore and doubtless you know me to be destitute of friends  not destitute robert there is your sister your brother louis whom i have never seen there is mr yorke and there is my unclebesides of course many more  robert smiled you would be puzzled to name your many more said he but show me your exercisebook what extreme pains you take with the writing my sister i suppose exacts this care she wants to form you in all things after the model of a flemish schoolgirl what life are you destined for caroline what will you do with your french drawing and other accomplishments when they are acquired  you may well say when they are acquired for as you are aware till hortense began to teach me i knew precious little as to the life i am destined for i cannot tell i suppose to keep my uncles house till she hesitated  till what till he dies  no how harsh to say that i never think of his dying he is only fiftyfive but tillin short till events offer other occupations for me  a remarkably vague prospect are you content with it  i used to be formerly children you know have little reflection or rather their reflections run on ideal themes there are moments now when i am not quite satisfied  why  i am making no moneyearning nothing  you come to the point lina you too then wish to make money  i do i should like an occupation and if i were a boy it would not be so difficult to find one i see such an easy pleasant way of learning a business and making my way in life  go on let us hear what way  i could be apprenticed to your tradethe clothtrade i could learn it of you as we are distant relations i would do the countinghouse work keep the books and write the letters while you went to market i know you greatly desire to be rich in order to pay your fathers debts perhaps i could help you to get rich  help me you should think of yourself  i do think of myself but must one for ever think only of oneself  of whom else do i think of whom else dare i think the poor ought to have no large sympathies it is their duty to be narrow  no robert  yes caroline poverty is necessarily selfish contracted grovelling anxious now and then a poor mans heart when certain beams and dews visit it may smell like the budding vegetation in yonder garden on this spring day may feel ripe to evolve in foliage perhaps blossom but he must not encourage the pleasant impulse he must invoke prudence to check it with that frosty breath of hers which is as nipping as any north wind  no cottage would be happy then  when i speak of poverty i do not so much mean the natural habitual poverty of the workingman as the embarrassed penury of the man in debt my grubworm is always a straitened struggling careworn tradesman  cherish hope not anxiety certain ideas have become too fixed in your mind it may be presumptuous to say it but i have the impression that there is something wrong in your notions of the best means of attaining happiness as there is in second hesitation  i am all ear caroline  in courage let me speak the truthin your mannermind i say only mannerto these yorkshire workpeople  you have often wanted to tell me that have you not  yes oftenvery often  the faults of my manner are i think only negative i am not proud what has a man in my position to be proud of i am only taciturn phlegmatic and joyless  as if your living clothdressers were all machines like your frames and shears in your own house you seem different  to those of my own house i am no alien which i am to these english clowns i might act the benevolent with them but acting is not my forte i find them irrational perverse they hinder me when i long to hurry forward in treating them justly i fulfil my whole duty towards them  you dont expect them to love you of course  nor wish it  ah said the monitress shaking her head and heaving a deep sigh with this ejaculation indicative that she perceived a screw to be loose somewhere but that it was out of her reach to set it right she bent over her grammar and sought the rule and exercise for the day  i suppose i am not an affectionate man caroline the attachment of a very few suffices me  if you please robert will you mend me a pen or two before you go  first let me rule your book for you always contrive to draw the lines aslant there now and now for the pens you like a fine one i think  such as you generally make for me and hortense not your own broad points  if i were of louiss calling i might stay at home and dedicate this morning to you and your studies whereas i must spend it in skyess woolwarehouse  you will be making money  more likely losing it  as he finished mending the pens a horse saddled and bridled was brought up to the gardengate  there fred is ready for me i must go ill take one look to see what the spring has done in the south border too first  he quitted the room and went out into the garden ground behind the mill a sweet fringe of young verdure and opening flowerssnowdrop crocus even primrosebloomed in the sunshine under the hot wall of the factory moore plucked here and there a blossom and leaf till he had collected a little bouquet he returned to the parlour pilfered a thread of silk from his sisters workbasket tied the flowers and laid them on carolines desk  now goodmorning  thank you robert it is pretty it looks as it lies there like sparkles of sunshine and blue sky goodmorning  he went to the door stopped opened his lips as if to speak said nothing and moved on he passed through the wicket and mounted his horse in a second he had flung himself from his saddle again transferred the reins to murgatroyd and reentered the cottage  i forgot my gloves he said appearing to take something from the sidetable then as an impromptu thought he remarked you have no binding engagement at home perhaps caroline  i never have some childrens socks which mrs ramsden has ordered to knit for the jews basket but they will keep  jews basket besold never was utensil better named anything more jewish than itits contents and their pricescannot be conceived but i see something a very tiny curl at the corners of your lip which tells me that you know its merits as well as i do forget the jews basket then and spend the day here as a change your uncle wont break his heart at your absence  she smiled no  the old cossack i dare say not muttered moore  then stay and dine with hortense she will be glad of your company i shall return in good time we will have a little reading in the evening the moon rises at halfpast eight and i will walk up to the rectory with you at nine do you agree  she nodded her head and her eyes lit up  moore lingered yet two minutes he bent over carolines desk and glanced at her grammar he fingered her pen he lifted her bouquet and played with it his horse stamped impatient fred murgatroyd hemmed and coughed at the gate as if he wondered what in the world his master was doing goodmorning again said moore and finally vanished  hortense coming in ten minutes after found to her surprise that caroline had not yet commenced her exercise     chapter vi  coriolanus   mademoiselle moore had that morning a somewhat absentminded pupil caroline forgot again and again the explanations which were given to her however she still bore with unclouded mood the chidings her inattention brought upon her sitting in the sunshine near the window she seemed to receive with its warmth a kind influence which made her both happy and good thus disposed she looked her best and her best was a pleasing vision  to her had not been denied the gift of beauty it was not absolutely necessary to know her in order to like her she was fair enough to please even at the first view her shape suited her age it was girlish light and pliant every curve was neat every limb proportionate her face was expressive and gentle her eyes were handsome and gifted at times with a winning beam that stole into the heart with a language that spoke softly to the affections her mouth was very pretty she had a delicate skin and a fine flow of brown hair which she knew how to arrange with taste curls became her and she possessed them in picturesque profusion her style of dress announced taste in the wearervery unobtrusive in fashion far from costly in material but suitable in colour to the fair complexion with which it contrasted and in make to the slight form which it draped her present winter garb was of merinothe same soft shade of brown as her hair the little collar round her neck lay over a pink ribbon and was fastened with a pink knot she wore no other decoration  so much for caroline helstones appearance as to her character or intellect if she had any they must speak for themselves in due time  her connections are soon explained she was the child of parents separated soon after her birth in consequence of disagreement of disposition her mother was the halfsister of mr moores father thus though there was no mixture of blood she was in a distant sense the cousin of robert louis and hortense her father was the brother of mr helstonea man of the character friends desire not to recall after death has once settled all earthly accounts he had rendered his wife unhappy the reports which were known to be true concerning him had given an air of probability to those which were falsely circulated respecting his betterprincipled brother caroline had never known her mother as she was taken from her in infancy and had not since seen her her father died comparatively young and her uncle the rector had for some years been her sole guardian he was not as we are aware much adapted either by nature or habits to have the charge of a young girl he had taken little trouble about her education probably he would have taken none if she finding herself neglected had not grown anxious on her own account and asked every now and then for a little attention and for the means of acquiring such amount of knowledge as could not be dispensed with still she had a depressing feeling that she was inferior that her attainments were fewer than were usually possessed by girls of her age and station and very glad was she to avail herself of the kind offer made by her cousin hortense soon after the arrival of the latter at hollows mill to teach her french and fine needlework mdlle moore for her part delighted in the task because it gave her importance she liked to lord it a little over a docile yet quick pupil she took caroline precisely at her own estimate as an irregularlytaught even ignorant girl and when she found that she made rapid and eager progress it was to no talent no application in the scholar she ascribed the improvement but entirely to her own superior method of teaching when she found that caroline unskilled in routine had a knowledge of her own desultory but varied the discovery caused her no surprise for she still imagined that from her conversation had the girl unawares gleaned these treasures she thought it even when forced to feel that her pupil knew much on subjects whereof she knew little the idea was not logical but hortense had perfect faith in it  mademoiselle who prided herself on possessing un esprit positif and on entertaining a decided preference for dry studies kept her young cousin to the same as closely as she could she worked her unrelentingly at the grammar of the french language assigning her as the most improving exercise she could devise interminable analyses logiques these analyses were by no means a source of particular pleasure to caroline she thought she could have learned french just as well without them and grudged excessively the time spent in pondering over propositions principales et incidents in deciding the incidente determinative and the incidente applicative in examining whether the proposition was pleine elliptique or implicite sometimes she lost herself in the maze and when so lost she would now and then while hortense was rummaging her drawers upstairsan unaccountable occupation in which she spent a large portion of each day arranging disarranging rearranging and counterarranging carry her book to robert in the countinghouse and get the rough place made smooth by his aid mr moore possessed a clear tranquil brain of his own almost as soon as he looked at carolines little difficulties they seemed to dissolve beneath his eye in two minutes he would explain all in two words give the key to the puzzle she thought if hortense could only teach like him how much faster she might learn repaying him by an admiring and grateful smile rather shed at his feet than lifted to his face she would leave the mill reluctantly to go back to the cottage and then while she completed the exercise or worked out the sum for mdlle moore taught her arithmetic too she would wish nature had made her a boy instead of a girl that she might ask robert to let her be his clerk and sit with him in the countinghouse instead of sitting with hortense in the parlour  occasionallybut this happened very rarelyshe spent the evening at hollows cottage sometimes during these visits moore was away attending a market sometimes he was gone to mr yorkes often he was engaged with a male visitor in another room but sometimes too he was at home disengaged free to talk with caroline when this was the case the evening hours passed on wings of light they were gone before they were counted there was no room in england so pleasant as that small parlour when the three cousins occupied it hortense when she was not teaching or scolding or cooking was far from illhumoured it was her custom to relax towards evening and to be kind to her young english kinswoman there was a means too of rendering her delightful by inducing her to take her guitar and sing and play she then became quite goodnatured and as she played with skill and had a welltoned voice it was not disagreeable to listen to her it would have been absolutely agreeable except that her formal and selfimportant character modulated her strains as it impressed her manners and moulded her countenance  mr moore released from the business yoke was if not lively himself a willing spectator of carolines liveliness a complacent listener to her talk a ready respondent to her questions he was something agreeable to sit near to hover round to address and look at sometimes he was better than thisalmost animated quite gentle and friendly  the drawback was that by the next morning he was sure to be frozen up again and however much he seemed in his quiet way to enjoy these social evenings he rarely contrived their recurrence this circumstance puzzled the inexperienced head of his cousin if i had a means of happiness at my command she thought i would employ that means often i would keep it bright with use and not let it lie for weeks aside till it gets rusty  yet she was careful not to put in practice her own theory much as she liked an evening visit to the cottage she never paid one unasked often indeed when pressed by hortense to come she would refuse because robert did not second or but slightly seconded the request this morning was the first time he had ever of his own unprompted will given her an invitation and then he had spoken so kindly that in hearing him she had received a sense of happiness sufficient to keep her glad for the whole day  the morning passed as usual mademoiselle ever breathlessly busy spent it in bustling from kitchen to parlour now scolding sarah now looking over carolines exercise or hearing her repetitionlesson however faultlessly these tasks were achieved she never commended it was a maxim with her that praise is inconsistent with a teachers dignity and that blame in more or less unqualified measure is indispensable to it she thought incessant reprimand severe or slight quite necessary to the maintenance of her authority and if no possible error was to be found in the lesson it was the pupils carriage or air or dress or mien which required correction  the usual affray took place about the dinner which meal when sarah at last brought it into the room she almost flung upon the table with a look that expressed quite plainly i never dished such stuff i my life afore its not fit for dogs notwithstanding sarahs scorn it was a savoury repast enough the soup was a sort of purée of dried peas which mademoiselle had prepared amidst bitter lamentations that in this desolate country of england no haricot beans were to be had then came a dish of meatnature unknown but supposed to be miscellaneoussingularly chopped up with crumbs of bread seasoned uniquely though not unpleasantly and baked in a moulda queer but by no means unpalatable dish greens oddly bruised formed the accompanying vegetable and a pâté of fruit conserved after a recipe devised by madame gérard moores grandmère and from the taste of which it appeared probable that mélasse had been substituted for sugar completed the dinner  caroline had no objection to this belgian cookeryindeed she rather liked it for a change and it was well she did so for had she evinced any disrelish thereof such manifestation would have injured her in mademoiselles good graces for ever a positive crime might have been more easily pardoned than a symptom of distaste for the foreign comestibles  soon after dinner caroline coaxed her governesscousin upstairs to dress this manœuvre required management to have hinted that the jupon camisole and curlpapers were odious objects or indeed other than quite meritorious points would have been a felony any premature attempt to urge their disappearance was therefore unwise and would be likely to issue in the persevering wear of them during the whole day carefully avoiding rocks and quicksands however the pupil on pretence of requiring a change of scene contrived to get the teacher aloft and once in the bedroom she persuaded her that it was not worth while returning thither and that she might as well make her toilet now and while mademoiselle delivered a solemn homily on her own surpassing merit in disregarding all frivolities of fashion caroline denuded her of the camisole invested her with a decent gown arranged her collar hair etc and made her quite presentable but hortense would put the finishing touches herself and these finishing touches consisted in a thick handkerchief tied round the throat and a large servantlike black apron which spoiled everything on no account would mademoiselle have appeared in her own house without the thick handkerchief and the voluminous apron the first was a positive matter of moralityit was quite improper not to wear a fichu the second was the ensign of a good housewifeshe appeared to think that by means of it she somehow effected a large saving in her brothers income she had with her own hands made and presented to caroline similar equipments and the only serious quarrel they had ever had and which still left a soreness in the elder cousins soul had arisen from the refusal of the younger one to accept of and profit by these elegant presents  i wear a high dress and a collar said caroline and i should feel suffocated with a handkerchief in addition and my short aprons do quite as well as that very long one i would rather make no change  yet hortense by dint of perseverance would probably have compelled her to make a change had not mr moore chanced to overhear a dispute on the subject and decided that carolines little aprons would suffice and that in his opinion as she was still but a child she might for the present dispense with the fichu especially as her curls were long and almost touched her shoulders  there was no appeal against roberts opinion therefore his sister was compelled to yield but she disapproved entirely of the piquant neatness of carolines costume and the ladylike grace of her appearance something more solid and homely she would have considered beaucoup plus convenable  the afternoon was devoted to sewing mademoiselle like most belgian ladies was specially skilful with her needle she by no means thought it waste of time to devote unnumbered hours to fine embroidery sightdestroying lacework marvellous netting and knitting and above all to most elaborate stockingmending she would give a day to the mending of two holes in a stocking any time and think her mission nobly fulfilled when she had accomplished it it was another of carolines troubles to be condemned to learn this foreign style of darning which was done stitch by stitch so as exactly to imitate the fabric of the stocking itselfa wearifu process but considered by hortense gérard and by her ancestresses before her for long generations back as one of the first duties of a woman she herself had had a needle cotton and a fearfully torn stocking put into her hand while she yet wore a childs coif on her little black head her hauts faits in the darning line had been exhibited to company ere she was six years old and when she first discovered that caroline was profoundly ignorant of this most essential of attainments she could have wept with pity over her miserablyneglected youth  no time did she lose in seeking up a hopeless pair of hose of which the heels were entirely gone and in setting the ignorant english girl to repair the deficiency this task had been commenced two years ago and caroline had the stockings in her workbag yet she did a few rows every day by way of penance for the expiation of her sins they were a grievous burden to her she would much have liked to put them in the fire and once mr moore who had observed her sitting and sighing over them had proposed a private incremation in the countinghouse but to this proposal caroline knew it would have been impolitic to accedethe result could only be a fresh pair of hose probably in worse condition she adhered therefore to the ills she knew  all the afternoon the two ladies sat and sewed till the eyes and fingers and even the spirits of one of them were weary the sky since dinner had darkened it had begun to rain again to pour fast secret fears began to steal on caroline that robert would be persuaded by mr sykes or mr yorke to remain at whinbury till it cleared and of that there appeared no present chance five oclock struck and time stole on still the clouds streamed a sighing wind whispered in the rooftrees of the cottage day seemed already closing the parlour fire shed on the clear hearth a glow ruddy as at twilight  it will not be fair till the moon rises pronounced mademoiselle moore consequently i feel assured that my brother will not return till then indeed i should be sorry if he did we will have coffee it would be vain to wait for him  i am tired may i leave my work now cousin  you may since it grows too dark to see to do it well fold it up put it carefully in your bag then step into the kitchen and desire sarah to bring in the goûter or tea as you call it  but it has not yet struck six he may still come  he will not i tell you i can calculate his movements i understand my brother  suspense is irksome disappointment bitter all the world has some time or other felt that caroline obedient to orders passed into the kitchen sarah was making a dress for herself at the table  you are to bring in coffee said the young lady in a spiritless tone and then she leaned her arm and head against the kitchen mantelpiece and hung listlessly over the fire  how low you seem miss but its all because your cousin keeps you so close to work its a shame  nothing of the kind sarah was the brief reply  oh but i know it is youre fit to cry just this minute for nothing else but because youve sat still the whole day it would make a kitten dull to be mewed up so  sarah does your master often come home early from market when it is wet  never hardly but just today for some reason he has made a difference  what do you mean  he is come i am certain i saw murgatroyd lead his horse into the yard by the backway when i went to get some water at the pump five minutes since he was in the countinghouse with joe scott i believe  you are mistaken  what should i be mistaken for i know his horse surely  but you did not see himself  i heard him speak though he was saying something to joe scott about having settled all concerning ways and means and that there would be a new set of frames in the mill before another week passed and that this time he would get four soldiers from stilbro barracks to guard the wagon  sarah are you making a gown  yes is it a handsome one  beautiful get the coffee ready ill finish cutting out that sleeve for you and ill give you some trimming for it i have some narrow satin ribbon of a colour that will just match it  youre very kind miss  be quick theres a good girl but first put your masters shoes on the hearth he will take his boots off when he comes in i hear him he is coming  miss you are cutting the stuff wrong  so i am but it is only a snip there is no harm done  the kitchen door opened mr moore entered very wet and cold caroline half turned from her dressmaking occupation but renewed it for a moment as if to gain a minutes time for some purpose bent over the dress her face was hidden there was an attempt to settle her features and veil their expression which failed when she at last met mr moore her countenance beamed  we had ceased to expect you they asserted you would not come she said  but i promised to return soon you expected me i suppose  no robert i dared not when it rained so fast and you are wet and chilled change everything if you took cold i shouldwe should blame ourselves in some measure  i am not wet through my ridingcoat is waterproof dry shoes are all i require therethe fire is pleasant after facing the cold wind and rain for a few miles  he stood on the kitchen hearth caroline stood beside him mr moore while enjoying the genial glow kept his eyes directed towards the glittering brasses on the shelf above chancing for an instant to look down his glance rested on an uplifted face flushed smiling happy shaded with silky curls lit with fine eyes sarah was gone into the parlour with the tray a lecture from her mistress detained her there moore placed his hand a moment on his young cousins shoulder stooped and left a kiss on her forehead  oh said she as if the action had unsealed her lips i was miserable when i thought you would not come i am almost too happy now are you happy robert do you like to come home  i think i dotonight at least  are you certain you are not fretting about your frames and your business and the war  not just now  are you positive you dont feel hollows cottage too small for you and narrow and dismal  at this moment no  can you affirm that you are not bitter at heart because rich and great people forget you  no more questions you are mistaken if you think i am anxious to curry favour with rich and great people i only want meansa positiona career  which your own talent and goodness shall win you you were made to be great you shall be great  i wonder now if you spoke honestly out of your heart what recipe you would give me for acquiring this same greatness but i know itbetter than you know it yourself would it be efficacious would it work yespoverty misery bankruptcy oh life is not what you think it lina  but you are what i think you  i am not  you are better then  far worse  no far better i know you are good  how do you know it  you look so and i feel you are so  where do you feel it  in my heart  ah you judge me with your heart lina you should judge me with your head  i do and then i am quite proud of you robert you cannot tell all my thoughts about you  mr moores dark face mustered colour his lips smiled and yet were compressed his eyes laughed and yet he resolutely knit his brow  think meanly of me lina said he men in general are a sort of scum very different to anything of which you have an idea i make no pretension to be better than my fellows  if you did i should not esteem you so much it is because you are modest that i have such confidence in your merit  are you flattering me he demanded turning sharply upon her and searching her face with an eye of acute penetration  no she said softly laughing at his sudden quickness she seemed to think it unnecessary to proffer any eager disavowal of the charge  you dont care whether i think you flatter me or not  no  you are so secure of your own intentions  i suppose so  what are they caroline  only to ease my mind by expressing for once part of what i think and then to make you better satisfied with yourself  by assuring me that my kinswoman is my sincere friend  just so i am your sincere friend robert  and i amwhat chance and change shall make me lina  not my enemy however  the answer was cut short by sarah and her mistress entering the kitchen together in some commotion they had been improving the time which mr moore and miss helstone had spent in dialogue by a short dispute on the subject of café au lait which sarah said was the queerest mess she ever saw and a waste of gods good gifts as it was the nature of coffee to be boiled in water and which mademoiselle affirmed to be un breuvage royal a thousand times too good for the mean person who objected to it  the former occupants of the kitchen now withdrew into the parlour before hortense followed them thither caroline had only time again to question not my enemy robert and moore quakerlike had replied with another query could i be and then seating himself at the table had settled caroline at his side  caroline scarcely heard mademoiselles explosion of wrath when she rejoined them the long declamation about the conduite indigne de cette méchante créature sounded in her ear as confusedly as the agitated rattling of the china robert laughed a little at it in very subdued sort and then politely and calmly entreating his sister to be tranquil assured her that if it would yield her any satisfaction she should have her choice of an attendant amongst all the girls in his mill only he feared they would scarcely suit her as they were most of them he was informed completely ignorant of household work and pert and selfwilled as sarah was she was perhaps no worse than the majority of the women of her class  mademoiselle admitted the truth of this conjecture according to her ces paysannes anglaises étaient tout insupportables what would she not give for some bonne cuisinière anversoise with the high cap short petticoat and decent sabots proper to her classsomething better indeed than an insolent coquette in a flounced gown and absolutely without cap for sarah it appears did not partake the opinion of st paul that it is a shame for a woman to go with her head uncovered but holding rather a contrary doctrine resolutely refused to imprison in linen or muslin the plentiful tresses of her yellow hair which it was her wont to fasten up smartly with a comb behind and on sundays to wear curled in front  shall i try and get you an antwerp girl asked mr moore who stern in public was on the whole very kind in private  merci du cadeau was the answer an antwerp girl would not stay here ten days sneered at as she would be by all the young coquines in your factory then softening you are very good dear brotherexcuse my petulancebut truly my domestic trials are severe yet they are probably my destiny for i recollect that our revered mother experienced similar sufferings though she had the choice of all the best servants in antwerp domestics are in all countries a spoiled and unruly set  mr moore had also certain reminiscences about the trials of his revered mother a good mother she had been to him and he honoured her memory but he recollected that she kept a hot kitchen of it in antwerp just as his faithful sister did here in england thus therefore he let the subject drop and when the coffeeservice was removed proceeded to console hortense by fetching her musicbook and guitar and having arranged the ribbon of the instrument round her neck with a quiet fraternal kindness he knew to be allpowerful in soothing her most ruffled moods he asked her to give him some of their mothers favourite songs  nothing refines like affection family jarring vulgarizes family union elevates hortense pleased with her brother and grateful to him looked as she touched her guitar almost graceful almost handsome her everyday fretful look was gone for a moment and was replaced by a sourire plein de bonté she sang the songs he asked for with feeling they reminded her of a parent to whom she had been truly attached they reminded her of her young days she observed too that caroline listened with naïve interest this augmented her goodhumour and the exclamation at the close of the song i wish i could sing and play like hortense achieved the business and rendered her charming for the evening  it is true a little lecture to caroline followed on the vanity of wishing and the duty of trying as rome it was suggested had not been built in a day so neither had mademoiselle gérard moores education been completed in a week or by merely wishing to be clever it was effort that had accomplished that great work she was ever remarkable for her perseverance for her industry her masters had remarked that it was as delightful as it was uncommon to find so much talent united with so much solidity and so on once on the theme of her own merits mademoiselle was fluent  cradled at last in blissful selfcomplacency she took her knitting and sat down tranquil drawn curtains a clear fire a softlyshining lamp gave now to the little parlour its best its evening charm it is probable that the three there present felt this charm they all looked happy  what shall we do now caroline asked mr moore returning to his seat beside his cousin  what shall we do robert repeated she playfully you decide  not play at chess  no  nor draughts nor backgammon  no no we both hate silent games that only keep ones hands employed dont we  i believe we do then shall we talk scandal  about whom are we sufficiently interested in anybody to take a pleasure in pulling their character to pieces  a question that comes to the point for my part unamiable as it sounds i must say no  and i too but it is strange though we want no thirdfourth i mean she hastily and with contrition glanced at hortense living person among usso selfish we are in our happinessthough we dont want to think of the present existing world it would be pleasant to go back to the past to hear people that have slept for generations in graves that are perhaps no longer graves now but gardens and fields speak to us and tell us their thoughts and impart their ideas  who shall be the speaker what language shall he utter french  your french forefathers dont speak so sweetly nor so solemnly nor so impressively as your english ancestors robert tonight you shall be entirely english you shall read an english book  an old english book  yes an old english bookone that you like and i will choose a part of it that is toned quite in harmony with something in you it shall waken your nature fill your mind with music it shall pass like a skilful hand over your heart and make its strings sound your heart is a lyre robert but the lot of your life has not been a minstrel to sweep it and it is often silent let glorious william come near and touch it you will see how he will draw the english power and melody out of its chords  i must read shakespeare  you must have his spirit before you you must hear his voice with your minds ear you must take some of his soul into yours  with a view to making me better is it to operate like a sermon  it is to stir you to give you new sensations it is to make you feel your life stronglynot only your virtues but your vicious perverse points  dieu que ditelle cried hortense who hitherto had been counting stitches in her knitting and had not much attended to what was said but whose ear these two strong words caught with a tweak  never mind her sister let her talk now just let her say anything she pleases tonight she likes to come down hard upon your brother sometimes it amuses me so let her alone  caroline who mounted on a chair had been rummaging the bookcase returned with a book  heres shakespeare she said and theres coriolanus now read and discover by the feelings the reading will give you at once how low and how high you are  come then sit near me and correct when i mispronounce  i am to be the teacher then and you my pupil  ainsi soitil  and shakespeare is our science since we are going to study  it appears so  and you are not going to be french and sceptical and sneering you are not going to think it a sign of wisdom to refuse to admire  i dont know  if you do robert ill take shakespeare away and ill shrivel up within myself and put on my bonnet and go home  sit down here i begin  one minute if you please brother interrupted mademoiselle when the gentleman of a family reads the ladies should always sewcaroline dear child take your embroidery you may get three sprigs done tonight  caroline looked dismayed i cant see by lamplight my eyes are tired and i cant do two things well at once if i sew i cannot listen if i listen i cannot sew  fi donc quel enfantillage began hortense mr moore as usual suavely interposed  permit her to neglect the embroidery for this evening i wish her whole attention to be fixed on my accent and to ensure this she must follow the reading with her eyesshe must look at the book  he placed it between them reposed his arm on the back of carolines chair and thus began to read  the very first scene in coriolanus came with smart relish to his intellectual palate and still as he read he warmed he delivered the haughty speech of caius marcius to the starving citizens with unction he did not say he thought his irrational pride right but he seemed to feel it so caroline looked up at him with a singular smile  theres a vicious point hit already she said you sympathize with that proud patrician who does not sympathize with his famished fellowmen and insults them there go on he proceeded the warlike portions did not rouse him much he said all that was out of date or should be the spirit displayed was barbarous yet the encounter singlehanded between marcius and tullus aufidius he delighted in as he advanced he forgot to criticise it was evident he appreciated the power the truth of each portion and stepping out of the narrow line of private prejudices began to revel in the large picture of human nature to feel the reality stamped upon the characters who were speaking from that page before him  he did not read the comic scenes well and caroline taking the book out of his hand read these parts for him from her he seemed to enjoy them and indeed she gave them with a spirit no one could have expected of her with a pithy expression with which she seemed gifted on the spot and for that brief moment only it may be remarked in passing that the general character of her conversation that evening whether serious or sprightly grave or gay was as of something untaught unstudied intuitive fitfulwhen once gone no more to be reproduced as it had been than the glancing ray of the meteor than the tints of the dewgem than the colour or form of the sunset cloud than the fleeting and glittering ripple varying the flow of a rivulet  coriolanus in glory coriolanus in disaster coriolanus banished followed like giant shades one after the other before the vision of the banished man moores spirit seemed to pause he stood on the hearth of aufidiuss hall facing the image of greatness fallen but greater than ever in that low estate he saw the grim appearance the dark face bearing command in it the noble vessel with its tackle torn with the revenge of caius marcius moore perfectly sympathized he was not scandalized by it and again caroline whispered there i see another glimpse of brotherhood in error  the march on rome the mothers supplication the long resistance the final yielding of bad passions to good which ever must be the case in a nature worthy the epithet of noble the rage of aufidius at what he considered his allys weakness the death of coriolanus the final sorrow of his great enemyall scenes made of condensed truth and strengthcame on in succession and carried with them in their deep fast flow the heart and mind of reader and listener  now have you felt shakespeare asked caroline some ten minutes after her cousin had closed the book  i think so  and have you felt anything in coriolanus like you  perhaps i have  was he not faulty as well as great  moore nodded  and what was his fault what made him hated by the citizens what caused him to be banished by his countrymen  what do you think it was  i ask again                        whether was it pride     which out of daily fortune ever taints     the happy man whether defect of judgment     to fail in the disposing of those chances     which he was lord of or whether nature     not to be other than one thing not moving     from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace     even with the same austerity and garb     as he controlled the war  well answer yourself sphinx  it was a spice of all and you must not be proud to your workpeople you must not neglect chances of soothing them and you must not be of an inflexible nature uttering a request as austerely as if it were a command  that is the moral you tack to the play what puts such notions into your head  a wish for your good a care for your safety dear robert and a fear caused by many things which i have heard lately that you will come to harm  who tells you these things  i hear my uncle talk about you he praises your hard spirit your determined cast of mind your scorn of low enemies your resolution not to truckle to the mob as he says  and would you have me truckle to them  no not for the world i never wish you to lower yourself but somehow i cannot help thinking it unjust to include all poor workingpeople under the general and insulting name of the mob and continually to think of them and treat them haughtily  you are a little democrat caroline if your uncle knew what would he say  i rarely talk to my uncle as you know and never about such things he thinks everything but sewing and cooking above womens comprehension and out of their line  and do you fancy you comprehend the subjects on which you advise me  as far as they concern you i comprehend them i know it would be better for you to be loved by your workpeople than to be hated by them and i am sure that kindness is more likely to win their regard than pride if you were proud and cold to me and hortense should we love you when you are cold to me as you are sometimes can i venture to be affectionate in return  now lina ive had my lesson both in languages and ethics with a touch on politics it is your turn hortense tells me you were much taken by a little piece of poetry you learned the other day a piece by poor andré chénierla jeune captive do you remember it still  i think so  repeat it then take your time and mind your accent especially let us have no english us  caroline beginning in a low rather tremulous voice but gaining courage as she proceeded repeated the sweet verses of chénier the last three stanzas she rehearsed well      mon beau voyage encore est si loin de sa fin      je pars et des ormeaux qui bordent le chemin        jai passé le premiers à peine      au banquet de la vie à peine commencé      un instant seulement mes lèvres ont pressé        la coupe en mes mains encore pleine      je ne suis quau printempsje veux voir la moisson      et comme le soleil de saison en saison        je veux achever mon année      brillante sur ma tige et lhonneur du jardin      je nai vu luire encore que les feux du matin        je veux achever ma journée  moore listened at first with his eyes cast down but soon he furtively raised them leaning back in his chair he could watch caroline without her perceiving where his gaze was fixed her cheek had a colour her eyes a light her countenance an expression this evening which would have made even plain features striking but there was not the grievous defect of plainness to pardon in her case the sunshine was not shed on rough barrenness it fell on soft bloom each lineament was turned with grace the whole aspect was pleasing at the present momentanimated interested touchedshe might be called beautiful such a face was calculated to awaken not only the calm sentiment of esteem the distant one of admiration but some feeling more tender genial intimatefriendship perhaps affection interest when she had finished she turned to moore and met his eye  is that pretty well repeated she inquired smiling like any happy docile child  i really dont know  why dont you know have you not listened  yesand looked you are fond of poetry lina  when i meet with real poetry i cannot rest till i have learned it by heart and so made it partly mine  mr moore now sat silent for several minutes it struck nine oclock sarah entered and said that mr helstones servant was come for miss caroline  then the evening is gone already she observed and it will be long i suppose before i pass another here  hortense had been for some time nodding over her knitting fallen into a doze now she made no response to the remark  you would have no objection to come here oftener of an evening inquired robert as he took her folded mantle from the sidetable where it still lay and carefully wrapped it round her  i like to come here but i have no desire to be intrusive i am not hinting to be asked you must understand that  oh i understand thee child you sometimes lecture me for wishing to be rich lina but if i were rich you should live here alwaysat any rate you should live with me wherever my habitation might be  that would be pleasant and if you were poorever so poorit would still be pleasant goodnight robert  i promised to walk with you up to the rectory  i know you did but i thought you had forgotten and i hardly knew how to remind you though i wished to do it but would you like to go it is a cold night and as fanny is come there is no necessity  here is your muff dont wake hortensecome  the half mile to the rectory was soon traversed they parted in the garden without kiss scarcely with a pressure of hands yet robert sent his cousin in excited and joyously troubled he had been singularly kind to her that daynot in phrase compliment profession but in manner in look and in soft and friendly tones  for himself he came home grave almost morose as he stood leaning on his own yardgate musing in the watery moonlight all alone the hushed dark mill before him the hillenvironed hollow round he exclaimed abruptly  this wont do theres weaknesstheres downright ruin in all this however he added dropping his voice the frenzy is quite temporary i know it very well i have had it before it will be gone tomorrow     chapter vii  the curates at tea   caroline helstone was just eighteen years old and at eighteen the true narrative of life is yet to be commenced before that time we sit listening to a tale a marvellous fiction delightful sometimes and sad sometimes almost always unreal before that time our world is heroic its inhabitants halfdivine or semidemon its scenes are dreamscenes darker woods and stranger hills brighter skies more dangerous waters sweeter flowers more tempting fruits wider plains drearier deserts sunnier fields than are found in nature overspread our enchanted globe what a moon we gaze on before that time how the trembling of our hearts at her aspect bears witness to its unutterable beauty as to our sun it is a burning heaventhe world of gods  at that time at eighteen drawing near the confines of illusive void dreams elfland lies behind us the shores of reality rise in front these shores are yet distant they look so blue soft gentle we long to reach them in sunshine we see a greenness beneath the azure as of spring meadows we catch glimpses of silver lines and imagine the roll of living waters could we but reach this land we think to hunger and thirst no more whereas many a wilderness and often the flood of death or some stream of sorrow as cold and almost as black as death is to be crossed ere true bliss can be tasted every joy that life gives must be earned ere it is secured and how hardly earned those only know who have wrestled for great prizes the hearts blood must gem with red beads the brow of the combatant before the wreath of victory rustles over it  at eighteen we are not aware of this hope when she smiles on us and promises happiness tomorrow is implicitly believed love when he comes wandering like a lost angel to our door is at once admitted welcomed embraced his quiver is not seen if his arrows penetrate their wound is like a thrill of new life there are no fears of poison none of the barb which no leechs hand can extract that perilous passionan agony ever in some of its phases with many an agony throughoutis believed to be an unqualified good in short at eighteen the school of experience is to be entered and her humbling crushing grinding but yet purifying and invigorating lessons are yet to be learned  alas experience no other mentor has so wasted and frozen a face as yours none wears a robe so black none bears a rod so heavy none with hand so inexorable draws the novice so sternly to his task and forces him with authority so resistless to its acquirement it is by your instructions alone that man or woman can ever find a safe track through lifes wilds without it how they stumble how they stray on what forbidden grounds do they intrude down what dread declivities are they hurled  caroline having been convoyed home by robert had no wish to pass what remained of the evening with her uncle the room in which he sat was very sacred ground to her she seldom intruded on it and tonight she kept aloof till the bell rang for prayers part of the evening church service was the form of worship observed in mr helstones household he read it in his usual nasal voice clear loud and monotonous the rite over his niece according to her wont stepped up to him  goodnight uncle  hey youve been gadding abroad all dayvisiting dining out and what not  only at the cottage  and have you learned your lessons  yes  and made a shirt  only part of one  well that will do stick to the needle learn shirtmaking and gownmaking and piecrustmaking and youll be a clever woman some day go to bed now im busy with a pamphlet here  presently the niece was enclosed in her small bedroom the door bolted her white dressinggown assumed her long hair loosened and falling thick soft and wavy to her waist and as resting from the task of combing it out she leaned her check on her hand and fixed her eyes on the carpet before her rose and close around her drew the visions we see at eighteen years  her thoughts were speaking with her speaking pleasantly as it seemed for she smiled as she listened she looked pretty meditating thus but a brighter thing than she was in that apartmentthe spirit of youthful hope according to this flattering prophet she was to know disappointment to feel chill no more she had entered on the dawn of a summer dayno false dawn but the true spring of morningand her sun would quickly rise impossible for her now to suspect that she was the sport of delusion her expectations seemed warranted the foundation on which they rested appeared solid  when people love the next step is they marry was her argument now i love robert and i feel sure that robert loves me i have thought so many a time before today i felt it when i looked up at him after repeating chéniers poem his eyes what handsome eyes he has sent the truth through my heart sometimes i am afraid to speak to him lest i should be too frank lest i should seem forwardfor i have more than once regretted bitterly overflowing superfluous words and feared i had said more than he expected me to say and that he would disapprove what he might deem my indiscretion now tonight i could have ventured to express any thought he was so indulgent how kind he was as we walked up the lane he does not flatter or say foolish things his lovemaking friendship i mean of course i dont yet account him my lover but i hope he will be so some day is not like what we read of in booksit is far betteroriginal quiet manly sincere i do like him i would be an excellent wife to him if he did marry me i would tell him of his faults for he has a few faults but i would study his comfort and cherish him and do my best to make him happy now i am sure he will not be cold tomorrow i feel almost certain that tomorrow evening he will either come here or ask me to go there  she recommenced combing her hair long as a mermaids turning her head as she arranged it she saw her own face and form in the glass such reflections are soberizing to plain people their own eyes are not enchanted with the image they are confident then that the eyes of others can see in it no fascination but the fair must naturally draw other conclusions the picture is charming and must charm caroline saw a shape a head that daguerreotyped in that attitude and with that expression would have been lovely she could not choose but derive from the spectacle confirmation to her hopes it was then in undiminished gladness she sought her couch  and in undiminished gladness she rose the next day as she entered her uncles breakfastroom and with soft cheerfulness wished him goodmorning even that little man of bronze himself thought for an instant his niece was growing a fine girl generally she was quiet and timid with himvery docile but not communicative this morning however she found many things to say slight topics alone might be discussed between them for with a womana girlmr helstone would touch on no other she had taken an early walk in the garden and she told him what flowers were beginning to spring there she inquired when the gardener was to come and trim the borders she informed him that certain starlings were beginning to build their nests in the churchtower briarfield church was close to briarfield rectory she wondered the tolling of the bells in the belfry did not scare them  mr helstone opined that they were like other fools who had just pairedinsensible to inconvenience just for the moment caroline made perhaps a little too courageous by her temporary good spirits here hazarded a remark of a kind she had never before ventured to make on observations dropped by her revered relative  uncle said she whenever you speak of marriage you speak of it scornfully do you think people shouldnt marry  it is decidedly the wisest plan to remain single especially for women  are all marriages unhappy  millions of marriages are unhappy if everybody confessed the truth perhaps all are more or less so  you are always vexed when you are asked to come and marry a couple why  because one does not like to act as accessory to the commission of a piece of pure folly  mr helstone spoke so readily he seemed rather glad of the opportunity to give his niece a piece of his mind on this point emboldened by the impunity which had hitherto attended her questions she went a little further  but why said she should it be pure folly if two people like each other why shouldnt they consent to live together  they tire of each otherthey tire of each other in a month a yokefellow is not a companion he or she is a fellowsufferer  it was by no means naïve simplicity which inspired carolines next remark it was a sense of antipathy to such opinions and of displeasure at him who held them  one would think you had never been married uncle one would think you were an old bachelor  practically i am so  but you have been married why were you so inconsistent as to marry  every man is mad once or twice in his life  so you tired of my aunt and my aunt of you and you were miserable together  mr helstone pushed out his cynical lip wrinkled his brown forehead and gave an inarticulate grunt  did she not suit you was she not goodtempered did you not get used to her were you not sorry when she died  caroline said mr helstone bringing his hand slowly down to within an inch or two of the table and then smiting it suddenly on the mahogany understand this it is vulgar and puerile to confound generals with particulars in every case there is the rule and there are the exceptions your questions are stupid and babyish ring the bell if you have done breakfast  the breakfast was taken away and that meal over it was the general custom of uncle and niece to separate and not to meet again till dinner but today the niece instead of quitting the room went to the windowseat and sat down there mr helstone looked round uneasily once or twice as if he wished her away but she was gazing from the window and did not seem to mind him so he continued the perusal of his morning papera particularly interesting one it chanced to be as new movements had just taken place in the peninsula and certain columns of the journal were rich in long dispatches from general lord wellington he little knew meantime what thoughts were busy in his nieces mindthoughts the conversation of the past halfhour had revived but not generated tumultuous were they now as disturbed bees in a hive but it was years since they had first made their cells in her brain  she was reviewing his character his disposition repeating his sentiments on marriage many a time had she reviewed them before and sounded the gulf between her own mind and his and then on the other side of the wide and deep chasm she had seen and she now saw another figure standing beside her unclesa strange shape dim sinister scarcely earthlythe halfremembered image of her own father james helstone matthewson helstones brother  rumours had reached her ear of what that fathers character was old servants had dropped hints she knew too that he was not a good man and that he was never kind to her she recollecteda dark recollection it wassome weeks that she had spent with him in a great town somewhere when she had had no maid to dress her or take care of her when she had been shut up day and night in a high garretroom without a carpet with a bare uncurtained bed and scarcely any other furniture when he went out early every morning and often forgot to return and give her her dinner during the day and at night when he came back was like a madman furious terrible orstill more painfullike an idiot imbecile senseless she knew she had fallen ill in this place and that one night when she was very sick he had come raving into the room and said he would kill her for she was a burden to him her screams had brought aid and from the moment she was then rescued from him she had never seen him except as a dead man in his coffin  that was her father also she had a mother though mr helstone never spoke to her of that mother though she could not remember having seen her but that she was alive she knew this mother was then the drunkards wife what had their marriage been caroline turning from the lattice whence she had been watching the starlings though without seeing them in a low voice and with a sad bitter tone thus broke the silence of the room  you term marriage miserable i suppose from what you saw of my father and mothers if my mother suffered what i suffered when i was with papa she must have had a dreadful life  mr helstone thus addressed wheeled about in his chair and looked over his spectacles at his niece he was taken aback  her father and mother what had put it into her head to mention her father and mother of whom he had never during the twelve years she had lived with him spoken to her that the thoughts were selfmatured that she had any recollections or speculations about her parents he could not fancy  your father and mother who has been talking to you about them  nobody but i remember something of what papa was and i pity mamma where is she  this where is she had been on carolines lips hundreds of times before but till now she had never uttered it  i hardly know returned mr helstone i was little acquainted with her i have not heard from her for years but wherever she is she thinks nothing of you she never inquires about you i have reason to believe she does not wish to see you come it is schooltime you go to your cousin at ten dont you the clock has struck  perhaps caroline would have said more but fanny coming in informed her master that the churchwardens wanted to speak to him in the vestry he hastened to join them and his niece presently set out for the cottage  the road from the rectory to hollows mill inclined downwards she ran therefore almost all the way exercise the fresh air the thought of seeing robert at least of being on his premises in his vicinage revived her somewhat depressed spirits quickly arriving in sight of the white house and within hearing of the thundering mill and its rushing watercourse the first thing she saw was moore at his garden gate there he stood in his belted holland blouse a light cap covering his head which undress costume suited him he was looking down the lane not in the direction of his cousins approach she stopped withdrawing a little behind a willow and studied his appearance  he has not his peer she thought he is as handsome as he is intelligent what a keen eye he has what clearlycut spirited featuresthin and serious but graceful i do like his face i do like his aspect i do like him so muchbetter than any of those shuffling curates for instancebetter than anybody bonny robert  she sought bonny roberts presence speedily for his part when she challenged his sight i believe he would have passed from before her eyes like a phantom if he could but being a tall fact and no fiction he was obliged to stand the greeting he made it brief it was cousinlike brotherlike friendlike anything but loverlike the nameless charm of last night had left his manner he was no longer the same man or at any rate the same heart did not beat in his breast rude disappointment sharp cross at first the eager girl would not believe in the change though she saw and felt it it was difficult to withdraw her hand from his till he had bestowed at least something like a kind pressure it was difficult to turn her eyes from his eyes till his looks had expressed something more and fonder than that cool welcome  a lover masculine so disappointed can speak and urge explanation a lover feminine can say nothing if she did the result would be shame and anguish inward remorse for selftreachery nature would brand such demonstration as a rebellion against her instincts and would vindictively repay it afterwards by the thunderbolt of selfcontempt smiting suddenly in secret take the matter as you find it ask no questions utter no remonstrances it is your best wisdom you expected bread and you have got a stone break your teeth on it and dont shriek because the nerves are martyrized do not doubt that your mental stomachif you have such a thingis strong as an ostrichs the stone will digest you held out your hand for an egg and fate put into it a scorpion show no consternation close your fingers firmly upon the gift let it sting through your palm never mind in time after your hand and arm have swelled and quivered long with torture the squeezed scorpion will die and you will have learned the great lesson how to endure without a sob for the whole remnant of your life if you survive the testsome it is said die under ityou will be stronger wiser less sensitive this you are not aware of perhaps at the time and so cannot borrow courage of that hope nature however as has been intimated is an excellent friend in such cases sealing the lips interdicting utterance commanding a placid dissimulationa dissimulation often wearing an easy and gay mien at first settling down to sorrow and paleness in time then passing away and leaving a convenient stoicism not the less fortifying because it is halfbitter  halfbitter is that wrong no it should be bitter bitterness is strengthit is a tonic sweet mild force following acute suffering you find nowhere to talk of it is delusion there may be apathetic exhaustion after the rack if energy remains it will be rather a dangerous energydeadly when confronted with injustice  who has read the ballad of puir mary leethat old scotch ballad written i know not in what generation nor by what hand mary had been illusedprobably in being made to believe that truth which was falsehood she is not complaining but she is sitting alone in the snowstorm and you hear her thoughts they are not the thoughts of a model heroine under her circumstances but they are those of a deeplyfeeling stronglyresentful peasantgirl anguish has driven her from the inglenook of home to the whiteshrouded and icy hills crouched under the cauld drift she recalls every image of horrorthe yellowwymed ask

and guffaw        o villains like robinaree  but what has been said in the last page or two is not germane to caroline helstones feelings or to the state of things between her and robert moore robert had done her no wrong he had told her no lie it was she that was to blame if any one was what bitterness her mind distilled should and would be poured on her own head she had loved without being asked to lovea natural sometimes an inevitable chance but big with misery  robert indeed had sometimes seemed to be fond of her but why because she had made herself so pleasing to him he could not in spite of all his efforts help testifying a state of feeling his judgment did not approve nor his will sanction he was about to withdraw decidedly from intimate communication with her because he did not choose to have his affections inextricably entangled nor to be drawn despite his reason into a marriage he believed imprudent now what was she to do to give way to her feelings or to vanquish them to pursue him or to turn upon herself if she is weak she will try the first expedientwill lose his esteem and win his aversion if she has sense she will be her own governor and resolve to subdue and bring under guidance the disturbed realm of her emotions she will determine to look on life steadily as it is to begin to learn its severe truths seriously and to study its knotty problems closely conscientiously  it appeared she had a little sense for she quitted robert quietly without complaint or question without the alteration of a muscle or the shedding of a tear betook herself to her studies under hortense as usual and at dinnertime went home without lingering  when she had dined and found herself in the rectory drawingroom alone having left her uncle over his temperate glass of port wine the difficulty that occurred to and embarrassed her was how am i to get through this day  last night she had hoped it would be spent as yesterday was that the evening would be again passed with happiness and robert she had learned her mistake this morning and yet she could not settle down convinced that no chance would occur to recall her to hollows cottage or to bring moore again into her society  he had walked up after tea more than once to pass an hour with her uncle the doorbell had rung his voice had been heard in the passage just at twilight when she little expected such a pleasure and this had happened twice after he had treated her with peculiar reserve and though he rarely talked to her in her uncles presence he had looked at her relentingly as he sat opposite her worktable during his stay the few words he had spoken to her were comforting his manner on bidding her goodnight was genial now he might come this evening said false hope she almost knew it was false hope which breathed the whisper and yet she listened  she tried to readher thoughts wandered she tried to sewevery stitch she put in was an ennui the occupation was insufferably tedious she opened her desk and attempted to write a french compositionshe wrote nothing but mistakes  suddenly the doorbell sharply rang her heart leaped she sprang to the drawingroom door opened it softly peeped through the aperture fanny was admitting a visitora gentlemana tall manjust the height of robert for one second she thought it was robertfor one second she exulted but the voice asking for mr helstone undeceived her that voice was an irish voice consequently not moores but the curatesmalones he was ushered into the diningroom where doubtless he speedily helped his rector to empty the decanters  it was a fact to be noted that at whatever house in briarfield whinbury or nunnely one curate dropped in to a mealdinner or tea as the case might beanother presently followed often two more not that they gave each other the rendezvous but they were usually all on the run at the same time and when donne for instance sought malone at his lodgings and found him not he inquired whither he had posted and having learned of the landlady his destination hastened with all speed after him the same causes operated in the same way with sweeting thus it chanced on that afternoon that carolines ears were three times tortured with the ringing of the bell and the advent of undesired guests for donne followed malone and sweeting followed donne and more wine was ordered up from the cellar into the diningroom for though old helstone chid the inferior priesthood when he found them carousing as he called it in their own tents yet at his hierarchical table he ever liked to treat them to a glass of his best and through the closed doors caroline heard their boyish laughter and the vacant cackle of their voices her fear was lest they should stay to tea for she had no pleasure in making tea for that particular trio what distinctions people draw these three were menyoung meneducated men like moore yet for her how great the difference their society was a borehis a delight  not only was she destined to be favoured with their clerical company but fortune was at this moment bringing her four other guestslady guests all packed in a ponyphaeton now rolling somewhat heavily along the road from whinbury an elderly lady and three of her buxom daughters were coming to see her in a friendly way as the custom of that neighbourhood was yes a fourth time the bell clanged fanny brought the present announcement to the drawingroom  mrs sykes and the three misses sykes  when caroline was going to receive company her habit was to wring her hands very nervously to flush a little and come forward hurriedly yet hesitatingly wishing herself meantime at jericho she was at such crises sadly deficient in finished manner though she had once been at school a year accordingly on this occasion her small white hands sadly maltreated each other while she stood up waiting the entrance of mrs sykes  in stalked that lady a tall bilious gentlewoman who made an ample and not altogether insincere profession of piety and was greatly given to hospitality towards the clergy in sailed her three daughters a showy trio being all three wellgrown and more or less handsome  in english country ladies there is this point to be remarked whether young or old pretty or plain dull or sprightly they all or almost all have a certain expression stamped on their features which seems to say i knowi do not boast of it but i know that i am the standard of what is proper let every one therefore whom i approach or who approaches me keep a sharp lookout for wherein they differ from mebe the same in dress manner opinion principle or practicetherein they are wrong  mrs and misses sykes far from being exceptions to this observation were pointed illustrations of its truth miss marya welllooked wellmeant and on the whole welldispositioned girlwore her complacency with some state though without harshness miss harrieta beautycarried it more overbearingly she looked high and cold miss hannah who was conceited dashing pushing flourished hers consciously and openly the mother evinced it with the gravity proper to her age and religious fame  the reception was got through somehow caroline was glad to see them an unmitigated fib hoped they were well hoped mrs sykess cough was better mrs sykes had had a cough for the last twenty years hoped the misses sykes had left their sisters at home well to which inquiry the misses sykes sitting on three chairs opposite the musicstool whereon caroline had undesignedly come to anchor after wavering for some seconds between it and a large armchair into which she at length recollected she ought to induct mrs sykesand indeed that lady saved her the trouble by depositing herself thereinthe misses sykes replied to caroline by one simultaneous bow very majestic and mighty awful a pause followed this bow was of a character to ensure silence for the next five minutes and it did mrs sykes then inquired after mr helstone and whether he had had any return of rheumatism and whether preaching twice on a sunday fatigued him and if he was capable of taking a full service now and on being assured he was she and all her daughters combining in chorus expressed their opinion that he was a wonderful man of his years  pause second  miss mary getting up the steam in her turn asked whether caroline had attended the bible society meeting which had been held at nunnely last thursday night the negative answer which truth compelled caroline to utterfor last thursday evening she had been sitting at home reading a novel which robert had lent herelicited a simultaneous expression of surprise from the lips of the four ladies  we were all there said miss marymamma and all of us we even persuaded papa to go hannah would insist upon it but he fell asleep while mr langweilig the german moravian minister was speaking i felt quite ashamed he nodded so  and there was dr broadbent cried hannahsuch a beautiful speaker you couldnt expect it of him for he is almost a vulgarlooking man  but such a dear man interrupted mary  and such a good man such a useful man added her mother  only like a butcher in appearance interposed the fair proud harriet i couldnt bear to look at him i listened with my eyes shut  miss helstone felt her ignorance and incompetency not having seen dr broadbent she could not give her opinion pause third came on during its continuance caroline was feeling at her hearts core what a dreaming fool she was what an unpractical life she led how little fitness there was in her for ordinary intercourse with the ordinary world she was feeling how exclusively she had attached herself to the white cottage in the hollow how in the existence of one inmate of that cottage she had pent all her universe she was sensible that this would not do and that some day she would be forced to make an alteration it could not be said that she exactly wished to resemble the ladies before her but she wished to become superior to her present self so as to feel less scared by their dignity  the sole means she found of reviving the flagging discourse was by asking them if they would all stay to tea and a cruel struggle it cost her to perform this piece of civility mrs sykes had begun we are much obliged to you but when in came fanny once more  the gentlemen will stay the evening maam was the message she brought from mr helstone  what gentlemen have you now inquired mrs sykes their names were specified she and her daughters interchanged glances the curates were not to them what they were to caroline mr sweeting was quite a favourite with them even mr malone rather so because he was a clergyman really since you have company already i think we will stay remarked mrs sykes we shall be quite a pleasant little party i always like to meet the clergy  and now caroline had to usher them upstairs to help them to unshawl smooth their hair and make themselves smart to reconduct them to the drawingroom to distribute amongst them books of engravings or odd things purchased from the jewbasket she was obliged to be a purchaser though she was but a slack contributor and if she had possessed plenty of money she would rather when it was brought to the rectoryan awful incubushave purchased the whole stock than contributed a single pincushion  it ought perhaps to be explained in passing for the benefit of those who are not au fait to the mysteries of the jewbasket and missionarybasket that these meubles are willow repositories of the capacity of a goodsized family clothesbasket dedicated to the purpose of conveying from house to house a monster collection of pincushions needlebooks cardracks workbags articles of infant wear etc etc etc made by the willing or reluctant hands of the christian ladies of a parish and sold perforce to the heathenish gentlemen thereof at prices unblushingly exorbitant the proceeds of such compulsory sales are applied to the conversion of the jews the seeking up of the ten missing tribes or to the regeneration of the interesting coloured population of the globe each lady contributor takes it in her turn to keep the basket a month to sew for it and to foist off its contents on a shrinking male public an exciting time it is when that turn comes round some activeminded woman with a good trading spirit like it and enjoy exceedingly the fun of making hardhanded worstedspinners cash up to the tune of four or five hundred per cent above cost price for articles quite useless to them other feebler souls object to it and would rather see the prince of darkness himself at their door any morning than that phantom basket brought with mrs rouses compliments and please maam she says its your turn now  miss helstones duties of hostess performed more anxiously than cheerily she betook herself to the kitchen to hold a brief privycouncil with fanny and eliza about the tea  what a lot on em cried eliza who was cook and i put off the baking today because i thought there would be bread plenty to fit while morning we shall never have enow  are there any teacakes asked the young mistress  only three and a loaf i wish these fine folk would stay at home till theyre asked and i want to finish trimming my hat bonnet she meant  then suggested caroline to whom the importance of the emergency gave a certain energy fanny must run down to briarfield and buy some muffins and crumpets and some biscuits and dont be cross eliza we cant help it now  and which teathings are we to have  oh the best i suppose ill get out the silver service and she ran upstairs to the platecloset and presently brought down teapot creamewer and sugarbasin  and mun we have th urn  yes and now get it ready as quickly as you can for the sooner we have tea over the sooner they will goat least i hope so heighho i wish they were gone she sighed as she returned to the drawingroom still she thought as she paused at the door ere opening it if robert would but come even now how bright all would be how comparatively easy the task of amusing these people if he were present there would be an interest in hearing him talk though he never says much in company and in talking in his presence there can be no interest in hearing any of them or in speaking to them how they will gabble when the curates come in and how weary i shall grow with listening to them but i suppose i am a selfish fool these are very respectable gentlefolks i ought no doubt to be proud of their countenance i dont say they are not as good as i amfar from itbut they are different from me  she went in  yorkshire people in those days took their tea round the table sitting well into it with their knees duly introduced under the mahogany it was essential to have a multitude of plates of bread and butter varied in sorts and plentiful in quantity it was thought proper too that on the centre plate should stand a glass dish of marmalade among the viands was expected to be found a small assortment of cheesecakes and tarts if there was also a plate of thin slices of pink ham garnished with green parsley so much the better  eliza the rectors cook fortunately knew her business as provider she had been put out of humour a little at first when the invaders came so unexpectedly in such strength but it appeared that she regained her cheerfulness with action for in due time the tea was spread forth in handsome style and neither ham tarts nor marmalade were wanting among its accompaniments  the curates summoned to this bounteous repast entered joyous but at once on seeing the ladies of whose presence they had not been forewarned they came to a stand in the doorway malone headed the party he stopped short and fell back almost capsizing donne who was behind him donne staggering three paces in retreat sent little sweeting into the arms of old helstone who brought up the rear there was some expostulation some tittering malone was desired to mind what he was about and urged to push forward which at last he did though colouring to the top of his peaked forehead a bluish purple helstone advancing set the shy curates aside welcomed all his fair guests shook hands and passed a jest with each and seated himself snugly between the lovely harriet and the dashing hannah miss mary he requested to move to the seat opposite to him that he might see her if he couldnt be near her perfectly easy and gallant in his way were his manners always to young ladies and most popular was he amongst them yet at heart he neither respected nor liked the sex and such of them as circumstances had brought into intimate relation with him had ever feared rather than loved him  the curates were left to shift for themselves sweeting who was the least embarrassed of the three took refuge beside mrs sykes who he knew was almost as fond of him as if he had been her son donne after making his general bow with a grace all his own and saying in a high pragmatical voice how dye do miss helstone dropped into a seat at carolines elbow to her unmitigated annoyance for she had a peculiar antipathy to donne on account of his stultified and immovable selfconceit and his incurable narrowness of mind malone grinning most unmeaningly inducted himself into the corresponding seat on the other side she was thus blessed in a pair of supporters neither of whom she knew would be of any mortal use whether for keeping up the conversation handing cups circulating the muffins or even lifting the plate from the slopbasin little sweeting small and boyish as he was would have been worth twenty of them  malone though a ceaseless talker when there were only men present was usually tonguetied in the presence of ladies three phrases however he had ready cut and dried which he never failed to produce  1stly have you had a walk today miss helstone  2ndly have you seen your cousin moore lately  3rdly does your class at the sunday school keep up its number  these three questions being put and responded to between caroline and malone reigned silence  with donne it was otherwise he was troublesome exasperating he had a stock of smalltalk on hand at once the most trite and perverse that can well be imaginedabuse of the people of briarfield of the natives of yorkshire generally complaints of the want of high society of the backward state of civilization in these districts murmurings against the disrespectful conduct of the lower orders in the north toward their betters silly ridicule of the manner of living in these partsthe want of style the absence of elegance as if he donne had been accustomed to very great doings indeed an insinuation which his somewhat underbred manner and aspect failed to bear out these strictures he seemed to think must raise him in the estimation of miss helstone or of any other lady who heard him whereas with her at least they brought him to a level below contempt though sometimes indeed they incensed her for a yorkshire girl herself she hated to hear yorkshire abused by such a pitiful prater and when wrought up to a certain pitch she would turn and say something of which neither the matter nor the manner recommended her to mr donnes goodwill she would tell him it was no proof of refinement to be ever scolding others for vulgarity and no sign of a good pastor to be eternally censuring his flock she would ask him what he had entered the church for since he complained there were only cottages to visit and poor people to preach towhether he had been ordained to the ministry merely to wear soft clothing and sit in kings houses these questions were considered by all the curates as to the last degree audacious and impious  tea was a long time in progress all the guests gabbled as their hostess had expected they would mr helstone being in excellent spiritswhen indeed was he ever otherwise in society attractive female society it being only with the one lady of his own family that he maintained a grim taciturnitykept up a brilliant flow of easy prattle with his righthand and lefthand neighbours and even with his visàvis miss mary though as mary was the most sensible the least coquettish of the three to her the elderly widower was the least attentive at heart he could not abide sense in women he liked to see them as silly as lightheaded as vain as open to ridicule as possible because they were then in reality what he held them to be and wished them to beinferior toys to play with to amuse a vacant hour and to be thrown away  hannah was his favourite harriet though beautiful egotistical and selfsatisfied was not quite weak enough for him she had some genuine selfrespect amidst much false pride and if she did not talk like an oracle neither would she babble like one crazy she would not permit herself to be treated quite as a doll a child a plaything she expected to be bent to like a queen  hannah on the contrary demanded no respect only flattery if her admirers only told her that she was an angel she would let them treat her like an idiot so very credulous and frivolous was she so very silly did she become when besieged with attention flattered and admired to the proper degree that there were moments when helstone actually felt tempted to commit matrimony a second time and to try the experiment of taking her for his second helpmeet but fortunately the salutary recollection of the ennuis of his first marriage the impression still left on him of the weight of the millstone he had once worn round his neck the fixity of his feelings respecting the insufferable evils of conjugal existence operated as a check to his tenderness suppressed the sigh heaving his old iron lungs and restrained him from whispering to hannah proposals it would have been high fun and great satisfaction to her to hear  it is probable she would have married him if he had asked her her parents would have quite approved the match to them his fiftyfive years his bendleather heart could have presented no obstacles and as he was a rector held an excellent living occupied a good house and was supposed even to have private property though in that the world was mistaken every penny of the £5000 inherited by him from his father had been devoted to the building and endowing of a new church at his native village in lancashirefor he could show a lordly munificence when he pleased and if the end was to his liking never hesitated about making a grand sacrifice to attain ither parents i say would have delivered hannah over to his lovingkindness and his tender mercies without one scruple and the second mrs helstone inverting the natural order of insect existence would have fluttered through the honeymoon a bright admired butterfly and crawled the rest of her days a sordid trampled worm  little mr sweeting seated between mrs sykes and miss mary both of whom were very kind to him and having a dish of tarts before him and marmalade and crumpet upon his plate looked and felt more content than any monarch he was fond of all the misses sykes they were all fond of him he thought them magnificent girls quite proper to mate with one of his inches if he had a cause of regret at this blissful moment it was that miss dora happened to be absentdora being the one whom he secretly hoped one day to call mrs david sweeting with whom he dreamt of taking stately walks leading her like an empress through the village of nunnely and an empress she would have been if size could make an empress she was vast ponderous seen from behind she had the air of a very stout lady of forty but withal she possessed a good face and no unkindly character  the meal at last drew to a close it would have been over long ago if mr donne had not persisted in sitting with his cup half full of cold tea before him long after the rest had finished and after he himself had discussed such allowance of viands as he felt competent to swallowlong indeed after signs of impatience had been manifested all round the board till chairs were pushed back till the talk flagged till silence fell vainly did caroline inquire repeatedly if he would have another cup if he would take a little hot tea as that must be cold etc he would neither drink it nor leave it he seemed to think that this isolated position of his gave him somehow a certain importance that it was dignified and stately to be the last that it was grand to keep all the others waiting so long did he linger that the very urn died it ceased to hiss at length however the old rector himself who had hitherto been too pleasantly engaged with hannah to care for the delay got impatient  for whom are we waiting he asked  for me i believe returned donne complacently appearing to think it much to his credit that a party should thus be kept dependent on his movements  tut cried helstone then standing up let us return thanks said he which he did forthwith and all quitted the table donne nothing abashed still sat ten minutes quite alone whereupon mr helstone rang the bell for the things to be removed the curate at length saw himself forced to empty his cup and to relinquish the rôle which he thought had given him such a felicitous distinction drawing upon him such flattering general notice  and now in the natural course of events caroline knowing how it would be had opened the piano and produced musicbooks in readiness music was asked for this was mr sweetings chance for showing off he was eager to commence he undertook therefore the arduous task of persuading the young ladies to favour the company with an aira song con amore he went through the whole business of begging praying resisting excuses explaining away difficulties and at last succeeded in persuading miss harriet to allow herself to be led to the instrument then out came the pieces of his flute he always carried them in his pocket as unfailingly as he carried his handkerchief they were screwed and arranged malone and donne meanwhile herding together and sneering at him which the little man glancing over his shoulder saw but did not heed at all he was persuaded their sarcasm all arose from envy they could not accompany the ladies as he could he was about to enjoy a triumph over them  the triumph began malone much chagrined at hearing him pipe up in most superior style determined to earn distinction too if possible and all at once assuming the character of a swain which character he had endeavoured to enact once or twice before but in which he had not hitherto met with the success he doubtless opined his merits deserved approached a sofa on which miss helstone was seated and depositing his great irish frame near her tried his hand or rather tongue at a fine speech or two accompanied by grins the most extraordinary and incomprehensible in the course of his efforts to render himself agreeable he contrived to possess himself of the two long sofa cushions and a square one with which after rolling them about for some time with strange gestures he managed to erect a sort of barrier between himself and the object of his attentions caroline quite willing that they should be sundered soon devised an excuse for stepping over to the opposite side of the room and taking up a position beside mrs sykes of which good lady she entreated some instruction in a new stitch in ornamental knitting a favour readily granted and thus peter augustus was thrown out  very sullenly did his countenance lower when he saw himself abandonedleft entirely to his own resources on a large sofa with the charge of three small cushions on his hands the fact was he felt disposed seriously to cultivate acquaintance with miss helstone because he thought in common with others that her uncle possessed money and concluded that since he had no children he would probably leave it to his niece gérard moore was better instructed on this point he had seen the neat church that owed its origin to the rectors zeal and cash and more than once in his inmost soul had cursed an expensive caprice which crossed his wishes  the evening seemed long to one person in that room caroline at intervals dropped her knitting on her lap and gave herself up to a sort of brainlethargyclosing her eyes and depressing her headcaused by what seemed to her the unmeaning hum around herthe inharmonious tasteless rattle of the piano keys the squeaking and gasping notes of the flute the laughter and mirth of her uncle and hannah and mary she could not tell whence originating for she heard nothing comic or gleeful in their discourse and more than all by the interminable gossip of mrs sykes murmured close at her ear gossip which rang the changes on four subjectsher own health and that of the various members of her family the missionary and jew baskets and their contents the late meeting at nunnely and one which was expected to come off next week at whinbury  tired at length to exhaustion she embraced the opportunity of mr sweeting coming up to speak to mrs sykes to slip quietly out of the apartment and seek a moments respite in solitude she repaired to the diningroom where the clear but now low remnant of a fire still burned in the grate the place was empty and quiet glasses and decanters were cleared from the table the chairs were put back in their places all was orderly caroline sank into her uncles large easychair half shut her eyes and rested herselfrested at least her limbs her senses her hearing her visionweary with listening to nothing and gazing on vacancy as to her mind that flew directly to the hollow it stood on the threshold of the parlour there then it passed to the countinghouse and wondered which spot was blessed by the presence of robert it so happened that neither locality had that honour for robert was half a mile away from both and much nearer to caroline than her deadened spirit suspected he was at this moment crossing the churchyard approaching the rectory gardengatenot however coming to see his cousin but intent solely on communicating a brief piece of intelligence to the rector  yes caroline you hear the wire of the bell vibrate it rings again for the fifth time this afternoon you start and you are certain now that this must be he of whom you dream why you are so certain you cannot explain to yourself but you know it you lean forward listening eagerly as fanny opens the door right that is the voicelow with the slight foreign accent but so sweet as you fancy you half rise fanny will tell him mr helstone is with company and then he will go away oh she cannot let him go in spite of herself in spite of her reason she walks half across the room she stands ready to dart out in case the step should retreat but he enters the passage since your master is engaged he says just show me into the diningroom bring me pen and ink i will write a short note and leave it for him  now having caught these words and hearing him advance caroline if there was a door within the diningroom would glide through it and disappear she feels caught hemmed in she dreads her unexpected presence may annoy him a second since she would have flown to him that second past she would flee from him she cannot there is no way of escape the diningroom has but one door through which now enters her cousin the look of troubled surprise she expected to see in his face has appeared there has shocked her and is gone she has stammered a sort of apology  i only left the drawingroom a minute for a little quiet  there was something so diffident and downcast in the air and tone with which she said this any one might perceive that some saddening change had lately passed over her prospects and that the faculty of cheerful selfpossession had left her mr moore probably remembered how she had formerly been accustomed to meet him with gentle ardour and hopeful confidence he must have seen how the check of this morning had operated here was an opportunity for carrying out his new system with effect if he chose to improve it perhaps he found it easier to practise that system in broad daylight in his millyard amidst busy occupations than in a quiet parlour disengaged at the hour of eventide fanny lit the candles which before had stood unlit on the table brought writing materials and left the room caroline was about to follow her moore to act consistently should have let her go whereas he stood in the doorway and holding out his hand gently kept her back he did not ask her to stay but he would not let her go  shall i tell my uncle you are here asked she still in the same subdued voice  no i can say to you all i had to say to him you will be my messenger  yes robert  then you may just inform him that i have got a clue to the identity of one at least of the men who broke my frames that he belongs to the same gang who attacked sykes and pearsons dressingshop and that i hope to have him in custody tomorrow you can remember that  oh yes these two monosyllables were uttered in a sadder tone than ever and as she said them she shook her head slightly and sighed will you prosecute him  doubtless  no robert  and why no caroline  because it will set all the neighbourhood against you more than ever  that is no reason why i should not do my duty and defend my property this fellow is a great scoundrel and ought to be incapacitated from perpetrating further mischief  but his accomplices will take revenge on you you do not know how the people of this country bear malice it is the boast of some of them that they can keep a stone in their pocket seven years turn it at the end of that time keep it seven years longer and hurl it and hit their mark at last  moore laughed  a most pithy vaunt said heone that redounds vastly to the credit of your dear yorkshire friends but dont fear for me lina i am on my guard against these lamblike compatriots of yours dont make yourself uneasy about me  how can i help it you are my cousin if anything happened she stopped  nothing will happen lina to speak in your own language there is a providence above allis there not  yes dear robert may he guard you  and if prayers have efficacy yours will benefit me you pray for me sometimes  not sometimes robert you and louis and hortense are always remembered  so i have often imagined it has occurred to me when weary and vexed i have myself gone to bed like a heathen that another had asked forgiveness for my day and safety for my night i dont suppose such vicarial piety will avail much but the petitions come out of a sincere breast from innocent lips they should be acceptable as abels offering and doubtless would be if the object deserved them  annihilate that doubt it is groundless  when a man has been brought up only to make money and lives to make it and for nothing else and scarcely breathes any other air than that of mills and markets it seems odd to utter his name in a prayer or to mix his idea with anything divine and very strange it seems that a good pure heart should take him in and harbour him as if he had any claim to that sort of nest if i could guide that benignant heart i believe i should counsel it to exclude one who does not profess to have any higher aim in life than that of patching up his broken fortune and wiping clean from his bourgeois scutcheon the foul stain of bankruptcy  the hint though conveyed thus tenderly and modestly as caroline thought was felt keenly and comprehended clearly  indeed i only thinkor i will only thinkof you as my cousin was the quick answer i am beginning to understand things better than i did robert when you first came to englandbetter than i did a week a day ago i know it is your duty to try to get on and that it wont do for you to be romantic but in future you must not misunderstand me if i seem friendly you misunderstood me this morning did you not  what made you think so  your lookyour manner  but look at me now  oh you are different now at present i dare speak to you  yet i am the same except that i have left the tradesman behind me in the hollow your kinsman alone stands before you  my cousin robertnot mr moore  not a bit of mr moore caroline  here the company was heard rising in the other room the door was opened the ponycarriage was ordered shawls and bonnets were demanded mr helstone called for his niece  i must go robert  yes you must go or they will come in and find us here and i rather than meet all that host in the passage will take my departure through the window luckily it opens like a door one minute onlyput down the candle an instantgoodnight i kiss you because we are cousins and being cousins onetwothree kisses are allowable caroline goodnight     chapter viii  noah and moses   the next day moore had risen before the sun and had taken a ride to whinbury and back ere his sister had made the café au lait or cut the tartines for his breakfast what business he transacted there he kept to himself hortense asked no questions it was not her wont to comment on his movements nor his to render an account of them the secrets of businesscomplicated and often dismal mysterieswere buried in his breast and never came out of their sepulchre save now and then to scare joe scott or give a start to some foreign correspondent indeed a general habit of reserve on whatever was important seemed bred in his mercantile blood  breakfast over he went to his countinghouse henry joe scotts boy brought in the letters and the daily papers moore seated himself at his desk broke the seals of the documents and glanced them over they were all short but not it seemed sweetprobably rather sour on the contrary for as moore laid down the last his nostrils emitted a derisive and defiant snuff and though he burst into no soliloquy there was a glance in his eye which seemed to invoke the devil and lay charges on him to sweep the whole concern to gehenna however having chosen a pen and stripped away the feathered top in a brief spasm of fingerfury only fingerfuryhis face was placid he dashed off a batch of answers sealed them and then went out and walked through the mill on coming back he sat down to read his newspaper  the contents seemed not absorbingly interesting he more than once laid it across his knee folded his arms and gazed into the fire he occasionally turned his head towards the window he looked at intervals at his watch in short his mind appeared preoccupied perhaps he was thinking of the beauty of the weatherfor it was a fine and mild morning for the seasonand wishing to be out in the fields enjoying it the door of his countinghouse stood wide open the breeze and sunshine entered freely but the first visitant brought no spring perfume on its wings only an occasional sulphurpuff from the sootthick column of smoke rushing sable from the gaunt millchimney  a darkblue apparition that of joe scott fresh from a dyeing vat appeared momentarily at the open door uttered the words hes comed sir and vanished  mr moore raised not his eyes from the paper a large man broadshouldered and massivelimbed clad in fustian garments and gray worsted stockings entered who was received with a nod and desired to take a seat which he did making the remark as he removed his hat a very bad one stowed it away under his chair and wiped his forehead with a spotted cotton handkerchief extracted from the hatcrown that it was raight dahn warm for febewerry mr moore assentedat least he uttered some slight sound which though inarticulate might pass for an assent the visitor now carefully deposited in the corner beside him an officiallooking staff which he bore in his hand this done he whistled probably by way of appearing at his ease  you have what is necessary i suppose said mr moore  ay ay alls right  he renewed his whistling mr moore his reading the paper apparently had become more interesting presently however he turned to his cupboard which was within reach of his long arm opened it without rising took out a black bottlethe same he had produced for malones benefita tumbler and a jug placed them on the table and said to his guest  help yourself theres water in that jar in the corner  i dunnut knaw that theres mich need for all a body is dry thirsty in a morning said the fustian gentleman rising and doing as requested  will you tak naught yourseln mr moore he inquired as with skilled hand he mixed a portion and having tested it by a deep draught sank back satisfied and bland in his seat moore chary of words replied by a negative movement and murmur  yahd as good continued his visitor it uld set ye up wald a sup o this stuff uncommon good hollands ye get it fro furrin parts ise think  ay  tak my advice and try a glass ont them lads ats coming ll keep ye talking nobdy knows how long yell need propping  have you seen mr sykes this morning inquired moore  i seed him a hauf an hournay happen a quarter of an hour sin just afore i set off he said he aimed to come here and i sudnt wonder but yell have old helstone too i seed em saddling his little nag as i passed at back o t rectory  the speaker was a true prophet for the trot of a little nags hoofs was five minutes after heard in the yard it stopped and a wellknown nasal voice cried aloud boy probably addressing harry scott who usually hung about the premises from 9 am to 5 pm take my horse and lead him into the stable  helstone came in marching nimbly and erect looking browner keener and livelier than usual  beautiful morning moore how do my boy ha whom have we here turning to the personage with the staff sugden what youre going to work directly on my word you lose no time but i come to ask explanations your message was delivered to me are you sure you are on the right scent how do you mean to set about the business have you got a warrant  sugden has  then you are going to seek him now ill accompany you  you will be spared that trouble sir he is coming to seek me im just now sitting in state waiting his arrival  and who is it one of my parishioners  joe scott had entered unobserved he now stood a most sinister phantom half his person being dyed of the deepest tint of indigo leaning on the desk his masters answer to the rectors question was a smile joe took the word putting on a quiet but pawky look he said  its a friend of yours mr helstone a gentleman you often speak of  indeed his name joe you look well this morning  only the rev moses barraclough t tub orator you call him sometimes i think  ah said the rector taking out his snuffbox and administering to himself a very long pinchah couldnt have supposed it why the pious man never was a workman of yours moore hes a tailor by trade  and so much the worse grudge i owe him for interfering and setting my discarded men against me  and moses was actually present at the battle of stilbro moor he went there wooden leg and all  ay sir said joe he went there on horseback that his leg mightnt be noticed he was the captain and wore a mask the rest only had their faces blackened  and how was he found out  ill tell you sir said joe t maisters not so fond of talking ive no objections he courted sarah mr moores sarvant lass and so it seems she would have nothing to say to him she either didnt like his wooden leg or shed some notion about his being a hypocrite happen for women is queer hands we may say that amang werseln when theres none of em nigh shed have encouraged him in spite of his leg and his deceit just to pass time like ive known some on em do as mich and some o t bonniest and mimmestlooking tooay ive seen clean trim young things that looked as denty and pure as daisies and wi time a body fun em out to be nowt but stinging venomed nettles  joes a sensible fellow interjected helstone  howsiver sarah had another string to her bow fred murgatroyd one of our lads is for her and as women judge men by their facesand fred has a middling face while moses is none so handsome as we all knawthe lass took on wi fred a twothree months sin murgatroyd and moses chanced to meet one sunday night theyd both come lurking about these premises wi the notion of counselling sarah to tak a bit of a walk wi them they fell out had a tussle and fred was worsted for hes young and small and barraclough for all he has only one leg is almost as strong as sugden thereindeed anybody that hears him roaring at a revival or a lovefeast may be sure hes no weakling  joe youre insupportable here broke in mr moore you spin out your explanation as moses spins out his sermons the long and short of it is murgatroyd was jealous of barraclough and last night as he and a friend took shelter in a barn from a shower they heard and saw moses conferring with some associates within from their discourse it was plain he had been the leader not only at stilbro moor but in the attack on sykess property moreover they planned a deputation to wait on me this morning which the tailor is to head and which in the most religious and peaceful spirit is to entreat me to put the accursed thing out of my tent i rode over to whinbury this morning got a constable and a warrant and i am now waiting to give my friend the reception he deserves here meantime comes sykes mr helstone you must spirit him up he feels timid at the thoughts of prosecuting  a gig was heard to roll into the yard mr sykes entereda tall stout man of about fifty comely of feature but feeble of physiognomy he looked anxious  have they been are they gone have you got him is it over he asked  not yet returned moore with phlegm we are waiting for them  theyll not come its near noon better give it up it will excite bad feelingmake a stircause perhaps fatal consequences  you need not appear said moore i shall meet them in the yard when they come you can stay here  but my name must be seen in the law proceedings a wife and family mr moorea wife and family make a man cautious  moore looked disgusted give way if you please said he leave me to myself i have no objection to act alone only be assured you will not find safety in submission your partner pearson gave way and conceded and forbore well that did not prevent them from attempting to shoot him in his own house  my dear sir take a little wine and water recommended mr helstone the wine and water was hollands and water as mr sykes discovered when he had compounded and swallowed a brimming tumbler thereof it transfigured him in two minutes brought the colour back to his face and made him at least wordvaliant he now announced that he hoped he was above being trampled on by the common people he was determined to endure the insolence of the workingclasses no longer he had considered of it and made up his mind to go all lengths if money and spirit could put down these rioters they should be put down mr moore might do as he liked but hechristie sykeswould spend his last penny in law before he would be beaten hed settle them or hed see  take another glass urged moore  mr sykes didnt mind if he did this was a cold morning sugden had found it a warm one it was necessary to be careful at this season of the yearit was proper to take something to keep the damp out he had a little cough already here he coughed in attestation of the fact something of this sort lifting the black bottle was excellent taken medicinally he poured the physic into his tumbler he didnt make a practice of drinking spirits in a morning but occasionally it really was prudent to take precautions  quite prudent and take them by all means urged the host  mr sykes now addressed mr helstone who stood on the hearth his shovelhat on his head watching him significantly with his little keen eyes  you sir as a clergyman said he may feel it disagreeable to be present amidst scenes of hurry and flurry and i may say peril i dare say your nerves wont stand it youre a man of peace sir but we manufacturers living in the world and always in turmoil get quite belligerent really theres an ardour excited by the thoughts of danger that makes my heart pant when mrs sykes is afraid of the house being attacked and broke openas she is every nighti get quite excited i couldnt describe to you sir my feelings really if anybody was to comethieves or anythingi believe i should enjoy it such is my spirit  the hardest of laughs though brief and low and by no means insulting was the response of the rector moore would have pressed upon the heroic millowner a third tumbler but the clergyman who never transgressed nor would suffer others in his presence to transgress the bounds of decorum checked him  enough is as good as a feast is it not mr sykes he said and mr sykes assented and then sat and watched joe scott remove the bottle at a sign from helstone with a selfsatisfied simper on his lips and a regretful glisten in his eye moore looked as if he should have liked to fool him to the top of his bent what would a certain young kinswoman of his have said could she have seen her dear good great roberther coriolanusjust now would she have acknowledged in that mischievous sardonic visage the same face to which she had looked up with such love which had bent over her with such gentleness last night was that the man who had spent so quiet an evening with his sister and his cousinso suave to one so tender to the otherreading shakespeare and listening to chénier  yes it was the same man only seen on a different sidea side caroline had not yet fairly beheld though perhaps she had enough sagacity faintly to suspect its existence well caroline had doubtless her defective side too she was human she must then have been very imperfect and had she seen moore on his very worst side she would probably have said this to herself and excused him love can excuse anything except meanness but meanness kills love cripples even natural affection without esteem true love cannot exist moore with all his faults might be esteemed for he had no moral scrofula in his mind no hopeless polluting taintsuch for instance as that of falsehood neither was he the slave of his appetites the active life to which he had been born and bred had given him something else to do than to join the futile chase of the pleasurehunter he was a man undegraded the disciple of reason not the votary of sense the same might be said of old helstone neither of these two would look think or speak a lie for neither of them had the wretched black bottle which had just been put away any charms both might boast a valid claim to the proud title of lord of the creation for no animal vice was lord of them they looked and were superior beings to poor sykes  a sort of gathering and trampling sound was heard in the yard and then a pause moore walked to the window helstone followed both stood on one side the tall junior behind the undersized senior looking forth carefully so that they might not be visible from without their sole comment on what they saw was a cynical smile flashed into each others stern eyes  a flourishing oratorical cough was now heard followed by the interjection whisht designed as it seemed to still the hum of several voices moore opened his casement an inch or two to admit sound more freely  joseph scott began a snuffling voicescott was standing sentinel at the countinghouse doormight we inquire if your master be within and is to be spoken to  hes within ay said joe nonchalantly  would you then if you please emphasis on you have the goodness to tell him that twelve gentlemen wants to see him  hed happen ax what for suggested joe i mught as weel tell him that at t same time  for a purpose was the answer joe entered  please sir theres twelve gentlemen wants to see ye for a purpose  good joe im their mansugden come when i whistle  moore went out chuckling dryly he advanced into the yard one hand in his pocket the other in his waistcoat his cap brim over his eyes shading in some measure their deep dancing ray of scorn twelve men waited in the yard some in their shirtsleeves some in blue aprons two figured conspicuously in the van of the party one a little dapper strutting man with a turnedup nose the other a broadshouldered fellow distinguished no less by his demure face and cat like trustless eyes than by a wooden leg and stout crutch there was a kind of leer about his lips he seemed laughing in his sleeve at some person or thing his whole air was anything but that of a true man  goodmorning mr barraclough said moore debonairly for him  peace be unto you was the answer mr barraclough entirely closing his naturally halfshut eyes as he delivered it  im obliged to you peace is an excellent thing theres nothing i more wish for myself but that is not all you have to say to me i suppose i imagine peace is not your purpose  as to our purpose began barraclough its one that may sound strange and perhaps foolish to ears like yours for the childer of this world is wiser in their generation than the childer of light  to the point if you please and let me hear what it is  yese hear sir if i cannot get it off theres eleven behint can help me it is a grand purpose and changing his voice from a halfsneer to a whine its the looards own purpose and thats better  do you want a subscription to a new ranters chapel mr barraclough unless your errand be something of that sort i cannot see what you have to do with it  i hadnt that duty on my mind sir but as providence has led ye to mention the subject ill make it i my way to tak ony trifle ye may have to spare the smallest contribution will be acceptable  with that he doffed his hat and held it out as a beggingbox a brazen grin at the same time crossing his countenance  if i gave you sixpence you would drink it  barraclough uplifted the palms of his hands and the whites of his eyes evincing in the gesture a mere burlesque of hypocrisy  you seem a fine fellow said moore quite coolly and dryly you dont care for showing me that you are a doubledyed hypocrite that your trade is fraud you expect indeed to make me laugh at the cleverness with which you play your coarsely farcical part while at the same time you think you are deceiving the men behind you  moses countenance lowered he saw he had gone too far he was going to answer when the second leader impatient of being hitherto kept in the background stepped forward this man did not look like a traitor though he had an exceedingly selfconfident and conceited air  mr moore commenced he speaking also in his throat and nose and enunciating each word very slowly as if with a view to giving his audience time to appreciate fully the uncommon elegance of the phraseology it might perhaps justly be said that reason rather than peace is our purpose we come in the first place to request you to hear reason and should you refuse it is my duty to warn you in very decided terms that measures will be had resort to he meant recourse which will probably terminate inin bringing you to a sense of the unwisdom of thethe foolishness which seems to guide and guard your proceedings as a tradesman in this manufacturing part of the country hem sir i would beg to allude that as a furriner coming from a distant coast another quarter and hemisphere of this globe thrown as i may say a perfect outcast on these shoresthe cliffs of albionyou have not that understanding of huz and wer ways which might conduce to the benefit of the workingclasses if to come at once to particlars youd consider to give up this here miln and go without further protractions straight home to where you belong it ud happen be as well i can see naught ageean such a planwhat hev ye to say tullt lads turning round to the other members of the deputation who responded unanimously hear hear  brayvo noah o tims murmured joe scott who stood behind mr moore mosesll niver beat that cliffs o albion and t other hemisphere my certy did ye come fro th antarctic zone maister moses is dished  moses however refused to be dished he thought he would try again casting a somewhat ireful glance at noah o tims he launched out in his turn and now he spoke in a serious tone relinquishing the sarcasm which he found had not answered  or iver you set up the pole o your tent amang us mr moore we lived i peace and quietnessyea i may say in all lovingkindness i am not myself an aged person as yet but i can remember as far back as maybe some twenty year when handlabour were encouraged and respected and no mischiefmaker had ventured to introduce these here machines which is so pernicious now im not a clothdresser myself but by trade a tailor howsiver my heart is of a softish nature im a very feeling man and when i see my brethren oppressed like my great namesake of old i stand up for em for which intent i this day speak with you face to face and advises you to part wi your infernal machinery and tak on more hands  what if i dont follow your advice mr barraclough  the looard pardon you the looard soften your heart sir  are you in connection with the wesleyans now mr barraclough  praise god bless his name im a joined methody  which in no respect prevents you from being at the same time a drunkard and a swindler i saw you one night a week ago laid deaddrunk by the roadside as i returned from stilbro market and while you preach peace you make it the business of your life to stir up dissension you no more sympathize with the poor who are in distress than you sympathize with me you incite them to outrage for bad purposes of your own so does the individual called noah of tims you two are restless meddling impudent scoundrels whose chief motiveprinciple is a selfish ambition as dangerous as it is puerile the persons behind you are some of them honest though misguided men but you two i count altogether bad  barraclough was going to speak  silence you have had your say and now i will have mine as to being dictated to by you or any jack jem or jonathan on earth i shall not suffer it for a moment you desire me to quit the country you request me to part with my machinery in case i refuse you threaten me i do refusepointblank here i stay and by this mill i stand and into it will i convey the best machinery inventors can furnish what will you do the utmost you can doand this you will never dare to dois to burn down my mill destroy its contents and shoot me what then suppose that building was a ruin and i was a corpsewhat then you lads behind these two scamps would that stop invention or exhaust science not for the fraction of a second of time another and better gigmill would rise on the ruins of this and perhaps a more enterprising owner come in my place hear me ill make my cloth as i please and according to the best lights i have in its manufacture i will employ what means i choose whoever after hearing this shall dare to interfere with me may just take the consequences an example shall prove im in earnest  he whistled shrill and loud sugden his staff and warrant came on the scene  moore turned sharply to barraclough you were at stilbro said he i have proof of that you were on the moor you wore a mask you knocked down one of my men with your own handyou a preacher of the gospelsugden arrest him  moses was captured there was a cry and a rush to rescue but the right hand which all this while had lain hidden in moores breast reappearing held out a pistol  both barrels are loaded said he im quite determined keep off  stepping backwards facing the foe as he went he guarded his prey to the countinghouse he ordered joe scott to pass in with sugden and the prisoner and to bolt the door inside for himself he walked backwards and forwards along the front of the mill looking meditatively on the ground his hand hanging carelessly by his side but still holding the pistol the eleven remaining deputies watched him some time talking under their breath to each other at length one of them approached this man looked very different from either of the two who had previously spoken he was hardfavoured but modest and manlylooking  ive not much faith i moses barraclough said he and i would speak a word to you myseln mr moore its out o no illwill that im here for my part its just to mak a effort to get things straightened for theyre sorely acrooked ye see were ill offvarry ill off wer families is poor and pined were thrown out o work wi these frames we can get nought to do we can earn nought what is to be done mun we say wisht and lig us down and dee nay ive no grand words at my tongues end mr moore but i feel that it wad be a low principle for a reasonable man to starve to death like a dumb cratur i willnt dot im not for shedding blood id neither kill a man nor hurt a man and im not for pulling down mills and breaking machinesfor as ye say that way o going onll niver stop invention but ill talkill mak as big a din as ever i can invention may be all right but i know it isnt right for poor folks to starve them that governs mun find a way to help us they mun make fresh orderations yell say thats hard to do so mich louder mun we shout out then for so much slacker will t parliamentmen be to set on to a tough job  worry the parliamentmen as much as you please said moore but to worry the millowners is absurd and i for one wont stand it  yere a raight hard un returned the workman willnt ye gie us a bit o time willnt ye consent to mak your changes rather more slowly  am i the whole body of clothiers in yorkshire answer me that  yere yourseln  and only myself and if i stopped by the way an instant while others are rushing on i should be trodden down if i did as you wish me to do i should be bankrupt in a month and would my bankruptcy put bread into your hungry childrens mouths william farren neither to your dictation nor to that of any other will i submit talk to me no more about machinery i will have my own way i shall get new frames in tomorrow if you broke these i would still get more ill never give in  here the millbell rang twelve oclock it was the dinnerhour moore abruptly turned from the deputation and reentered his countinghouse  his last words had left a bad harsh impression he at least had failed in the disposing of a chance he was lord of by speaking kindly to william farrenwho was a very honest man without envy or hatred of those more happily circumstanced than himself thinking it no hardship and no injustice to be forced to live by labour disposed to be honourably content if he could but get work to domoore might have made a friend it seemed wonderful how he could turn from such a man without a conciliatory or a sympathizing expression the poor fellows face looked haggard with want he had the aspect of a man who had not known what it was to live in comfort and plenty for weeks perhaps months past and yet there was no ferocity no malignity in his countenance it was worn dejected austere but still patient how could moore leave him thus with the words ill never give in and not a whisper of goodwill or hope or aid  farren as he went home to his cottageonce in better times a decent clean pleasant place but now though still clean very dreary because so poorasked himself this question he concluded that the foreign millowner was a selfish an unfeeling and he thought too a foolish man it appeared to him that emigration had he only the means to emigrate would be preferable to service under such a master he felt much cast downalmost hopeless  on his entrance his wife served out in orderly sort such dinner as she had to give him and the bairns it was only porridge and too little of that some of the younger children asked for more when they had done their portionan application which disturbed william much while his wife quieted them as well as she could he left his seat and went to the door he whistled a cheery stave which did not however prevent a broad drop or two much more like the first of a thundershower than those which oozed from the wound of the gladiator from gathering on the lids of his gray eyes and plashing thence to the threshold he cleared his vision with his sleeve and the melting mood over a very stern one followed  he still stood brooding in silence when a gentleman in black came upa clergyman it might be seen at once but neither helstone nor malone nor donne nor sweeting he might be forty years old he was plainlooking darkcomplexioned and already rather grayhaired he stooped a little in walking his countenance as he came on wore an abstracted and somewhat doleful air but in approaching farren he looked up and then a hearty expression illuminated the preoccupied serious face  is it you william how are you he asked  middling mr hall how are ye will ye step in and rest ye  mr hall whose name the reader has seen mentioned before and who indeed was vicar of nunnely of which parish farren was a native and from whence he had removed but three years ago to reside in briarfield for the convenience of being near hollows mill where he had obtained work entered the cottage and having greeted the goodwife and the children sat down he proceeded to talk very cheerfully about the length of time that had elapsed since the family quitted his parish the changes which had occurred since he answered questions touching his sister margaret who was inquired after with much interest he asked questions in his turn and at last glancing hastily and anxiously round through his spectacles he wore spectacles for he was shortsighted at the bare room and at the meagre and wan faces of the circle about himfor the children had come round his knee and the father and mother stood before himhe said abruptly  and how are you all how do you get on  mr hall be it remarked though an accomplished scholar not only spoke with a strong northern accent but on occasion used freely northcountry expressions  we get on poorly said william were all out of work ive selled most o t household stuff as ye may see and what were to do next god knows  has mr moore turned you off  he has turned us off and ive sich an opinion of him now that i think if

and in order the better to talk it over mr hall lifted the least of the children on to his knee and placed his hand on the head of the next least but when the small things began to chatter to him he bade them whisht and fixing his eyes on the grate he regarded the handful of embers which burned there very gravely  sad times he said and they last long it is the will of god his will be done but he tries us to the utmost  again he reflected  youve no money william and youve nothing you could sell to raise a small sum  no ive selled t chest o drawers and t clock and t bit of a mahogany stand and

earnest words of religious consolation and exhortation with a mutual god bless you sir god bless you my friends they separated     chapter ix  briarmains   messrs helstone and sykes began to be extremely jocose and congratulatory with mr moore when he returned to them after dismissing the deputation he was so quiet however under their compliments upon his firmness etc and wore a countenance so like a still dark day equally beamless and breezeless that the rector after glancing shrewdly into his eyes buttoned up his felicitations with his coat and said to sykes whose senses were not acute enough to enable him to discover unassisted where his presence and conversation were a nuisance come sir your road and mine lie partly together had we not better bear each other company well bid moore goodmorning and leave him to the happy fancies he seems disposed to indulge  and where is sugden demanded moore looking up  ah ha cried helstone ive not been quite idle while you were busy ive been helping you a little i flatter myself not injudiciously i thought it better not to lose time so while you were parleying with that downlooking gentlemanfarren i think his name isi opened this back window shouted to murgatroyd who was in the stable to bring mr sykess gig round then i smuggled sugden and brother moseswooden leg and allthrough the aperture and saw them mount the gig always with our good friend sykess permission of course sugden took the reinshe drives like jehuand in another quarter of an hour barraclough will be safe in stilbro jail  very good thank you said moore and goodmorning gentlemen he added and so politely conducted them to the door and saw them clear of his premises  he was a taciturn serious man the rest of the day he did not even bandy a repartee with joe scott who for his part said to his master only just what was absolutely necessary to the progress of business but looked at him a good deal out of the corners of his eyes frequently came to poke the countinghouse fire for him and once as he was locking up for the day the mill was then working short time owing to the slackness of trade observed that it was a grand evening and he could wish mr moore to take a bit of a walk up th hollow it would do him good  at this recommendation mr moore burst into a short laugh and after demanding of joe what all this solicitude meant and whether he took him for a woman or a child seized the keys from his hand and shoved him by the shoulders out of his presence he called him back however ere he had reached the yardgate  joe do you know those farrens they are not well off i suppose  they cannot be well off sir when theyve not had work as a three month yed see yoursel at williams sorely changedfair paired theyve selled most o t stuff out o th house  he was not a bad workman  ye never had a better sir sin ye began trade  and decent peoplethe whole family  niver dacenter th wifes a raight cant body and as cleanye mught eat your porridge off th house floor theyre sorely comed down i wish william could get a job as gardener or summat i that way he understands gardening weel he once lived wi a scotchman that tached him the mysteries o that craft as they say  now then you can go joe you need not stand there staring at me  yeve no orders to give sir  none but for you to take yourself off  which joe did accordingly                                       spring evenings are often cold and raw and though this had been a fine day warm even in the morning and meridian sunshine the air chilled at sunset the ground crisped and ere dusk a hoar frost was insidiously stealing over growing grass and unfolding bud it whitened the pavement in front of briarmains mr yorkes residence and made silent havoc among the tender plants in his garden and on the mossy level of his lawn as to that great tree strongtrunked and broadarmed which guarded the gable nearest the road it seemed to defy a springnight frost to harm its still bare boughs and so did the leafless grove of walnuttrees rising tall behind the house  in the dusk of the moonless if starry night lights from windows shone vividly this was no dark or lonely scene nor even a silent one briarmains stood near the highway it was rather an old place and had been built ere that highway was cut and when a lane winding up through fields was the only path conducting to it briarfield lay scarce a mile off its hum was heard its glare distinctly seen briar chapel a large new raw wesleyan place of worship rose but a hundred yards distant and as there was even now a prayermeeting being held within its walls the illumination of its windows cast a bright reflection on the road while a hymn of a most extraordinary description such as a very quaker might feel himself moved by the spirit to dance to roused cheerily all the echoes of the vicinage the words were distinctly audible by snatches here is a quotation or two from different strains for the singers passed jauntily from hymn to hymn and from tune to tune with an ease and buoyancy all their own      oh who can explain        this struggle for life      this travail and pain        this trembling and strife      plague earthquake and famine        and tumult and war      the wonderful coming        of jesus declare      for every fight        is dreadful and loud      the warriors delight        is slaughter and blood      his foes overturning        till all shall expire      and this is with burning        and fuel and fire  here followed an interval of clamorous prayer accompanied by fearful groans a shout of ive found liberty doad o bills has fun liberty rang from the chapel and out all the assembly broke again      what a mercy is this       what a heaven of bliss     how unspeakably happy am i       gathered into the fold       with thy people enrolled     with thy people to live and to die      oh the goodness of god       in employing a clod     his tribute of glory to raise       his standard to bear       and with triumph declare     his unspeakable riches of grace      oh the fathomless love       that has deigned to approve     and prosper the work of my hands       with my pastoral crook       i went over the brook     and behold i am spread into bands      who i ask in amaze       hath begotten me these     and inquire from what quarter they came       my full heart it replies       they are born from the skies     and gives glory to god and the lamb  the stanza which followed this after another and longer interregnum of shouts yells ejaculations frantic cries agonized groans seemed to cap the climax of noise and zeal      sleeping on the brink of sin      tophet gaped to take us in      mercy to our rescue flew      broke the snare and brought us through      here as in a lions den      undevoured we still remain      pass secure the watery flood      hanging on the arm of god      here  terrible most distracting to the ear was the strained shout in which the last stanza was given      here we raise our voices higher      shout in the refiners fire      clap our hands amidst the flame      glory give to jesus name  the roof of the chapel did not fly off which speaks volumes in praise of its solid slating  but if briar chapel seemed alive so also did briarmains though certainly the mansion appeared to enjoy a quieter phase of existence than the temple some of its windows too were aglow the lower casements opened upon the lawn curtains concealed the interior and partly obscured the ray of the candles which lit it but they did not entirely muffle the sound of voice and laughter we are privileged to enter that front door and to penetrate to the domestic sanctum  it is not the presence of company which makes mr yorkes habitation lively for there is none within it save his own family and they are assembled in that farthest room to the right the back parlour  this is the usual sittingroom of an evening those windows would be seen by daylight to be of brilliantlystained glass purple and amber the predominant hues glittering round a gravelytinted medallion in the centre of each representing the suave head of william shakespeare and the serene one of john milton some canadian views hung on the wallsgreen forest and blue water sceneryand in the midst of them blazes a nighteruption of vesuvius very ardently it glows contrasted with the cool foam and azure of cataracts and the dusky depths of woods  the fire illuminating this room reader is such as if you be a southern you do not often see burning on the hearth of a private apartment it is a clear hot coal fire heaped high in the ample chimney mr yorke will have such fires even in warm summer weather he sits beside it with a book in his hand a little round stand at his elbow supporting a candle but he is not readinghe is watching his children opposite to him sits his ladya personage whom i might describe minutely but i feel no vocation to the task i see her though very plainly before mea large woman of the gravest aspect care on her front and on her shoulders but not overwhelming inevitable care rather the sort of voluntary exemplary cloud and burden people ever carry who deem it their duty to be gloomy ah welladay mrs yorke had that notion and grave as saturn she was morning noon and night and hard things she thought if any unhappy wightespecially of the female sexwho dared in her presence to show the light of a gay heart on a sunny countenance in her estimation to be mirthful was to be profane to be cheerful was to be frivolous she drew no distinctions yet she was a very good wife a very careful mother looked after her children unceasingly was sincerely attached to her husband only the worst of it was if she could have had her will she would not have permitted him to have any friend in the world beside herself all his relations were insupportable to her and she kept them at arms length  mr yorke and she agreed perfectly well yet he was naturally a social hospitable man an advocate for family unity and in his youth as has been said he liked none but lively cheerful women why he chose her how they contrived to suit each other is a problem puzzling enough but which might soon be solved if one had time to go into the analysis of the case suffice it here to say that yorke had a shadowy side as well as a sunny side to his character and that his shadowy side found sympathy and affinity in the whole of his wifes uniformly overcast nature for the rest she was a strongminded woman never said a weak or a trite thing took stern democratic views of society and rather cynical ones of human nature considered herself perfect and safe and the rest of the world all wrong her main fault was a brooding eternal immitigable suspicion of all men things creeds and parties this suspicion was a mist before her eyes a false guide in her path wherever she looked wherever she turned  it may be supposed that the children of such a pair were not likely to turn out quite ordinary commonplace beings and they were not you see six of them reader the youngest is a baby on the mothers knee it is all her own yet and that one she has not yet begun to doubt suspect condemn it derives its sustenance from her it hangs on her it clings to her it loves her above everything else in the world she is sure of that because as it lives by her it cannot be otherwise therefore she loves it  the two next are girls rose and jessy they are both now at their fathers knee they seldom go near their mother except when obliged to do so rose the elder is twelve years old she is like her fatherthe most like him of the whole groupbut it is a granite head copied in ivory all is softened in colour and line yorke himself has a harsh facehis daughters is not harsh neither is it quite pretty it is simple childlike in feature the round cheeks bloom as to the gray eyes they are otherwise than childlike a serious soul lights thema young soul yet but it will mature if the body lives and neither father nor mother have a spirit to compare with it partaking of the essence of each it will one day be better than eitherstronger much purer more aspiring rose is a still sometimes a stubborn girl now her mother wants to make of her such a woman as she is herselfa woman of dark and dreary duties and rose has a mind fullset thicksown with the germs of ideas her mother never knew it is agony to her often to have these ideas trampled on and repressed she has never rebelled yet but if hard driven she will rebel one day and then it will be once for all rose loves her father her father does not rule her with a rod of iron he is good to her he sometimes fears she will not live so bright are the sparks of intelligence which at moments flash from her glance and gleam in her language this idea makes him often sadly tender to her  he has no idea that little jessy will die young she is so gay and chattering arch original even now passionate when provoked but most affectionate if caressed by turns gentle and rattling exacting yet generous fearlessof her mother for instance whose irrationally hard and strict rule she has often defiedyet reliant on any who will help her jessy with her little piquant face engaging prattle and winning ways is made to be a pet and her fathers pet she accordingly is it is odd that the doll should resemble her mother feature by feature as rose resembles her father and yet the physiognomyhow different  mr yorke if a magic mirror were now held before you and if therein were shown you your two daughters as they will be twenty years from this night what would you think the magic mirror is here you shall learn their destiniesand first that of your little life jessy  do you know this place no you never saw it but you recognize the nature of these trees this foliagethe cypress the willow the yew stone crosses like these are not unfamiliar to you nor are these dim garlands of everlasting flowers here is the placegreen sod and a gray marble headstone jessy sleeps below she lived through an april day much loved was she much loving she often in her brief life shed tears she had frequent sorrows she smiled between gladdening whatever saw her her death was tranquil and happy in roses guardian arms for rose had been her stay and defence through many trials the dying and the watching english girls were at that hour alone in a foreign country and the soil of that country gave jessy a grave  now behold rose two years later the crosses and garlands looked strange but the hills and woods of this landscape look still stranger this indeed is far from england remote must be the shores which wear that wild luxuriant aspect this is some virgin solitude unknown birds flutter round the skirts of that forest no european river this on whose banks rose sits thinking the little quiet yorkshire girl is a lonely emigrant in some region of the southern hemisphere will she ever come back  the three eldest of the family are all boysmatthew mark and martin they are seated together in that corner engaged in some game observe their three heads much alike at a first glance at a second different at a third contrasted darkhaired darkeyed redcheeked are the whole trio small english features they all possess all own a blended resemblance to sire and mother and yet a distinctive physiognomy mark of a separate character belongs to each  i shall not say much about matthew the firstborn of the house though it is impossible to avoid gazing at him long and conjecturing what qualities that visage hides or indicates he is no plainlooking boy that jetblack hair white brow highcoloured cheek those quick dark eyes are good points in their way how is it that look as long as you will there is but one object in the room and that the most sinister to which matthews face seems to bear an affinity and of which ever and anon it reminds you strangelythe eruption of vesuvius flame and shadow seem the component parts of that lads soulno daylight in it and no sunshine and no pure cool moonbeam ever shone there he has an english frame but apparently not an english mindyou would say an italian stiletto in a sheath of british workmanship he is crossed in the gamelook at his scowl mr yorke sees it and what does he say in a low voice he pleads mark and martin dont anger your brother and this is ever the tone adopted by both parents theoretically they decry partialityno rights of primogeniture are to be allowed in that house but matthew is never to be vexed never to be opposed they avert provocation from him as assiduously as they would avert fire from a barrel of gunpowder concede conciliate is their motto wherever he is concerned the republicans are fast making a tyrant of their own flesh and blood this the younger scions know and feel and at heart they all rebel against the injustice they cannot read their parents motives they only see the difference of treatment the dragons teeth are already sown amongst mr yorkes young olivebranches discord will one day be the harvest  mark is a bonnylooking boy the most regularfeatured of the family he is exceedingly calm his smile is shrewd he can say the driest most cutting things in the quietest of tones despite his tranquillity a somewhat heavy brow speaks temper and reminds you that the smoothest waters are not always the safest besides he is too still unmoved phlegmatic to be happy life will never have much joy in it for mark by the time he is fiveandtwenty he will wonder why people ever laugh and think all fools who seem merry poetry will not exist for mark either in literature or in life its best effusions will sound to him mere rant and jargon enthusiasm will be his aversion and contempt mark will have no youth while he looks juvenile and blooming he will be already middleaged in mind his body is now fourteen years of age but his soul is already thirty  martin the youngest of the three owns another nature life may or may not be brief for him but it will certainly be brilliant he will pass through all its illusions half believe in them wholly enjoy them then outlive them that boy is not handsomenot so handsome as either of his brothers he is plain there is a husk upon him a dry shell and he will wear it till he is near twenty then he will put it off about that period he will make himself handsome he will wear uncouth manners till that age perhaps homely garments but the chrysalis will retain the power of transfiguring itself into the butterfly and such transfiguration will in due season take place for a space he will be vain probably a downright puppy eager for pleasure and desirous of admiration athirst too for knowledge he will want all that the world can give him both of enjoyment and lore he will perhaps take deep draughts at each fount that thirst satisfied what next i know not martin might be a remarkable man whether he will or not the seer is powerless to predict on that subject there has been no open vision  take mr yorkes family in the aggregate there is as much mental power in those six young heads as much originality as much activity and vigour of brain asdivided amongst half a dozen commonplace broodswould give to each rather more than an average amount of sense and capacity mr yorke knows this and is proud of his race yorkshire has such families here and there amongst her hills and woldspeculiar racy vigorous of good blood and strong brain turbulent somewhat in the pride of their strength and intractable in the force of their native powers wanting polish wanting consideration wanting docility but sound spirited and truebred as the eagle on the cliff or the steed in the steppe  a low tap is heard at the parlour door the boys have been making such a noise over their game and little jessy besides has been singing so sweet a scotch song to her fatherwho delights in scotch and italian songs and has taught his musical little daughter some of the bestthat the ring at the outer door was not observed  come in says mrs yorke in that conscientiously constrained and solemnized voice of hers which ever modulates itself to a funereal dreariness of tone though the subject it is exercised upon be but to give orders for the making of a pudding in the kitchen to bid the boys hang up their caps in the hall or to call the girls to their sewingcome in and in came robert moore  moores habitual gravity as well as his abstemiousness for the case of spirit decanters is never ordered up when he pays an evening visit has so far recommended him to mrs yorke that she has not yet made him the subject of private animadversions with her husband she has not yet found out that he is hampered by a secret intrigue which prevents him from marrying or that he is a wolf in sheeps clothingdiscoveries which she made at an early date after marriage concerning most of her husbands bachelor friends and excluded them from her board accordingly which part of her conduct indeed might be said to have its just and sensible as well as its harsh side  well is it you she says to mr moore as he comes up to her and gives his hand what are you roving about at this time of night for you should be at home  can a single man be said to have a home madam he asks  pooh says mrs yorke who despises conventional smoothness quite as much as her husband does and practises it as little and whose plain speaking on all occasions is carried to a point calculated sometimes to awaken admiration but oftener alarmpooh you need not talk nonsense to me a single man can have a home if he likes pray does not your sister make a home for you  not she joined in mr yorke hortense is an honest lass but when i was roberts age i had five or six sisters all as decent and proper as she is but you see hesther for all that it did not hinder me from looking out for a wife  and sorely he has repented marrying me added mrs yorke who liked occasionally to crack a dry jest against matrimony even though it should be at her own expense he has repented it in sackcloth and ashes robert moore as you may well believe when you see his punishment here she pointed to her children who would burden themselves with such a set of great rough lads as those if they could help it it is not only bringing them into the world though that is bad enough but they are all to feed to clothe to rear to settle in life young sir when you feel tempted to marry think of our four sons and two daughters and look twice before you leap  i am not tempted now at any rate i think these are not times for marrying or giving in marriage  a lugubrious sentiment of this sort was sure to obtain mrs yorkes approbation she nodded and groaned acquiescence but in a minute she said i make little account of the wisdom of a solomon of your age it will be upset by the first fancy that crosses you meantime sit down sir you can talk i suppose as well sitting as standing  this was her way of inviting her guest to take a chair he had no sooner obeyed her than little jessy jumped from her fathers knee and ran into mr moores arms which were very promptly held out to receive her  you talk of marrying him said she to her mother quite indignantly as she was lifted lightly to his knee and he is married now or as good he promised that i should be his wife last summer the first time he saw me in my new white frock and blue sash didnt he father these children were not accustomed to say papa and mamma their mother would allow no such nambypamby  ay my little lassie he promised ill bear witness but make him say it over again now jessy such as he are only false loons  he is not false he is too bonny to be false said jessy looking up to her tall sweetheart with the fullest confidence in his faith  bonny cried mr yorke thats the reason that he should be and proof that he is a scoundrel  but he looks too sorrowful to be false here interposed a quiet voice from behind the fathers chair if he was always laughing i should think he forgot promises soon but mr moore never laughs  your sentimental buck is the greatest cheat of all rose remarked mr yorke  hes not sentimental said rose  mr moore turned to her with a little surprise smiling at the same time  how do you know i am not sentimental rose  because i heard a lady say you were not  voilà qui devient intéressant exclaimed mr yorke hitching his chair nearer the fire a lady that has quite a romantic twang we must guess who it isrosy whisper the name low to your father dont let him hear  rose dont be too forward to talk here interrupted mrs yorke in her usual killjoy fashion nor jessy either it becomes all children especially girls to be silent in the presence of their elders  why have we tongues then asked jessy pertly while rose only looked at her mother with an expression that seemed to say she should take that maxim in and think it over at her leisure after two minutes grave deliberation she asked and why especially girls mother  firstly because i say so and secondly because discretion and reserve are a girls best wisdom  my dear madam observed moore what you say is excellentit reminds me indeed of my dear sisters observations but really it is not applicable to these little ones let rose and jessy talk to me freely or my chief pleasure in coming here is gone i like their prattle it does me good  does it not asked jessy more good than if the rough lads came round youyou call them rough mother yourself  yes mignonne a thousand times more good i have rough lads enough about me all day long poulet  there are plenty of people continued she who take notice of the boys all my uncles and aunts seem to think their nephews better than their nieces and when gentlemen come here to dine it is always matthew and mark and martin that are talked to and never rose and me mr moore is our friend and well keep himbut mind rose hes not so much your friend as he is mine he is my particular acquaintance remember that and she held up her small hand with an admonitory gesture  rose was quite accustomed to be admonished by that small hand her will daily bent itself to that of the impetuous little jessy she was guided overruled by jessy in a thousand things on all occasions of show and pleasure jessy took the lead and rose fell quietly into the background whereas when the disagreeables of lifeits work and privationswere in question rose instinctively took upon her in addition to her own share what she could of her sisters jessy had already settled it in her mind that she when she was old enough was to be married rose she decided must be an old maid to live with her look after her children keep her house this state of things is not uncommon between two sisters where one is plain and the other pretty but in this case if there was a difference in external appearance rose had the advantage her face was more regularfeatured than that of the piquant little jessy jessy however was destined to possess along with sprightly intelligence and vivacious feeling the gift of fascination the power to charm when where and whom she would rose was to have a fine generous soul a noble intellect profoundly cultivated a heart as true as steel but the manner to attract was not to be hers  now rose tell me the name of this lady who denied that i was sentimental urged mr moore  rose had no idea of tantalization or she would have held him a while in doubt she answered briefly i cant i dont know her name  describe her to me what was she like where did you see her  when jessy and i went to spend the day at whinbury with kate and susan pearson who were just come home from school there was a party at mrs pearsons and some grownup ladies were sitting in a corner of the drawingroom talking about you  did you know none of them  hannah and harriet and dora and mary sykes  good were they abusing me rosy  some of them were they called you a misanthrope i remember the word i looked for it in the dictionary when i came home it means a manhater  what besides  hannah sykes said you were a solemn puppy  better cried mr yorke laughing oh excellent hannah thats the one with the red haira fine girl but halfwitted  she has wit enough for me it appears said moore a solemn puppy indeed well rose go on  miss pearson said she believed there was a good deal of affectation about you and that with your dark hair and pale face you looked to her like some sort of a sentimental noodle  again mr yorke laughed mrs yorke even joined in this time you see in what esteem you are held behind your back said she yet i believe that miss pearson would like to catch you she set her cap at you when you first came into the country old as she is  and who contradicted her rosy inquired moore  a lady whom i dont know because she never visits here though i see her every sunday at church she sits in the pew near the pulpit i generally look at her instead of looking at my prayerbook for she is like a picture in our diningroom that woman with the dove in her handat least she has eyes like it and a nose too a straight nose that makes all her face look somehow what i call clear  and you dont know her exclaimed jessy in a tone of exceeding surprise thats so like rose mr moore i often wonder in what sort of a world my sister lives i am sure she does not live all her time in this one is continually finding out that she is quite ignorant of some little matter which everybody else knows to think of her going solemnly to church every sunday and looking all servicetime at one particular person and never so much as asking that persons name she means caroline helstone the rectors niece i remember all about it miss helstone was quite angry with anne pearson she said robert moore is neither affected nor sentimental you mistake his character utterly or rather not one of you here knows anything about it now shall i tell you what she is like i can tell what people are like and how they are dressed better than rose can  let us hear  she is nice she is fair she has a pretty white slender throat she has long curls not stiff onesthey hang loose and soft their colour is brown but not dark she speaks quietly with a clear tone she never makes a bustle in moving she often wears a gray silk dress she is neat all overher gowns and her shoes and her gloves always fit her she is what i call a lady and when i am as tall as she is i mean to be like her shall i suit you if i am will you really marry me  moore stroked jessys hair for a minute he seemed as if he would draw her nearer to him but instead he put her a little farther off  oh you wont have me you push me away  why jessy you care nothing about me you never come to see me now at the hollow  because you dont ask me  hereupon mr moore gave both the little girls an invitation to pay him a visit next day promising that as he was going to stilbro in the morning he would buy them each a present of what nature he would not then declare but they must come and see jessy was about to reply when one of the boys unexpectedly broke in  i know that miss helstone you have all been palavering about shes an ugly girl i hate her i hate all womenites i wonder what they were made for  martin said his father for martin it was the lad only answered by turning his cynical young face halfarch halftruculent towards the paternal chair martin my lad thourt a swaggering whelp now thou wilt some day be an outrageous puppy but stick to those sentiments of thine see ill write down the words now i my pocketbook the senior took out a moroccocovered book and deliberately wrote therein ten years hence martin if thou and i be both alive at that day ill remind thee of that speech  ill say the same then i mean always to hate women theyre such dolls they do nothing but dress themselves finely and go swimming about to be admired ill never marry ill be a bachelor  stick to it stick to ithesther addressing his wife i was like him when i was his agea regular misogamist and behold by the time i was threeandtwentybeing then a tourist in france and italy and the lord knows wherei curled my hair every night before i went to bed and wore a ring i my ear and would have worn one i my nose if it had been the fashion and all that i might make myself pleasing and charming to the ladies martin will do the like  will i never ive more sense what a guy you were father as to dressing i make this vow ill never dress more finely than as you see me at presentmr moore im clad in blue cloth from top to toe and they laugh at me and call me sailor at the grammarschool i laugh louder at them and say they are all magpies and parrots with their coats one colour and their waistcoats another and their trousers a third ill always wear blue cloth and nothing but blue cloth it is beneath a human beings dignity to dress himself in particoloured garments  ten years hence martin no tailors shop will have choice of colours varied enough for thy exacting taste no perfumers stores essences exquisite enough for thy fastidious senses  martin looked disdain but vouchsafed no further reply meantime mark who for some minutes had been rummaging amongst a pile of books on a sidetable took the word he spoke in a peculiarly slow quiet voice and with an expression of still irony in his face not easy to describe  mr moore said he you think perhaps it was a compliment on miss caroline helstones part to say you were not sentimental i thought you appeared confused when my sisters told you the words as if you felt flattered you turned red just like a certain vain little lad at our school who always thinks proper to blush when he gets a rise in the class for your benefit mr moore ive been looking up the word sentimental in the dictionary and i find it to mean tinctured with sentiment on examining further sentiment is explained to be thought idea notion a sentimental man then is one who has thoughts ideas notions an unsentimental man is one destitute of thought idea or notion  and mark stopped he did not smile he did not look round for admiration he had said his say and was silent  ma foi mon ami observed mr moore to yorke ce sont vraiment des enfants terribles que les vôtres  rose who had been listening attentively to marks speech replied to him there are different kinds of thoughts ideas and notions said she good and bad sentimental must refer to the bad or miss helstone must have taken it in that sense for she was not blaming mr moore she was defending him  thats my kind little advocate said moore taking roses hand  she was defending him repeated rose as i should have done had i been in her place for the other ladies seemed to speak spitefully  ladies always do speak spitefully observed martin it is the nature of womenites to be spiteful  matthew now for the first time opened his lips what a fool martin is to be always gabbling about what he does not understand  it is my privilege as a freeman to gabble on whatever subject i like responded martin  you use it or rather abuse it to such an extent rejoined the elder brother that you prove you ought to have been a slave  a slave a slave that to a yorke and from a yorke this fellow he added standing up at the table and pointing across it to matthewthis fellow forgets what every cottier in briarfield knows that all born of our house have that arched instep under which water can flowproof that there has not been a slave of the blood for three hundred years  mountebank said matthew  lads be silent exclaimed mr yorkemartin you are a mischiefmaker there would have been no disturbance but for you  indeed is that correct did i begin or did matthew had i spoken to him when he accused me of gabbling like a fool  a presumptuous fool repeated matthew  here mrs yorke commenced rocking herselfrather a portentous movement with her as it was occasionally followed especially when matthew was worsted in a conflict by a fit of hysterics  i dont see why i should bear insolence from matthew yorke or what right he has to use bad language to me observed martin  he has no right my lad but forgive your brother until seventyandseven times said mr yorke soothingly  always alike and theory and practice always adverse murmured martin as he turned to leave the room  where art thou going my son asked the father  somewhere where i shall be safe from insult if in this house i can find any such place  matthew laughed very insolently martin threw a strange look at him and trembled through all his slight lads frame but he restrained himself  i suppose there is no objection to my withdrawing he inquired  no go my lad but remember not to bear malice  martin went and matthew sent another insolent laugh after him rose lifting her fair head from moores shoulder against which for a moment it had been resting said as she directed a steady gaze to matthew martin is grieved and you are glad but i would rather be martin than you i dislike your nature  here mr moore by way of averting or at least escaping a scenewhich a sob from mrs yorke warned him was likely to come onrose and putting jessy off his knee he kissed her and rose reminding them at the same time to be sure and come to the hollow in good time tomorrow afternoon then having taken leave of his hostess he said to mr yorke may i speak a word with you and was followed by him from the room their brief conference took place in the hall  have you employment for a good workman asked moore  a nonsense question in these times when you know that every master has many good workmen to whom he cannot give full employment  you must oblige me by taking on this man if possible  my lad i can take on no more hands to oblige all england  it does not signify i must find him a place somewhere  who is he  william farren  i know william a rightdown honest man is william  he has been out of work three months he has a large family we are sure they cannot live without wages he was one of the deputation of clothdressers who came to me this morning to complain and threaten william did not threaten he only asked me to give them rather more timeto make my changes more slowly you know i cannot do that straitened on all sides as i am i have nothing for it but to push on i thought it would be idle to palaver long with them i sent them away after arresting a rascal amongst them whom i hope to transporta fellow who preaches at the chapel yonder sometimes  not moses barraclough  yes  ah youve arrested him good then out of a scoundrel youre going to make a martyr youve done a wise thing  ive done a right thing well the short and the long of it is im determined to get farren a place and i reckon on you to give him one  this is cool however exclaimed mr yorke what right have you to reckon on me to provide for your dismissed workmen what do i know about your farrens and your williams ive heard hes an honest man but am i to support all the honest men in yorkshire you may say that would be no great charge to undertake but great or little ill none of it  come mr yorke what can you find for him to do  i find youll make me use language im not accustomed to use i wish you would go home here is the door set off  moore sat down on one of the hall chairs  you cant give him work in your millgood but you have land find him some occupation on your land mr yorke  bob i thought you cared nothing about our lourdauds de paysans i dont understand this change  i do the fellow spoke to me nothing but truth and sense i answered him just as roughly as i did the rest who jabbered mere gibberish i couldnt make distinctions there and then his appearance told what he had gone through lately clearer than his words but where is the use of explaining let him have work  let him have it yourself if you are so very much in earnest strain a point  if there was a point left in my affairs to strain i would strain it till it cracked again but i received letters this morning which showed me pretty clearly where i stand and it is not far off the end of the plank my foreign market at any rate is gorged if there is no changeif there dawns no prospect of peaceif the orders in council are not at least suspended so as to open our way in the westi do not know where i am to turn i see no more light than if i were sealed in a rock so that for me to pretend to offer a man a livelihood would be to do a dishonest thing  come let us take a turn on the front it is a starlight night said mr yorke  they passed out closing the front door after them and side by side paced the frostwhite pavement to and fro  settle about farren at once urged mr moore you have large fruitgardens at yorke mills he is a good gardener give him work there  well so be it ill send for him tomorrow and well see and now my lad youre concerned about the condition of your affairs  yes a second failurewhich i may delay but which at this moment i see no way finally to avertwould blight the name of moore completely and you are aware i had fine intentions of paying off every debt and reestablishing the old firm on its former basis  you want capitalthats all you want  yes but you might as well say that breath is all a dead man wants to live  i knowi know capital is not to be had for the asking and if you were a married man and had a family like me i should think your case pretty nigh desperate but the young and unencumbered have chances peculiar to themselves i hear gossip now and then about your being on the eve of marriage with this miss and that but i suppose it is none of it true  you may well suppose that i think i am not in a position to be dreaming of marriage marriage i cannot bear the word it sounds so silly and utopian i have settled it decidedly that marriage and love are superfluities intended only for the rich who live at ease and have no need to take thought for the morrow or desperationsthe last and reckless joy of the deeply wretched who never hope to rise out of the slough of their utter poverty  i should not think so if i were circumstanced as you are i should think i could very likely get a wife with a few thousands who would suit both me and my affairs  i wonder where  would you try if you had a chance  i dont know it depends onin short it depends on many things  would you take an old woman  id rather break stones on the road  so would i would you take an ugly one  bah i hate ugliness and delight in beauty my eyes and heart yorke take pleasure in a sweet young fair face as they are repelled by a grim rugged meagre one soft delicate lines and hues please harsh ones prejudice me i wont have an ugly wife  not if she were rich  not if she were dressed in gems i could not lovei could not fancyi could not endure her my taste must have satisfaction or disgust would break out in despotism or worsefreeze to utter iciness  what bob if you married an honest goodnatured and wealthy lass though a little hardfavoured couldnt you put up with the high cheekbones the rather wide mouth and reddish hair  ill never try i tell you grace at least i will have and youth and symmetryyes and what i call beauty  and poverty and a nursery full of bairns you can neither clothe nor feed and very soon an anxious faded mother and then bankruptcy discredita lifelong struggle  let me alone yorke  if you are romantic robert and especially if you are already in love it is of no use talking  i am not romantic i am stripped of romance as bare as the white tenters in that field are of cloth  always use such figures of speech lad i can understand them and there is no love affair to disturb your judgment  i thought i had said enough on that subject before love for me stuff  well then if you are sound both in heart and head there is no reason why you should not profit by a good chance if it offers therefore wait and see  you are quite oracular yorke  i think i am a bit i that line i promise ye naught and i advise ye naught but i bid ye keep your heart up and be guided by circumstances  my namesake the physicians almanac could not speak more guardedly  in the meantime i care naught about ye robert moore ye are nothing akin to me or mine and whether ye lose or find a fortune it maks no difference to me go home now it has stricken ten miss hortense will be wondering where ye are     chapter x  old maids   time wore on and spring matured the surface of england began to look pleasant her fields grew green her hills fresh her gardens blooming but at heart she was no better still her poor were wretched still their employers were harassed commerce in some of its branches seemed threatened with paralysis for the war continued englands blood was shed and her wealth lavishedall it seemed to attain most inadequate ends some tidings there were indeed occasionally of successes in the peninsula but these came in slowly long intervals occurred between in which no note was heard but the insolent selffelicitations of bonaparte on his continued triumphs those who suffered from the results of the war felt this tedious and as they thought hopeless struggle against what their fears or their interests taught them to regard as an invincible power most insufferable they demanded peace on any terms men like yorke and mooreand there were thousands whom the war placed where it placed them shuddering on the verge of bankruptcyinsisted on peace with the energy of desperation  they held meetings they made speeches they got up petitions to extort this boon on what terms it was made they cared not  all men taken singly are more or less selfish and taken in bodies they are intensely so the british merchant is no exception to this rule the mercantile classes illustrate it strikingly these classes certainly think too exclusively of making money they are too oblivious of every national consideration but that of extending englandsthat is their owncommerce chivalrous feeling disinterestedness pride in honour is too dead in their hearts a land ruled by them alone would too often make ignominious submissionnot at all from the motives christ teaches but rather from those mammon instils during the late war the tradesmen of england would have endured buffets from the french on the right cheek and on the left their cloak they would have given to napoleon and then have politely offered him their coat also nor would they have withheld their waistcoat if urged they would have prayed permission only to retain their one other garment for the sake of the purse in its pocket not one spark of spirit not one symptom of resistance would they have shown till the hand of the corsican bandit had grasped that beloved purse then perhaps transfigured at once into british bulldogs they would have sprung at the robbers throat and there they would have fastened and there hung inveterate insatiable till the treasure had been restored tradesmen when they speak against war always profess to hate it because it is a bloody and barbarous proceeding you would think to hear them talk that they are peculiarly civilizedespecially gentle and kindly of disposition to their fellowmen this is not the case many of them are extremely narrow and coldhearted have no good feeling for any class but their own are distant even hostile to all others call them useless seem to question their right to exist seem to grudge them the very air they breathe and to think the circumstance of their eating drinking and living in decent houses quite unjustifiable they do not know what others do in the way of helping pleasing or teaching their race they will not trouble themselves to inquire whoever is not in trade is accused of eating the bread of idleness of passing a useless existence long may it be ere england really becomes a nation of shopkeepers  we have already said that moore was no selfsacrificing patriot and we have also explained what circumstances rendered him specially prone to confine his attention and efforts to the furtherance of his individual interest accordingly when he felt himself urged a second time to the brink of ruin none struggled harder than he against the influences which would have thrust him over what he could do towards stirring agitation in the north against the war he did and he instigated others whose money and connections gave them more power than he possessed sometimes by flashes he felt there was little reason in the demands his party made on government when he heard of all europe threatened by bonaparte and of all europe arming to resist him when he saw russia menaced and beheld russia rising incensed and stern to defend her frozen soil her wild provinces of serfs her dark native despotism from the tread the yoke the tyranny of a foreign victorhe knew that england a free realm could not then depute her sons to make concessions and propose terms to the unjust grasping french leader when news came from time to time of the movements of that man then representing england in the peninsula of his advance from success to successthat advance so deliberate but so unswerving so circumspect but so certain so unhasting but so unresting when he read lord wellingtons own dispatches in the columns of the newspapers documents written by modesty to the dictation of truthmoore confessed at heart that a power was with the troops of britain of that vigilant enduring genuine unostentatious sort which must win victory to the side it led in the end in the end but that end he thought was yet far off and meantime he moore as an individual would be crushed his hopes ground to dust it was himself he had to care for his hopes he had to pursue and he would fulfil his destiny  he fulfilled it so vigorously that ere long he came to a decisive rupture with his old tory friend the rector they quarrelled at a public meeting and afterwards exchanged some pungent letters in the newspapers mr helstone denounced moore as a jacobin ceased to see him would not even speak to him when they met he intimated also to his niece very distinctly that her communications with hollows cottage must for the present cease she must give up taking french lessons the language he observed was a bad and frivolous one at the best and most of the works it boasted were bad and frivolous highly injurious in their tendency to weak female minds he wondered he remarked parenthetically what noodle first made it the fashion to teach women french nothing was more improper for them it was like feeding a rickety child on chalk and water gruel caroline must give it up and give up her cousins too they were dangerous people  mr helstone quite expected opposition to this order he expected tears seldom did he trouble himself about carolines movements but a vague idea possessed him that she was fond of going to hollows cottage also he suspected that she liked robert moores occasional presence at the rectory the cossack had perceived that whereas if malone stepped in of an evening to make himself sociable and charming by pinching the ears of an aged black cat which usually shared with miss helstones feet the accommodation of her footstool or by borrowing a fowlingpiece and banging away at a tool shed door in the garden while enough of daylight remained to show that conspicuous mark keeping the passage and sittingroom doors meantime uncomfortably open for the convenience of running in and out to announce his failures and successes with noisy brusqueriehe had observed that under such entertaining circumstances caroline had a trick of disappearing tripping noiselessly upstairs and remaining invisible till called down to supper on the other hand when robert moore was the guest though he elicited no vivacities from the cat did nothing to it indeed beyond occasionally coaxing it from the stool to his knee and there letting it purr climb to his shoulder and rub its head against his cheek though there was no earsplitting cracking off of firearms no diffusion of sulphurous gunpowder perfume no noise no boasting during his staythat still caroline sat in the room and seemed to find wondrous content in the stitching of jewbasket pincushions and the knitting of missionarybasket socks  she was very quiet and robert paid her little attention scarcely ever addressing his discourse to her but mr helstone not being one of those elderly gentlemen who are easily blindedon the contrary finding himself on all occasions extremely wideawakehad watched them when they bade each other goodnight he had just seen their eyes meet onceonly once some natures would have taken pleasure in the glance then surprised because there was no harm and some delight in it it was by no means a glance of mutual intelligence for mutual love secrets existed not between them there was nothing then of craft and concealment to offend only mr moores eyes looking into carolines felt they were clear and gentle and carolines eyes encountering mr moores confessed they were manly and searching each acknowledged the charm in his or her own way moore smiled slightly and caroline coloured as slightly mr helstone could on the spot have rated them both they annoyed him why impossible to say if you had asked him what moore merited at that moment he would have said a horsewhip if you had inquired into carolines deserts he would have adjudged her a box on the ear if you had further demanded the reason of such chastisements he would have stormed against flirtation and lovemaking and vowed he would have no such folly going on under his roof  these private considerations combined with political reasons fixed his resolution of separating the cousins he announced his will to caroline one evening as she was sitting at work near the drawingroom window her face was turned towards him and the light fell full upon it it had struck him a few minutes before that she was looking paler and quieter than she used to look it had not escaped him either that robert moores name had never for some three weeks past dropped from her lips nor during the same space of time had that personage made his appearance at the rectory some suspicion of clandestine meetings haunted his mind having but an indifferent opinion of women he always suspected them he thought they needed constant watching it was in a tone dryly significant he desired her to cease her daily visits to the hollow he expected a start a look of depreciation the start he saw but it was a very slight one no look whatever was directed to him  do you hear me he asked  yes uncle  of course you mean to attend to what i say  yes certainly  and there must be no letterscribbling to your cousin hortenseno intercourse whatever i do not approve of the principles of the family they are jacobinical  very well said caroline quietly she acquiesced then there was no vexed flushing of the face no gathering tears the shadowy thoughtfulness which had covered her features ere mr helstone spoke remained undisturbed she was obedient  yes perfectly because the mandate coincided with her own previous judgment because it was now become pain to her to go to hollows cottage nothing met her there but disappointment hope and love had quitted that little tenement for robert seemed to have deserted its precincts whenever she asked after himwhich she very seldom did since the mere utterance of his name made her face grow hotthe answer was he was from home or he was quite taken up with business hortense feared he was killing himself by application he scarcely ever took a meal in the house he lived in the countinghouse  at church only caroline had the chance of seeing him and there she rarely looked at him it was both too much pain and too much pleasure to lookit excited too much emotion and that it was all wasted emotion she had learned well to comprehend  once on a dark wet sunday when there were few people at church and when especially certain ladies were absent of whose observant faculties and tomahawk tongues caroline stood in awe she had allowed her eye to seek roberts pew and to rest awhile on its occupant he was there alone hortense had been kept at home by prudent considerations relative to the rain and a new spring chapeau during the sermon he sat with folded arms and eyes cast down looking very sad and abstracted when depressed the very hue of his face seemed more dusk than when he smiled and today cheek and forehead wore their most tintless and sober olive by instinct caroline knew as she examined that clouded countenance that his thoughts were running in no familiar or kindly channel that they were far away not merely from her but from all which she could comprehend or in which she could sympathize nothing that they had ever talked of together was now in his mind he was wrapt from her by interests and responsibilities in which it was deemed such as she could have no part  caroline meditated in her own way on the subject speculated on his feelings on his life on his fears on his fate mused over the mystery of business tried to comprehend more about it than had ever been told herto understand its perplexities liabilities duties exactions endeavoured to realize the state of mind of a man of business to enter into it feel what he would feel aspire to what he would aspire her earnest wish was to see things as they were and not to be romantic by dint of effort she contrived to get a glimpse of the light of truth here and there and hoped that scant ray might suffice to guide her  different indeed she concluded is roberts mental condition to mine i think only of him he has no room no leisure to think of me the feeling called love is and has been for two years the predominant emotion of my heartalways there always awake always astir quite other feelings absorb his reflections and govern his faculties he is rising now going to leave the church for service is over will he turn his head towards this pew no not once he has not one look for me that is hard a kind glance would have made me happy till tomorrow i have not got it he would not give it he is gone strange that grief should now almost choke me because another human beings eye has failed to greet mine  that sunday evening mr malone coming as usual to pass it with his rector caroline withdrew after tea to her chamber fanny knowing her habits had lit her a cheerful little fire as the weather was so gusty and chill closeted there silent and solitary what could she do but think she noiselessly paced to and fro the carpeted floor her head drooped her hands folded it was irksome to sit the current of reflection ran rapidly through her mind tonight she was mutely excited  mute was the room mute the house the double door of the study muffled the voices of the gentlemen the servants were quiet in the kitchen engaged with books their young mistress had lent thembooks which she had told them were fit for sunday reading and she herself had another of the same sort open on the table but she could not read it its theology was incomprehensible to her and her own mind was too busy teeming wandering to listen to the language of another mind  then too her imagination was full of picturesimages of moore scenes where he and she had been together winter fireside sketches a glowing landscape of a hot summer afternoon passed with him in the bosom of nunnely wood divine vignettes of mild spring or mellow autumn moments when she had sat at his side in hollows copse listening to the call of the may cuckoo or sharing the september treasure of nuts and ripe blackberriesa wild dessert which it was her mornings pleasure to collect in a little basket and cover with green leaves and fresh blossoms and her afternoons delight to administer to moore berry by berry and nut by nut like a bird feeding its fledgling  roberts features and form were with her the sound of his voice was quite distinct in her ear his few caresses seemed renewed but these joys being hollow were ere long crushed in the pictures faded the voice failed the visionary clasp melted chill from her hand and where the warm seal of lips had made impress on her forehead it felt now as if a sleety raindrop had fallen she returned from an enchanted region to the real world for nunnely wood in june she saw her narrow chamber for the songs of birds in alleys she heard the rain on her casement for the sigh of the south wind came the sob of the mournful east and for moores manly companionship she had the thin illusion of her own dim shadow on the wall turning from the pale phantom which reflected herself in its outline and her reverie in the drooped attitude of its dim head and colourless tresses she sat downinaction would suit the frame of mind into which she was now decliningshe said to herself i have to live perhaps till seventy years as far as i know i have good health half a century of existence may lie before me how am i to occupy it what am i to do to fill the interval of time which spreads between me and the grave  she reflected  i shall not be married it appears she continued i suppose as robert does not care for me i shall never have a husband to love nor little children to take care of till lately i had reckoned securely on the duties and affections of wife and mother to occupy my existence i considered somehow as a matter of course that i was growing up to the ordinary destiny and never troubled myself to seek any other but now i perceive plainly i may have been mistaken probably i shall be an old maid i shall live to see robert married to some one else some rich lady i shall never marry what was i created for i wonder where is my place in the world  she mused again  ah i see she pursued presently that is the question which most old maids are puzzled to solve other people solve it for them by saying your place is to do good to others to be helpful whenever help is wanted that is right in some measure and a very convenient doctrine for the people who hold it but i perceive that certain sets of human beings are very apt to maintain that other sets should give up their lives to them and their service and then they requite them by praise they call them devoted and virtuous is this enough is it to live is there not a terrible hollowness mockery want craving in that existence which is given away to others for want of something of your own to bestow it on i suspect there is does virtue lie in abnegation of self i do not believe it undue humility makes tyranny weak concession creates selfishness the romish religion especially teaches renunciation of self submission to others and nowhere are found so many grasping tyrants as in the ranks of the romish priesthood each human being has his share of rights i suspect it would conduce to the happiness and welfare of all if each knew his allotment and held to it as tenaciously as the martyr to his creed queer thoughts these that surge in my mind are they right thoughts i am not certain  well life is short at the best seventy years they say pass like a vapour like a dream when one awaketh and every path trod by human feet terminates in one bournethe grave the little chink in the surface of this great globe the furrow where the mighty husbandman with the scythe deposits the seed he has shaken from the ripe stem and there it falls decays and thence it springs again when the world has rolled round a few times more so much for the body the soul meantime wings its long flight upward folds its wings on the brink of the sea of fire and glass and gazing down through the burning clearness finds there mirrored the vision of the christians triple godheadthe sovereign father the mediating son the creator spirit such words at least have been chosen to express what is inexpressible to describe what baffles description the souls real hereafter who shall guess  her fire was decayed to its last cinder malone had departed and now the study bell rang for prayers  the next day caroline had to spend altogether alone her uncle being gone to dine with his friend dr boultby vicar of whinbury the whole time she was talking inwardly in the same strainlooking forwards asking what she was to do with life fanny as she passed in and out of the room occasionally intent on housemaid errands perceived that her young mistress sat very still she was always in the same place always bent industriously over a piece of work she did not lift her head to speak to fanny as her custom was and when the latter remarked that the day was fine and she ought to take a walk she only said it is cold  you are very diligent at that sewing miss caroline continued the girl approaching her little table  i am tired of it fanny  then why do you go on with it put it down read or do something to amuse you  it is solitary in this house fanny dont you think so  i dont find it so miss me and eliza are company for one another but you are quite too still you should visit more now be persuaded go upstairs and dress yourself smart and go and take tea in a friendly way with miss mann or miss ainley i am certain either of those ladies would be delighted to see you  but their houses are dismal they are both old maids i am certain old maids are a very unhappy race  not they miss they cant be unhappy they take such care of themselves they are all selfish  miss ainley is not selfish fanny she is always doing good how devotedly kind she was to her stepmother as long as the old lady lived and now when she is quite alone in the world without brother or sister or any one to care for her how charitable she is to the poor as far as her means permit still nobody thinks much of her or has pleasure in going to see her and how gentlemen always sneer at her  they shouldnt miss i believe she is a good woman but gentlemen think only of ladies looks  ill go and see her exclaimed caroline starting up and if she asks me to stay to tea ill stay how wrong it is to neglect people because they are not pretty and young and merry and i will certainly call to see miss mann too she may not be amiable but what has made her unamiable what has life been to her  fanny helped miss helstone to put away her work and afterwards assisted her to dress  youll not be an old maid miss caroline she said as she tied the sash of her brown silk frock having previously smoothed her soft full and shining curls there are no signs of an old maid about you  caroline looked at the little mirror before her and she thought there were some signs she could see that she was altered within the last month that the hues of her complexion were paler her eyes changeda wan shade seemed to circle them her countenance was dejectedshe was not in short so pretty or so fresh as she used to be she distantly hinted this to fanny from whom she got no direct answer only a remark that people did vary in their looks but that at her age a little falling away signified nothing she would soon come round again and be plumper and rosier than ever having given this assurance fanny showed singular zeal in wrapping her up in warm shawls and handkerchiefs till caroline nearly smothered with the weight was fain to resist further additions  she paid her visitsfirst to miss mann for this was the most difficult point miss mann was certainly not quite a lovable person till now caroline had always unhesitatingly declared she disliked her and more than once she had joined her cousin robert in laughing at some of her peculiarities moore was not habitually given to sarcasm especially on anything humbler or weaker than himself but he had once or twice happened to be in the room when miss mann had made a call on his sister and after listening to her conversation and viewing her features for a time he had gone out into the garden where his little cousin was tending some of his favourite flowers and while standing near and watching her he had amused himself with comparing fair youth delicate and attractive with shrivelled eld livid and loveless and in jestingly repeating to a smiling girl the vinegar discourse of a cankered old maid once on such an occasion caroline had said to him looking up from the luxuriant creeper she was binding to its frame ah robert you do not like old maids i too should come under the lash of your sarcasm if i were an old maid  you an old maid he had replied a piquant notion suggested by lips of that tint and form i can fancy you though at forty quietly dressed pale and sunk but still with that straight nose white forehead and those soft eyes i suppose too you will keep your voice which has another timbre than that hard deep organ of miss manns courage cary even at fifty you will not be repulsive  miss mann did not make herself or tune her voice robert  nature made her in the mood in which she makes her briars and thorns whereas for the creation of some women she reserves the may morning hours when with light and dew she wooes the primrose from the turf and the lily from the woodmoss                                       ushered into miss manns little parlour caroline found her as she always found her surrounded by perfect neatness cleanliness and comfort after all is it not a virtue in old maids that solitude rarely makes them negligent or disorderlyno dust on her polished furniture none on her carpet fresh flowers in the vase on her table a bright fire in the grate she herself sat primly and somewhat grimlytidy in a cushioned rockingchair her hands busied with some knitting this was her favourite work as it required the least exertion she scarcely rose as caroline entered to avoid excitement was one of miss manns aims in life she had been composing herself ever since she came down in the morning and had just attained a certain lethargic state of tranquillity when the visitors knock at the door startled her and undid her days work she was scarcely pleased therefore to see miss helstone she received her with reserve bade her be seated with austerity and when she got her placed opposite she fixed her with her eye  this was no ordinary doomto be fixed with miss manns eye robert moore had undergone it once and had never forgotten the circumstance  he considered it quite equal to anything medusa could do he professed to doubt whether since that infliction his flesh had been quite what it was beforewhether there was not something stony in its texture the gaze had had such an effect on him as to drive him promptly from the apartment and house it had even sent him straightway up to the rectory where he had appeared in carolines presence with a very queer face and amazed her by demanding a cousinly salute on the spot to rectify a damage that had been done him  certainly miss mann had a formidable eye for one of the softer sex it was prominent and showed a great deal of the white and looked as steadily as unwinkingly at you as if it were a steel ball soldered in her head and when while looking she began to talk in an indescribably dry monotonous tonea tone without vibration or inflectionyou felt as if a graven image of some bad spirit were addressing you but it was all a figment of fancy a matter of surface miss manns goblin grimness scarcely went deeper than the angel sweetness of hundreds of beauties she was a perfectly honest conscientious woman who had performed duties in her day from whose severe anguish many a human peri gazelleeyed silkentressed and silvertongued would have shrunk appalled she had passed alone through protracted scenes of suffering exercised rigid selfdenial made large sacrifices of time money health for those who had repaid her only by ingratitude and now her mainalmost her solefault was that she was censorious  censorious she certainly was caroline had not sat five minutes ere her hostess still keeping her under the spell of that dread and gorgon gaze began flaying alive certain of the families in the neighbourhood she went to work at this business in a singularly cool deliberate manner like some surgeon practising with his scalpel on a lifeless subject she made few distinctions she allowed scarcely any one to be good she dissected impartially almost all her acquaintance if her auditress ventured now and then to put in a palliative word she set it aside with a certain disdain still though thus pitiless in moral anatomy she was no scandalmonger she never disseminated really malignant or dangerous reports it was not her heart so much as her temper that was wrong  caroline made this discovery for the first time today and moved thereby to regret divers unjust judgments she had more than once passed on the crabbed old maid she began to talk to her softly not in sympathizing words but with a sympathizing voice the loneliness of her condition struck her visitor in a new light as did also the character of her uglinessa bloodless pallor of complexion and deeply worn lines of feature the girl pitied the solitary and afflicted woman her looks told what she felt a sweet countenance is never so sweet as when the moved heart animates it with compassionate tenderness miss mann seeing such a countenance raised to her was touched in her turn she acknowledged her sense of the interest thus unexpectedly shown in her who usually met with only coldness and ridicule by replying to her candidly communicative on her own affairs she usually was not because no one cared to listen to her but today she became so and her confidante shed tears as she heard her speak for she told of cruel slowwasting obstinate sufferings well might she be corpselike well might she look grim and never smile well might she wish to avoid excitement to gain and retain composure caroline when she knew all acknowledged that miss mann was rather to be admired for fortitude than blamed for moroseness reader when you behold an aspect for whose constant gloom and frown you cannot account whose unvarying cloud exasperates you by its apparent causelessness be sure that there is a canker somewhere and a canker not the less deeply corroding because concealed  miss mann felt that she was understood partly and wished to be understood further for however old plain humble desolate afflicted we may be so long as our hearts preserve the feeblest spark of life they preserve also shivering near that pale ember a starved ghostly longing for appreciation and affection to this extenuated spectre perhaps a crumb is not thrown once a year but when ahungered and athirst to faminewhen all humanity has forgotten the dying tenant of a decaying housedivine mercy remembers the mourner and a shower of manna falls for lips that earthly nutriment is to pass no more biblical promises heard first in health but then unheeded come whispering to the couch of sickness it is felt that a pitying god watches what all mankind have forsaken the tender compassion of jesus is recalled and relied on the faded eye gazing beyond time sees a home a friend a refuge in eternity  miss mann drawn on by the still attention of her listener proceeded to allude to circumstances in her past life she spoke like one who tells the truthsimply and with a certain reserve she did not boast nor did she exaggerate caroline found that the old maid had been a most devoted daughter and sister an unwearied watcher by lingering deathbeds that to prolonged and unrelaxing attendance on the sick the malady that now poisoned her own life owed its origin that to one wretched relative she had been a support and succour in the depths of selfearned degradation and that it was still her hand which kept him from utter destitution miss helstone stayed the whole evening omitting to pay her other intended visit and when she left miss mann it was with the determination to try in future to excuse her faults never again to make light of her peculiarities or to laugh at her plainness and above all things not to neglect her but to come once a week and to offer her from one human heart at least the homage of affection and respect she felt she could now sincerely give her a small tribute of each feeling  caroline on her return told fanny she was very glad she had gone out as she felt much better for the visit the next day she failed not to seek miss ainley this lady was in narrower circumstances than miss mann and her dwelling was more humble it was however if possible yet more exquisitely clean though the decayed gentlewoman could not afford to keep a servant but waited on herself and had only the occasional assistance of a little girl who lived in a cottage near  not only was miss ainley poorer but she was even plainer than the other old maid in her first youth she must have been ugly now at the age of fifty she was very ugly at first sight all but peculiarly welldisciplined minds were apt to turn from her with annoyance to conceive against her a prejudice simply on the ground of her unattractive look then she was prim in dress and manner she looked spoke and moved the complete old maid  her welcome to caroline was formal even in its kindnessfor it was kind but miss helstone excused this she knew something of the benevolence of the heart which beat under that starched kerchief all the neighbourhoodat least all the female neighbourhoodknew something of it no one spoke against miss ainley except lively young gentlemen and inconsiderate old ones who declared her hideous  caroline was soon at home in that tiny parlour a kind hand took from her her shawl and bonnet and installed her in the most comfortable seat near the fire the young and the antiquated woman were presently deep in kindly conversation and soon caroline became aware of the power a most serene unselfish and benignant mind could exercise over those to whom it was developed she talked never of herself always of others their faults she passed over her theme was their wants which she sought to supply their sufferings which she longed to alleviate she was religious a professor of religionwhat some would call a saint and she referred to religion often in sanctioned phrasein phrase which those who possess a perception of the ridiculous without owning the power of exactly testing and truly judging character would certainly have esteemed a proper subject for satire a matter for mimicry and laughter they would have been hugely mistaken for their pains sincerity is never ludicrous it is always respectable whether truthbe it religious or moral truthspeak eloquently and in wellchosen language or not its voice should be heard with reverence let those who cannot nicely and with certainty discern the difference between the tones of hypocrisy and those of sincerity never presume to laugh at all lest they should have the miserable misfortune to laugh in the wrong place and commit impiety when they think they are achieving wit  not from miss ainleys own lips did caroline hear of her good works but she knew much of them nevertheless her beneficence was the familiar topic of the poor in briarfield they were not works of almsgiving the old maid was too poor to give much though she straitened herself to privation that she might contribute her mite when needful they were the works of a sister of charityfar more difficult to perform than those of a lady bountiful she would watch by any sickbed she seemed to fear no disease she would nurse the poorest whom none else would nurse she was serene humble kind and equable through everything  for this goodness she got but little reward in this life many of the poor became so accustomed to her services that they hardly thanked her for them the rich heard them mentioned with wonder but were silent from a sense of shame at the difference between her sacrifices and their own many ladies however respected her deeply they could not help it one gentlemanone onlygave her his friendship and perfect confidence this was mr hall the vicar of nunnely he said and said truly that her life came nearer the life of christ than that of any other human being he had ever met with you must not think reader that ill sketching miss ainleys character i depict a figment of imagination no we seek the originals of such portraits in real life only  miss helstone studied well the mind and heart now revealed to her she found no high intellect to admirethe old maid was merely sensiblebut she discovered so much goodness so much usefulness so much mildness patience truth that she bent her own mind before miss ainleys in reverence what was her love of nature what was her sense of beauty what were her more varied and fervent emotions what was her deeper power of thought what her wider capacity to comprehend compared to the practical excellence of this good woman momently they seemed only beautiful forms of selfish delight mentally she trod them under foot  it is true she still felt with pain that the life which made miss ainley happy could not make her happy pure and active as it was in her heart she deemed it deeply dreary because it was so lovelessto her ideas so forlorn yet doubtless she reflected it needed only habit to make it practicable and agreeable to any one it was despicable she felt to pine sentimentally to cherish secret griefs vain memories to be inert to waste youth in aching languor to grow old doing nothing  i will bestir myself was her resolution and try to be wise if i cannot be good  she proceeded to make inquiry of miss ainley if she could help her in anything miss ainley glad of an assistant told her that she could and indicated some poor families in briarfield that it was desirable she should visit giving her likewise at her further request some work to do for certain poor women who had many children and who were unskilled in using the needle for themselves  caroline went home laid her plans and took a resolve not to swerve from them she allotted a certain portion of her time for her various studies and a certain portion for doing anything miss ainley might direct her to do the remainder was to be spent in exercise not a moment was to be left for the indulgence of such fevered thoughts as had poisoned last sunday evening  to do her justice she executed her plans conscientiously perseveringly it was very hard work at firstit was even hard work to the endbut it helped her to stem and keep down anguish it forced her to be employed it forbade her to brood and gleams of satisfaction chequered her gray life here and there when she found she had done good imparted pleasure or allayed suffering  yet i must speak truth these efforts brought her neither health of body nor continued peace of mind with them all she wasted grew more joyless and more wan with them all her memory kept harping on the name of robert moore an elegy over the past still rung constantly in her ear a funereal inward cry haunted and harassed her the heaviness of a broken spirit and of pining and palsying faculties settled slow on her buoyant youth winter seemed conquering her spring the minds soil and its treasures were freezing gradually to barren stagnation     chapter xi  fieldhead   yet caroline refused tamely to succumb she had native strength in her girls heart and she used it men and women never struggle so hard as when they struggle alone without witness counsellor or confidant unencouraged unadvised and unpitied  miss helstone was in this position her sufferings were her only spur and being very real and sharp they roused her spirit keenly bent on victory over a mortal pain she did her best to quell it never had she been seen so busy so studious and above all so active she took walks in all weathers long walks in solitary directions day by day she came back in the evening pale and weariedlooking yet seemingly not fatigued for still as soon as she had thrown off her bonnet and shawl she would instead of resting begin to pace her apartment sometimes she would not sit down till she was literally faint she said she did this to tire herself well that she might sleep soundly at night but if that was her aim it was unattained for at night when others slumbered she was tossing on her pillow or sitting at the foot of her couch in the darkness forgetful apparently of the necessity of seeking repose often unhappy girl she was cryingcrying in a sort of intolerable despair which when it rushed over her smote down her strength and reduced her to childlike helplessness  when thus prostrate temptations besieged her weak suggestions whispered in her weary heart to write to robert and say that she was unhappy because she was forbidden to see him and hortense and that she feared he would withdraw his friendship not love from her and forget her entirely and begging him to remember her and sometimes to write to her one or two such letters she actually indited but she never sent them shame and good sense forbade  at last the life she led reached the point when it seemed she could bear it no longer that she must seek and find a change somehow or her heart and head would fail under the pressure which strained them she longed to leave briarfield to go to some very distant place she longed for something elsethe deep secret anxious yearning to discover and know her mother strengthened daily but with the desire was coupled a doubt a dreadif she knew her could she love her there was cause for hesitation for apprehension on this point never in her life had she heard that mother praised whoever mentioned her mentioned her coolly her uncle seemed to regard his sisterinlaw with a sort of tacit antipathy an old servant who had lived with mrs james helstone for a short time after her marriage whenever she referred to her former mistress spoke with chilling reservesometimes she called her queer sometimes she said she did not understand her these expressions were ice to the daughters heart they suggested the conclusion that it was perhaps better never to know her parent than to know her and not like her  but one project could she frame whose execution seemed likely to bring her a hope of relief it was to take a situation to be a governess she could do nothing else a little incident brought her to the point when she found courage to break her design to her uncle  her long and late walks lay always as has been said on lonely roads but in whatever direction she had rambledwhether along the drear skirts of stilbro moor or over the sunny stretch of nunnely commonher homeward path was still so contrived as to lead her near the hollow she rarely descended the den but she visited its brink at twilight almost as regularly as the stars rose over the hillcrests her restingplace was at a certain stile under a certain old thorn thence she could look down on the cottage the mill the dewy gardenground the still deep dam thence was visible the wellknown countinghouse window from whose panes at a fixed hour shot suddenly bright the ray of the wellknown lamp her errand was to watch for this ray her reward to catch it sometimes sparkling bright in clear air sometimes shimmering dim through mist and anon flashing broken between slant lines of rainfor she came in all weathers  there were nights when it failed to appear she knew then that robert was from home and went away doubly sad whereas its kindling rendered her elate as though she saw in it the promise of some indefinite hope if while she gazed a shadow bent between the light and lattice her heart leaped that eclipse was robert she had seen him she would return home comforted carrying in her mind a clearer vision of his aspect a distincter recollection of his voice his smile his bearing and blent with these impressions was often a sweet persuasion that if she could get near him his heart might welcome her presence yet that at this moment he might be willing to extend his hand and draw her to him and shelter her at his side as he used to do that night though she might weep as usual she would fancy her tears less scalding the pillow they watered seemed a little softer the temples pressed to that pillow ached less  the shortest path from the hollow to the rectory wound near a certain mansion the same under whose lone walls malone passed on that nightjourney mentioned in an early chapter of this workthe old and tenantless dwelling yclept fieldhead tenantless by the proprietor it had been for ten years but it was no ruin mr yorke had seen it kept in good repair and an old gardener and his wife had lived in it cultivated the grounds and maintained the house in habitable condition  if fieldhead had few other merits as a building it might at least be termed picturesque its regular architecture and the gray and mossy colouring communicated by time gave it a just claim to this epithet the old latticed windows the stone porch the walls the roof the chimneystacks were rich in crayon touches and sepia lights and shades the trees behind were fine bold and spreading the cedar on the lawn in front was grand and the granite urns on the garden wall the fretted arch of the gateway were for an artist as the very desire of the eye  one mild may evening caroline passing near about moonrise and feeling though weary unwilling yet to go home where there was only the bed of thorns and the night of grief to anticipate sat down on the mossy ground near the gate and gazed through towards cedar and mansion it was a still nightcalm dewy cloudless the gables turned to the west reflected the clear amber of the horizon they faced the oaks behind were black the cedar was blacker under its dense raven boughs a glimpse of sky opened gravely blue it was full of the moon which looked solemnly and mildly down on caroline from beneath that sombre canopy  she felt this night and prospect mournfully lovely she wished she could be happy she wished she could know inward peace she wondered providence had no pity on her and would not help or console her recollections of happy trysts of lovers commemorated in old ballads returned on her mind she thought such tryst in such scene would be blissful where now was robert she asked not at the hollow she had watched for his lamp long and had not seen it she questioned within herself whether she and moore were ever destined to meet and speak again suddenly the door within the stone porch of the hall opened and two men came outone elderly and whiteheaded the other young darkhaired and tall they passed across the lawn out through a portal in the garden wall caroline saw them cross the road pass the stile descend the fields she saw them disappear robert moore had passed before her with his friend mr yorke neither had seen her  the apparition had been transientscarce seen ere gone but its electric passage left her veins kindled her soul insurgent it found her despairing it left her desperatetwo different states  oh had he but been alone had he but seen me was her cry he would have said something he would have given me his hand he does he must love me a little he would have shown some token of affection in his eye on his lips i should have read comfort but the chance is lost the wind the clouds shadow does not pass more silently more emptily than he i have been mocked and heaven is cruel  thus in the utter sickness of longing and disappointment she went home  the next morning at breakfast where she appeared whitecheeked and miserablelooking as one who had seen a ghost she inquired of mr helstone have you any objection uncle to my inquiring for a situation in a family  her uncle ignorant as the table supporting his coffeecup of all his niece had undergone and was undergoing scarcely believed his ears  what whim now he asked are you bewitched what can you mean  i am not well and need a change she said  he examined her he discovered she had experienced a change at any rate without his being aware of it the rose had dwindled and faded to a mere snowdrop bloom had vanished flesh wasted she sat before him drooping colourless and thin but for the soft expression of her brown eyes the delicate lines of her features and the flowing abundance of her hair she would no longer have possessed a claim to the epithet pretty  what on earth is the matter with you he asked what is wrong how are you ailing  no answer only the brown eyes filled the faintlytinted lips trembled  look out for a situation indeed for what situation are you fit what have you been doing with yourself you are not well  i should be well if i went from home  these women are incomprehensible they have the strangest knack of startling you with unpleasant surprises today you see them bouncing buxom red as cherries and round as apples tomorrow they exhibit themselves effete as dead weeds blanched and broken down and the reason of it all thats the puzzle she has her meals her liberty a good house to live in and good clothes to wear as usual a while since that sufficed to keep her handsome and cheery and there she sits now a poor little pale puling chit enough provoking then comes the question what is to be done i suppose i must send for advice will you have a doctor child  no uncle i dont want one a doctor could do me no good i merely want change of air and scene  well if that be the caprice it shall be gratified you shall go to a wateringplace i dont mind the expense fanny shall accompany you  but uncle some day i must do something for myself i have no fortune i had better begin now  while i live you shall not turn out as a governess caroline i will not have it said that my niece is a governess  but the later in life one makes a change of that sort uncle the more difficult and painful it is i should wish to get accustomed to the yoke before any habits of ease and independence are formed  i beg you will not harass me caroline i mean to provide for you i have always meant to provide for you i will purchase an annuity bless me i am but fiftyfive my health and constitution are excellent there is plenty of time to save and take measures dont make yourself anxious respecting the future is that what frets you  no uncle but i long for a change  he laughed there speaks the woman cried he the very woman a change a change always fantastical and whimsical well its in her sex  but it is not fantasy and whim uncle  what is it then  necessity i think i feel weaker than formerly i believe i should have more to do  admirable she feels weak and therefore she should be set to hard labourclair comme le jour as mooreconfound moore you shall go to cliff bridge and there are two guineas to buy a new frock come cary never fear well find balm in gilead  uncle i wish you were less generous and more  more what  sympathizing was the word on carolines lips but it was not uttered she checked herself in time her uncle would indeed have laughed if that nambypamby word had escaped her finding her silent he said the fact is you dont know precisely what you want  only to be a governess  pooh mere nonsense ill not hear of governessing dont mention it again it is rather too feminine a fancy i have finished breakfast ring the bell put all crotchets out of your head and run away and amuse yourself  what with my doll asked caroline to herself as she quitted the room  a week or two passed her bodily and mental health neither grew worse nor better she was now precisely in that state when if her constitution had contained the seeds of consumption decline or slow fever those diseases would have been rapidly developed and would soon have carried her quietly from the world people never die of love or grief alone though some die of inherent maladies which the tortures of those passions prematurely force into destructive action the sound by nature undergo these tortures and are racked shaken shattered their beauty and bloom perish but life remains untouched they are brought to a certain point of dilapidation they are reduced to pallor debility and emaciation people think as they see them gliding languidly about that they will soon withdraw to sickbeds perish there and cease from among the healthy and happy this does not happen they live on and though they cannot regain youth and gaiety they may regain strength and serenity the blossom which the march wind nips but fails to sweep away may survive to hang a withered apple on the tree late into autumn having braved the last frosts of spring it may also brave the first of winter  every one noticed the change in miss helstones appearance and most people said she was going to die she never thought so herself she felt in no dying case she had neither pain nor sickness her appetite was diminished she knew the reason it was because she wept so much at night her strength was lessened she could account for it sleep was coy and hard to be won dreams were distressing and baleful in the far future she still seemed to anticipate a time when this passage of misery should be got over and when she should once more be calm though perhaps never again happy  meanwhile her uncle urged her to visit to comply with the frequent invitations of their acquaintance this she evaded doing she could not be cheerful in company she felt she was observed there with more curiosity than sympathy old ladies were always offering her their advice recommending this or that nostrum young ladies looked at her in a way she understood and from which she shrank their eyes said they knew she had been disappointed as custom phrases it by whom they were not certain  commonplace young ladies can be quite as hard as commonplace young gentlemenquite as worldly and selfish those who suffer should always avoid them grief and calamity they despise they seem to regard them as the judgments of god on the lowly with them to love is merely to contrive a scheme for achieving a good match to be disappointed is to have their scheme seen through and frustrated they think the feelings and projects of others on the subject of love similar to their own and judge them accordingly  all this caroline knew partly by instinct partly by observation she regulated her conduct by her knowledge keeping her pale face and wasted figure as much out of sight as she could living thus in complete seclusion she ceased to receive intelligence of the little transactions of the neighbourhood  one morning her uncle came into the parlour where she sat endeavouring to find some pleasure in painting a little group of wild flowers gathered under a hedge at the top of the hollow fields and said to her in his abrupt manner come child you are always stooping over palette or book or sampler leave that tinting work bythebye do you put your pencil to your lips when you paint  sometimes uncle when i forget  then it is that which is poisoning you the paints are deleterious child there is white lead and red lead and verdigris and gamboge and twenty other poisons in those colour cakes lock them up lock them up get your bonnet on i want you to make a call with me  with you uncle  this question was asked in a tone of surprise she was not accustomed to make calls with her uncle she never rode or walked out with him on any occasion  quick quick i am always busy you know i have no time to lose  she hurriedly gathered up her materials asking meantime where they were going  to fieldhead  fieldhead what to see old james booth the gardener is he ill  we are going to see miss shirley keeldar  miss keeldar is she coming to yorkshire is she at fieldhead  she is she has been there a week i met her at a party last nightthat party to which you would not go i was pleased with her i choose that you shall make her acquaintance it will do you good  she is now come of age i suppose  she is come of age and will reside for a time on her property i lectured her on the subject i showed her her duty she is not intractable she is rather a fine girl she will teach you what it is to have a sprightly spirit nothing lackadaisical about her  i dont think she will want to see me or to have me introduced to her what good can i do her how can i amuse her  pshaw put your bonnet on  is she proud uncle  dont know you hardly imagine she would show her pride to me i suppose a chit like that would scarcely presume to give herself airs with the rector of her parish however rich she might be  no but how did she behave to other people  didnt observe she holds her head high and probably can be saucy enough where she dare she wouldnt be a woman otherwise there away now for your bonnet at once  not naturally very confident a failure of physical strength and a depression of spirits had not tended to increase carolines presence of mind and ease of manner or to give her additional courage to face strangers and she quailed in spite of selfremonstrance as she and her uncle walked up the broad paved approach leading from the gateway of fieldhead to its porch she followed mr helstone reluctantly through that porch into the sombre old vestibule beyond  very sombre it waslong vast and dark one latticed window lit it but dimly the wide old chimney contained now no fire for the present warm weather needed it not it was filled instead with willowboughs the gallery on high opposite the entrance was seen but in outline so shadowy became this hall towards its ceiling carved stags heads with real antlers looked down grotesquely from the walls this was neither a grand nor a comfortable house within as without it was antique rambling and incommodious a property of a thousand a year belonged to it which property had descended for lack of male heirs on a female there were mercantile families in the district boasting twice the income but the keeldars by virtue of their antiquity and their distinction of lords of the manor took the precedence of all  mr and miss helstone were ushered into a parlour of course as was to be expected in such a gothic old barrack this parlour was lined with oak fine dark glossy panels compassed the walls gloomily and grandly very handsome reader these shining brown panels are very mellow in colouring and tasteful in effect butif you know what a spring clean isvery execrable and inhuman whoever having the bowels of humanity has seen servants scrubbing at these polished wooden walls with beeswaxed cloths on a warm may day must allow that they are intolerable and not to be endured and i cannot but secretly applaud the benevolent barbarian who had painted another and larger apartment of fieldheadthe drawingroom to wit formerly also an oakroomof a delicate pinky white thereby earning for himself the character of a hun but mightily enhancing the cheerfulness of that portion of his abode and saving future housemaids a world of toil  the brownpanelled parlour was furnished all in old style and with real old furniture on each side of the high mantelpiece stood two antique chairs of oak solid as silvan thrones and in one of these sat a lady but if this were miss keeldar she must have come of age at least some twenty years ago she was of matronly form and though she wore no cap and possessed hair of quite an undimmed auburn shading small and naturally younglooking features she had no youthful aspect nor apparently the wish to assume it you could have wished her attire of a newer fashion in a wellcut wellmade gown hers would have been no uncomely presence it puzzled you to guess why a garment of handsome materials should be arranged in such scanty folds and devised after such an obsolete mode you felt disposed to set down the wearer as somewhat eccentric at once  this lady received the visitors with a mixture of ceremony and diffidence quite english no middleaged matron who was not an englishwoman could evince precisely the same mannera manner so uncertain of herself of her own merits of her power to please and yet so anxious to be proper and if possible rather agreeable than otherwise in the present instance however more embarrassment was shown than is usual even with diffident englishwomen miss helstone felt this sympathized with the stranger and knowing by experience what was good for the timid took a seat quietly near her and began to talk to her with a gentle ease communicated for the moment by the presence of one less selfpossessed than herself  she and this lady would if alone have at once got on extremely well together the lady had the clearest voice imaginableinfinitely softer and more tuneful than could have been reasonably expected from forty yearsand a form decidedly inclined to embonpoint this voice caroline liked it atoned for the formal if correct accent and language the lady would soon have discovered she liked it and her and in ten minutes they would have been friends but mr helstone stood on the rug looking at them both looking especially at the strange lady with his sarcastic keen eye that clearly expressed impatience of her chilly ceremony and annoyance at her want of aplomb his hard gaze and rasping voice discomfited the lady more and more she tried however to get up little speeches about the weather the aspect of the country etc but the impracticable mr helstone presently found himself somewhat deaf whatever she said he affected not to hear distinctly and she was obliged to go over each elaboratelyconstructed nothing twice the effort soon became too much for her she was just rising in a perplexed flutter nervously murmuring that she knew not what detained miss keeldar that she would go and look for her when miss keeldar saved her the trouble by appearing it was to be presumed at least that she who now came in through a glass door from the garden owned that name  there is real grace in ease of manner and so old helstone felt when an erect slight girl walked up to him retaining with her left hand her little silk apron full of flowers and giving him her right hand said pleasantly i knew you would come to see me though you do think mr yorke has made me a jacobin goodmorning  but well not have you a jacobin returned he no miss shirley they shall not steal the flower of my parish from me now that you are amongst us you shall be my pupil in politics and religion ill teach you sound doctrine on both points  mrs pryor has anticipated you she replied turning to the elder lady mrs pryor you know was my governess and is still my friend and of all the high and rigid tories she is queen of all the stanch churchwomen she is chief i have been well drilled both in theology and history i assure you mr helstone  the rector immediately bowed very low to mrs pryor and expressed himself obliged to her  the exgoverness disclaimed skill either in political or religious controversy explained that she thought such matters little adapted for female minds but avowed herself in general terms the advocate of order and loyalty and of course truly attached to the establishment she added she was ever averse to change under any circumstances and something scarcely audible about the extreme danger of being too ready to take up new ideas closed her sentence  miss keeldar thinks as you think i hope madam  difference of age and difference of temperament occasion difference of sentiment was the reply it can scarcely be expected that the eager and young should hold the opinions of the cool and middleaged  oh oh we are independent we think for ourselves cried mr helstone we are a little jacobin for anything i knowa little freethinker in good earnest let us have a confession of faith on the spot  and he took the heiresss two handscausing her to let fall her whole cargo of flowersand seated her by him on the sofa  say your creed he ordered  the apostles creed  yes  she said it like a child  now for st athanasiuss thats the test  let me gather up my flowers here is tartar coming he will tread upon them  tartar was a rather large strong and fiercelooking dog very ugly being of a breed between mastiff and bulldog who at this moment entered through the glass door and posting directly to the rug snuffed the fresh flowers scattered there he seemed to scorn them as food but probably thinking their velvety petals might be convenient as litter he was turning round preparatory to depositing his tawny bulk upon them when miss helstone and miss keeldar simultaneously stooped to the rescue  thank you said the heiress as she again held out her little apron for caroline to heap the blossoms into it is this your daughter mr helstone she asked  my niece caroline  miss keeldar shook hands with her and then looked at her caroline also looked at her hostess  shirley keeldar she had no christian name but shirley her parents who had wished to have a son finding that after eight years of marriage providence had granted them only a daughter bestowed on her the same masculine family cognomen they would have bestowed on a boy if with a boy they had been blessedshirley keeldar was no ugly heiress she was agreeable to the eye her height and shape were not unlike miss helstones perhaps in stature she might have the advantage by an inch or two she was gracefully made and her face too possessed a charm as well described by the word grace as any other it was pale naturally but intelligent and of varied expression she was not a blonde like caroline clear and dark were the characteristics of her aspect as to colour her face and brow were clear her eyes of the darkest gray no green lights in themtransparent pure neutral gray and her hair of the darkest brown her features were distinguishedby which i do not mean that they were high bony and roman being indeed rather small and slightly marked than otherwise but only that they were to use a few french words fins gracieux spirituelsmobile they were and speaking but their changes were not to be understood nor their language interpreted all at once she examined caroline seriously inclining her head a little to one side with a thoughtful air  you see she is only a feeble chick observed mr helstone  she looks youngyounger than ihow old are you she inquired in a manner that would have been patronizing if it had not been extremely solemn and simple  eighteen years and six months  and i am twentyone  she said no more she had now placed her flowers on the table and was busied in arranging them  and st athanasiuss creed urged the rector you believe it all dont you  i cant remember it quite all i will give you a nosegay mr helstone when i have given your niece one  she had selected a little bouquet of one brilliant and two or three delicate flowers relieved by a spray of dark verdure she tied it with silk from her workbox and placed it on carolines lap and then she put her hands behind her and stood bending slightly towards her guest still regarding her in the attitude and with something of the aspect of a grave but gallant little cavalier this temporary expression of face was aided by the style in which she wore her hair parted on one temple and brushed in a glossy sweep above the forehead whence it fell in curls that looked natural so free were their wavy undulations  are you tired with your walk she inquired  nonot in the least it is but a short distancebut a mile  you look paleis she always so pale she asked turning to the rector  she used to be as rosy as the reddest of your flowers  why is she altered what has made her pale has she been ill  she tells me she wants a change  she ought to have one you ought to give her one you should send her to the seacoast  i will ere summer is over meantime i intend her to make acquaintance with you if you have no objection  i am sure miss keeldar will have no objection here observed mrs pryor i think i may take it upon me to say that miss helstones frequent presence at fieldhead will be esteemed a favour  you speak my sentiments precisely maam said shirley and i thank you for anticipating melet me tell you she continued turning again to caroline that you also ought to thank my governess it is not every one she would welcome as she has welcomed you you are distinguished more than you think this morning as soon as you are gone i shall ask mrs pryors opinion of you i am apt to rely on her judgment of character for hitherto i have found it wondrous accurate already i foresee a favourable answer to my inquiriesdo i not guess rightly mrs pryor  my dear you said but now you would ask my opinion when miss helstone was gone i am scarcely likely to give it in her presence  no and perhaps it will be long enough before i obtain iti am sometimes sadly tantalized mr helstone by mrs pryors extreme caution her judgments ought to be correct when they come for they are often as tardy of delivery as a lord chancellors on some peoples characters i cannot get her to pronounce a sentence entreat as i may  mrs pryor here smiled  yes said her pupil i know what that smile means you are thinking of my gentlemantenantdo you know mr moore of the hollow she asked mr helstone  ay ay your tenantso he is you have seen a good deal of him no doubt since you came  i have been obliged to see him there was business to transact business really the word makes me conscious i am indeed no longer a girl but quite a woman and something more i am an esquire shirley keeldar esquire ought to be my style and title they gave me a mans name i hold a mans position it is enough to inspire me with a touch of manhood and when i see such people as that stately anglobelgianthat gérard moorebefore me gravely talking to me of business really i feel quite gentlemanlike you must choose me for your churchwarden mr helstone the next time you elect new ones they ought to make me a magistrate and a captain of yeomanry tony lumpkins mother was a colonel and his aunt a justice of the peace why shouldnt i be  with all my heart if you choose to get up a requisition on the subject i promise to head the list of signatures with my name but you were speaking of moore  ah yes i find it a little difficult to understand mr moore to know what to think of him whether to like him or not he seems a tenant of whom any proprietor might be proudand proud of him i am in that sense but as a neighbour what is he again and again i have entreated mrs pryor to say what she thinks of him but she still evades returning a direct answer i hope you will be less oracular mr helstone and pronounce at once do you like him  not at all just now his name is entirely blotted from my good books  what is the matter what has he done  my uncle and he disagree on politics interposed the low voice of caroline she had better not have spoken just then having scarcely joined in the conversation before it was not apropos to do it now she felt this with nervous acuteness as soon as she had spoken and coloured to the eyes  what are moores politics inquired shirley  those of a tradesman returned the rectornarrow selfish and unpatriotic the man is eternally writing and speaking against the continuance of the war i have no patience with him  the war hurts his trade i remember he remarked that only yesterday but what other objection have you to him  that is enough  he looks the gentleman in my sense of the term pursued shirley and it pleases me to think he is such  caroline rent the tyrian petals of the one brilliant flower in her bouquet and answered in distinct tones decidedly he is shirley hearing this courageous affirmation flashed an arch searching glance at the speaker from her deep expressive eyes  you are his friend at any rate she said you defend him in his absence  i am both his friend and his relative was the prompt reply robert moore is my cousin  oh then you can tell me all about him just give me a sketch of his character  insuperable embarrassment seized caroline when this demand was made she could not and did not attempt to comply with it her silence was immediately covered by mrs pryor who proceeded to address sundry questions to mr helstone regarding a family or two in the neighbourhood with whose connections in the south she said she was acquainted shirley soon withdrew her gaze from miss helstones face she did not renew her interrogations but returning to her flowers proceeded to choose a nosegay for the rector she presented it to him as he took leave and received the homage of a salute on the hand in return  be sure you wear it for my sake said she  next my heart of course responded helstonemrs pryor take care of this future magistrate this churchwarden in perspective this captain of yeomanry this young squire of briarfield in a word dont let him exert himself too much dont let him break his neck in hunting especially let him mind how he rides down that dangerous hill near the hollow  i like a descent said shirley i like to clear it rapidly and especially i like that romantic hollow with all my heart  romantic with a mill in it  romantic with a mill in it the old mill and the white cottage are each admirable in its way  and the countinghouse mr keeldar  the countinghouse is better than my bloomcoloured drawingroom i adore the countinghouse  and the trade the cloth the greasy wool the polluting dyeingvats  the trade is to be thoroughly respected  and the tradesman is a hero good  i am glad to hear you say so i thought the tradesman looked heroic  mischief spirit and glee sparkled all over her face as she thus bandied words with the old cossack who almost equally enjoyed the tilt  captain keeldar you have no mercantile blood in your veins why are you so fond of trade  because i am a millowner of course half my income comes from the works in that hollow  dont enter into partnershipthats all  youve put it into my head youve put it into my head she exclaimed with a joyous laugh it will never get out thank you and waving her hand white as a lily and fine as a fairys she vanished within the porch while the rector and his niece passed out through the arched gateway     chapter xii  shirley and caroline   shirley showed she had been sincere in saying she should be glad of carolines society by frequently seeking it and indeed if she had not sought it she would not have had it for miss helstone was slow to make fresh acquaintance she was always held back by the idea that people could not want her that she could not amuse them and a brilliant happy youthful creature like the heiress of fieldhead seemed to her too completely independent of society so uninteresting as hers ever to find it really welcome  shirley might be brilliant and probably happy likewise but no one is independent of genial society and though in about a month she had made the acquaintance of most of the families round and was on quite free and easy terms with all the misses sykes and all the misses pearson and the two superlative misses wynne of walden hall yet it appeared she found none amongst them very genial she fraternized with none of them to use her own words if she had had the bliss to be really shirley keeldar esq lord of the manor of briarfield there was not a single fair one in this and the two neighbouring parishes whom she should have felt disposed to request to become mrs keeldar lady of the manor this declaration she made to mrs pryor who received it very quietly as she did most of her pupils offhand speeches responding my dear do not allow that habit of alluding to yourself as a gentleman to be confirmed it is a strange one those who do not know you hearing you speak thus would think you affected masculine manners  shirley never laughed at her former governess even the little formalities and harmless peculiarities of that lady were respectable in her eyes had it been otherwise she would have proved herself a weak character at once for it is only the weak who make a butt of quiet worth therefore she took her remonstrance in silence she stood quietly near the window looking at the grand cedar on her lawn watching a bird on one of its lower boughs presently she began to chirrup to the bird soon her chirrup grew clearer ere long she was whistling the whistle struck into a tune and very sweetly and deftly it was executed  my dear expostulated mrs pryor  was i whistling said shirley i forgot i beg your pardon maam i had resolved to take care not to whistle before you  but miss keeldar where did you learn to whistle you must have got the habit since you came down into yorkshire i never knew you guilty of it before  oh i learned to whistle a long while ago  who taught you  no one i took it up by listening and i had laid it down again but lately yesterday evening as i was coming up our lane i heard a gentleman whistling that very tune in the field on the other side of the hedge and that reminded me  what gentleman was it  we have only one gentleman in this region maam and that is mr mooreat least he is the only gentleman who is not grayhaired my two venerable favourites mr helstone and mr yorke it is true are fine old beaus infinitely better than any of the stupid young ones  mrs pryor was silent  you do not like mr helstone maam  my dear mr helstones office secures him from criticism  you generally contrive to leave the room when he is announced  do you walk out this morning my dear  yes i shall go to the rectory and seek and find caroline helstone and make her take some exercise she shall have a breezy walk over nunnely common  if you go in that direction my dear have the goodness to remind miss helstone to wrap up well as there is a fresh wind and she appears to me to require care  you shall be minutely obeyed mrs pryor meantime will you not accompany us yourself  no my love i should be a restraint upon you i am stout and cannot walk so quickly as you would wish to do  shirley easily persuaded caroline to go with her and when they were fairly out on the quiet road traversing the extensive and solitary sweep of nunnely common she as easily drew her into conversation the first feelings of diffidence overcome caroline soon felt glad to talk with miss keeldar the very first interchange of slight observations sufficed to give each an idea of what the other was shirley said she liked the green sweep of the common turf and better still the heath on its ridges for the heath reminded her of moors she had seen moors when she was travelling on the borders near scotland she remembered particularly a district traversed one long afternoon on a sultry but sunless day in summer they journeyed from noon till sunset over what seemed a boundless waste of deep heath and nothing had they seen but wild sheep nothing heard but the cries of wild birds  i know how the heath would look on such a day said caroline purpleblacka deeper shade of the skytint and that would be livid  yes quite livid with brassy edges to the clouds and here and there a white gleam more ghastly than the lurid tinge which as you looked at it you momentarily expected would kindle into blinding lightning  did it thunder  it muttered distant peals but the storm did not break till evening after we had reached our innthat inn being an isolated house at the foot of a range of mountains  did you watch the clouds come down over the mountains  i did i stood at the window an hour watching them the hills seemed rolled in a sullen mist and when the rain fell in whitening sheets suddenly they were blotted from the prospect they were washed from the world  i have seen such storms in hilly districts in yorkshire and at their riotous climax while the sky was all cataract the earth all flood i have remembered the deluge  it is singularly reviving after such hurricanes to feel calm return and from the opening clouds to receive a consolatory gleam softly testifying that the sun is not quenched  miss keeldar just stand still now and look down at nunnely dale and wood  they both halted on the green brow of the common they looked down on the deep valley robed in may raiment on varied meads some pearled with daisies and some golden with kingcups today all this young verdure smiled clear in sunlight transparent emerald and amber gleams played over it on nunnwoodthe sole remnant of antique british forest in a region whose lowlands were once all silvan chase as its highlands were breastdeep heatherslept the shadow of a cloud the distant hills were dappled the horizon was shaded and tinted like motherofpearl silvery blues soft purples evanescent greens and roseshades all melting into fleeces of white cloud pure as azury snow allured the eye as with a remote glimpse of heavens foundations the air blowing on the brow was fresh and sweet and bracing  our england is a bonny island said shirley and yorkshire is one of her bonniest nooks  you are a yorkshire girl too  i amyorkshire in blood and birth five generations of my race sleep under the aisles of briarfield church i drew my first breath in the old black hall behind us  hereupon caroline presented her hand which was accordingly taken and shaken we are compatriots said she  yes agreed shirley with a grave nod  and that asked miss keeldar pointing to the forestthat is nunnwood  it is  were you ever there  many a time  in the heart of it  yes  what is it like  it is like an encampment of forest sons of anak the trees are huge and old when you stand at their roots the summits seem in another region the trunks remain still and firm as pillars while the boughs sway to every breeze in the deepest calm their leaves are never quite hushed and in high wind a flood rushes a sea thunders above you  was it not one of robin hoods haunts  yes and there are mementos of him still existing to penetrate into nunnwood miss keeldar is to go far back into the dim days of old can you see a break in the forest about the centre  yes distinctly  that break is a della deep hollow cup lined with turf as green and short as the sod of this common the very oldest of the trees gnarled mighty oaks crowd about the brink of this dell in the bottom lie the ruins of a nunnery  we will goyou and i alone carolineto that wood early some fine summer morning and spend a long day there we can take pencils and sketchbooks and any interesting reading book we like and of course we shall take something to eat i have two little baskets in which mrs gill my housekeeper might pack our provisions and we could each carry our own it would not tire you too much to walk so far  oh no especially if we rested the whole day in the wood and i know all the pleasantest spots i know where we could get nuts in nutting time i know where wild strawberries abound i know certain lonely quite untrodden glades carpeted with strange mosses some yellow as if gilded some a sober gray some gemgreen i know groups of trees that ravish the eye with their perfect picturelike effectsrude oak delicate birch glossy beech clustered in contrast and ash trees stately as saul standing isolated and superannuated woodgiants clad in bright shrouds of ivy miss keeldar i could guide you  you would be dull with me alone  i should not i think we should suit and what third person is there whose presence would not spoil our pleasure  indeed i know of none about our own agesno lady at least and as to gentlemen  an excursion becomes quite a different thing when there are gentlemen of the party interrupted caroline  i agree with youquite a different thing to what we were proposing  we were going simply to see the old trees the old ruins to pass a day in old times surrounded by olden silence and above all by quietude  you are right and the presence of gentlemen dispels the last charm i think if they are of the wrong sort like your malones and your young sykes and wynnes irritation takes the place of serenity if they are of the right sort there is still a change i can hardly tell what changeone easy to feel difficult to describe  we forget nature imprimis  and then nature forgets us covers her vast calm brow with a dim veil conceals her face and withdraws the peaceful joy with which if we had been content to worship her only she would have filled our hearts  what does she give us instead  more elation and more anxiety an excitement that steals the hours away fast and a trouble that ruffles their course  our power of being happy lies a good deal in ourselves i believe remarked caroline sagely i have gone to nunnwood with a large partyall the curates and some other gentry of these parts together with sundry ladiesand i found the affair insufferably tedious and absurd and i have gone quite alone or accompanied but by fanny who sat in the woodmans hut and sewed or talked to the goodwife while i roamed about and made sketches or read and i have enjoyed much happiness of a quiet kind all day long but that was when i was youngtwo years ago  did you ever go with your cousin robert moore  yes once  what sort of a companion is he on these occasions  a cousin you know is different to a stranger  i am aware of that but cousins if they are stupid are still more insupportable than strangers because you cannot so easily keep them at a distance but your cousin is not stupid  no but  well  if the company of fools irritates as you say the society of clever men leaves its own peculiar pain also where the goodness or talent of your friend is beyond and above all doubt your own worthiness to be his associate often becomes a matter of question  oh there i cannot follow you that crotchet is not one i should choose to entertain for an instant i consider myself not unworthy to be the associate of the best of themof gentlemen i meanthough that is saying a great deal where they are good they are very good i believe your uncle bythebye is not a bad specimen of the elderly gentleman i am always glad to see his brown keen sensible old face either in my own house or any other are you fond of him is he kind to you now speak the truth  he has brought me up from childhood i doubt not precisely as he would have brought up his own daughter if he had had one and that is kindness but i am not fond of him i would rather be out of his presence than in it  strange when he has the art of making himself so agreeable  yes in company but he is stern and silent at home as he puts away his cane and shovelhat in the rectory hall so he locks his liveliness in his bookcase and studydesk the knitted brow and brief word for the fireside the smile the jest the witty sally for society  is he tyrannical  not in the least he is neither tyrannical nor hypocritical he is simply a man who is rather liberal than goodnatured rather brilliant than genial rather scrupulously equitable than truly justif you can understand such superfine distinctions  oh yes goodnature implies indulgence which he has not geniality warmth of heart which he does not own and genuine justice is the offspring of sympathy and considerateness of which i can well conceive my bronzed old friend is quite innocent  i often wonder shirley whether most men resemble my uncle in their domestic relations whether it is necessary to be new and unfamiliar to them in order to seem agreeable or estimable in their eyes and whether it is impossible to their natures to retain a constant interest and affection for those they see every day  i dont know i cant clear up your doubts i ponder over similar ones myself sometimes but to tell you a secret if i were convinced that they are necessarily and universally different from usfickle soon petrifying unsympathizingi would never marry i should not like to find out that what i loved did not love me that it was weary of me and that whatever effort i might make to please would hereafter be worse than useless since it was inevitably in its nature to change and become indifferent that discovery once made what should i long for to go away to remove from a presence where my society gave no pleasure  but you could not if you were married  no i could not there it is i could never be my own mistress more a terrible thought it suffocates me nothing irks me like the idea of being a burden and a borean inevitable burden a ceaseless bore now when i feel my company superfluous i can comfortably fold my independence round me like a mantle and drop my pride like a veil and withdraw to solitude if married that could not be  i wonder we dont all make up our minds to remain single said caroline we should if we listened to the wisdom of experience my uncle always speaks of marriage as a burden and i believe whenever he hears of a man being married he invariably regards him as a fool or at any rate as doing a foolish thing  but caroline men are not all like your uncle surely not i hope not  she paused and mused  i suppose we each find an exception in the one we love till we are married suggested caroline  i suppose so and this exception we believe to be of sterling materials we fancy it like ourselves we imagine a sense of harmony we think his voice gives the softest truest promise of a heart that will never harden against us we read in his eyes that faithful feelingaffection i dont think we should trust to what they call passion at all caroline i believe it is a mere fire of dry sticks blazing up and vanishing but we watch him and see him kind to animals to little children to poor people he is kind to us likewise good considerate he does not flatter women but he is patient with them and he seems to be easy in their presence and to find their company genial he likes them not only for vain and selfish reasons but as we like himbecause we like him then we observe that he is just that he always speaks the truth that he is conscientious we feel joy and peace when he comes into a room we feel sadness and trouble when he leaves it we know that this man has been a kind son that he is a kind brother will any one dare to tell me that he will not be a kind husband  my uncle would affirm it unhesitatingly he will be sick of you in a month he would say  mrs pryor would seriously intimate the same  mrs yorke and miss mann would darkly suggest ditto  if they are true oracles it is good never to fall in love  very good if you can avoid it  i choose to doubt their truth  i am afraid that proves you are already caught  not i but if i were do you know what soothsayers i would consult  let me hear  neither man nor woman elderly nor young the little irish beggar that comes barefoot to my door the mouse that steals out of the cranny in the wainscot the bird that in frost and snow pecks at my window for a crumb the dog that licks my hand and sits beside my knee  did you ever see any one who was kind to such things  did you ever see any one whom such things seemed instinctively to follow like rely on  we have a black cat and an old dog at the rectory i know somebody to whose knee that black cat loves to climb against whose shoulder and cheek it likes to purr the old dog always comes out of his kennel and wags his tail and whines affectionately when somebody passes  and what does that somebody do  he quietly strokes the cat and lets her sit while he conveniently can and when he must disturb her by rising he puts her softly down and never flings her from him roughly he always whistles to the dog and gives him a caress  does he it is not robert  but it is robert  handsome fellow said shirley with enthusiasm her eyes sparkled  is he not handsome has he not fine eyes and wellcut features and a clear princely forehead  he has all that caroline bless him he is both graceful and good  i was sure you would see that he was when i first looked at your face i knew you would  i was well inclined to him before i saw him i liked him when i did see him i admire him now there is charm in beauty for itself caroline when it is blent with goodness there is a powerful charm  when mind is added shirley  who can resist it  remember my uncle mesdames pryor yorke and mann  remember the croaking of the frogs of egypt he is a noble being i tell you when they are good they are the lords of the creationthey are the sons of god moulded in their makers image the minutest spark of his spirit lifts them almost above mortality indisputably a great good handsome man is the first of created things  above us  i would scorn to contend for empire with himi would scorn it shall my left hand dispute for precedence with my right shall my heart quarrel with my pulse shall my veins be jealous of the blood which fills them  men and women husbands and wives quarrel horribly shirley  poor things poor fallen degenerate things god made them for another lot for other feelings  but are we mens equals or are we not  nothing ever charms me more than when i meet my superiorone who makes me sincerely feel that he is my superior  did you ever meet him  i should be glad to see him any day the higher above me so much the better it degrades to stoop it is glorious to look up what frets me is that when i try to esteem i am baffled when religiously inclined there are but false gods to adore i disdain to be a pagan  miss keeldar will you come in we are here at the rectory gates  not today but tomorrow i shall fetch you to spend the evening with me caroline helstone if you really are what at present to me you seem you and i will suit i have never in my whole life been able to talk to a young lady as i have talked to you this morning kiss meand goodbye                                       mrs pryor seemed as well disposed to cultivate carolines acquaintance as shirley she who went nowhere else called on an early day at the rectory she came in the afternoon when the rector happened to be out it was rather a close day the heat of the weather had flushed her and she seemed fluttered too by the circumstance of entering a strange house for it appeared her habits were most retiring and secluded when miss helstone went to her in the diningroom she found her seated on the sofa trembling fanning herself with her handkerchief and seeming to contend with a nervous discomposure that threatened to become hysterical  caroline marvelled somewhat at this unusual want of selfcommand in a lady of her years and also at the lack of real strength in one who appeared almost robustfor mrs pryor hastened to allege the fatigue of her walk the heat of the sun etc as reasons for her temporary indisposition and still as with more hurry than coherence she again and again enumerated these causes of exhaustion caroline gently sought to relieve her by opening her shawl and removing her bonnet attentions of this sort mrs pryor would not have accepted from every one in general she recoiled from touch or close approach with a mixture of embarrassment and coldness far from flattering to those who offered her aid to miss helstones little light hand however she yielded tractably and seemed soothed by its contact in a few minutes she ceased to tremble and grew quiet and tranquil  her usual manner being resumed she proceeded to talk of ordinary topics in a miscellaneous company mrs pryor rarely opened her lips or if obliged to speak she spoke under restraint and consequently not well in dialogue she was a good converser her language always a little formal was well chosen her sentiments were just her information was varied and correct caroline felt it pleasant to listen to her more pleasant than she could have anticipated  on the wall opposite the sofa where they sat hung three picturesthe centre one above the mantelpiece that of a lady the two others male portraits  that is a beautiful face said mrs pryor interrupting a brief pause which had followed half an hours animated conversation the features may be termed perfect no statuarys chisel could improve them it is a portrait from the life i presume  it is a portrait of mrs helstone  of mrs matthewson helstone of your uncles wife  it is and is said to be a good likeness before her marriage she was accounted the beauty of the district  i should say she merited the distinction what accuracy in all the lineaments it is however a passive face the original could not have been what is generally termed a woman of spirit  i believe she was a remarkably still silent person  one would scarcely have expected my dear that your uncles choice should have fallen on a partner of that description is he not fond of being amused by lively chat  in company he is but he always says he could never do with a talking wife he must have quiet at home you go out to gossip he affirms you come home to read and reflect  mrs matthewson lived but a few years after her marriage i think i have heard  about five years  well my dear pursued mrs pryor rising to go i trust it is understood that you will frequently come to fieldhead i hope you will you must feel lonely here having no female relative in the house you must necessarily pass much of your time in solitude  i am inured to it i have grown up by myself may i arrange your shawl for you  mrs pryor submitted to be assisted  should you chance to require help in your studies she said you may command me  caroline expressed her sense of such kindness  i hope to have frequent conversations with you i should wish to be of use to you  again miss helstone returned thanks she thought what a kind heart was hidden under her visitors seeming chilliness observing that mrs pryor again glanced with an air of interest towards the portraits as she walked down the room caroline casually explained the likeness that hangs near the window you will see is my uncle taken twenty years ago the other to the left of the mantelpiece is his brother james my father  they resemble each other in some measure said mrs pryor yet a difference of character may be traced in the different mould of the brow and mouth  what difference inquired caroline accompanying her to the door james helstonethat is my fatheris generally considered the bestlooking of the two strangers i remark always exclaim what a handsome man do you think his picture handsome mrs pryor  it is much softer or finer featured than that of your uncle  but where or what is the difference of character to which you alluded tell me i wish to see if you guess right  my dear your uncle is a man of principle his forehead and his lips are firm and his eye is steady  well and the other do not be afraid of offending me i always like the truth  do you like the truth it is well for you adhere to that preferencenever swerve thence the other my dear if he had been living now would probably have furnished little support to his daughter it is however a graceful headtaken in youth i should think my dear turning abruptly you acknowledge an inestimable value in principle  i am sure no character can have true worth without it  you feel what you say you have considered the subject  often circumstances early forced it upon my attention  the lesson was not lost then though it came so prematurely i suppose the soil is not light nor stony otherwise seed falling in that season never would have borne fruit my dear do not stand in the air of the door you will take cold goodafternoon  miss helstones new acquaintance soon became of value to her their society was acknowledged a privilege she found she would have been in error indeed to have let slip this chance of relief to have neglected to avail herself of this happy change a turn was thereby given to her thoughts a new channel was opened for them which diverting a few of them at least from the one direction in which all had hitherto tended abated the impetuosity of their rush and lessened the force of their pressure on one worndown point  soon she was content to spend whole days at fieldhead doing by turns whatever shirley or mrs pryor wished her to do and now one would claim her now the other nothing could be less demonstrative than the friendship of the elder lady but also nothing could be more vigilant assiduous untiring i have intimated that she was a peculiar personage and in nothing was her peculiarity more shown than in the nature of the interest she evinced for caroline she watched all her movements she seemed as if she would have guarded all her steps it gave her pleasure to be applied to by miss helstone for advice and assistance she yielded her aid when asked with such quiet yet obvious enjoyment that caroline ere long took delight in depending on her  shirley keeldars complete docility with mrs pryor had at first surprised miss helstone and not less the fact of the reserved exgoverness being so much at home and at ease in the residence of her young pupil where she filled with such quiet independency a very dependent post but she soon found that it needed but to know both ladies to comprehend fully the enigma every one it seemed to her must like must love must prize mrs pryor when they knew her no matter that she perseveringly wore oldfashioned gowns that her speech was formal and her manner cool that she had twenty little ways such as nobody else had she was still such a stay such a counsellor so truthful so kind in her way that in carolines idea none once accustomed to her presence could easily afford to dispense with it  as to dependency or humiliation caroline did not feel it in her intercourse with shirley and why should mrs pryor the heiress was richvery richcompared with her new friend one possessed a clear thousand a year the other not a penny and yet there was a safe sense of equality experienced in her society never known in that of the ordinary briarfield and whinbury gentry  the reason was shirleys head ran on other things than money and position she was glad to be independent as to property by fits she was even elated at the notion of being lady of the manor and having tenants and an estate she was especially tickled with an agreeable complacency when reminded of all that property down in the hollow comprising an excellent clothmill dyehouse warehouse together with the messuage gardens and outbuildings termed hollows cottage but her exultation being quite undisguised was singularly inoffensive and for her serious thoughts they tended elsewhere to admire the great reverence the good and be joyous with the genial was very much the bent of shirleys soul she mused therefore on the means of following this bent far oftener than she pondered on her social superiority  in caroline miss keeldar had first taken an interest because she was quiet retiring looked delicate and seemed as if she needed some one to take care of her her predilection increased greatly when she discovered that her own way of thinking and talking was understood and responded to by this new acquaintance she had hardly expected it miss helstone she fancied had too pretty a face manners and voice too soft to be anything out of the common way in mind and attainments and she very much wondered to see the gentle features light up archly to the reveille of a dry sally or two risked by herself and more did she wonder to discover the selfwon knowledge treasured and the untaught speculations working in that girlish curlveiled head carolines instinct of taste too was like her own such books as miss keeldar had read with the most pleasure were miss helstones delight also they held many aversions too in common and could have the comfort of laughing together over works of false sentimentality and pompous pretension  few shirley conceived men or women have the right taste in poetry the right sense for discriminating between what is real and what is false she had again and again heard very clever people pronounce this or that passage in this or that versifier altogether admirable which when she read her soul refused to acknowledge as anything but cant flourish and tinsel or at the best elaborate wordiness curious clever learned perhaps haply even tinged with the fascinating hues of fancy but god knows as different from real poetry as the gorgeous and massy vase of mosaic is from the little cup of pure metal or to give the reader a choice of similes as the milliners artificial wreath is from the freshgathered lily of the field  caroline she found felt the value of the true ore and knew the deception of the flashy dross the minds of the two girls being toned in harmony often chimed very sweetly together  one evening they chanced to be alone in the oakparlour they had passed a long wet day together without ennui it was now on the edge of dark candles were not yet brought in both as twilight deepened grew meditative and silent a western wind roared high round the hall driving wild clouds and stormy rain up from the farremote ocean all was tempest outside the antique lattices all deep peace within shirley sat at the window watching the rack in heaven the mist on earth listening to certain notes of the gale that plained like restless spiritsnotes which had she not been so young gay and healthy would have swept her trembling nerves like some omen some anticipatory dirge in this her prime of existence and bloom of beauty they but subdued vivacity to pensiveness snatches of sweet ballads haunted her ear now and then she sang a stanza her accents obeyed the fitful impulse of the wind they swelled as its gusts rushed on and died as they wandered away caroline withdrawn to the farthest and darkest end of the room her figure just discernible by the ruby shine of the flameless fire was pacing to and fro muttering to herself fragments of wellremembered poetry she spoke very low but shirley heard her and while singing softly she listened this was the strain      obscurest night involved the sky        the atlantic billows roared      when such a destined wretch as i        washed headlong from on board      of friends of hope of all bereft      his floating home for ever left  here the fragment stopped because shirleys song erewhile somewhat full and thrilling had become delicately faint  go on said she  then you go on too i was only repeating the castaway  i know if you can remember it all say it all  and as it was nearly dark and after all miss keeldar was no formidable auditor caroline went through it she went through it as she should have gone through it the wild sea the drowning mariner the reluctant ship swept on in the storm you heard were realized by her and more vividly was realized the heart of the poet who did not weep for the castaway but who in an hour of tearless anguish traced a semblance to his own godabandoned misery in the fate of that manforsaken sailor and cried from the depths where he struggled      no voice divine the storm allayed        no light propitious shone      when snatched from all effectual aid        we perishedeach alone      but i beneath a rougher sea      and whelmed in deeper gulfs than he  i hope william cowper is safe and calm in heaven now said caroline  do you pity what he suffered on earth asked miss keeldar  pity him shirley what can i do else he was nearly brokenhearted when he wrote that poem and it almost breaks ones heart to read it but he found relief in writing iti know he did and that gift of poetrythe most divine bestowed on manwas i believe granted to allay emotions when their strength threatens harm it seems to me shirley that nobody should write poetry to exhibit intellect or attainment who cares for that sort of poetry who cares for learningwho cares for fine words in poetry and who does not care for feelingreal feelinghowever simply even rudely expressed  it seems you care for it at all events and certainly in hearing that poem one discovers that cowper was under an impulse strong as that of the wind which drove the shipan impulse which while it would not suffer him to stop to add ornament to a single stanza filled him with force to achieve the whole with consummate perfection you managed to recite it with a steady voice caroline i wonder thereat  cowpers hand did not tremble in writing the lines why should my voice falter in repeating them depend on it shirley no tear blistered the manuscript of the castaway i hear in it no sob of sorrow only the cry of despair but that cry uttered i believe the deadly spasm passed from his heart that he wept abundantly and was comforted  shirley resumed her ballad minstrelsy stopping short she remarked ere long one could have loved cowper if it were only for the sake of having the privilege of comforting him  you never would have loved cowper rejoined caroline promptly he was not made to be loved by woman  what do you mean  what i say i know there is a kind of natures in the worldand very noble elevated natures toowhom love never comes near you might have sought cowper with the intention of loving him and you would have looked at him pitied him and left him forced away by a sense of the impossible the incongruous as the crew were borne from their drowning comrade by the furious blast  you may be right who told you this  and what i say of cowper i should say of rousseau was rousseau ever loved he loved passionately but was his passion ever returned i am certain never and if there were any female cowpers and rousseaus i should assert the same of them  who told you this i ask did moore  why should anybody have told me have i not an instinct can i not divine by analogy moore never talked to me either about cowper or rousseau or love the voice we hear in solitude told me all i know on these subjects  do you like characters of the rousseau order caroline  not at all as a whole i sympathize intensely with certain qualities they possess certain divine sparks in their nature dazzle my eyes and make my soul glow then again i scorn them they are made of clay and gold the refuse and the ore make a mass of weakness taken altogether i feel them unnatural unhealthy repulsive  i dare say i should be more tolerant of a rousseau than you would cary submissive and contemplative yourself you like the stern and the practical by the way you must miss that cousin robert of yours very much now that you and he never meet  i do  and he must miss you  that he does not  i cannot imagine pursued shirley who had lately got a habit of introducing moores name into the conversation even when it seemed to have no business therei cannot imagine but that he was fond of you since he took so much notice of you talked to you and taught you so much  he never was fond of me he never professed to be fond of me he took pains to prove that he only just tolerated me  caroline determined not to err on the flattering side in estimating her cousins regard for her always now habitually thought of it and mentioned it in the most scanty measure she had her own reasons for being less sanguine than ever in hopeful views of the future less indulgent to pleasurable retrospections of the past  of course then observed miss keeldar you only just tolerated him in return  shirley men and women are so different they are in such a different position women have so few things to think about men so many you may have a friendship for a man while he is almost indifferent to you much of what cheers your life may be dependent on him while not a feeling or interest of moment in his eyes may have reference to you robert used to be in the habit of going to london sometimes for a week or a fortnight together well while he was away i found his absence a void there was something wanting briarfield was duller of course i had my usual occupations still i missed him as i sat by myself in the evenings i used to feel a strange certainty of conviction i cannot describe that if a magician or a genius had at that moment offered me prince alis tube you remember it in the arabian nights and if with its aid i had been enabled to take a view of robertto see where he was how occupiedi should have learned in a startling manner the width of the chasm which gaped between such as he and such as i i knew that however my thoughts might adhere to him his were effectually sundered from me  caroline demanded miss keeldar abruptly dont you wish you had a professiona trade  i wish it fifty times a day as it is i often wonder what i came into the world for i long to have something absorbing and compulsory to fill my head and hands and to occupy my thoughts  can labour alone make a human being happy  no but it can give varieties of pain and prevent us from breaking our hearts with a single tyrant mastertorture besides successful labour has its recompense a vacant weary lonely hopeless life has none  but hard labour and learned professions they say make women masculine coarse unwomanly  and what does it signify whether unmarried and nevertobemarried women are unattractive and inelegant or not provided only they are decent decorous and neat it is enough the utmost which ought to be required of old maids in the way of appearance is that they should not absolutely offend mens eyes as they pass them in the street for the rest they should be allowed without too much scorn to be as absorbed grave plainlooking and plaindressed as they please  you might be an old maid yourself caroline you speak so earnestly  i shall be one it is my destiny i will never marry a malone or a sykes and no one else will ever marry me  here fell a long pause shirley broke it again the name by which she seemed bewitched was almost the first on her lips  linadid not moore call you lina sometimes  yes it is sometimes used as the abbreviation of caroline in his native country  well lina do you remember my one day noticing an inequality in your haira curl wanting on that right sideand your telling me that it was roberts fault as he had once cut therefrom a long lock  yes  if he is and always was as indifferent to you as you say why did he steal your hair  i dont knowyes i do it was my doing not his everything of that sort always was my doing he was going from hometo london as usual and the night before he went i had found in his sisters workbox a lock of black haira short round curl hortense told me it was her brothers and a keepsake he was sitting near the table i looked at his head he has plenty of hair on the temples were many such round curls i thought he could spare me one i knew i should like to have it and i asked for it he said on condition that he might have his choice of a tress from my head so he got one of my long locks of hair and i got one of his short ones i keep his but i dare say he has lost mine it was my doing and one of those silly deeds it distresses the heart and sets the face on fire to think of one of those small but sharp recollections that return lacerating your selfrespect like tiny penknives and forcing from your lips as you sit alone sudden insanesounding interjections  caroline  i do think myself a fool shirley in some respects i do despise myself but i said i would not make you my confessor for you cannot reciprocate foible for foible you are not weak how steadily you watch me now turn aside your clear strong sheeagle eye it is an insult to fix it on me thus  what a study of character you areweak certainly but not in the sense you thinkcome in  this was said in answer to a tap at the door miss keeldar happened to be near it at the moment caroline at the other end of the room she saw a note put into shirleys hands and heard the words from mr moore maam  bring candles said miss keeldar  caroline sat expectant  a communication on business said the heiress but when candles were brought she neither opened nor read it the rectors fanny was presently announced and the rectors niece went home     chapter xiii  further communications on business   in shirleys nature prevailed at times an easy indolence there were periods when she took delight in perfect vacancy of hand and eyemoments when her thoughts her simple existence the fact of the world being around and heaven above her seemed to yield her such fullness of happiness that she did not need to lift a finger to increase the joy often after an active morning she would spend a sunny afternoon in lying stirless on the turf at the foot of some tree of friendly umbrage no society did she need but that of caroline and it sufficed if she were within call no spectacle did she ask but that of the deep blue sky and such cloudlets as sailed afar and aloft across its span no sound but that of the bees hum the leafs whisper her sole book in such hours was the dim chronicle of memory or the sibyl page of anticipation from her young eyes fell on each volume a glorious light to read by round her lips at moments played a smile which revealed glimpses of the tale or prophecy it was not sad not dark fate had been benign to the blissful dreamer and promised to favour her yet again in her past were sweet passages in her future rosy hopes  yet one day when caroline drew near to rouse her thinking she had lain long enough behold as she looked down shirleys cheek was wet as if with dew those fine eyes of hers shone humid and brimming  shirley why do you cry asked caroline involuntarily laying stress on you  miss keeldar smiled and turned her picturesque head towards the questioner because it pleases me mightily to cry she said my heart is both sad and glad but why you good patient childwhy do you not bear me company i only weep tears delightful and soon wiped away you might weep gall if you choose  why should i weep gall  mateless solitary bird was the only answer  and are not you too mateless shirley  at heartno  oh who nestles there shirley  but shirley only laughed gaily at this question and alertly started up  i have dreamed she said a mere daydreamcertainly bright probably baseless                                       miss helstone was by this time free enough from illusions she took a sufficiently grave view of the future and fancied she knew pretty well how her own destiny and that of some others were tending yet old associations retained their influence over her and it was these and the power of habit which still frequently drew her of an evening to the fieldstyle and the old thorn overlooking the hollow  one night the night after the incident of the note she had been at her usual post watching for her beaconwatching vainly that evening no lamp was lit she waited till the rising of certain constellations warned her of lateness and signed her away in passing fieldhead on her return its moonlight beauty attracted her glance and stayed her step an instant tree and hall rose peaceful under the night sky and clear full orb pearly paleness gilded the building mellow brown gloom bosomed it round shadows of deep green brooded above its oakwreathed roof the broad pavement in front shone pale also it gleamed as if some spell had transformed the dark granite to glistering parian on the silvery space slept two sable shadows thrown sharply defined from two human figures these figures when first seen were motionless and mute presently they moved in harmonious step and spoke low in harmonious key earnest was the gaze that scrutinized them as they emerged from behind the trunk of the cedar is it mrs pryor and shirley  certainly it is shirley who else has a shape so lithe and proud and graceful and her face too is visibleher countenance careless and pensive and musing and mirthful and mocking and tender not fearing the dew she has not covered her head her curls are freethey veil her neck and caress her shoulder with their tendril rings an ornament of gold gleams through the halfclosed folds of the scarf she has wrapped across her bust and a large bright gem glitters on the white hand which confines it yes that is shirley  her companion then is of course mrs pryor  yes if mrs pryor owns six feet of stature and if she has changed her decent widows weeds for masculine disguise the figure walking at miss keeldars side is a mana tall young stately man it is her tenant robert moore  the pair speak softly their words are not distinguishable to remain a moment to gaze is not to be an eavesdropper and as the moon shines so clearly and their countenances are so distinctly apparent who can resist the attraction of such interest caroline it seems cannot for she lingers  there was a time when on summer nights moore had been wont to walk with his cousin as he was now walking with the heiress often had she gone up the hollow with him after sunset to scent the freshness of the earth where a growth of fragrant herbage carpeted a certain narrow terrace edging a deep ravine from whose rifted gloom was heard a sound like the spirit of the lonely watercourse moaning amongst its wet stones and between its weedy banks and under its dark bower of alders  but i used to be closer to him thought caroline he felt no obligation to treat me with homage i needed only kindness he used to hold my hand he does not touch hers and yet shirley is not proud where she loves there is no haughtiness in her aspect now only a little in her portwhat is natural to and inseparable from her what she retains in her most careless as in her most guarded moments robert must think as i think that he is at this instant looking down on a fine face and he must think it with a mans brain not with mine she has such generous yet soft fire in her eyes she smileswhat makes her smile so sweet i saw that robert felt its beauty and he must have felt it with his mans heart not with my dim womans perceptions they look to me like two great happy spirits yonder silvered pavement reminds me of that white shore we believe to be beyond the deathflood they have reached it they walk there united and what am i standing here in shadow shrinking into concealment my mind darker than my hidingplace i am one of this world no spirita poor doomed mortal who asks in ignorance and hopelessness wherefore she was born to what end she lives whose mind for ever runs on the question how she shall at last encounter and by whom be sustained through death  this is the worst passage i have come to yet still i was quite prepared for it i gave robert up and gave him up to shirley the first day i heard she was come the first moment i saw herrich youthful and lovely she has him now he is her lover she is his darling she will be far more his darling yet when they are married the more robert knows of shirley the more his soul will cleave to her they will both be happy and i do not grudge them their bliss but i groan under my own misery some of my suffering is very acute truly i ought not to have been born they should have smothered me at the first cry  here shirley stepping aside to gather a dewy flower she and her companion turned into a path that lay nearer the gate some of their conversation became audible caroline would not stay to listen she passed away noiselessly and the moonlight kissed the wall which her shadow had dimmed the reader is privileged to remain and try what he can make of the discourse  i cannot conceive why nature did not give you a bulldogs head for you have all a bulldogs tenacity said shirley  not a flattering idea am i so ignoble  and something also you have of the same animals silent ways of going about its work you give no warning you come noiselessly behind seize fast and hold on  this is guesswork you have witnessed no such feat on my part in your presence i have been no bulldog  your very silence indicates your race how little you talk in general yet how deeply you scheme you are farseeing you are calculating  i know the ways of these people i have gathered information of their intentions my note last night informed you that barracloughs trial had ended in his conviction and sentence to transportation his associates will plot vengeance i shall lay my plans so as to counteract or at least be prepared for theirsthat is all having now given you as clear an explanation as i can am i to understand that for what i propose doing i have your approbation  i shall stand by you so long as you remain on the defensive yes  good without any aideven opposed or disapproved by youi believe i should have acted precisely as i now intend to act but in another spirit i now feel satisfied on the whole i relish the position  i dare say you do that is evident you relish the work which lies before you still better than you would relish the execution of a government order for armycloth  i certainly feel it congenial  so would old helstone it is true there is a shade of difference in your motivesmany shades perhaps shall i speak to mr helstone i will if you like  act as you please your judgment miss keeldar will guide you accurately i could rely on it myself in a more difficult crisis but i should inform you mr helstone is somewhat prejudiced against me at present  i am awarei have heard all about your differences depend upon it they will melt away he cannot resist the temptation of an alliance under present circumstances  i should be glad to have him he is of true metal  i think so also  an old blade and rusty somewhat but the edge and temper still excellent  well you shall have him mr moorethat is if i can win him  whom can you not win  perhaps not the rector but i will make the effort  effort he will yield for a worda smile  by no means it will cost me several cups of tea some toast and cake and an ample measure of remonstrances expostulations and persuasions it grows rather chill  i perceive you shiver am i acting wrongly to detain you here yet it is so calmi even feel it warmand society such as yours is a pleasure to me so rare if you were wrapped in a thicker shawl  i might stay longer and forget how late it is which would chagrin mrs pryor we keep early and regular hours at fieldhead mr moore and so i am sure does your sister at the cottage  yes but hortense and i have an understanding the most convenient in the world that we shall each do as we please  how do you please to do  three nights in the week i sleep in the millbut i require little restand when it is moonlight and mild i often haunt the hollow till daybreak  when i was a very little girl mr moore my nurse used to tell me tales of fairies being seen in that hollow that was before my father built the mill when it was a perfectly solitary ravine you will be falling under enchantment  i fear it is done said moore in a low voice  but there are worse things than fairies to be guarded against pursued miss keeldar  things more perilous he subjoined  far more so for instance how would you like to meet michael hartley that mad calvinist and jacobin weaver they say he is addicted to poaching and often goes abroad at night with his gun  i have already had the luck to meet him we held a long argument together one night a strange little incident it was i liked it  liked it i admire your taste michael is not sane where did you meet him  in the deepest shadiest spot in the glen where the water runs low under brushwood we sat down near that plank bridge it was moonlight but clouded and very windy we had a talk  on politics  and religion i think the moon was at the full and michael was as near crazed as possible he uttered strange blasphemy in his antinomian fashion  excuse me but i think you must have been nearly as mad as he to sit listening to him  there is a wild interest in his ravings the man would be half a poet if he were not wholly a maniac and perhaps a prophet if he were not a profligate he solemnly informed me that hell was foreordained my inevitable portion that he read the mark of the beast on my brow that i had been an outcast from the beginning gods vengeance he said was preparing for me and affirmed that in a vision of the night he had beheld the manner and the instrument of my doom i wanted to know further but he left me with these words the end is not yet  have you ever seen him since  about a month afterwards in returning from market i encountered him and moses barraclough both in an advanced stage of inebriation they were praying in frantic sort at the roadside they accosted me as satan bid me avaunt and clamoured to be delivered from temptation again but a few days ago michael took the trouble of appearing at the countinghouse door hatless in his shirtsleeveshis coat and castor having been detained at the publichouse in pledge he delivered himself of the comfortable message that he could wish mr moore to set his house in order as his soul was likely shortly to be required of him  do you make light of these things  the poor man had been drinking for weeks and was in a state bordering on delirium tremens  what then he is the more likely to attempt the fulfilment of his own prophecies  it would not do to permit incidents of this sort to affect ones nerves  mr moore go home  so soon  pass straight down the fields not round by the lade and plantations  it is early yet  it is late for my part i am going in will you promise me not to wander in the hollow tonight  if you wish it  i do wish it may i ask whether you consider life valueless  by no means on the contrary of late i regard my life as invaluable  of late  existence is neither aimless nor hopeless to me now and it was both three months ago i was then drowning and rather wished the operation over all at once a hand was stretched to mesuch a delicate hand i scarcely dared trust it its strength however has rescued me from ruin  are you really rescued  for the time your assistance has given me another chance  live to make the best of it dont offer yourself as a target to michael hartley and goodnight                                       miss helstone was under a promise to spend the evening of the next day at fieldhead she kept her promise some gloomy hours had she spent in the interval most of the time had been passed shut up in her own apartment only issuing from it indeed to join her uncle at meals and anticipating inquiries from fanny by telling her that she was busy altering a dress and preferred sewing upstairs to avoid interruption  she did sew she plied her needle continuously ceaselessly but her brain worked faster than her fingers again and more intensely than ever she desired a fixed occupation no matter how onerous how irksome her uncle must be once more entreated but first she would consult mrs pryor her head laboured to frame projects as diligently as her hands to plait and stitch the thin texture of the muslin summer dress spread on the little white couch at the foot of which she sat now and then while thus doubly occupied a tear would fill her eyes and fall on her busy hands but this sign of emotion was rare and quickly effaced the sharp pang passed the dimness cleared from her vision she would rethread her needle rearrange tuck and trimming and work on  late in the afternoon she dressed herself she reached fieldhead and appeared in the oak parlour just as tea was brought in shirley asked her why she came so late  because i have been making my dress said she these fine sunny days began to make me ashamed of my winter merino so i have furbished up a lighter garment  in which you look as i like to see you said shirley you are a ladylike little person carolineis she not mrs pryor  mrs pryor never paid compliments and seldom indulged in remarks favourable or otherwise on personal appearance on the present occasion she only swept carolines curls from her cheek as she took a seat near her caressed the oval outline and observed you get somewhat thin my love and somewhat pale do you sleep well your eyes have a languid look and she gazed at her anxiously  i sometimes dream melancholy dreams answered caroline and if i lie awake for an hour or two in the night i am continually thinking of the rectory as a dreary old place you know it is very near the churchyard the back part of the house is extremely ancient and it is said that the outkitchens there were once enclosed in the churchyard and that there are graves under them i rather long to leave the rectory  my dear you are surely not superstitious  no mrs pryor but i think i grow what is called nervous i see things under a darker aspect than i used to do i have fears i never used to havenot of ghosts but of omens and disastrous events and i have an inexpressible weight on my mind which i would give the world to shake off and i cannot do it  strange cried shirley i never feel so mrs pryor said nothing  fine weather pleasant days pleasant scenes are powerless to give me pleasure continued caroline calm evenings are not calm to me moonlight which i used to think mild now only looks mournful is this weakness of mind mrs pryor or what is it i cannot help it i often struggle against it i reason but reason and effort make no difference  you should take more exercise said mrs pryor  exercise i exercise sufficiently i exercise till i am ready to drop  my dear you should go from home  mrs pryor i should like to go from home but not on any purposeless excursion or visit i wish to be a governess as you have been it would oblige me greatly if you would speak to my uncle on the subject  nonsense broke in shirley what an idea be a governess better be a slave at once where is the necessity of it why should you dream of such a painful step  my dear said mrs pryor you are very young to be a governess and not sufficiently robust the duties a governess undertakes are often severe  and i believe i want severe duties to occupy me  occupy you cried shirley when are you idle i never saw a more industrious girl than you you are always at work come she continuedcome and sit by my side and take some tea to refresh you you dont care much for my friendship then that you wish to leave me  indeed i do shirley and i dont wish to leave you i shall never find another friend so dear  at which words miss keeldar put her hand into carolines with an impulsively affectionate movement which was well seconded by the expression of her face  if you think so you had better make much of me she said and not run away from me i hate to part with those to whom i am become attached mrs pryor there sometimes talks of leaving me and says i might make a more advantageous connection than herself i should as soon think of exchanging an oldfashioned mother for something modish and stylish as for youwhy i began to flatter myself we were thoroughly friends that you liked shirley almost as well as shirley likes you and she does not stint her regard  i do like shirley i like her more and more every day but that does not make me strong or happy  and would it make you strong or happy to go and live as a dependent amongst utter strangers it would not and the experiment must not be tried i tell you it would fail it is not in your nature to bear the desolate life governesses generally lead you would fall ill i wont hear of it  and miss keeldar paused having uttered this prohibition very decidedly soon she recommenced still looking somewhat courroucée why it is my daily pleasure now to look out for the little cottage bonnet and the silk scarf glancing through the trees in the lane and to know that my quiet shrewd thoughtful companion and monitress is coming back to me that i shall have her sitting in the room to look at to talk to or to let alone as she and i please this may be a selfish sort of languagei know it isbut it is the language which naturally rises to my lips therefore i utter it  i would write to you shirley  and what are letters only a sort of pis aller drink some tea caroline eat somethingyou eat nothing laugh and be cheerful and stay at home  miss helstone shook her head and sighed she felt what difficulty she would have to persuade any one to assist or sanction her in making that change in her life which she believed desirable might she only follow her own judgment she thought she should be able to find perhaps a harsh but an effectual cure for her sufferings but this judgment founded on circumstances she could fully explain to none least of all to shirley seemed in all eyes but her own incomprehensible and fantastic and was opposed accordingly  there really was no present pecuniary need for her to leave a comfortable home and take a situation and there was every probability that her uncle might in some way permanently provide for her so her friends thought and as far as their lights enabled them to see they reasoned correctly but of carolines strange sufferings which she desired so eagerly to overcome or escape they had no idea of her racked nights and dismal days no suspicion it was at once impossible and hopeless to explain to wait and endure was her only plan many that want food and clothing have cheerier lives and brighter prospects than she had many harassed by poverty are in a strait less afflictive  now is your mind quieted inquired shirley will you consent to stay at home  i shall not leave it against the approbation of my friends was the reply but i think in time they will be obliged to think as i do  during this conversation mrs pryor looked far from easy her extreme habitual reserve would rarely permit her to talk freely or to interrogate others closely she could think a multitude of questions she never ventured to put give advice in her mind which her tongue never delivered had she been alone with caroline she might possibly have said something to the point miss keeldars presence accustomed as she was to it sealed her lips now as on a thousand other occasions inexplicable nervous scruples kept her back from interfering she merely showed her concern for miss helstone in an indirect way by asking her if the fire made her too warm placing a screen between her chair and the hearth closing a window whence she imagined a draught proceeded and often and restlessly glancing at her shirley resumed having destroyed your plan she said which i hope i have done i shall construct a new one of my own every summer i make an excursion this season i propose spending two months either at the scotch lochs or the english lakesthat is i shall go there provided you consent to accompany me if you refuse i shall not stir a foot  you are very good shirley  i would be very good if you would let me i have every disposition to be good it is my misfortune and habit i know to think of myself paramount to anybody else but who is not like me in that respect however when captain keeldar is made comfortable accommodated with all he wants including a sensible genial comrade it gives him a thorough pleasure to devote his spare efforts to making that comrade happy and should we not be happy caroline in the highlands we will go to the highlands we will if you can bear a seavoyage go to the islesthe hebrides the shetland the orkney islands would you not like that i see you wouldmrs pryor i call you to witness her face is all sunshine at the bare mention of it  i should like it much returned caroline to whom indeed the notion of such a tour was not only pleasant but gloriously reviving shirley rubbed her hands  come i can bestow a benefit she exclaimed i can do a good deed with my cash my thousand a year is not merely a matter of dirty banknotes and jaundiced guineas let me speak respectfully of both though for i adore them but it may be health to the drooping strength to the weak consolation to the sad i was determined to make something of it better than a fine old house to live in than satin gowns to wear better than deference from acquaintance and homage from the poor here is to begin this summer caroline mrs pryor and i go out into the north atlantic beyond the shetland perhaps to the faroe isles we will see seals in suderoe and doubtless mermaids in stromoecaroline is laughing mrs pryor i made her laugh i have done her good  i shall like to go shirley again said miss helstone i long to hear the sound of wavesoceanwavesand to see them as i have imagined them in dreams like tossing banks of green light strewed with vanishing and reappearing wreaths of foam whiter than lilies i shall delight to pass the shores of those lone rockislets where the seabirds live and breed unmolested we shall be on the track of the old scandinaviansof the norsemen we shall almost see the shores of norway this is a very vague delight that i feel communicated by your proposal but it is a delight  will you think of fitful head now when you lie awake at night of gulls shrieking round it and waves tumbling in upon it rather than of the graves under the rectory backkitchen  i will try and instead of musing about remnants of shrouds and fragments of coffins and human bones and mould i will fancy seals lying in the sunshine on solitary shores where neither fisherman nor hunter ever come of rock crevices full of pearly eggs bedded in seaweed of unscared birds covering white sands in happy flocks  and what will become of that inexpressible weight you said you had on your mind  i will try to forget it in speculation on the sway of the whole great deep above a herd of whales rushing through the livid and liquid thunder down from the frozen zonea hundred of them perhaps wallowing flashing rolling in the wake of a patriarch bull huge enough to have been spawned before the flood such a creature as poor smart had in his mind when he said      strong against tides the enormous whale        emerges as he goes  i hope our bark will meet with no such shoal or herd as you term it caroline i suppose you fancy the seamammoths pasturing about the bases of the everlasting hills devouring strange provender in the vast valleys through and above which seabillows roll i should not like to be capsized by the patriarch bull  i suppose you expect to see mermaids shirley  one of them at any ratei do not bargain for lessand she is to appear in some such fashion as this i am to be walking by myself on deck rather late of an august evening watching and being watched by a full harvest moon something is to rise white on the surface of the sea over which that moon mounts silent and hangs glorious the object glitters and sinks it rises again i think i hear it cry with an articulate voice i call you up from the cabin i show you an image fair as alabaster emerging from the dim wave we both see the long hair the lifted and foamwhite arm the oval mirror brilliant as a star it glides nearer a human face is plainly visiblea face in the style of yourswhose straight pure excuse the word it is appropriatewhose straight pure lineaments paleness does not disfigure it looks at us but not with your eyes i see a preternatural lure in its wily glance it beckons were we men we should spring at the signthe cold billow would be dared for the sake of the colder enchantress being women we stand safe though not dreadless she comprehends our unmoved gaze she feels herself powerless anger crosses her front she cannot charm but she will appal us she rises high and glides all revealed on the dark waveridge temptressterror monstrous likeness of ourselves are you not glad caroline when at last and with a wild shriek she dives  but shirley she is not like us we are neither temptresses nor terrors nor monsters  some of our kind it is said are all three there are men who ascribe to woman in general such attributes  my dears here interrupted mrs pryor does it not strike you that your conversation for the last ten minutes has been rather fanciful  but there is no harm in our fancies is there maam  we are aware that mermaids do not exist why speak of them as if they did how can you find interest in speaking of a nonentity  i dont know said shirley  my dear i think there is an arrival i heard a step in the lane while you were talking and is not that the gardengate which creaks  shirley stepped to the window  yes there is some one said she turning quietly away and as she resumed her seat a sensitive flush animated her face while a trembling ray at once kindled and softened her eye she raised her hand to her chin cast her gaze down and seemed to think as she waited  the servant announced mr moore and shirley turned round when mr moore appeared at the door his figure seemed very tall as he entered and stood in contrast with the three ladies none of whom could boast a stature much beyond the average he was looking well better than he had been known to look for the past twelve months a sort of renewed youth glowed in his eye and colour and an invigorated hope and settled purpose sustained his bearing firmness his countenance still indicated but not austerity it looked as cheerful as it was earnest  i am just returned from stilbro he said to miss keeldar as he greeted her and i thought i would call to impart to you the result of my mission  you did right not to keep me in suspense she said and your visit is well timed sit down we have not finished tea are you english enough to relish tea or do you faithfully adhere to coffee  moore accepted tea  i am learning to be a naturalized englishman said he my foreign habits are leaving me one by one  and now he paid his respects to mrs pryor and paid them well with a grave modesty that became his age compared with hers then he looked at carolinenot however for the first time his glance had fallen upon her before he bent towards her as she sat gave her his hand and asked her how she was the light from the window did not fall upon miss helstone her back was turned towards it a quiet though rather low reply a still demeanour and the friendly protection of early twilight kept out of view each traitorous symptom none could affirm that she had trembled or blushed that her heart had quaked or her nerves thrilled none could prove emotion a greeting showing less effusion was never interchanged moore took the empty chair near her opposite miss keeldar he had placed himself well his neighbour screened by the very closeness of his vicinage from his scrutiny and sheltered further by the dusk which deepened each moment soon regained not merely seeming but real mastery of the feelings which had started into insurrection at the first announcement of his name  he addressed his conversation to miss keeldar  i went to the barracks he said and had an interview with colonel ryde he approved my plans and promised the aid i wanted indeed he offered a more numerous force than i requirehalf a dozen will suffice i dont intend to be swamped by redcoats they are needed for appearance rather than anything else my main reliance is on my own civilians  and on their captain interposed shirley  what captain keeldar inquired moore slightly smiling and not lifting his eyes the tone of raillery in which he said this was very respectful and suppressed  no returned shirley answering the smile captain gérard moore who trusts much to the prowess of his own right arm i believe  furnished with his countinghouse ruler added moore resuming his usual gravity he went on i received by this evenings post a note from the home secretary in answer to mine it appears they are uneasy at the state of matters here in the north they especially condemn the supineness and pusillanimity of the millowners they say as i have always said that inaction under present circumstances is criminal and that cowardice is cruelty since both can only encourage disorder and lead finally to sanguinary outbreaks there is the notei brought it for your perusal and there is a batch of newspapers containing further accounts of proceedings in nottingham manchester and elsewhere  he produced letters and journals and laid them before miss keeldar while she perused them he took his tea quietly but though his tongue was still his observant faculties seemed by no means off duty mrs pryor sitting in the background did not come within the range of his glance but the two younger ladies had the full benefit thereof  miss keeldar placed directly opposite was seen without effort she was the object his eyes when lifted naturally met first and as what remained of daylightthe gilding of the westwas upon her her shape rose in relief from the dark panelling behind shirleys clear cheek was tinted yet with the colour which had risen into it a few minutes since the dark lashes of her eyes looking down as she read the dusk yet delicate line of her eyebrows the almost sable gloss of her curls made her heightened complexion look fine as the bloom of a red wild flower by contrast there was natural grace in her attitude and there was artistic effect in the ample and shining folds of her silk dressan attire simply fashioned but almost splendid from the shifting brightness of its dye warp and woof being of tints deep and changing as the hue on a pheasants neck a glancing bracelet on her arm produced the contrast of gold and ivory there was something brilliant in the whole picture it is to be supposed that moore thought so as his eye dwelt long on it but he seldom permitted his feelings or his opinions to exhibit themselves in his face his temperament boasted a certain amount of phlegm and he preferred an undemonstrative not ungentle but serious aspect to any other  he could not by looking straight before him see caroline as she was close at his side it was necessary therefore to manœuvre a little to get her well within the range of his observation he leaned back in his chair and looked down on her in miss helstone neither he nor any one else could discover brilliancy sitting in the shade without flowers or ornaments her attire the modest muslin dress colourless but for its narrow stripe of pale azure her complexion unflushed unexcited the very brownness of her hair and eyes invisible by this faint light she was compared with the heiress as a graceful pencil sketch compared with a vivid painting since robert had seen her last a great change had been wrought in her whether he perceived it might not be ascertained he said nothing to that effect  how is hortense asked caroline softly  very well but she complains of being unemployed she misses you  tell her that i miss her and that i write and read a portion of french every day  she will ask if you sent your love she is always particular on that point you know she likes attention  my best lovemy very best and say to her that whenever she has time to write me a little note i shall be glad to hear from her  what if i forget i am not the surest messenger of compliments  no dont forget robert it is no compliment it is in good earnest  and must therefore be delivered punctually  if you please  hortense will be ready to shed tears she is tenderhearted on the subject of her pupil yet she reproaches you sometimes for obeying your uncles injunctions too literally affection like love will be unjust now and then  and caroline made no answer to this observation for indeed her heart was troubled and to her eyes she would have raised her handkerchief if she had dared if she had dared too she would have declared how the very flowers in the garden of hollows cottage were dear to her how the little parlour of that house was her earthly paradise how she longed to return to it as much almost as the first woman in her exile must have longed to revisit eden not daring however to say these things she held her peace she sat quiet at roberts side waiting for him to say something more it was long since this proximity had been herslong since his voice had addressed her could she with any show of probability even of possibility have imagined that the meeting gave him pleasure to her it would have given deep bliss yet even in doubt that it pleased in dread that it might annoy him she received the boon of the meeting as an imprisoned bird would the admission of sunshine to its cage it was of no use arguing contending against the sense of present happiness to be near robert was to be revived  miss keeldar laid down the papers  and are you glad or sad for all these menacing tidings she inquired of her tenant  not precisely either but i certainly am instructed i see that our only plan is to be firm i see that efficient preparation and a resolute attitude are the best means of averting bloodshed  he then inquired if she had observed some particular paragraph to which she replied in the negative and he rose to show it to her he continued the conversation standing before her from the tenor of what he said it appeared evident that they both apprehended disturbances in the neighbourhood of briarfield though in what form they expected them to break out was not specified neither caroline nor mrs pryor asked questions the subject did not appear to be regarded as one ripe for free discussion therefore the lady and her tenant were suffered to keep details to themselves unimportuned by the curiosity of their listeners  miss keeldar in speaking to mr moore took a tone at once animated and dignified confidential and selfrespecting when however the candles were brought in and the fire was stirred up and the fullness of light thus produced rendered the expression of her countenance legible you could see that she was all interest life and earnestness there was nothing coquettish in her demeanour whatever she felt for moore she felt it seriously and serious too were his feelings and settled were his views apparently for he made no petty effort to attract dazzle or impress he contrived notwithstanding to command a little because the deeper voice however mildly modulated the somewhat harder mind now and then though involuntarily and unintentionally bore down by some peremptory phrase or tone the mellow accents and susceptible if high nature of shirley miss keeldar looked happy in conversing with him and her joy seemed twofolda joy of the past and present of memory and of hope  what i have just said are carolines ideas of the pair she felt what has just been described in thus feeling she tried not to suffer but suffered sharply nevertheless she suffered indeed miserably a few minutes before her famished heart had tasted a drop and crumb of nourishment that if freely given would have brought back abundance of life where life was failing but the generous feast was snatched from her spread before another and she remained but a bystander at the banquet  the clock struck nine it was carolines time for going home she gathered up her work put the embroidery the scissors the thimble into her bag she bade mrs pryor a quiet goodnight receiving from that lady a warmer pressure of the hand than usual she stepped up to miss keeldar  goodnight shirley  shirley started up what so soon are you going already  it is past nine  i never heard the clock you will come again tomorrow and you will be happy tonight will you not remember our plans  yes said caroline i have not forgotten  her mind misgave her that neither those plans nor any other could permanently restore her mental tranquillity she turned to robert who stood close behind her as he looked up the light of the candles on the mantelpiece fell full on her face all its paleness all its change all its forlorn meaning were clearly revealed robert had good eyes and might have seen it if he would whether he did see it nothing indicated  goodnight she said shaking like a leaf offering her thin hand hastily anxious to part from him quickly  you are going home he asked not touching her hand  yes  is fanny come for you  yes  i may as well accompany you a step of the way not up to the rectory though lest my old friend helstone should shoot me from the window  he laughed and took his hat caroline spoke of unnecessary trouble he told her to put on her bonnet and shawl she was quickly ready and they were soon both in the open air moore drew her hand under his arm just in his old mannerthat manner which she ever felt to be so kind  you may run on fanny he said to the housemaid we shall overtake you and when the girl had got a little in advance he enclosed carolines hand in his and said he was glad to find she was a familiar guest at fieldhead he hoped her intimacy with miss keeldar would continue such society would be both pleasant and improving  caroline replied that she liked shirley  and there is no doubt the liking is mutual said moore if she professes friendship be certain she is sincere she cannot feign she scorns hypocrisy and caroline are we never to see you at hollows cottage again  i suppose not unless my uncle should change his mind  are you much alone now  yes a good deal i have little pleasure in any society but miss keeldars  have you been quite well lately  quite  you must take care of yourself be sure not to neglect exercise do you know i fancied you somewhat altereda little fallen away and pale is your uncle kind to you  yes he is just as he always is  not too tender that is to saynot too protective and attentive and what ails you then tell me lina  nothing robert but her voice faltered  that is to say nothing that you will tell me i am not to be taken into confidence separation is then quite to estrange us is it  i do not know sometimes i almost fear it is  but it ought not to have that effect should auld acquaintance be forgot and days o lang syne  robert i dont forget  it is two months i should think caroline since you were at the cottage  since i was within ityes  have you ever passed that way in your walk  i have come to the top of the fields sometimes of an evening and looked down once i saw hortense in the garden watering her flowers and i know at what time you light your lamp in the countinghouse i have waited for it to shine out now and then and i have seen you bend between it and the window i knew it was you i could almost trace the outline of your form  i wonder i never encountered you i occasionally walk to the top of the hollows fields after sunset  i know you do i had almost spoken to you one night you passed so near me  did i i passed near you and did not see you was i alone  i saw you twice and neither time were you alone  who was my companion probably nothing but joe scott or my own shadow by moonlight  no neither joe scott nor your shadow robert the first time you were with mr yorke and the second time what you call your shadow was a shape with a white forehead and dark curls and a sparkling necklace round its neck but i only just got a glimpse of you and that fairy shadow i did not wait to hear you converse  it appears you walk invisible i noticed a ring on your hand this evening can it be the ring of gyges henceforth when sitting in the countinghouse by myself perhaps at dead of night i shall permit myself to imagine that caroline may be leaning over my shoulder reading with me from the same book or sitting at my side engaged in her own particular task and now and then raising her unseen eyes to my face to read there my thoughts  you need fear no such infliction i do not come near you i only stand afar off watching what may become of you  when i walk out along the hedgerows in the evening after the mill is shut or at night when i take the watchmans place i shall fancy the flutter of every little bird over its nest the rustle of every leaf a movement made by you treeshadows will take your shape in the white sprays of hawthorn i shall imagine glimpses of you lina you will haunt me  i will never be where you would not wish me to be nor see nor hear what you would wish unseen and unheard  i shall see you in my very mill in broad daylight indeed i have seen you there once but a week ago i was standing at the top of one of my long rooms girls were working at the other end and amongst half a dozen of them moving to and fro i seemed to see a figure resembling yours it was some effect of doubtful light or shade or of dazzling sunbeam i walked up to this group what i sought had glided away i found myself between two buxom lasses in pinafores  i shall not follow you into your mill robert unless you call me there  nor is that the only occasion on which imagination has played me a trick one night when i came home late from market i walked into the cottage parlour thinking to find hortense but instead of her i thought i found you there was no candle in the room my sister had taken the light upstairs with her the windowblind was not drawn and broad moonbeams poured through the panes there you were lina at the casement shrinking a little to one side in an attitude not unusual with you you were dressed in white as i have seen you dressed at an evening party for half a second your fresh living face seemed turned towards me looking at me for half a second my idea was to go and take your hand to chide you for your long absence and welcome your present visit two steps forward broke the spell the drapery of the dress changed outline the tints of the complexion dissolved and were formless positively as i reached the spot there was nothing left but the sweep of a white muslin curtain and a balsam plant in a flowerpot covered with a flush of bloom sic transit et cetera  it was not my wraith then i almost thought it was  no only gauze crockery and pink blossoma sample of earthly illusions  i wonder you have time for such illusions occupied as your mind must be  so do i but i find in myself lina two naturesone for the world and business and one for home and leisure gérard moore is a hard dog brought up to mill and market the person you call your cousin robert is sometimes a dreamer who lives elsewhere than in clothhall and countinghouse  your two natures agree with you i think you are looking in good spirits and health you have quite lost that harassed air which it often pained one to see in your face a few months ago  do you observe that certainly i am disentangled of some difficulties i have got clear of some shoals and have more searoom  and with a fair wind you may now hope to make a prosperous voyage  i may hope ityesbut hope is deceptive there is no controlling wind or wave gusts and swells perpetually trouble the mariners course he dare not dismiss from his mind the expectation of tempest  but you are ready for a breeze you are a good seaman an able commander you are a skilful pilot robert you will weather the storm  my kinswoman always thinks the best of me but i will take her words for a propitious omen i will consider that in meeting her tonight i have met with one of those birds whose appearance is to the sailor the harbinger of good luck  a poor harbinger of good luck is she who can do nothing who has no power i feel my incapacity it is of no use saying i have the will to serve you when i cannot prove it yet i have that will i wish you success i wish you high fortune and true happiness  when did you ever wish me anything else what is fanny waiting for i told her to walk on oh we have reached the churchyard then we are to part here i suppose we might have sat a few minutes in the church porch if the girl had not been with us it is so fine a night so summermild and still i have no particular wish to return yet to the hollow  but we cannot sit in the porch now robert  caroline said this because moore was turning her round towards it  perhaps not but tell fanny to go in say we are coming a few minutes will make no difference  the church clock struck ten  my uncle will be coming out to take his usual sentinel round and he always surveys the church and churchyard  and if he does if it were not for fanny who knows we are here i should find pleasure in dodging and eluding him we could be under the east window when he is at the porch as he came round to the north side we could wheel off to the south we might at a pinch hide behind some of the monuments that tall erection of the wynnes would screen us completely  robert what good spirits you have go go added caroline hastily i hear the front door  i dont want to go on the contrary i want to stay  you know my uncle will be terribly angry he forbade me to see you because you are a jacobin  a queer jacobin  go robert he is coming i hear him cough  diable it is strangewhat a pertinacious wish i feel to stay  you remember what he did to fannys began caroline and stopped abruptly short sweetheart was the word that ought to have followed but she could not utter it it seemed calculated to suggest ideas she had no intention to suggestideas delusive and disturbing moore was less scrupulous fannys sweetheart he said at once he gave him a showerbath under the pump did he not hed do as much for me i dare say with pleasure i should like to provoke the old turknot however against you but he would make a distinction between a cousin and a lover would he not  oh he would not think of you in that way of course not his quarrel with you is entirely political yet i should not like the breach to be widened and he is so testy here he is at the garden gate for your own sake and mine robert go  the beseeching words were aided by a beseeching gesture and a more beseeching look moore covered her clasped hands an instant with his answered her upward by a downward gaze said goodnight and went  caroline was in a moment at the kitchen door behind fanny the shadow of the shovelhat at that very instant fell on a moonlit tomb the rector emerged erect as a cane from his garden and proceeded in slow march his hands behind him down the cemetery moore was almost caught he had to dodge after all to coast round the church and finally to bend his tall form behind the wynnes ambitious monument there he was forced to hide full ten minutes kneeling with one knee on the turf his hat off his curls bare to the dew his dark eye shining and his lips parted with inward laughter at his position for the rector meantime stood coolly stargazing and taking snuff within three feet of him  it happened however that mr helstone had no suspicion whatever on his mind for being usually but vaguely informed of his nieces movements not thinking it worth while to follow them closely he was not aware that she had been out at all that day and imagined her then occupied with book or work in her chamberwhere indeed she was by this time though not absorbed in the tranquil employment he ascribed to her but standing at her window with fastthrobbing heart peeping anxiously from behind the blind watching for her uncle to reenter and her cousin to escape and at last she was gratified she heard mr helstone come in she saw robert stride the tombs and vault the wall she then went down to prayers when she returned to her chamber it was to meet the memory of robert slumbers visitation was long averted long she sat at her lattice long gazed down on the old garden and older church on the tombs laid out all gray and calm and clear in moonlight she followed the steps of the night on its pathway of stars far into the wee sma hours ayont the twal she was with moore in spirit the whole time she was at his side she heard his voice she gave her hand into his hand it rested warm in his fingers when the church clock struck when any other sound stirred when a little mouse familiar to her chamberan intruder for which she would never permit fanny to lay a trapcame rattling amongst the links of her locketchain her one ring and another trinket or two on the toilettable to nibble a bit of biscuit laid ready for it she looked up recalled momentarily to the real then she said half aloud as if deprecating the accusation of some unseen and unheard monitor i am not cherishing love dreams i am only thinking because i cannot sleep of course i know he will marry shirley  with returning silence with the lull of the chime and the retreat of her small untamed and unknown protégé she still resumed the dream nestling to the visions sidelistening to conversing with it it paled at last as dawn approached the setting stars and breaking day dimmed the creation of fancy the wakened song of birds hushed her whispers the tale full of fire quick with interest borne away by the morning wind became a vague murmur the shape that seen in a moonbeam lived had a pulse had movement wore healths glow and youths freshness turned cold and ghostly gray confronted with the red of sunrise it wasted she was left solitary at last she crept to her couch chill and dejected     chapter xiv  shirley seeks to be saved by works   of course i know he will marry shirley were her first words when she rose in the morning and he ought to marry her she can help him she added firmly but i shall be forgotten when they are married was the cruel succeeding thought oh i shall be wholly forgotten and whatwhat shall i do when robert is taken quite from me where shall i turn my robert i wish i could justly call him mine but i am poverty and incapacity shirley is wealth and power and she is beauty too and love i cannot deny it this is no sordid suit she loves himnot with inferior feelings she loves or will love as he must feel proud to be loved not a valid objection can be made let them be married then but afterwards i shall be nothing to him as for being his sister and all that stuff i despise it i will either be all or nothing to a man like robert no feeble shuffling or false cant is endurable once let that pair be united and i will certainly leave them as for lingering about playing the hypocrite and pretending to calm sentiments of friendship when my soul will be wrung with other feelings i shall not descend to such degradation as little could i fill the place of their mutual friend as that of their deadly foe as little could i stand between them as trample over them robert is a firstrate manin my eyes i have loved do love and must love him i would be his wife if i could as i cannot i must go where i shall never see him there is but one alternativeto cleave to him as if i were a part of him or to be sundered from him wide as the two poles of a spheresunder me then providence part us speedily  some such aspirations as these were again working in her mind late in the afternoon when the apparition of one of the personages haunting her thoughts passed the parlour window miss keeldar sauntered slowly by her gait her countenance wearing that mixture of wistfulness and carelessness which when quiescent was the wonted cast of her look and character of her bearing when animated the carelessness quite vanished the wistfulness became blent with a genial gaiety seasoning the laugh the smile the glance with a unique flavour of sentiment so that mirth from her never resembled the crackling of thorns under a pot  what do you mean by not coming to see me this afternoon as you promised was her address to caroline as she entered the room  i was not in the humour replied miss helstone very truly  shirley had already fixed on her a penetrating eye  no she said i see you are not in the humour for loving me you are in one of your sunless inclement moods when one feels a fellowcreatures presence is not welcome to you you have such moods are you aware of it  do you mean to stay long shirley  yes i am come to have my tea and must have it before i go i shall take the liberty then of removing my bonnet without being asked  and this she did and then stood on the rug with her hands behind her  a pretty expression you have in your countenance she went on still gazing keenly though not inimicallyrather indeed pityinglyat caroline wonderfully selfsupported you look you solitudeseeking wounded deer are you afraid shirley will worry you if she discovers that you are hurt and that you bleed  i never do fear shirley  but sometimes you dislike her often you avoid her shirley can feel when she is slighted and shunned if you had not walked home in the company you did last night you would have been a different girl today what time did you reach the rectory  by ten  humph you took threequarters of an hour to walk a mile was it you or moore who lingered so  shirley you talk nonsense  he talked nonsensethat i doubt not or he looked it which is a thousand times worse i see the reflection of his eyes on your forehead at this moment i feel disposed to call him out if i could only get a trustworthy second i feel desperately irritated i felt so last night and have felt it all day  you dont ask me why she proceeded after a pause you little silent overmodest thing and you dont deserve that i should pour out my secrets into your lap without an invitation upon my word i could have found it in my heart to have dogged moore yesterday evening with dire intent i have pistols and can use them  stuff shirley which would you have shotme or robert  neither perhaps perhaps myselfmore likely a bat or a treebough he is a puppy your cousina quiet serious sensible judicious ambitious puppy i see him standing before me talking his halfstern halfgentle talk bearing me down as i am very conscious he does with his fixity of purpose etc and theni have no patience with him  miss keeldar started off on a rapid walk through the room repeating energetically that she had no patience with men in general and with her tenant in particular  you are mistaken urged caroline in some anxiety robert is no puppy or male flirt i can vouch for that  you vouch for it do you think ill take your word on the subject there is no ones testimony i would not credit sooner than yours to advance moores fortune you would cut off your right hand  but not tell lies and if i speak the truth i must assure you that he was just civil to me last nightthat was all  i never asked what he was i can guess i saw him from the window take your hand in his long fingers just as he went out at my gate  that is nothing i am not a stranger you know i am an old acquaintance and his cousin  i feel indignant and that is the long and short of the matter responded miss keeldar all my comfort she added presently is broken up by his manœuvres he keeps intruding between you and me without him we should be good friends but that six feet of puppyhood makes a perpetuallyrecurring eclipse of our friendship again and again he crosses and obscures the disc i want always to see clear ever and anon he renders me to you a mere bore and nuisance  no shirley no  he does you did not want my society this afternoon and i feel it hard you are naturally somewhat reserved but i am a social personage who cannot live alone if we were but left unmolested i have that regard for you that i could bear you in my presence for ever and not for the fraction of a second do i ever wish to be rid of you you cannot say as much respecting me  shirley i can say anything you wish shirley i like you  you will wish me at jericho tomorrow lina  i shall not i am every day growing more accustomed tofonder of you you know i am too english to get up a vehement friendship all at once but you are so much better than commonyou are so different to everyday young ladiesi esteem you i value you you are never a burden to menever do you believe what i say  partly replied miss keeldar smiling rather incredulously but you are a peculiar personage quiet as you look there is both a force and a depth somewhere within not easily reached or appreciated then you certainly are not happy  and unhappy people are rarely good is that what you mean  not at all i mean rather that unhappy people are often preoccupied and not in the mood for discoursing with companions of my nature moreover there is a sort of unhappiness which not only depresses but corrodes and that i fear is your portion will pity do you any good lina if it will take some from shirley she offers largely and warrants the article genuine  shirley i never had a sisteryou never had a sister but it flashes on me at this moment how sisters feel towards each otheraffection twined with their life which no shocks of feeling can uproot which little quarrels only trample an instant that it may spring more freshly when the pressure is removed affection that no passion can ultimately outrival with which even love itself cannot do more than compete in force and truth love hurts us so shirley it is so tormenting so racking and it burns away our strength with its flame in affection is no pain and no fire only sustenance and balm i am supported and soothed when youthat is you onlyare near shirley do you believe me now  i am always easy of belief when the creed pleases me we really are friends then lina in spite of the black eclipse  we really are returned the other drawing shirley towards her and making her sit down chance what may  come then we will talk of something else than the troubler but at this moment the rector came in and the something else of which miss keeldar was about to talk was not again alluded to till the moment of her departure she then delayed a few minutes in the passage to say caroline i wish to tell you that i have a great weight on my mind my conscience is quite uneasy as if i had committed or was going to commit a crime it is not my private conscience you must understand but my landedproprietor and lordofthemanor conscience i have got into the clutch of an eagle with iron talons i have fallen under a stern influence which i scarcely approve but cannot resist something will be done ere long i fear which it by no means pleases me to think of to ease my mind and to prevent harm as far as i can i mean to enter on a series of good works dont be surprised therefore if you see me all at once turn outrageously charitable i have no idea how to begin but you must give me some advice we will talk more on the subject tomorrow and just ask that excellent person miss ainley to step up to fieldhead i have some notion of putting myself under her tuition wont she have a precious pupil drop a hint to her lina that though a wellmeaning i am rather a neglected character and then she will feel less scandalized at my ignorance about clothing societies and such things  on the morrow caroline found shirley sitting gravely at her desk with an accountbook a bundle of banknotes and a wellfilled purse before her she was looking mighty serious but a little puzzled she said she had been casting an eye over the weekly expenditure in housekeeping at the hall trying to find out where she could retrench that she had also just given audience to mrs gill the cook and had sent that person away with a notion that her shirleys brain was certainly crazed i have lectured her on the duty of being careful said she in a way quite new to her so eloquent was i on the text of economy that i surprised myself for you see it is altogether a fresh idea i never thought much less spoke on the subject till lately but it is all theory for when i came to the practical part i could retrench nothing i had not firmness to take off a single pound of butter or to prosecute to any clear result an inquest into the destiny of either dripping lard bread cold meat or other kitchen perquisite whatever i know we never get up illuminations at fieldhead but i could not ask the meaning of sundry quite unaccountable pounds of candles we do not wash for the parish yet i viewed in silence items of soap and bleachingpowder calculated to satisfy the solicitude of the most anxious inquirer after our position in reference to those articles carnivorous i am not nor is mrs pryor nor is mrs gill herself yet i only hemmed and opened my eyes a little wide when i saw butchers bills whose figures seemed to prove that factfalsehood i mean caroline you may laugh at me but you cant change me i am a poltroon on certain points i feel it there is a base alloy of moral cowardice in my composition i blushed and hung my head before mrs gill when she ought to have been faltering confessions to me i found it impossible to get up the spirit even to hint much less to prove to her that she was a cheat i have no calm dignity no true courage about me  shirley what fit of selfinjustice is this my uncle who is not given to speak well of women says there are not ten thousand men in england as genuinely fearless as you  i am fearless physically i am never nervous about danger i was not startled from selfpossession when mr wynnes great red bull rose with a bellow before my face as i was crossing the cowslip lea alone stooped his begrimed sullen head and made a run at me but i was afraid of seeing mrs gill brought to shame and confusion of face you have twiceten timesmy strength of mind on certain subjects caroline you whom no persuasion can induce to pass a bull however quiet he looks would have firmly shown my housekeeper she had done wrong then you would have gently and wisely admonished her and at last i dare say provided she had seemed penitent you would have very sweetly forgiven her of this conduct i am incapable however in spite of exaggerated imposition i still find we live within our means i have money in hand and i really must do some good with it the briarfield poor are badly off they must be helped what ought i to do think you lina had i not better distribute the cash at once  no indeed shirley you will not manage properly i have often noticed that your only notion of charity is to give shillings and halfcrowns in a careless freehanded sort of way which is liable to continual abuse you must have a prime minister or you will get yourself into a series of scrapes you suggested miss ainley yourself to miss ainley i will apply and meantime promise to keep quiet and not begin throwing away your money what a great deal you have shirley you must feel very rich with all that  yes i feel of consequence it is not an immense sum but i feel responsible for its disposal and really this responsibility weighs on my mind more heavily than i could have expected they say that there are some families almost starving to death in briarfield some of my own cottagers are in wretched circumstances i must and will help them  some people say we shouldnt give alms to the poor shirley  they are great fools for their pains for those who are not hungry it is easy to palaver about the degradation of charity and so on but they forget the brevity of life as well as its bitterness we have none of us long to live let us help each other through seasons of want and woe as well as we can without heeding in the least the scruples of vain philosophy  but you do help others shirley you give a great deal as it is  not enough i must give more or i tell you my brothers blood will some day be crying to heaven against me for after all if political incendiaries come here to kindle conflagration in the neighbourhood and my property is attacked i shall defend it like a tigressi know i shall let me listen to mercy as long as she is near me her voice once drowned by the shout of ruffian defiance and i shall be full of impulses to resist and quell if once the poor gather and rise in the form of the mob i shall turn against them as an aristocrat if they bully me i must defy if they attack i must resist and i will  you talk like robert  i feel like robert only more fierily let them meddle with robert or roberts mill or roberts interests and i shall hate them at present i am no patrician nor do i regard the poor around me as plebeians but if once they violently wrong me or mine and then presume to dictate to us i shall quite forget pity for their wretchedness and respect for their poverty in scorn of their ignorance and wrath at their insolence  shirley how your eyes flash  because my soul burns would you any more than me let robert be borne down by numbers  if i had your power to aid robert i would use it as you mean to use it if i could be such a friend to him as you can be i would stand by him as you mean to stand by him till death  and now lina though your eyes dont flash they glow you drop your lids but i saw a kindled spark however it is not yet come to fighting what i want to do is to prevent mischief i cannot forget either day or night that these embittered feelings of the poor against the rich have been generated in suffering they would neither hate nor envy us if they did not deem us so much happier than themselves to allay this suffering and thereby lessen this hate let me out of my abundance give abundantly and that the donation may go farther let it be made wisely to that intent we must introduce some clear calm practical sense into our councils so go and fetch miss ainley  without another word caroline put on her bonnet and departed it may perhaps appear strange that neither she nor shirley thought of consulting mrs pryor on their scheme but they were wise in abstaining to have consulted herand this they knew by instinctwould only have been to involve her in painful embarrassment she was far better informed better read a deeper thinker than miss ainley but of administrative energy of executive activity she had none she would subscribe her own modest mite to a charitable object willinglysecret almsgiving suited her but in public plans on a large scale she could take no part as to originating them that was out of the question this shirley knew and therefore she did not trouble mrs pryor by unavailing conferences which could only remind her of her own deficiencies and do no good  it was a bright day for miss ainley when she was summoned to fieldhead to deliberate on projects so congenial to her when she was seated with all honour and deference at a table with paper pen ink andwhat was best of allcash before her and requested to draw up a regular plan for administering relief to the destitute poor of briarfield she who knew them all had studied their wants had again and again felt in what way they might best be succoured could the means of succour only be found was fully competent to the undertaking and a meek exultation gladdened her kind heart as she felt herself able to answer clearly and promptly the eager questions put by the two young girls as she showed them in her answers how much and what serviceable knowledge she had acquired of the condition of her fellowcreatures around her  shirley placed at her disposal £300 and at sight of the money miss ainleys eyes filled with joyful tears for she already saw the hungry fed the naked clothed the sick comforted thereby she quickly drew up a simple sensible plan for its expenditure and she assured them brighter times would now come round for she doubted not the lady of fieldheads example would be followed by others she should try to get additional subscriptions and to form a fund but first she must consult the clergy yes on that point she was peremptory mr helstone dr boultby mr hall must be consulted for not only must briarfield be relieved but whinbury and nunnely it would she averred be presumption in her to take a single step unauthorized by them  the clergy were sacred beings in miss ainleys eyes no matter what might be the insignificance of the individual his station made him holy the very curateswho in their trivial arrogance were hardly worthy to tie her pattenstrings or carry her cotton umbrella or check woollen shawlshe in her pure sincere enthusiasm looked upon as sucking saints no matter how clearly their little vices and enormous absurdities were pointed out to her she could not see them she was blind to ecclesiastical defects the white surplice covered a multitude of sins  shirley knowing this harmless infatuation on the part of her recentlychosen prime minister stipulated expressly that the curates were to have no voice in the disposal of the money that their meddling fingers were not to be inserted into the pie the rectors of course must be paramount and they might be trusted they had some experience some sagacity and mr hall at least had sympathy and lovingkindness for his fellowmen but as for the youth under them they must be set aside kept down and taught that subordination and silence best became their years and capacity  it was with some horror miss ainley heard this language caroline however interposing with a mild word or two in praise of mr sweeting calmed her again sweeting was indeed her own favourite she endeavoured to respect messrs malone and donne but the slices of spongecake and glasses of cowslip or primrose wine she had at different times administered to sweeting when he came to see her in her little cottage were ever offered with sentiments of truly motherly regard the same innocuous collation she had once presented to malone but that personage evinced such open scorn of the offering she had never ventured to renew it to donne she always served the treat and was happy to see his approbation of it proved beyond a doubt by the fact of his usually eating two pieces of cake and putting a third in his pocket  indefatigable in her exertions where good was to be done miss ainley would immediately have set out on a walk of ten miles round to the three rectors in order to show her plan and humbly solicit their approval but miss keeldar interdicted this and proposed as an amendment to collect the clergy in a small select reunion that evening at fieldhead miss ainley was to meet them and the plan was to be discussed in full privy council  shirley managed to get the senior priesthood together accordingly and before the old maids arrival she had further talked all the gentlemen into the most charming mood imaginable she herself had taken in hand dr boultby and mr helstone the first was a stubborn old welshman hot opinionated and obstinate but withal a man who did a great deal of good though not without making some noise about it the latter we know she had rather a friendly feeling for both especially for old helstone and it cost her no trouble to be quite delightful to them she took them round the garden she gathered them flowers she was like a kind daughter to them mr hall she left to carolineor rather it was to carolines care mr hall consigned himself  he generally sought caroline in every party where she and he happened to be he was not in general a ladys man though all ladies liked him something of a bookworm he was nearsighted spectacled now and then abstracted to old ladies he was kind as a son to men of every occupation and grade he was acceptable the truth simplicity frankness of his manners the nobleness of his integrity the reality and elevation of his piety won him friends in every grade his poor clerk and sexton delighted in him the noble patron of his living esteemed him highly it was only with young handsome fashionable and stylish ladies he felt a little shy being himself a plain manplain in aspect plain in manners plain in speechhe seemed to fear their dash elegance and airs but miss helstone had neither dash nor airs and her native elegance was of a very quiet orderquiet as the beauty of a groundloving hedgeflower he was a fluent cheerful agreeable talker caroline could talk too in a têteàtête she liked mr hall to come and take the seat next her in a party and thus secure her from peter augustus malone joseph donne or john sykes and mr hall never failed to avail himself of this privilege when he possibly could such preference shown by a single gentleman to a single lady would certainly in ordinary cases have set in motion the tongues of the gossips but cyril hall was fortyfive years old slightly bald and slightly gray and nobody ever said or thought he was likely to be married to miss helstone nor did he think so himself he was wedded already to his books and his parish his kind sister margaret spectacled and learned like himself made him happy in his single state he considered it too late to change besides he had known caroline as a pretty little girl she had sat on his knee many a time he had bought her toys and given her books he felt that her friendship for him was mixed with a sort of filial respect he could not have brought himself to attempt to give another colour to her sentiments and his serene mind could glass a fair image without feeling its depths troubled by the reflection  when miss ainley arrived she was made kindly welcome by every one mrs pryor and margaret hall made room for her on the sofa between them and when the three were seated they formed a trio which the gay and thoughtless would have scorned indeed as quite worthless and unattractivea middleaged widow and two plain spectacled old maidsyet which had its own quiet value as many a suffering and friendless human being knew  shirley opened the business and showed the plan  i know the hand which drew up that said mr hall glancing at miss ainley and smiling benignantly his approbation was won at once boultby heard and deliberated with bent brow and protruded under lip his consent he considered too weighty to be given in a hurry helstone glanced sharply round with an alert suspicious expression as if he apprehended that female craft was at work and that something in petticoats was somehow trying underhand to acquire too much influence and make itself of too much importance shirley caught and comprehended the expression this scheme is nothing said she carelessly it is only an outlinea mere suggestion you gentlemen are requested to draw up rules of your own  and she directly fetched her writingcase smiling queerly to herself as she bent over the table where it stood she produced a sheet of paper a new pen drew an armchair to the table and presenting her hand to old helstone begged permission to install him in it for a minute he was a little stiff and stood wrinkling his coppercoloured forehead strangely at last he muttered well you are neither my wife nor my daughter so ill be led for once but mindi know i am led your little female manœuvres dont blind me  oh said shirley dipping the pen in the ink and putting it into his hand you must regard me as captain keeldar today this is quite a gentlemans affairyours and mine entirely doctor so she had dubbed the rector the ladies there are only to be our aidesdecamp and at their peril they speak till we have settled the whole business  he smiled a little grimly and began to write he soon interrupted himself to ask questions and consult his brethren disdainfully lifting his glance over the curly heads of the two girls and the demure caps of the elder ladies to meet the winking glasses and gray pates of the priests in the discussion which ensued all three gentlemen to their infinite credit showed a thorough acquaintance with the poor of their parishesan even minute knowledge of their separate wants each rector knew where clothing was needed where food would be most acceptable where money could be bestowed with a probability of it being judiciously laid out wherever their memories fell short miss ainley or miss hall if applied to could help them out but both ladies took care not to speak unless spoken to neither of them wanted to be foremost but each sincerely desired to be useful and useful the clergy consented to make themwith which boon they were content  shirley stood behind the rectors leaning over their shoulders now and then to glance at the rules drawn up and the list of cases making out listening to all they said and still at intervals smiling her queer smilea smile not illnatured but significanttoo significant to be generally thought amiable men rarely like such of their fellows as read their inward nature too clearly and truly it is good for women especially to be endowed with a soft blindness to have mild dim eyes that never penetrate below the surface of thingsthat take all for what it seems thousands knowing this keep their eyelids drooped on system but the most downcast glance has its loophole through which it can on occasion take its sentinelsurvey of life i remember once seeing a pair of blue eyes that were usually thought sleepy secretly on the alert and i knew by their expressionan expression which chilled my blood it was in that quarter so wondrously unexpectedthat for years they had been accustomed to silent soulreading the world called the owner of these blue eyes bonne petite femme she was not an englishwoman i learned her nature afterwardsgot it off by heartstudied it in its farthest most hidden recesses she was the finest deepest subtlest schemer in europe  when all was at length settled to miss keeldars mind and the clergy had entered so fully into the spirit of her plans as to head the subscriptionlist with their signatures for £50 each she ordered supper to be served having previously directed mrs gill to exercise her utmost skill in the preparation of this repast mr hall was no bon vivanthe was naturally an abstemious man indifferent to luxury but boultby and helstone both liked good cookery the recherché supper consequently put them into excellent humour they did justice to it though in a gentlemanly waynot in the mode mr donne would have done had he been present a glass of fine wine was likewise tasted with discerning though most decorous relish captain keeldar was complimented on his taste the compliment charmed him it had been his aim to gratify and satisfy his priestly guests he had succeeded and was radiant with glee     chapter xv  mr donnes exodus   the next day shirley expressed to caroline how delighted she felt that the little party had gone off so well  i rather like to entertain a circle of gentlemen said she it is amusing to observe how they enjoy a judiciously concocted repast for ourselves you see these choice wines and these scientific dishes are of no importance to us but gentlemen seem to retain something of the naïveté of children about food and one likes to please themthat is when they show the becoming decent selfgovernment of our admirable rectors i watch moore sometimes to try and discover how he can be pleased but he has not that childs simplicity about him did you ever find out his accessible point caroline you have seen more of him than i  it is not at any rate that of my uncle and dr boultby returned caroline smiling she always felt a sort of shy pleasure in following miss keeldars lead respecting the discussion of her cousins character left to herself she would never have touched on the subject but when invited the temptation of talking about him of whom she was ever thinking was irresistible but she added i really dont know what it is for i never watched robert in my life but my scrutiny was presently baffled by finding he was watching me  there it is exclaimed shirley you cant fix your eyes on him but his presently flash on you he is never off his guard he wont give you an advantage even when he does not look at you his thoughts seem to be busy amongst your own thoughts tracing your words and actions to their source contemplating your motives at his ease oh i know that sort of character or something in the same style it is one that piques me singularly how does it affect you  this question was a specimen of one of shirleys sharp sudden turns caroline used to be fluttered by them at first but she had now got into the way of parrying these homethrusts like a little quakeress  pique you in what way does it pique you she said  here he comes suddenly exclaimed shirley breaking off starting up and running to the window here comes a diversion i never told you of a superb conquest i have made latelymade at those parties to which i can never persuade you to accompany me and the thing has been done without effort or intention on my partthat i aver there is the belland by all thats delicious there are two of them do they never hunt then except in couples you may have one lina and you may take your choice i hope i am generous enough listen to tartar  the blackmuzzled tawny dog a glimpse of which was seen in the chapter which first introduced its mistress to the reader here gave tongue in the hall amidst whose hollow space the deep bark resounded formidably a growl more terrible than the bark menacing as muttered thunder succeeded  listen again cried shirley laughing you would think that the prelude to a bloody onslaught they will be frightened they dont know old tartar as i do they are not aware his uproars are all sound and fury signifying nothing  some bustle was heard down sir down exclaimed a hightoned imperious voice and then came a crack of a cane or whip immediately there was a yella scuttera runa positive tumult  o malone malone  down down down cried the high voice  he really is worrying them exclaimed shirley they have struck him a blow is what he is not used to and will not take  out she ran a gentleman was fleeing up the oak staircase making for refuge in the gallery or chambers in hot haste another was backing fast to the stairfoot wildly flourishing a knotty stick at the same time reiterating down down down while the tawny dog bayed bellowed howled at him and a group of servants came bundling from the kitchen the dog made a spring the second gentleman turned tail and rushed after his comrade the first was already safe in a bedroom he held the door against his fellownothing so merciless as terror but the other fugitive struggled hard the door was about to yield to his strength  gentlemen was uttered in miss keeldars silvery but vibrating tones spare my locks if you please calm yourselves come down look at tartar he wont harm a cat  she was caressing the said tartar he lay crouched at her feet his fore paws stretched out his tail still in threatening agitation his nostrils snorting his bulldog eyes conscious of a dull fire he was an honest phlegmatic stupid but stubborn canine character he loved his mistress and johnthe man who fed himbut was mostly indifferent to the rest of the world quiet enough he was unless struck or threatened with a stick and that put a demon into him at once  mr malone how do you do continued shirley lifting up her mirthlit face to the gallery that is not the way to the oak parlour that is mrs pryors apartment request your friend mr donne to evacuate i shall have the greatest pleasure in receiving him in a lower room  ha ha cried malone in hollow laughter quitting the door and leaning over the massive balustrade really that animal alarmed donne he is a little timid he proceeded stiffening himself and walking trimly to the stairhead i thought it better to follow in order to reassure him  it appears you did well come down if you pleasejohn turning to her manservant go upstairs and liberate mr donnetake care mr malone the stairs are slippery  in truth they were being of polished oak the caution came a little late for malone he had slipped already in his stately descent and was only saved from falling by a clutch at the banisters which made the whole structure creak again  tartar seemed to think the visitors descent effected with unwarranted éclat and accordingly he growled once more malone however was no coward the spring of the dog had taken him by surprise but he passed him now in suppressed fury rather than fear if a look could have strangled tartar he would have breathed no more forgetting politeness in his sullen rage malone pushed into the parlour before miss keeldar he glanced at miss helstone he could scarcely bring himself to bend to her he glared on both the ladies he looked as if had either of them been his wife he would have made a glorious husband at the moment in each hand he seemed as if he would have liked to clutch one and gripe her to death  however shirley took pity she ceased to laugh and caroline was too true a lady to smile even at any one under mortification tartar was dismissed peter augustus was soothedfor shirley had looks and tones that might soothe a very bull he had sense to feel that since he could not challenge the owner of the dog he had better be civil and civil he tried to be and his attempts being well received he grew presently very civil and quite himself again he had come indeed for the express purpose of making himself charming and fascinating rough portents had met him on his first admission to fieldhead but that passage got over charming and fascinating he resolved to be like march having come in like a lion he purposed to go out like a lamb  for the sake of air as it appeared or perhaps for that of ready exit in case of some new emergency arising he took his seatnot on the sofa where miss keeldar offered him enthronization nor yet near the fireside to which caroline by a friendly sign gently invited him but on a chair close to the door being no longer sullen or furious he grew after his fashion constrained and embarrassed he talked to the ladies by fits and starts choosing for topics whatever was most intensely commonplace he sighed deeply significantly at the close of every sentence he sighed in each pause he sighed ere he opened his mouth at last finding it desirable to add ease to his other charms he drew forth to aid him an ample silk pockethandkerchief this was to be the graceful toy with which his unoccupied hands were to trifle he went to work with a certain energy he folded the redandyellow square cornerwise he whipped it open with a waft again he folded it in narrower compass he made of it a handsome band to what purpose would he proceed to apply the ligature would he wrap it about his throathis head should it be a comforter or a turban neither peter augustus had an inventive an original genius he was about to show the ladies graces of action possessing at least the charm of novelty he sat on the chair with his athletic irish legs crossed and these legs in that attitude he circled with the bandana and bound firmly together it was evident he felt this device to be worth an encore he repeated it more than once the second performance sent shirley to the window to laugh her silent but irrepressible laugh unseen it turned carolines head aside that her long curls might screen the smile mantling on her features miss helstone indeed was amused by more than one point in peters demeanour she was edified at the complete though abrupt diversion of his homage from herself to the heiress the £5000 he supposed her likely one day to inherit were not to be weighed in the balance against miss keeldars estate and hall he took no pains to conceal his calculations and tactics he pretended to no gradual change of views he wheeled about at once the pursuit of the lesser fortune was openly relinquished for that of the greater on what grounds he expected to succeed in his chase himself best knew certainly not by skilful management  from the length of time that elapsed it appeared that john had some difficulty in persuading mr donne to descend at length however that gentleman appeared nor as he presented himself at the oakparlour door did he seem in the slightest degree ashamed or confusednot a whit donne indeed was of that coldly phlegmatic immovably complacent densely selfsatisfied nature which is insensible to shame he had never blushed in his life no humiliation could abash him his nerves were not capable of sensation enough to stir his life and make colour mount to his cheek he had no fire in his blood and no modesty in his soul he was a frontless arrogant decorous slip of the commonplaceconceited inane insipid and this gentleman had a notion of wooing miss keeldar he knew no more however how to set about the business than if he had been an image carved in wood he had no idea of a taste to be pleased a heart to be reached in courtship his notion was when he should have formally visited her a few times to write a letter proposing marriage then he calculated she would accept him for love of his office then they would be married then he should be master of fieldhead and he should live very comfortably have servants at his command eat and drink of the best and be a great man you would not have suspected his intentions when he addressed his intended bride in an impertinent injured tonea very dangerous dog that miss keeldar i wonder you should keep such an animal  do you mr donne perhaps you will wonder more when i tell you i am very fond of him  i should say you are not serious in the assertion cant fancy a lady fond of that brutetis so uglya mere carters dog pray hang him  hang what i am fond of  and purchase in his stead some sweetly pooty pug or poodlesomething appropriate to the fair sex ladies generally like lapdogs  perhaps i am an exception  oh you cant be you know all ladies are alike in those matters that is universally allowed  tartar frightened you terribly mr donne i hope you wont take any harm  that i shall no doubt he gave me a turn i shall not soon forget when i sor him such was mr donnes pronunciation about to spring i thought i should have fainted  perhaps you did faint in the bedroom you were a long time there  no i bore up that i might hold the door fast i was determined not to let any one enter i thought i would keep a barrier between me and the enemy  but what if your friend mr malone had been worried  malone must take care of himself your man persuaded me to come out at last by saying the dog was chained up in his kennel if i had not been assured of this i would have remained all day in the chamber but what is that i declare the man has told a falsehood the dog is there  and indeed tartar walked past the glass door opening to the garden stiff tawny and blackmuzzled as ever he still seemed in bad humour he was growling again and whistling a halfstrangled whistle being an inheritance from the bulldog side of his ancestry  there are other visitors coming observed shirley with that provoking coolness which the owners of formidablelooking dogs are apt to show while their animals are all bristle and bay tartar sprang down the pavement towards the gate bellowing avec explosion his mistress quietly opened the glass door and stepped out chirruping to him his bellow was already silenced and he was lifting up his huge blunt stupid head to the new callers to be patted  what tartar tartar said a cheery rather boyish voice dont you know us goodmorning old boy  and little mr sweeting whose conscious good nature made him comparatively fearless of man woman child or brute came through the gate caressing the guardian his vicar mr hall followed he had no fear of tartar either and tartar had no illwill to him he snuffed both the gentlemen round and then as if concluding that they were harmless and might be allowed to pass he withdrew to the sunny front of the hall leaving the archway free mr sweeting followed and would have played with him but tartar took no notice of his caresses it was only his mistresss hand whose touch gave him pleasure to all others he showed himself obstinately insensible  shirley advanced to meet messrs hall and sweeting shaking hands with them cordially they were come to tell her of certain successes they had achieved that morning in applications for subscriptions to the fund mr halls eyes beamed benignantly through his spectacles his plain face looked positively handsome with goodness and when caroline seeing who was come ran out to meet him and put both her hands into his he gazed down on her with a gentle serene affectionate expression that gave him the aspect of a smiling melanchthon  instead of reentering the house they strayed through the garden the ladies walking one on each side of mr hall it was a breezy sunny day the air freshened the girls cheeks and gracefully dishevelled their ringlets both of them looked prettyone gay mr hall spoke oftenest to his brilliant companion looked most frequently at the quiet one miss keeldar gathered handfuls of the profusely blooming flowers whose perfume filled the enclosure she gave some to caroline telling her to choose a nosegay for mr hall and with her lap filled with delicate and splendid blossoms caroline sat down on the steps of a summerhouse the vicar stood near her leaning on his cane  shirley who could not be inhospitable now called out the neglected pair in the oak parlour she convoyed donne past his dread enemy tartar who with his nose on his fore paws lay snoring under the meridian sun donne was not gratefulhe never was grateful for kindness and attentionbut he was glad of the safeguard miss keeldar desirous of being impartial offered the curates flowers they accepted them with native awkwardness malone seemed specially at a loss when a bouquet filled one hand while his shillelah occupied the other donnes thank you was rich to hear it was the most fatuous and arrogant of sounds implying that he considered this offering a homage to his merits and an attempt on the part of the heiress to ingratiate herself into his priceless affections sweeting alone received the posy like a smart sensible little man as he was putting it gallantly and nattily into his buttonhole  as a reward for his good manners miss keeldar beckoning him apart gave him some commission which made his eyes sparkle with glee away he flew round by the courtyard to the kitchen no need to give him directions he was always at home everywhere ere long he reappeared carrying a round table which he placed under the cedar then he collected six gardenchairs from various nooks and bowers in the grounds and placed them in a circle the parlourmaidmiss keeldar kept no footmancame out bearing a napkincovered tray sweetings nimble fingers aided in disposing glasses plates knives and forks he assisted her too in setting forth a neat luncheon consisting of cold chicken ham and tarts  this sort of impromptu regale it was shirleys delight to offer any chance guests and nothing pleased her better than to have an alert obliging little friend like sweeting to run about her hand cheerily receive and briskly execute her hospitable hints david and she were on the best terms in the world and his devotion to the heiress was quite disinterested since it prejudiced in nothing his faithful allegiance to the magnificent dora sykes  the repast turned out a very merry one donne and malone indeed contributed but little to its vivacity the chief part they played in it being what concerned the knife fork and wineglass but where four such natures as mr hall david sweeting shirley and caroline were assembled in health and amity on a green lawn under a sunny sky amidst a wilderness of flowers there could not be ungenial dullness  in the course of conversation mr hall reminded the ladies that whitsuntide was approaching when the grand united sundayschool teadrinking and procession of the three parishes of briarfield whinbury and nunnely were to take place caroline he knew would be at her post as teacher he said and he hoped miss keeldar would not be wanting he hoped she would make her first public appearance amongst them at that time shirley was not the person to miss an occasion of this sort she liked festive excitement a gathering of happiness a concentration and combination of pleasant details a throng of glad faces a muster of elated hearts she told mr hall they might count on her with security she did not know what she would have to do but they might dispose of her as they pleased  and said caroline you will promise to come to my table and to sit near me mr hall  i shall not fail deo volente said hei have occupied the place on her right hand at these monster teadrinkings for the last six years he proceeded turning to miss keeldar they made her a sundayschool teacher when she was a little girl of twelve she is not particularly selfconfident by nature as you may have observed and the first time she had to take a tray as the phrase is and make tea in public there was some piteous trembling and flushing i observed the speechless panic the cups shaking in the little hand and the overflowing teapot filled too full from the urn i came to her aid took a seat near her managed the urn and the slopbasin and in fact made the tea for her like any old woman  i was very grateful to you interposed caroline  you were you told me so with an earnest sincerity that repaid me well inasmuch as it was not like the majority of little ladies of twelve whom you may help and caress for ever without their evincing any quicker sense of the kindness done and meant than if they were made of wax and wood instead of flesh and nervesshe kept close to me miss keeldar the rest of the evening walking with me over the grounds where the children were playing she followed me into the vestry when all were summoned into church she would i believe have mounted with me to the pulpit had i not taken the previous precaution of conducting her to the rectory pew  and he has been my friend ever since said caroline  and always sat at her table near her tray and handed the cupsthat is the extent of my services the next thing i do for her will be to marry her some day to some curate or millownerbut mind caroline i shall inquire about the bridegrooms character and if he is not a gentleman likely to render happy the little girl who walked with me hand in hand over nunnely common i will not officiate so take care  the caution is useless i am not going to be married i shall live single like your sister margaret mr hall  very well you might do worse margaret is not unhappy she has her books for a pleasure and her brother for a care and is content if ever you want a home if the day should come when briarfield rectory is yours no longer come to nunnely vicarage should the old maid and bachelor be still living they will make you tenderly welcome  there are your flowers now said caroline who had kept the nosegay she had selected for him till this moment you dont care for a bouquet but you must give it to margaret onlyto be sentimental for oncekeep that little forgetmenot which is a wild flower i gathered from the grass andto be still more sentimentallet me take two or three of the blue blossoms and put them in my souvenir  and she took out a small book with enamelled cover and silver clasp wherein having opened it she inserted the flowers writing round them in pencil to be kept for the sake of the rev cyril hall my friend may  18  the rev cyril hall on his part also placed a sprig in safety between the leaves of a pocket testament he only wrote on the margin caroline  now said he smiling i trust we are romantic enough miss keeldar he continued the curates bythebye during this conversation were too much occupied with their own jokes to notice what passed at the other end of the table i hope you are laughing at this trait of exaltation in the old grayheaded vicar but the fact is i am so used to comply with the requests of this young friend of yours i dont know how to refuse her when she tells me to do anything you would say it is not much in my way to traffic with flowers and forgetmenots but you see when requested to be sentimental i am obedient  he is naturally rather sentimental remarked caroline margaret told me so and i know what pleases him  that you should be good and happy yes that is one of my greatest pleasures may god long preserve to you the blessings of peace and innocence by which phrase i mean comparative innocence for in his sight i am well aware none are pure what to our human perceptions looks spotless as we fancy angels is to him but frailty needing the blood of his son to cleanse and the strength of his spirit to sustain let us each and all cherish humilityi as you my young friends and we may well do it when we look into our own hearts and see there temptations inconsistencies propensities even we blush to recognize and it is not youth nor good looks nor grace nor any gentle outside charm which makes either beauty or goodness in gods eyesyoung ladies when your mirror or mens tongues flatter you remember that in the sight of her maker mary ann ainleya woman whom neither glass nor lips have ever panegyrizedis fairer and better than either of you she is indeed he added after a pauseshe is indeed you young things wrapt up in yourselves and in earthly hopes scarcely live as christ lived perhaps you cannot do it yet while existence is so sweet and earth so smiling to you it would be too much to expect she with meek heart and due reverence treads close in her redeemers steps  here the harsh voice of donne broke in on the mild tones of mr hall ahem he began clearing his throat evidently for a speech of some importanceahem miss keeldar your attention an instant if you please  well said shirley nonchalantly what is it i listen all of me is ear that is not eye  i hope part of you is hand also returned donne in his vulgarly presumptuous and familiar style and part purse it is to the hand and purse i propose to appeal i came here this morning with a view to beg of you  you should have gone to mrs gill she is my almoner  to beg of you a subscription to a school i and dr boultby intend to erect one in the hamlet of ecclefigg which is under our vicarage of whinbury the baptists have got possession of it they have a chapel there and we want to dispute the ground  but i have nothing to do with ecclefigg i possess no property there  what does that signify youre a churchwoman aint you  admirable creature muttered shirley under her breath exquisite address fine style what raptures he excites in me then aloud i am a churchwoman certainly  then you cant refuse to contribute in this case the population of ecclefigg are a parcel of brutes we want to civilize them  who is to be the missionary  myself probably  you wont fail through lack of sympathy with your flock  i hope noti expect success but we must have money there is the paper pray give a handsome sum  when asked for money shirley rarely held back she put down her name for £5 after the £300 she had lately given and the many smaller sums she was giving constantly it was as much as she could at present afford donne looked at it declared the subscription shabby and clamorously demanded more miss keeldar flushed up with some indignation and more astonishment  at present i shall give no more said she  not give more why i expected you to head the list with a cool hundred with your property you should never put down a signature for less  she was silent  in the south went on donne a lady with a thousand a year would be ashamed to give five pounds for a public object  shirley so rarely haughty looked so now her slight frame became nerved her distinguished face quickened with scorn  strange remarks said shemost inconsiderate reproach in return for bounty is misplaced  bounty do you call five pounds bounty  i do and bounty which had i not given it to dr boultbys intended school of the erection of which i approve and in no sort to his curate who seems illadvised in his manner of applying for or rather extorting subscriptionsbounty i repeat which but for this consideration i should instantly reclaim  donne was thickskinned he did not feel all or half that the tone air glance of the speaker expressed he knew not on what ground he stood  wretched place this yorkshire he went on i could never have formed an idear of the country had i not seen it and the peoplerich and poorwhat a set how corse and uncultivated they would be scouted in the south  shirley leaned forwards on the table her nostrils dilating a little her taper fingers interlaced and compressing each other hard  the rich pursued the infatuated and unconscious donne are a parcel of misers never living as persons with their incomes ought to live you scarsleyyou must excuse mr donnes pronunciation reader it was very choice he considered it genteel and prided himself on his southern accent northern ears received with singular sensations his utterance of certain wordsyou scarsley ever see a famly where a propa carriage or a regla butla is kep and as to the poorjust look at them when they come crowding about the church doors on the occasion of a marriage or a funeral clattering in clogs the men in their shirtsleeves and woolcombers aprons the women in mobcaps and bedgowns they positively deserve that one should turn a mad cow in amongst them to rout their rabbleranks hehe what fun it would be  there you have reached the climax said shirley quietly you have reached the climax she repeated turning her glowing glance towards him you cannot go beyond it and she added with emphasis you shall not in my house  up she rosenobody could control her now for she was exasperatedstraight she walked to her garden gates wide she flung them open  walk through she said austerely and pretty quickly and set foot on this pavement no more  donne was astounded he had thought all the time he was showing himself off to high advantage as a loftysouled person of the first ton he imagined he was producing a crushing impression had he not expressed disdain of everything in yorkshire what more conclusive proof could be given that he was better than anything there and yet here was he about to be turned like a dog out of a yorkshire garden where under such circumstances was the concatenation accordingly  rid me of you instantlyinstantly reiterated shirley as he lingered  madama clergyman turn out a clergyman  off were you an archbishop you have proved yourself no gentleman and must go quick  she was quite resolved there was no trifling with her besides tartar was again rising he perceived symptoms of a commotion he manifested a disposition to join in there was evidently nothing for it but to go and donne made his exodus the heiress sweeping him a deep curtsy as she closed the gates on him  how dare the pompous priest abuse his flock how dare the lisping cockney revile yorkshire was her sole observation on the circumstance as she returned to the table  ere long the little party broke up miss keeldars ruffled and darkened brow curled lip and incensed eye gave no invitation to further social enjoyment     chapter xvi  whitsuntide   the fund prospered by dint of miss keeldars example the three rectors vigorous exertions and the efficient though quiet aid of their spinster and spectacled lieutenants mary ann ainley and margaret hall a handsome sum was raised and this being judiciously managed served for the present greatly to alleviate the distress of the unemployed poor the neighbourhood seemed to grow calmer for a fortnight past no cloth had been destroyed no outrage on mill or mansion had been committed in the three parishes shirley was sanguine that the evil she wished to avert was almost escaped that the threatened storm was passing over with the approach of summer she felt certain that trade would improveit always did and then this weary war could not last for ever peace must return one day with peace what an impulse would be given to commerce  such was the usual tenor of her observations to her tenant gérard moore whenever she met him where they could converse and moore would listen very quietlytoo quietly to satisfy her she would then by her impatient glance demand something more from himsome explanation or at least some additional remark smiling in his way with that expression which gave a remarkable cast of sweetness to his mouth while his brow remained grave he would answer to the effect that himself too trusted in the finite nature of the war that it was indeed on that ground the anchor of his hopes was fixed thereon his speculations depended for you are aware he would continue that i now work hollows mill entirely on speculation i sell nothing there is no market for my goods i manufacture for a future day i make myself ready to take advantage of the first opening that shall occur three months ago this was impossible to me i had exhausted both credit and capital you well know who came to my rescue from what hand i received the loan which saved me it is on the strength of that loan i am enabled to continue the bold game which a while since i feared i should never play more total ruin i know will follow loss and i am aware that gain is doubtful but i am quite cheerful so long as i can be active so long as i can strive so long in short as my hands are not tied it is impossible for me to be depressed one yearnay but six monthsof the reign of the olive and i am safe for as you say peace will give an impulse to commerce in this you are right but as to the restored tranquillity of the neighbourhood as to the permanent good effect of your charitable fund i doubt eleemosynary relief never yet tranquillized the workingclassesit never made them grateful it is not in human nature that it should i suppose were all things ordered aright they ought not to be in a position to need that humiliating relief and this they feel we should feel it were we so placed besides to whom should they be grateful to you to the clergy perhaps but not to us millowners they hate us worse than ever then the disaffected here are in correspondence with the disaffected elsewhere nottingham is one of their headquarters manchester another birmingham a third the subalterns receive orders from their chiefs they are in a good state of discipline no blow is struck without mature deliberation in sultry weather you have seen the sky threaten thunder day by day and yet night after night the clouds have cleared and the sun has set quietly but the danger was not goneit was only delayed the longthreatening storm is sure to break at last there is analogy between the moral and physical atmosphere  well mr moore so these conferences always ended take care of yourself if you think that i have ever done you any good reward me by promising to take care of yourself  i do i will take close and watchful care i wish to live not to die the future opens like eden before me and still when i look deep into the shades of my paradise i see a vision that i like better than seraph or cherub glide across remote vistas  do you pray what vision  i see  the maid came bustling in with the teathings  the early part of that may as we have seen was fine the middle was wet but in the last week at change of moon it cleared again a fresh wind swept off the silverwhite deeppiled rainclouds bearing them mass on mass to the eastern horizon on whose verge they dwindled and behind whose rim they disappeared leaving the vault behind all pure blue space ready for the reign of the summer sun that sun rose broad on whitsuntide the gathering of the schools was signalized by splendid weather  whittuesday was the great day in preparation for which the two large schoolrooms of briarfield built by the present rector chiefly at his own expense were cleaned out whitewashed repainted and decorated with flowers and evergreenssome from the rectory garden two cartloads from fieldhead and a wheelbarrowful from the more stingy domain of de walden the residence of mr wynne in these schoolrooms twenty tables each calculated to accommodate twenty guests were laid out surrounded with benches and covered with white cloths above them were suspended at least some twenty cages containing as many canaries according to a fancy of the district specially cherished by mr helstones clerk who delighted in the piercing song of these birds and knew that amidst confusion of tongues they always carolled loudest these tables be it understood were not spread for the twelve hundred scholars to be assembled from the three parishes but only for the patrons and teachers of the schools the childrens feast was to be spread in the open air at one oclock the troops were to come in at two they were to be marshalled till four they were to parade the parish then came the feast and afterwards the meeting with music and speechifying in the church  why briarfield was chosen for the point of rendezvousthe scene of the fêteshould be explained it was not because it was the largest or most populous parishwhinbury far outdid it in that respect nor because it was the oldest antique as were the hoary church and rectorynunnelys lowroofed temple and mossy parsonage buried both in coeval oaks outstanding sentinels of nunnwood were older still it was simply because mr helstone willed it so and mr helstones will was stronger than that of boultby or hall the former could not the latter would not dispute a point of precedence with their resolute and imperious brother they let him lead and rule  this notable anniversary had always hitherto been a trying day to caroline helstone because it dragged her perforce into public compelling her to face all that was wealthy respectable influential in the neighbourhood in whose presence but for the kind countenance of mr hall she would have appeared unsupported obliged to be conspicuous obliged to walk at the head of her regiment as the rectors niece and first teacher of the first class obliged to make tea at the first table for a mixed multitude of ladies and gentlemen and to do all this without the countenance of mother aunt or other chaperonshe meantime being a nervous person who mortally feared publicityit will be comprehended that under these circumstances she trembled at the approach of whitsuntide  but this year shirley was to be with her and that changed the aspect of the trial singularlyit changed it utterly it was a trial no longerit was almost an enjoyment miss keeldar was better in her single self than a host of ordinary friends quite selfpossessed and always spirited and easy conscious of her social importance yet never presuming upon itit would be enough to give one courage only to look at her the only fear was lest the heiress should not be punctual to tryst she often had a careless way of lingering behind time and caroline knew her uncle would not wait a second for any one at the moment of the church clock tolling two the bells would clash out and the march begin she must look after shirley then in this matter or her expected companion would fail her  whittuesday saw her rise almost with the sun she fanny and eliza were busy the whole morning arranging the rectory parlours in firstrate company order and setting out a collation of cooling refreshmentswine fruit cakeson the diningroom sideboard then she had to dress in her freshest and fairest attire of white muslin the perfect fineness of the day and the solemnity of the occasion warranted and even exacted such costume her new sasha birthday present from margaret hall which she had reason to believe cyril himself had bought and in return for which she had indeed given him a set of cambric bands in a handsome casewas tied by the dexterous fingers of fanny who took no little pleasure in arraying her fair young mistress for the occasion her simple bonnet had been trimmed to correspond with her sash her pretty but inexpensive scarf of white crape suited her dress when ready she formed a picture not bright enough to dazzle but fair enough to interest not brilliantly striking but very delicately pleasinga picture in which sweetness of tint purity of air and grace of mien atoned for the absence of rich colouring and magnificent contour what her brown eye and clear forehead showed of her mind was in keeping with her dress and facemodest gentle and though pensive harmonious it appeared that neither lamb nor dove need fear her but would welcome rather in her look of simplicity and softness a sympathy with their own natures or with the natures we ascribe to them  after all she was an imperfect faulty human being fair enough of form hue and array but as cyril hall said neither so good nor so great as the withered miss ainley now putting on her best black gown and quaker drab shawl and bonnet in her own narrow cottage chamber  away caroline went across some very sequestered fields and through some quite hidden lanes to fieldhead she glided quickly under the green hedges and across the greener leas there was no dust no moisture to soil the hem of her stainless garment or to damp her slender sandal after the late rains all was clean and under the present glowing sun all was dry she walked fearlessly then on daisy and turf and through thick plantations she reached fieldhead and penetrated to miss keeldars dressingroom  it was well she had come or shirley would have been too late instead of making ready with all speed she lay stretched on a couch absorbed in reading mrs pryor stood near vainly urging her to rise and dress caroline wasted no words she immediately took the book from her and with her own hands commenced the business of disrobing and rerobing her shirley indolent with the heat and gay with her youth and pleasurable nature wanted to talk laugh and linger but caroline intent on being in time persevered in dressing her as fast as fingers could fasten strings or insert pins at length as she united a final row of hooks and eyes she found leisure to chide her saying she was very naughty to be so unpunctual that she looked even now the picture of incorrigible carelessness and so shirley did but a very lovely picture of that tiresome quality  she presented quite a contrast to caroline there was style in every fold of her dress and every line of her figure the rich silk suited her better than a simpler costume the deep embroidered scarf became her she wore it negligently but gracefully the wreath on her bonnet crowned her well the attention to fashion the tasteful appliance of ornament in each portion of her dress were quite in place with her all this suited her like the frank light in her eyes the rallying smile about her lips like her shaftstraight carriage and lightsome step caroline took her hand when she was dressed hurried her downstairs out of doors and thus they sped through the fields laughing as they went and looking very much like a snowwhite dove and gemtinted bird of paradise joined in social flight  thanks to miss helstones promptitude they arrived in good time while yet trees hid the church they heard the bell tolling a measured but urgent summons for all to assemble the trooping in of numbers the trampling of many steps and murmuring of many voices were likewise audible from a rising ground they presently saw on the whinbury road the whinbury school approaching it numbered five hundred souls the rector and curate boultby and donne headed itthe former looming large in full canonicals walking as became a beneficed priest under the canopy of a shovelhat with the dignity of an ample corporation the embellishment of the squarest and vastest of black coats and the support of the stoutest of goldheaded canes as the doctor walked he now and then slightly flourished his cane and inclined his shovelhat with a dogmatical wag towards his aidedecamp that aidedecampdonne to witnarrow as the line of his shape was compared to the broad bulk of his principal contrived notwithstanding to look every inch a curate all about him was pragmatical and selfcomplacent from his turnedup nose and elevated chin to his clerical black gaiters his somewhat short strapless trousers and his squaretoed shoes  walk on mr donne you have undergone scrutiny you think you look well whether the white and purple figures watching you from yonder hill think so is another question  these figures come running down when the regiment has marched by the churchyard is full of children and teachers all in their very best holiday attire and distressed as is the district bad as are the times it is wonderful to see how respectably how handsomely even they have contrived to clothe themselves that british love of decency will work miracles the poverty which reduces an irish girl to rags is impotent to rob the english girl of the neat wardrobe she knows necessary to her selfrespect besides the lady of the manorthat shirley now gazing with pleasure on this welldressed and happylooking crowdhas really done them good her seasonable bounty consoled many a poor family against the coming holiday and supplied many a child with a new frock or bonnet for the occasion she knows it and is elate with the consciousnessglad that her money example and influence have really substantially benefited those around her she cannot be charitable like miss ainley it is not in her nature it relieves her to feel that there is another way of being charitable practicable for other characters and under other circumstances  caroline too is pleased for she also has done good in her small wayrobbed herself of more than one dress ribbon or collar she could ill spare to aid in fitting out the scholars of her class and as she could not give money she has followed miss ainleys example in giving her time and her industry to sew for the children  not only is the churchyard full but the rectory garden is also thronged pairs and parties of ladies and gentlemen are seen walking amongst the waving lilacs and laburnums the house also is occupied at the wideopen parlour windows gay groups are standing these are the patrons and teachers who are to swell the procession in the parsons croft behind the rectory are the musicians of the three parish bands with their instruments fanny and eliza in the smartest of caps and gowns and the whitest of aprons move amongst them serving out quarts of ale whereof a stock was brewed very sound and strong some weeks since by the rectors orders and under his special superintendence whatever he had a hand in must be managed handsomely shabby doings of any description were not endured under his sanction from the erection of a public building a church school or courthouse to the cooking of a dinner he still advocated the lordly liberal and effective miss keeldar was like him in this respect and they mutually approved each others arrangements  caroline and shirley were soon in the midst of the company the former met them very easily for her instead of sitting down in a retired corner or stealing away to her own room till the procession should be marshalled according to her wont she moved through the three parlours conversed and smiled absolutely spoke once or twice ere she was spoken to and in short seemed a new creature it was shirleys presence which thus transformed her the view of miss keeldars air and manner did her a world of good shirley had no fear of her kind no tendency to shrink from to avoid it all human beingsmen women or childrenwhom low breeding or coarse presumption did not render positively offensive were welcome enough to hersome much more so than others of course but generally speaking till a man had indisputably proved himself bad and a nuisance shirley was willing to think him good and an acquisition and to treat him accordingly this disposition made her a general favourite for it robbed her very raillery of its sting and gave her serious or smiling conversation a happy charm nor did it diminish the value of her intimate friendship which was a distinct thing from this social benevolencedepending indeed on quite a different part of her character miss helstone was the choice of her affection and intellect the misses pearson sykes wynne etc etc only the profiteers by her goodnature and vivacity  donne happened to come into the drawingroom while shirley sitting on the sofa formed the centre of a tolerably wide circle she had already forgotten her exasperation against him and she bowed and smiled goodhumouredly the disposition of the man was then seen he knew neither how to decline the advance with dignity as one whose just pride has been wounded nor how to meet it with frankness as one who is glad to forget and forgive his punishment had impressed him with no sense of shame and he did not experience that feeling on encountering his chastiser he was not vigorous enough in evil to be actively malignanthe merely passed by sheepishly with a rated scowling look nothing could ever again reconcile him to his enemy while no passion of resentment for even sharper and more ignominious inflictions could his lymphatic nature know  he was not worth a scene said shirley to caroline what a fool i was to revenge on poor donne his silly spite at yorkshire is something like crushing a gnat for attacking the hide of a rhinoceros had i been a gentleman i believe i should have helped him off the premises by dint of physical force i am glad now i only employed the moral weapon but he must come near me no more i dont like him he irritates me there is not even amusement to be had out of him malone is better sport  it seemed as if malone wished to justify the preference for the words were scarcely out of the speakers mouth when peter augustus came up all in grande tenue gloved and scented with his hair oiled and brushed to perfection and bearing in one hand a huge bunch of cabbageroses five or six in full blow these he presented to the heiress with a grace to which the most cunning pencil could do but defective justice and who after this could dare to say that peter was not a ladys man he had gathered and he had given flowers he had offered a sentimental a poetic tribute at the shrine of love or mammon hercules holding the distaff was but a faint type of peter bearing the roses he must have thought this himself for he seemed amazed at what he had done he backed without a word he was going away with a husky chuckle of selfsatisfaction then he bethought himself to stop and turn to ascertain by ocular testimony that he really had presented a bouquet yes there were the six red cabbages on the purple satin lap a very white hand with some gold rings on the fingers slightly holding them together and streaming ringlets half hiding a laughing face drooped over them only half hiding peter saw the laugh it was unmistakable he was made a joke of his gallantry his chivalry were the subject of a jest for a petticoatfor two petticoats miss helstone too was smiling moreover he felt he was seen through and peter grew black as a thundercloud when shirley looked up a fell eye was fastened on her malone at least had energy enough in hate she saw it in his glance  peter is worth a scene and shall have it if he likes one day she whispered to her friend  and nowsolemn and sombre as to their colour though bland enough as to their facesappeared at the diningroom door the three rectors they had hitherto been busy in the church and were now coming to take some little refreshment for the body ere the march commenced the large moroccocovered easychair had been left vacant for dr boultby he was put into it and caroline obeying the instigations of shirley who told her now was the time to play the hostess hastened to hand to her uncles vast revered and on the whole worthy friend a glass of wine and a plate of macaroons boultbys churchwardens patrons of the sunday school both as he insisted on their being were already beside him mrs sykes and the other ladies of his congregation were on his right hand and on his left expressing their hopes that he was not fatigued their fears that the day would be too warm for him mrs boultby who held an opinion that when her lord dropped asleep after a good dinner his face became as the face of an angel was bending over him tenderly wiping some perspiration real or imaginary from his brow boultby in short was in his glory and in a round sound voix de poitrine he rumbled out thanks for attentions and assurances of his tolerable health of caroline he took no manner of notice as she came near save to accept what she offered he did not see herhe never did see her he hardly knew that such a person existed he saw the macaroons however and being fond of sweets possessed himself of a small handful thereof the wine mrs boultby insisted on mingling with hot water and qualifying with sugar and nutmeg  mr hall stood near an open window breathing the fresh air and scent of flowers and talking like a brother to miss ainley to him caroline turned her attention with pleasure what should she bring him he must not help himselfhe must be served by her and she provided herself with a little salver that she might offer him variety margaret hall joined them so did miss keeldar the four ladies stood round their favourite pastor they also had an idea that they looked on the face of an earthly angel cyril hall was their pope infallible to them as dr thomas boultby to his admirers a throng too enclosed the rector of briarfieldtwenty or more pressed round him and no parson was ever more potent in a circle than old helstone the curates herding together after their manner made a constellation of three lesser planets divers young ladies watched them afar off but ventured not nigh  mr helstone produced his watch ten minutes to two he announced aloud time for all to fall into line come he seized his shovelhat and marched away all rose and followed en masse  the twelve hundred children were drawn up in three bodies of four hundred souls each in the rear of each regiment was stationed a band between every twenty there was an interval wherein helstone posted the teachers in pairs to the van of the armies he summoned  grace boultby and mary sykes lead out whinbury  margaret hall and mary ann ainley conduct nunnely  caroline helstone and shirley keeldar head briarfield  then again he gave command  mr donne to whinbury mr sweeting to nunnely mr malone to briarfield  and these gentlemen stepped up before the ladygenerals  the rectors passed to the full front the parish clerks fell to the extreme rear helstone lifted his shovelhat in an instant out clashed the eight bells in the tower loud swelled the sounding bands flute spoke and clarion answered deep rolled the drums and away they marched  the broad white road unrolled before the long procession the sun and sky surveyed it cloudless the wind tossed the tree boughs above it and the twelve hundred children and one hundred and forty adults of which it was composed trod on in time and tune with gay faces and glad hearts it was a joyous scene and a scene to do good it was a day of happiness for rich and poorthe work first of god and then of the clergy let englands priests have their due they are a faulty set in some respects being only of common flesh and blood like us all but the land would be badly off without them britain would miss her church if that church fell god save it god also reform it     chapter xvii  the school feast   not on combat bent nor of foemen in search was this priestled and womanofficered company yet their music played martial tunes and to judge by the eyes and carriage of somemiss keeldar for instancethese sounds awoke if not a martial yet a longing spirit old helstone turning by chance looked into her face and he laughed and she laughed at him  there is no battle in prospect he said our country does not want us to fight for it no foe or tyrant is questioning or threatening our liberty there is nothing to be done we are only taking a walk keep your hand on the reins captain and slack the fire of that spirit it is not wanted the mores the pity  take your own advice doctor was shirleys response to caroline she murmured ill borrow of imagination what reality will not give me we are not soldiersbloodshed is not my desireor if we are we are soldiers of the cross time has rolled back some hundreds of years and we are bound on a pilgrimage to palestine but no that is too visionary i need a sterner dream we are lowlanders of scotland following a covenanting captain up into the hills to hold a meeting out of the reach of persecuting troopers we know that battle may follow prayer and as we believe that in the worst issue of battle heaven must be our reward we are ready and willing to redden the peatmoss with our blood that music stirs my soul it wakens all my life it makes my heart beatnot with its temperate daily pulse but with a new thrilling vigour i almost long for dangerfor a faith a land or at least a lover to defend  look shirley interrupted caroline what is that red speck above stilbro brow you have keener sight than i just turn your eagle eye to it  miss keeldar looked i see she said then added presently there is a line of red they are soldierscavalry soldiers she subjoined quickly they ride fast there are six of them they will pass us no they have turned off to the right they saw our procession and avoid it by making a circuit where are they going  perhaps they are only exercising their horses  perhaps so we see them no more now  mr helstone here spoke  we shall pass through royd lane to reach nunnely common by a short cut said he  and into the straits of royd lane they accordingly defiled it was very narrowso narrow that only two could walk abreast without falling into the ditch which ran along each side they had gained the middle of it when excitement became obvious in the clerical commanders boultbys spectacles and helstones rehoboam were agitated the curates nudged each other mr hall turned to the ladies and smiled  what is the matter was the demand  he pointed with his staff to the end of the lane before them lo and behold another an opposition procession was there entering headed also by men in black and followed also as they could now hear by music  is it our double asked shirley our manifold wraith here is a card turned up  if you wanted a battle you are likely to get oneat least of looks whispered caroline laughing  they shall not pass us cried the curates unanimously well not give way  give way retorted helstone sternly turning round who talks of giving way you boys mind what you are about the ladies i know will be firm i can trust them there is not a churchwoman here but will stand her ground against these folks for the honour of the establishmentwhat does miss keeldar say  she asks what is it  the dissenting and methodist schools the baptists independents and wesleyans joined in unholy alliance and turning purposely into this lane with the intention of obstructing our march and driving us back  bad manners said shirley and i hate bad manners of course they must have a lesson  a lesson in politeness suggested mr hall who was ever for peace not an example of rudeness  old helstone moved on quickening his step he marched some yards in advance of his company he had nearly reached the other sable leaders when he who appeared to act as the hostile commanderinchiefa large greasy man with black hair combed flat on his foreheadcalled a halt the procession paused he drew forth a hymn book gave out a verse set a tune and they all struck up the most dolorous of canticles  helstone signed to his bands they clashed out with all the power of brass he desired them to play rule britannia and ordered the children to join in vocally which they did with enthusiastic spirit the enemy was sung and stormed down his psalm quelled as far as noise went he was conquered  now follow me exclaimed helstone not at a run but at a firm smart pace be steady every child and woman of you keep together hold on by each others skirts if necessary  and he strode on with such a determined and deliberate gait and was besides so well seconded by his scholars and teachers who did exactly as he told them neither running nor faltering but marching with cool solid impetusthe curates too being compelled to do the same as they were between two fires helstone and miss keeldar both of whom watched any deviation with lynxeyed vigilance and were ready the one with his cane the other with her parasol to rebuke the slightest breach of orders the least independent or irregular demonstrationthat the body of dissenters were first amazed then alarmed then borne down and pressed back and at last forced to turn tail and leave the outlet from royd lane free boultby suffered in the onslaught but helstone and malone between them held him up and brought him through the business whole in limb though sorely tried in wind  the fat dissenter who had given out the hymn was left sitting in the ditch he was a spirit merchant by trade a leader of the nonconformists and it was said drank more water in that one afternoon than he had swallowed for a twelvemonth before mr hall had taken care of caroline and caroline of him he and miss ainley made their own quiet comments to each other afterwards on the incident miss keeldar and mr helstone shook hands heartily when they had fairly got the whole party through the lane the curates began to exult but mr helstone presently put the curb on their innocent spirits he remarked that they never had sense to know what to say and had better hold their tongues and he reminded them that the business was none of their managing  about halfpast three the procession turned back and at four once more regained the startingplace long lines of benches were arranged in the closeshorn fields round the school there the children were seated and huge baskets covered up with white cloths and great smoking tin vessels were brought out ere the distribution of good things commenced a brief grace was pronounced by mr hall and sung by the children their young voices sounded melodious even touching in the open air large currant buns and hot wellsweetened tea were then administered in the proper spirit of liberality no stinting was permitted on this day at least the rule for each childs allowance being that it was to have about twice as much as it could possibly eat thus leaving a reserve to be carried home for such as age sickness or other impediment prevented from coming to the feast buns and beer circulated meantime amongst the musicians and churchsingers afterwards the benches were removed and they were left to unbend their spirits in licensed play  a bell summoned the teachers patrons and patronesses to the schoolroom miss keeldar miss helstone and many other ladies were already there glancing over the arrangement of their separate trays and tables most of the female servants of the neighbourhood together with the clerks the singers and the musicians wives had been pressed into the service of the day as waiters each vied with the other in smartness and daintiness of dress and many handsome forms were seen amongst the younger ones about half a score were cutting bread and butter another halfscore supplying hot water brought from the coppers of the rectors kitchen the profusion of flowers and evergreens decorating the white walls the show of silver teapots and bright porcelain on the tables the active figures blithe faces gay dresses flitting about everywhere formed altogether a refreshing and lively spectacle everybody talked not very loudly but merrily and the canary birds sang shrill in their highhung cages  caroline as the rectors niece took her place at one of the three first tables mrs boultby and margaret hall officiated at the others at these tables the élite of the company were to be entertained strict rules of equality not being more in fashion at briarfield than elsewhere miss helstone removed her bonnet and scarf that she might be less oppressed with the heat her long curls falling on her neck served almost in place of a veil and for the rest her muslin dress was fashioned modestly as a nuns robe enabling her thus to dispense with the encumbrance of a shawl  the room was filling mr hall had taken his post beside caroline who now as she rearranged the cups and spoons before her whispered to him in a low voice remarks on the events of the day he looked a little grave about what had taken place in royd lane and she tried to smile him out of his seriousness miss keeldar sat nearfor a wonder neither laughing nor talking on the contrary very still and gazing round her vigilantly she seemed afraid lest some intruder should take a seat she apparently wished to reserve next her own ever and anon she spread her satin dress over an undue portion of the bench or laid her gloves or her embroidered handkerchief upon it caroline noticed this manège at last and asked her what friend she expected shirley bent towards her almost touched her ear with her rosy lips and whispered with a musical softness that often characterized her tones when what she said tended even remotely to stir some sweet secret source of feeling in her heart i expect mr moore i saw him last night and i made him promise to come with his sister and to sit at our table he wont fail me i feel certain but i apprehend his coming too late and being separated from us here is a fresh batch arriving every place will be taken provoking  in fact mr wynne the magistrate his wife his son and his two daughters now entered in high state they were briarfield gentry of course their place was at the first table and being conducted thither they filled up the whole remaining space for miss keeldars comfort mr sam wynne inducted himself into the very vacancy she had kept for moore planting himself solidly on her gown her gloves and her handkerchief mr sam was one of the objects of her aversion and the more so because he showed serious symptoms of an aim at her hand the old gentleman too had publicly declared that the fieldhead estate and the de walden estate were delightfully contagiousa malapropism which rumour had not failed to repeat to shirley  carolines ears yet rung with that thrilling whisper i expect mr moore her heart yet beat and her cheek yet glowed with it when a note from the organ pealed above the confused hum of the place dr boultby mr helstone and mr hall rose so did all present and grace was sung to the accompaniment of the music and then tea began she was kept too busy with her office for a while to have leisure for looking round but the last cup being filled she threw a restless glance over the room there were some ladies and several gentlemen standing about yet unaccommodated with seats amidst a group she recognized her spinster friend miss mann whom the fine weather had tempted or some urgent friend had persuaded to leave her drear solitude for one hour of social enjoyment miss mann looked tired of standing a lady in a yellow bonnet brought her a chair caroline knew well that chapeau en satin jaune she knew the black hair and the kindly though rather opinionated and frowardlooking face under it she knew that robe de soie noire she knew even that schall gris de lin she knew in short hortense moore and she wanted to jump up and run to her and kiss herto give her one embrace for her own sake and two for her brothers she half rose indeed with a smothered exclamation and perhapsfor the impulse was very strongshe would have run across the room and actually saluted her but a hand replaced her in her seat and a voice behind her whispered wait till after tea lina and then ill bring her to you  and when she could look up she did and there was robert himself close behind smiling at her eagerness looking better than she had ever seen him looklooking indeed to her partial eyes so very handsome that she dared not trust herself to hazard a second glance for his image struck on her vision with painful brightness and pictured itself on her memory as vividly as if there daguerreotyped by a pencil of keen lightning  he moved on and spoke to miss keeldar shirley irritated by some unwelcome attentions from sam wynne and by the fact of that gentleman being still seated on her gloves and handkerchiefand probably also by moores want of punctualitywas by no means in good humour she first shrugged her shoulders at him and then she said a bitter word or two about his insupportable tardiness moore neither apologized nor retorted he stood near her quietly as if waiting to see whether she would recover her temper which she did in little more than three minutes indicating the change by offering him her hand moore took it with a smile halfcorrective halfgrateful the slightest possible shake of the head delicately marked the former quality it is probable a gentle pressure indicated the latter  you may sit where you can now mr moore said shirley also smiling you see there is not an inch of room for you here but i discern plenty of space at mrs boultbys table between miss armitage and miss birtwhistle go john sykes will be your visàvis and you will sit with your back towards us  moore however preferred lingering about where he was he now and then took a turn down the long room pausing in his walk to interchange greetings with other gentlemen in his own placeless predicament but still he came back to the magnet shirley bringing with him each time he returned observations it was necessary to whisper in her ear  meantime poor sam wynne looked far from comfortable his fair neighbour judging from her movements appeared in a mood the most unquiet and unaccommodating she would not sit still two seconds she was hot she fanned herself complained of want of air and space she remarked that in her opinion when people had finished their tea they ought to leave the tables and announced distinctly that she expected to faint if the present state of things continued mr sam offered to accompany her into the open air just the way to give her her death of cold she alleged in short his post became untenable and having swallowed his quantum of tea he judged it expedient to evacuate  moore should have been at hand whereas he was quite at the other extremity of the room deep in conference with christopher sykes a large cornfactor timothy ramsden esq happened to be nearer and feeling himself tired of standing he advanced to fill the vacant seat shirleys expedients did not fail her a sweep of her scarf upset her teacup its contents were shared between the bench and her own satin dress of course it became necessary to call a waiter to remedy the mischief mr ramsden a stout puffy gentleman as large in person as he was in property held aloof from the consequent commotion shirley usually almost culpably indifferent to slight accidents affecting dress etc now made a commotion that might have become the most delicate and nervous of her sex mr ramsden opened his mouth withdrew slowly and as miss keeldar again intimated her intention to give way and swoon on the spot he turned on his heel and beat a heavy retreat  moore at last returned calmly surveying the bustle and somewhat quizzically scanning shirleys enigmaticallooking countenance he remarked that in truth this was the hottest end of the room that he found a climate there calculated to agree with none but cool temperaments like his own and putting the waiters the napkins the satin robethe whole turmoil in shortto one side he installed himself where destiny evidently decreed he should sit shirley subsided her features altered their lines the raised knit brow and inexplicable curve of the mouth became straight again wilfulness and roguery gave place to other expressions and all the angular movements with which she had vexed the soul of sam wynne were conjured to rest as by a charm still no gracious glance was cast on moore on the contrary he was accused of giving her a world of trouble and roundly charged with being the cause of depriving her of the esteem of mr ramsden and the invaluable friendship of mr samuel wynne  wouldnt have offended either gentleman for the world she averred i have always been accustomed to treat both with the most respectful consideration and there owing to you how they have been used i shall not be happy till i have made it up i never am happy till i am friends with my neighbours so tomorrow i must make a pilgrimage to royd cornmill soothe the miller and praise the grain and next day i must call at de waldenwhere i hate to goand carry in my reticule half an oatcake to give to mr sams favourite pointers  you know the surest path to the heart of each swain i doubt not said moore quietly he looked very content to have at last secured his present place but he made no fine speech expressive of gratification and offered no apology for the trouble he had given his phlegm became him wonderfully it made him look handsomer he was so composed it made his vicinage pleasant it was so peacerestoring you would not have thought to look at him that he was a poor struggling man seated beside a rich woman the calm of equality stilled his aspect perhaps that calm too reigned in his soul now and then from the way in which he looked down on miss keeldar as he addressed her you would have fancied his station towered above hers as much as his stature did almost stern lights sometimes crossed his brow and gleamed in his eyes their conversation had become animated though it was confined to a low key she was urging him with questionsevidently he refused to her curiosity all the gratification it demanded she sought his eye once with hers you read in its soft yet eager expression that it solicited clearer replies moore smiled pleasantly but his lips continued sealed then she was piqued and turned away but he recalled her attention in two minutes he seemed making promises which he soothed her into accepting in lieu of information  it appeared that the heat of the room did not suit miss helstone she grew paler and paler as the process of teamaking was protracted the moment thanks were returned she quitted the table and hastened to follow her cousin hortense who with miss mann had already sought the open air robert moore had risen when she didperhaps he meant to speak to her but there was yet a parting word to exchange with miss keeldar and while it was being uttered caroline had vanished  hortense received her former pupil with a demeanour of more dignity than warmth she had been seriously offended by mr helstones proceedings and had all along considered caroline to blame in obeying her uncle too literally  you are a very great stranger she said austerely as her pupil held and pressed her hand the pupil knew her too well to remonstrate or complain of coldness she let the punctilious whim pass sure that her natural bonté i use this french word because it expresses just what i meanneither goodness nor goodnature but something between the two would presently get the upper hand it did hortense had no sooner examined her face well and observed the change its somewhat wasted features betrayed than her mien softened kissing her on both cheeks she asked anxiously after her health caroline answered gaily it would however have been her lot to undergo a long crossexamination followed by an endless lecture on this head had not miss mann called off the attention of the questioner by requesting to be conducted home the poor invalid was already fatigued her weariness made her crosstoo cross almost to speak to caroline and besides that young persons white dress and lively look were displeasing in the eyes of miss mann the everyday garb of brown stuff or gray gingham and the everyday air of melancholy suited the solitary spinster better she would hardly know her young friend tonight and quitted her with a cool nod hortense having promised to accompany her home they departed together  caroline now looked round for shirley she saw the rainbow scarf and purple dress in the centre of a throng of ladies all well known to herself but all of the order whom she systematically avoided whenever avoidance was possible shyer at some moments than at others she felt just now no courage at all to join this company she could not however stand alone where all others went in pairs or parties so she approached a group of her own scholars great girls or rather young women who were standing watching some hundreds of the younger children playing at blindmans buff  miss helstone knew these girls liked her yet she was shy even with them out of school they were not more in awe of her than she of them she drew near them now rather to find protection in their company than to patronize them with her presence by some instinct they knew her weakness and with natural politeness they respected it her knowledge commanded their esteem when she taught them her gentleness attracted their regard and because she was what they considered wise and good when on duty they kindly overlooked her evident timidity when off they did not take advantage of it peasant girls as they were they had too much of our own english sensibility to be guilty of the coarse error they stood round her still civil friendly receiving her slight smiles and rather hurried efforts to converse with a good feeling and good breedingthe last quality being the result of the firstwhich soon set her at her ease  mr sam wynne coming up with great haste to insist on the elder girls joining in the game as well as the younger ones caroline was again left alone she was meditating a quiet retreat to the house when shirley perceiving from afar her isolation hastened to her side  let us go to the top of the fields she said i know you dont like crowds caroline  but it will be depriving you of a pleasure shirley to take you from all these fine people who court your society so assiduously and to whom you can without art or effort make yourself so pleasant  not quite without effort i am already tired of the exertion it is but insipid barren work talking and laughing with the good gentlefolks of briarfield i have been looking out for your white dress for the last ten minutes i like to watch those i love in a crowd and to compare them with others i have thus compared you you resemble none of the rest lina there are some prettier faces than yours here you are not a model beauty like harriet sykes for instancebeside her your person appears almost insignificantbut you look agreeable you look reflective you look what i call interesting  hush shirley you flatter me  i dont wonder that your scholars like you  nonsense shirley talk of something else  we will talk of moore then and we will watch him i see him even now  where and as caroline asked the question she looked not over the fields but into miss keeldars eyes as was her wont whenever shirley mentioned any object she descried afar her friend had quicker vision than herself and caroline seemed to think that the secret of her eagle acuteness might be read in her dark gray irides or rather perhaps she only sought guidance by the direction of those discriminating and brilliant spheres  there is moore said shirley pointing right across the wide field where a thousand children were playing and now nearly a thousand adult spectators walking about therecan you miss the tall stature and straight port he looks amidst the set that surround him like eliab amongst humbler shepherdslike saul in a warcouncil and a warcouncil it is if i am not mistaken  why so shirley asked caroline whose eye had at last caught the object it sought robert is just now speaking to my uncle and they are shaking hands they are then reconciled  reconciled not without good reason depend on itmaking common cause against some common foe and why think you are messrs wynne and sykes and armitage and ramsden gathered in such a close circle round them and why is malone beckoned to join them where he is summoned be sure a strong arm is needed  shirley as she watched grew restless her eyes flashed  they wont trust me she said that is always the way when it comes to the point  what about  cannot you feel there is some mystery afloat some event is expected some preparation is to be made i am certain i saw it all in mr moores manner this evening he was excited yet hard  hard to you shirley  yes to me he often is hard to me we seldom converse têteàtête but i am made to feel that the basis of his character is not of eider down  yet he seemed to talk to you softly  did he not very gentle tones and quiet manner yet the man is peremptory and secret his secrecy vexes me  yes robert is secret  which he has scarcely a right to be with me especially as he commenced by giving me his confidence having done nothing to forfeit that confidence it ought not to be withdrawn but i suppose i am not considered ironsouled enough to be trusted in a crisis  he fears probably to occasion you uneasiness  an unnecessary precaution i am of elastic materials not soon crushed he ought to know that but the man is proud he has his faults say what you will lina observe how engaged that group appear they do not know we are watching them  if we keep on the alert shirley we shall perhaps find the clue to their secret  there will be some unusual movements ere longperhaps tomorrow possibly tonight but my eyes and ears are wide open mr moore you shall be under surveillance be you vigilant also lina  i will robert is going i saw him turn i believe he noticed us they are shaking hands  shaking hands with emphasis added shirley as if they were ratifying some solemn league and covenant  they saw robert quit the group pass through a gate and disappear  and he has not bid us goodbye murmured caroline  scarcely had the words escaped her lips when she tried by a smile to deny the confession of disappointment they seemed to imply an unbidden suffusion for one moment both softened and brightened her eyes  oh that is soon remedied exclaimed shirley well make him bid us goodbye  make him that is not the same thing was the answer  it shall be the same thing  but he is gone you cant overtake him  i know a shorter way than that he has taken we will intercept him  but shirley i would rather not go  caroline said this as miss keeldar seized her arm and hurried her down the fields it was vain to contend nothing was so wilful as shirley when she took a whim into her head caroline found herself out of sight of the crowd almost before she was aware and ushered into a narrow shady spot embowered above with hawthorns and enamelled under foot with daisies she took no notice of the evening sun chequering the turf nor was she sensible of the pure incense exhaling at this hour from tree and plant she only heard the wicket opening at one end and knew robert was approaching the long sprays of the hawthorns shooting out before them served as a screen they saw him before he observed them at a glance caroline perceived that his social hilarity was gone he had left it behind him in the joyechoing fields round the school what remained now was his dark quiet business countenance as shirley had said a certain hardness characterized his air while his eye was excited but austere so much the worse timed was the present freak of shirleys if he had looked disposed for holiday mirth it would not have mattered much but now  i told you not to come said caroline somewhat bitterly to her friend she seemed truly perturbed to be intruded on robert thus against her will and his expectation and when he evidently would rather not be delayed keenly annoyed her it did not annoy miss keeldar in the least she stepped forward and faced her tenant barring his way you omitted to bid us goodbye she said  omitted to bid you goodbye where did you come from are you fairies i left two like you one in purple and one in white standing at the top of a bank four fields off but a minute ago  you left us there and find us here we have been watching you and shall watch you still you must be questioned one day but not now at present all you have to do is to say goodnight and then pass  moore glanced from one to the other without unbending his aspect days of fête have their privileges and so have days of hazard observed he gravely  come dont moralize say goodnight and pass urged shirley  must i say goodnight to you miss keeldar  yes and to caroline likewise it is nothing new i hope you have bid us both goodnight before  he took her hand held it in one of his and covered it with the other he looked down at her gravely kindly yet commandingly the heiress could not make this man her subject in his gaze on her bright face there was no servility hardly homage but there were interest and affection heightened by another feeling something in his tone when he spoke as well as in his words marked that last sentiment to be gratitude  your debtor bids you goodnight may you rest safely and serenely till morning  and you mr moorewhat are you going to do what have you been saying to mr helstone with whom i saw you shake hands why did all those gentlemen gather round you put away reserve for once be frank with me  who can resist you i will be frank tomorrow if there is anything to relate you shall hear it  just now pleaded shirley dont procrastinate  but i could only tell half a tale and my time is limited i have not a moment to spare hereafter i will make amends for delay by candour  but are you going home  yes  not to leave it any more tonight  certainly not at present farewell to both of you  he would have taken carolines hand and joined it in the same clasp in which he held shirleys but somehow it was not ready for him she had withdrawn a few steps apart her answer to moores adieu was only a slight bend of the head and a gentle serious smile he sought no more cordial token again he said farewell and quitted them both  there it is over said shirley when he was gone we have made him bid us goodnight and yet not lost ground in his esteem i think cary  i hope not was the brief reply  i consider you very timid and undemonstrative remarked miss keeldar why did you not give moore your hand when he offered you his he is your cousin you like him are you ashamed to let him perceive your affection  he perceives all of it that interests him no need to make a display of feeling  you are laconic you would be stoical if you could is love in your eyes a crime caroline  love a crime no shirley love is a divine virtue but why drag that word into the conversation it is singularly irrelevant  good pronounced shirley  the two girls paced the green lane in silence caroline first resumed  obtrusiveness is a crime forwardness is a crime and both disgust but love no purest angel need blush to love and when i see or hear either man or woman couple shame with love i know their minds are coarse their associations debased many who think themselves refined ladies and gentlemen and on whose lips the word vulgarity is for ever hovering cannot mention love without betraying their own innate and imbecile degradation it is a low feeling in their estimation connected only with low ideas for them  you describe threefourths of the world caroline  they are coldthey are cowardlythey are stupid on the subject shirley they never lovedthey never were loved  thou art right lina and in their dense ignorance they blaspheme living fire seraphbrought from a divine altar  they confound it with sparks mounting from tophet  the sudden and joyous clash of bells here stopped the dialogue by summoning all to the church     chapter xviii  which the genteel reader is recommended to skip low persons being here introduced   the evening was still and warm close and sultry it even promised to become round the descending sun the clouds glowed purple summer tints rather indian than english suffused the horizon and cast rosy reflections on hillside housefront treebole on winding road and undulating pastureground the two girls came down from the fields slowly by the time they reached the churchyard the bells were hushed the multitudes were gathered into the church the whole scene was solitary  how pleasant and calm it is said caroline  and how hot it will be in the church responded shirley and what a dreary long speech dr boultby will make and how the curates will hammer over their prepared orations for my part i would rather not enter  but my uncle will be angry if he observes our absence  i will bear the brunt of his wrath he will not devour me i shall be sorry to miss his pungent speech i know it will be all sense for the church and all causticity for schism hell not forget the battle of royd lane i shall be sorry also to deprive you of mr halls sincere friendly homily with all its racy yorkshireisms but here i must stay the gray church and grayer tombs look divine with this crimson gleam on them nature is now at her evening prayers she is kneeling before those red hills i see her prostrate on the great steps of her altar praying for a fair night for mariners at sea for travellers in deserts for lambs on moors and unfledged birds in woods caroline i see her and i will tell you what she is like she is like what eve was when she and adam stood alone on earth  and that is not miltons eve shirley  miltons eve miltons eve i repeat no by the pure mother of god she is not cary we are alone we may speak what we think milton was great but was he good his brain was right how was his heart he saw heaven he looked down on hell he saw satan and sin his daughter and death their horrible offspring angels serried before him their battalions the long lines of adamantine shields flashed back on his blind eyeballs the unutterable splendour of heaven devils gathered their legions in his sight their dim discrowned and tarnished armies passed rank and file before him milton tried to see the first woman but cary he saw her not  you are bold to say so shirley  not more bold than faithful it was his cook that he saw or it was mrs gill as i have seen her making custards in the heat of summer in the cool dairy with rosetrees and nasturtiums about the latticed window preparing a cold collation for the rectorspreserves and dulcet creams puzzled what choice to choose for delicacy best what order so contrived as not to mix tastes not welljoined inelegant but bring taste after taste upheld with kindliest change  all very well too shirley  i would beg to remind him that the first men of the earth were titans and that eve was their mother from her sprang saturn hyperion oceanus she bore prometheus  pagan that you are what does that signify  i say there were giants on the earth in those daysgiants that strove to scale heaven the first womans breast that heaved with life on this world yielded the daring which could contend with omnipotence the strength which could bear a thousand years of bondage the vitality which could feed that vulture death through uncounted ages the unexhausted life and uncorrupted excellence sisters to immortality which after millenniums of crimes struggles and woes could conceive and bring forth a messiah the first woman was heavenborn vast was the heart whence gushed the wellspring of the blood of nations and grand the undegenerate head where rested the consortcrown of creation  she coveted an apple and was cheated by a snake but you have got such a hash of scripture and mythology into your head that there is no making any sense of you you have not yet told me what you saw kneeling on those hills  i sawi now seea womantitan her robe of blue air spreads to the outskirts of the heath where yonder flock is grazing a veil white as an avalanche sweeps from her head to her feet and arabesques of lightning flame on its borders under her breast i see her zone purple like that horizon through its blush shines the star of evening her steady eyes i cannot picture they are clear they are deep as lakes they are lifted and full of worship they tremble with the softness of love and the lustre of prayer her forehead has the expanse of a cloud and is paler than the early moon risen long before dark gathers she reclines her bosom on the ridge of stilbro moor her mighty hands are joined beneath it so kneeling face to face she speaks with god that eve is jehovahs daughter as adam was his son  she is very vague and visionary come shirley we ought to go into church  caroline i will not i will stay out here with my mother eve in these days called nature i love herundying mighty being heaven may have faded from her brow when she fell in paradise but all that is glorious on earth shines there still she is taking me to her bosom and showing me her heart hush caroline you will see her and feel as i do if we are both silent  i will humour your whim but you will begin talking again ere ten minutes are over  miss keeldar on whom the soft excitement of the warm summer evening seemed working with unwonted power leaned against an upright headstone she fixed her eyes on the deepburning west and sank into a pleasurable trance caroline going a little apart paced to and fro beneath the rectory garden wall dreaming too in her way shirley had mentioned the word mother that word suggested to carolines imagination not the mighty and mystical parent of shirleys visions but a gentle human formthe form she ascribed to her own mother unknown unloved but not unlonged for  oh that the day would come when she would remember her child oh that i might know her and knowing love her  such was her aspiration  the longing of her childhood filled her soul again the desire which many a night had kept her awake in her crib and which fear of its fallacy had of late years almost extinguished relit suddenly and glowed warm in her heart that her mother might come some happy day and send for her to her presence look upon her fondly with loving eyes and say to her tenderly in a sweet voice caroline my child i have a home for you you shall live with me all the love you have needed and not tasted from infancy i have saved for you carefully come it shall cherish you now  a noise on the road roused caroline from her filial hopes and shirley from her titan visions they listened and heard the tramp of horses they looked and saw a glitter through the trees they caught through the foliage glimpses of martial scarlet helm shone plume waved silent and orderly six soldiers rode softly by  the same we saw this afternoon whispered shirley they have been halting somewhere till now they wish to be as little noticed as possible and are seeking their rendezvous at this quiet hour while the people are at church did i not say we should see unusual things ere long  scarcely were sight and sound of the soldiers lost when another and somewhat different disturbance broke the nighthusha childs impatient scream they looked a man issued from the church carrying in his arms an infanta robust ruddy little boy of some two years oldroaring with all the power of his lungs he had probably just awaked from a churchsleep two little girls of nine and ten followed the influence of the fresh air and the attraction of some flowers gathered from a grave soon quieted the child the man sat down with him dandling him on his knee as tenderly as any woman the two little girls took their places one on each side  goodevening william said shirley after due scrutiny of the man he had seen her before and apparently was waiting to be recognized he now took off his hat and grinned a smile of pleasure he was a roughheaded hardfeatured personage not old but very weatherbeaten his attire was decent and clean that of his children singularly neat it was our old friend farren the young ladies approached him  you are not going into the church he inquired gazing at them complacently yet with a mixture of bashfulness in his looka sentiment not by any means the result of awe of their station but only of appreciation of their elegance and youth before gentlemensuch as moore or helstone for instancewilliam was often a little dogged with proud or insolent ladies too he was quite unmanageable sometimes very resentful but he was most sensible of most tractable to goodhumour and civility his naturea stubborn onewas repelled by inflexibility in other natures for which reason he had never been able to like his former master moore and unconscious of that gentlemans good opinion of himself and of the service he had secretly rendered him in recommending him as gardener to mr yorke and by this means to other families in the neighbourhood he continued to harbour a grudge against his austerity latterly he had often worked at fieldhead miss keeldars frank hospitable manners were perfectly charming to him caroline he had known from her childhood unconsciously she was his ideal of a lady her gentle mien step gestures her grace of person and attire moved some artistfibres about his peasant heart he had a pleasure in looking at her as he had in examining rare flowers or in seeing pleasant landscapes both the ladies liked william it was their delight to lend him books to give him plants and they preferred his conversation far before that of many coarse hard pretentious people immeasurably higher in station  who was speaking william when you came out asked shirley  a gentleman ye set a deal of store on miss shirleymr donne  you look knowing william how did you find out my regard for mr donne  ay miss shirley theres a gleg light i your een sometimes which betrays you you look raight down scornful sometimes when mr donne is by  do you like him yourself william  me im stalled o t curates and so is t wife theyve no manners they talk to poor folk fair as if they thought they were beneath them theyre allus magnifying their office it is a pity but their office could magnify them but it does nought o t soart i fair hate pride  but you are proud in your own way yourself interposed caroline you are what you call houseproud you like to have everything handsome about you sometimes you look as if you were almost too proud to take your wages when you were out of work you were too proud to get anything on credit but for your children i believe you would rather have starved than gone to the shops without money and when i wanted to give you something what a difficulty i had in making you take it  it is partly true miss caroline ony day id rather give than take especially from sich as ye look at t difference between us yere a little young slender lass and im a great strong man im rather more nor twice your age it is not my part then i think to tak fro yeto be under obligations as they say to ye and that day ye came to our house and called me to t door and offered me five shillings which i doubt ye could ill sparefor yeve no fortin i knowthat day i war fair a rebel a radical an insurrectionist and ye made me so i thought it shameful that willing and able as i was to work i suld be i such a condition that a young cratur about the age o my own eldest lass suld think it needful to come and offer me her bit o brass  i suppose you were angry with me william  i almost was in a way but i forgave ye varry soon ye meant well ay i am proud and so are ye but your pride and mine is t raight makwhat we call i yorkshire clean pridesuch as mr malone and mr donne knows nought about theirs is mucky pride now i shall teach my lasses to be as proud as miss shirley there and my lads to be as proud as myseln but i dare ony o em to be like t curates id lick little michael if i seed him show any signs o that feeling  what is the difference william  ye know t difference weel enow but ye want me to get a gate o talking mr malone and mr donne is almost too proud to do aught for theirseln we are almost too proud to let anybody do aught for us t curates can hardly bide to speak a civil word to them they think beneath them we can hardly bide to tak an uncivil word fro them that thinks themseln aboon us  now william be humble enough to tell me truly how you are getting on in the world are you well off  miss shirley i am varry well off since i got into t gardening line wi mr yorkes help and since mr hall another o t raight sort helped my wife to set up a bit of a shop ive nought to complain of my family has plenty to eat and plenty to wear my pride makes me find means to have an odd pound now and then against rainy days for i think id die afore id come to t parish and me and mine is content but t neighbours is poor yet i see a great deal of distress  and consequently there is still discontent i suppose inquired miss keeldar  consequentlyye say rightconsequently in course starving folk cannot be satisfied or settled folk the countrys not in a safe conditionill say so mich  but what can be done what more can i do for instance  do ye can do not mich poor young lass yeve gien your brass yeve done well if ye could transport your tenant mr moore to botany bay yed happen do better folks hate him  william for shame exclaimed caroline warmly if folks do hate him it is to their disgrace not his mr moore himself hates nobody he only wants to do his duty and maintain his rights you are wrong to talk so  i talk as i think he has a cold unfeeling heart yond moore  but interposed shirley supposing moore was driven from the country and his mill razed to the ground would people have more work  theyd have less i know that and they know that and there is many an honest lad driven desperate by the certainty that whichever way he turns he cannot better himself and there is dishonest men plenty to guide them to the devil scoundrels that reckons to be the peoples friends and that knows nought about the people and is as insincere as lucifer ive lived aboon forty year in the world and i believe that the people will never have any true friends but theirseln and them two or three good folk i different stations that is friends to all the world human natur taking it i th lump is nought but selfishness it is but excessive few it is but just an exception here and there now and then sich as ye two young uns and me that being in a different sphere can understand t one t other and be friends wiout slavishness o one hand or pride o t other them that reckons to be friends to a lower class than their own fro political motives is never to be trusted they always try to make their inferiors tools for my own part i will neither be patronized nor misled for no mans pleasure ive had overtures made to me lately that i saw were treacherous and i flung em back i the faces o them that offered em  you wont tell us what overtures  i will not it would do no good it would mak no difference them they concerned can look after theirseln  ay wese look after werseln said another voice joe scott had sauntered forth from the church to get a breath of fresh air and there he stood  ill warrant ye joe observed william smiling  and ill warrant my maister was the answeryoung ladies continued joe assuming a lordly air yed better go into th house  i wonder what for inquired shirley to whom the overlookers somewhat pragmatical manners were familiar and who was often at war with him for joe holding supercilious theories about women in general resented greatly in his secret soul the fact of his master and his masters mill being in a manner under petticoat government and had felt as wormwood and gall certain business visits of the heiress to the hollows countinghouse  because there is nought agate that fits women to be consarned in  indeed there is prayer and preaching agate in that church are we not concerned in that  ye have been present neither at the prayer nor preaching maam if i have observed aright what i alluded to was politics william farren here was touching on that subject if im not mistaen  well what then politics are our habitual study joe do you know i see a newspaper every day and two of a sunday  i should think youll read the marriages probably miss and the murders and the accidents and sich like  i read the leading articles joe and the foreign intelligence and i look over the market prices in short i read just what gentlemen read  joe looked as if he thought this talk was like the chattering of a pie he replied to it by a disdainful silence  joe continued miss keeldar i never yet could ascertain properly whether you are a whig or a tory pray which party has the honour of your alliance  it is rayther difficult to explain where you are sure not to be understood was joes haughty response but as to being a tory id as soon be an old woman or a young one which is a more flimsier article still it is the tories that carries on the war and ruins trade and if i be of any partythough political parties is all nonsenseim of that which is most favourable to peace and by consequence to the mercantile interests of this here land  so am i joe replied shirley who had rather a pleasure in teasing the overlooker by persisting in talking on subjects with which he opined she as a woman had no right to meddlepartly at least i have rather a leaning to the agricultural interest too as good reason is seeing that i dont desire england to be under the feet of france and that if a share of my income comes from hollows mill a larger share comes from the landed estate around it it would not do to take any measures injurious to the farmers joe i think  the dews at this hour is unwholesome for females observed joe  if you make that remark out of interest in me i have merely to assure you that i am impervious to cold i should not mind taking my turn to watch the mill one of these summer nights armed with your musket joe  joe scotts chin was always rather prominent he poked it out at this speech some inches farther than usual  butto go back to my sheep she proceededclothier and millowner as i am besides farmer i cannot get out of my head a certain idea that we manufacturers and persons of business are sometimes a littlea very littleselfish and shortsighted in our views and rather too regardless of human suffering rather heartless in our pursuit of gain dont you agree with me joe  i cannot argue where i cannot be comprehended was again the answer  man of mystery your master will argue with me sometimes joe he is not so stiff as you are  maybe not weve all our own ways  joe do you seriously think all the wisdom in the world is lodged in male skulls  i think that women are a kittle and a froward generation and ive a great respect for the doctrines delivered in the second chapter of st pauls first epistle to timothy  what doctrines joe  let the woman learn in silence with all subjection i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve  what has that to do with the business interjected shirley that smacks of rights of primogeniture ill bring it up to mr yorke the first time he inveighs against those rights  and continued joe scott adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression  more shame to adam to sin with his eyes open cried miss keeldar to confess the honest truth joe i never was easy in my mind concerning that chapter it puzzles me  it is very plain miss he that runs may read  he may read it in his own fashion remarked caroline now joining in the dialogue for the first time you allow the right of private judgment i suppose joe  my certy that i do i allow and claim it for every line of the holy book  women may exercise it as well as men  nay women is to take their husbands opinion both in politics and religion its wholesomest for them  oh oh exclaimed both shirley and caroline  to be sure no doubt ont persisted the stubborn overlooker  consider yourself groaned down and cried shame over for such a stupid observation said miss keeldar you might as well say men are to take the opinions of their priests without examination of what value would a religion so adopted be it would be mere blind besotted superstition  and what is your reading miss helstone o these words o st pauls  hem ii account for them in this way he wrote that chapter for a particular congregation of christians under peculiar circumstances and besides i dare say if i could read the original greek i should find that many of the words have been wrongly translated perhaps misapprehended altogether it would be possible i doubt not with a little ingenuity to give the passage quite a contrary turnto make it say let the woman speak out whenever she sees fit to make an objection it is permitted to a woman to teach and to exercise authority as much as may be man meantime cannot do better than hold his peace and so on  that willnt wash miss  i dare say it will my notions are dyed in faster colours than yours joe mr scott you are a thoroughly dogmatical person and always were i like william better than you  joe is well enough in his own house said shirley i have seen him as quiet as a lamb at home there is not a better nor a kinder husband in briarfield he does not dogmatize to his wife  my wife is a hardworking plain woman time and trouble has taen all the conceit out of her but that is not the case with you young misses and then you reckon to have so much knowledge and i my thoughts its only superficial sort o vanities youre acquainted with i can tellhappen a year sinone day miss caroline coming into our countinghouse when i war packing up summat behind t great desk and she didnt see me and she brought a slate wi a sum on it to t maister it war only a bit of a sum in practice that our harry would have settled i two minutes she couldnt do it mr moore had to show her how and when he did show her she couldnt understand him  nonsense joe  nay its no nonsense and miss shirley there reckons to hearken to t maister when hes talking ower trade so attentive like as if she followed him word for word and all war as clear as a ladys lookingglass to her een and all t while shes peeping and peeping out o t window to see if t mare stands quiet and then looking at a bit of a splash on her ridingskirt and then glancing glegly round at wer countinghouse cobwebs and dust and thinking what mucky folk we are and what a grand ride shell have just i now ower nunnely common she hears no more o mr moores talk nor if he spake hebrew  joe you are a real slanderer i would give you your answer only the people are coming out of church we must leave you man of prejudice goodbyewilliam goodbyechildren come up to fieldhead tomorrow and you shall choose what you like best out of mrs gills storeroom     chapter xix  a summer night   the hour was now that of dusk a clear air favoured the kindling of the stars  there will be just light enough to show me the way home said miss keeldar as she prepared to take leave of caroline at the rectory garden door  you must not go alone shirley fanny shall accompany you  that she shall not of what need i be afraid in my own parish i would walk from fieldhead to the church any fine midsummer night three hours later than this for the mere pleasure of seeing the stars and the chance of meeting a fairy  but just wait till the crowd is cleared away  agreed there are the five misses armitage streaming by here comes mrs sykess phaeton mr wynnes close carriage mrs birtwhistles car i dont wish to go through the ceremony of bidding them all goodbye so we will step into the garden and take shelter amongst the laburnums for an instant  the rectors their curates and their churchwardens now issued from the church porch there was a great confabulation shaking of hands congratulation on speeches recommendation to be careful of the night air etc by degrees the throng dispersed the carriages drove off miss keeldar was just emerging from her flowery refuge when mr helstone entered the garden and met her  oh i want you he said i was afraid you were already gonecaroline come here  caroline came expecting as shirley did a lecture on not having been visible at church other subjects however occupied the rectors mind  i shall not sleep at home tonight he continued i have just met with an old friend and promised to accompany him i shall return probably about noon tomorrow thomas the clerk is engaged and i cannot get him to sleep in the house as i usually do when i am absent for a night now  now interrupted shirley you want me as a gentlemanthe first gentleman in briarfield in shortto supply your place be master of the rectory and guardian of your niece and maids while you are away  exactly captain i thought the post would suit you will you favour caroline so far as to be her guest for one night will you stay here instead of going back to fieldhead  and what will mrs pryor do she expects me home  i will send her word come make up your mind to stay it grows late the dew falls heavily you and caroline will enjoy each others society i doubt not  i promise you then to stay with caroline replied shirley as you say we shall enjoy each others society we will not be separated tonight now rejoin your old friend and fear nothing for us  if there should chance to be any disturbance in the night captain if you should hear the picking of a lock the cutting out of a pane of glass a stealthy tread of steps about the house and i need not fear to tell you who bear a welltempered mettlesome heart under your girls ribbon sash that such little incidents are very possible in the present time what would you do  dont know faint perhapsfall down and have to be picked up again but doctor if you assign me the post of honour you must give me arms what weapons are there in your stronghold  you could not wield a sword  no i could manage the carvingknife better  you will find a good one in the diningroom sideboarda ladys knife light to handle and as sharppointed as a poniard  it will suit caroline but you must give me a brace of pistols i know you have pistols  i have two pairs one pair i can place at your disposal you will find them suspended over the mantelpiece of my study in cloth cases  loaded  yes but not on the cock cock them before you go to bed it is paying you a great compliment captain to lend you these were you one of the awkward squad you should not have them  i will take care you need delay no longer mr helstone you may go nowhe is gracious to me to lend me his pistols she remarked as the rector passed out at the garden gate but come lina she continued let us go in and have some supper i was too much vexed at tea with the vicinage of mr sam wynne to be able to eat and now i am really hungry  entering the house they repaired to the darkened diningroom through the open windows of which apartment stole the evening air bearing the perfume of flowers from the garden the very distant sound of farretreating steps from the road and a soft vague murmur whose origin caroline explained by the remark uttered as she stood listening at the casement shirley i hear the beck in the hollow  then she rang the bell asked for a candle and some bread and milkmiss keeldars usual supper and her own fanny when she brought in the tray would have closed the windows and the shutters but was requested to desist for the present the twilight was too calm its breath too balmy to be yet excluded they took their meal in silence caroline rose once to remove to the windowsill a glass of flowers which stood on the sideboard the exhalation from the blossoms being somewhat too powerful for the sultry room in returning she half opened a drawer and took from it something that glittered clear and keen in her hand  you assigned this to me then shirley did you it is bright keenedged finely tapered it is dangerouslooking i never yet felt the impulse which could move me to direct this against a fellowcreature it is difficult to fancy that circumstances could nerve my arm to strike home with this long knife  i should hate to do it replied shirley but i think i could do it if goaded by certain exigencies which i can imagine and miss keeldar quietly sipped her glass of new milk looking somewhat thoughtful and a little pale though indeed when did she not look pale she was never florid  the milk sipped and the bread eaten fanny was again summoned she and eliza were recommended to go to bed which they were quite willing to do being weary of the days exertions of much cutting of currantbuns and filling of urns and teapots and running backwards and forwards with trays ere long the maids chamber door was heard to close caroline took a candle and went quietly all over the house seeing that every window was fast and every door barred she did not even evade the haunted back kitchen nor the vaultlike cellars these visited she returned  there is neither spirit nor flesh in the house at present she said which should not be there it is now near eleven oclock fully bedtime yet i would rather sit up a little longer if you do not object shirley here she continued i have brought the brace of pistols from my uncles study you may examine them at your leisure  she placed them on the table before her friend  why would you rather sit up longer asked miss keeldar taking up the firearms examining them and again laying them down  because i have a strange excited feeling in my heart  so have i  is this state of sleeplessness and restlessness caused by something electrical in the air i wonder  no the sky is clear the stars numberless it is a fine night  but very still i hear the water fret over its stony bed in hollows copse as distinctly as if it ran below the churchyard wall  i am glad it is so still a night a moaning wind or rushing rain would vex me to fever just now  why shirley  because it would baffle my efforts to listen  do you listen towards the hollow  yes it is the only quarter whence we can hear a sound just now  the only one shirley  they both sat near the window and both leaned their arms on the sill and both inclined their heads towards the open lattice they saw each others young faces by the starlight and that dim june twilight which does not wholly fade from the west till dawn begins to break in the east  mr helstone thinks we have no idea which way he is gone murmured miss keeldar nor on what errand nor with what expectations nor how prepared but i guess much do not you  i guess something  all those gentlemenyour cousin moore includedthink that you and i are now asleep in our beds unconscious  caring nothing about themhoping and fearing nothing for them added caroline  both kept silent for full half an hour the night was silent too only the church clock measured its course by quarters some words were interchanged about the chill of the air they wrapped their scarves closer round them resumed their bonnets which they had removed and again watched  towards midnight the teasing monotonous bark of the housedog disturbed the quietude of their vigil caroline rose and made her way noiselessly through the dark passages to the kitchen intending to appease him with a piece of bread she succeeded on returning to the diningroom she found it all dark miss keeldar having extinguished the candle the outline of her shape was visible near the still open window leaning out miss helstone asked no questions she stole to her side the dog recommenced barking furiously suddenly he stopped and seemed to listen the occupants of the diningroom listened too and not merely now to the flow of the millstream there was a nearer though a muffled sound on the road below the churchyarda measured beating approaching sounda dull tramp of marching feet  it drew near those who listened by degrees comprehended its extent it was not the tread of two nor of a dozen nor of a score of men it was the tread of hundreds they could see nothing the high shrubs of the garden formed a leafy screen between them and the road to hear however was not enough and this they felt as the troop trod forwards and seemed actually passing the rectory they felt it more when a human voicethough that voice spoke but one wordbroke the hush of the night  halt  a halt followed the march was arrested then came a low conference of which no word was distinguishable from the diningroom  we must hear this said shirley  she turned took her pistols from the table silently passed out through the middle window of the diningroom which was in fact a glass door stole down the walk to the garden wall and stood listening under the lilacs caroline would not have quitted the house had she been alone but where shirley went she would go she glanced at the weapon on the sideboard but left it behind her and presently stood at her friends side they dared not look over the wall for fear of being seen they were obliged to crouch behind it they heard these words  it looks a rambling old building who lives in it besides the damned parson  only three womenhis niece and two servants  do you know where they sleep  the lasses behind the niece in a front room  and helstone  yonder is his chamber he was burning a light but i see none now  where would you get in  if i were ordered to do his joband he desarves itid try yond long window it opens to the diningroom i could grope my way upstairs and i know his chamber  how would you manage about the women folk  let em alone except they shrieked and then id soon quieten em i could wish to find the old chap asleep if he waked hed be dangerous  has he arms  firearms allusand allus loadened  then youre a fool to stop us here a shot would give the alarm moore would be on us before we could turn round we should miss our main object  you might go on i tell you id engage helstone alone  a pause one of the party dropped some weapon which rang on the stone causeway at this sound the rectory dog barked again furiouslyfiercely  that spoils all said the voice hell awake a noise like that might rouse the dead you did not say there was a dog damn you forward  forward they wenttramp trampwith mustering manifold slowfiling tread they were gone  shirley stood erect looked over the wall along the road  not a soul remains she said  she stood and mused thank god was the next observation  caroline repeated the ejaculationnot in so steady a tone she was trembling much her heart was beating fast and thick her face was cold her forehead damp  thank god for us she reiterated but what will happen elsewhere they have passed us by that they may make sure of others  they have done well returned shirley with composure the others will defend themselves they can do it they are prepared for them with us it is otherwise my finger was on the trigger of this pistol i was quite ready to give that man if he had entered such a greeting as he little calculated on but behind him followed three hundred i had neither three hundred hands nor three hundred weapons i could not have effectually protected either you myself or the two poor women asleep under that roof therefore i again earnestly thank god for insult and peril escaped  after a second pause she continued what is it my duty and wisdom to do next not to stay here inactive i am glad to say but of course to walk over to the hollow  to the hollow shirley  to the hollow will you go with me  where those men are gone  they have taken the highway we should not encounter them the road over the fields is as safe silent and solitary as a path through the air would be will you go  yes was the answer given mechanically not because the speaker wished or was prepared to go or indeed was otherwise than scared at the prospect of going but because she felt she could not abandon shirley  then we must fasten up these windows and leave all as secure as we can behind us do you know what we are going for cary  yesnobecause you wish it  is that all and are you so obedient to a mere caprice of mine what a docile wife you would make to a stern husband the moons face is not whiter than yours at this moment and the aspen at the gate does not tremble more than your busy fingers and so tractable and terrorstruck and dismayed and devoted you would follow me into the thick of real danger cary let me give your fidelity a motive we are going for moores saketo see if we can be of use to him to make an effort to warn him of what is coming  to be sure i am a blind weak fool and you are acute and sensible shirley i will go with you i will gladly go with you  i do not doubt it you would die blindly and meekly for me but you would intelligently and gladly die for moore but in truth there is no question of death tonight we run no risk at all  caroline rapidly closed shutter and lattice do not fear that i shall not have breath to run as fast as you can possibly run shirley take my hand let us go straight across the fields  but you cannot climb walls  tonight i can  you are afraid of hedges and the beck which we shall be forced to cross  i can cross it  they started they ran many a wall checked but did not baffle them shirley was surefooted and agile she could spring like a deer when she chose caroline more timid and less dexterous fell once or twice and bruised herself but she rose again directly saying she was not hurt a quickset hedge bounded the last field they lost time in seeking a gap in it the aperture when found was narrow but they worked their way through the long hair the tender skin the silks and the muslins suffered but what was chiefly regretted was the impediment this difficulty had caused to speed on the other side they met the beck flowing deep in a rough bed at this point a narrow plank formed the only bridge across it shirley had trodden the plank successfully and fearlessly many a time before caroline had never yet dared to risk the transit  i will carry you across said miss keeldar you are light and i am not weak let me try  if i fall in you may fish me out was the answer as a grateful squeeze compressed her hand caroline without pausing trod forward on the trembling plank as if it were a continuation of the firm turf shirley who followed did not cross it more resolutely or safely in their present humour on their present errand a strong and foaming channel would have been a barrier to neither at the moment they were above the control either of fire or water all stilbro moor alight and aglow with bonfires would not have stopped them nor would calder or aire thundering in flood yet one sound made them pause scarce had they set foot on the solid opposite bank when a shot split the air from the north one second elapsed further off burst a like note in the south within the space of three minutes similar signals boomed in the east and west  i thought we were dead at the first explosion observed shirley drawing a long breath i felt myself hit in the temples and i concluded your heart was pierced but the reiterated voice was an explanation those are signalsit is their waythe attack must be near we should have had wings our feet have not borne us swiftly enough  a portion of the copse was now to clear when they emerged from it the mill lay just below them they could look down upon the buildings the yard they could see the road beyond and the first glance in that direction told shirley she was right in her conjecture they were already too late to give warning it had taken more time than they calculated on to overcome the various obstacles which embarrassed the short cut across the fields  the road which should have been white was dark with a moving mass the rioters were assembled in front of the closed yard gates and a single figure stood within apparently addressing them the mill itself was perfectly black and still there was neither life light nor motion around it  surely he is prepared surely that is not moore meeting them alone whispered shirley  it is we must go to him i will go to him  that you will not  why did i come then i came only for him i shall join him  fortunately it is out of your power there is no entrance to the yard  there is a small entrance at the back besides the gates in front it opens by a secret method which i know i will try it  not with my leave  miss keeldar clasped her round the waist with both arms and held her back not one step shall you stir she went on authoritatively at this moment moore would be both shocked and embarrassed if he saw either you or me men never want women near them in time of real danger  i would not troublei would help him was the reply  howby inspiring him with heroism pooh these are not the days of chivalry it is not a tilt at a tournament we are going to behold but a struggle about money and food and life  it is natural that i should be at his side  as queen of his heart his mill is his ladylove cary backed by his factory and his frames he has all the encouragement he wants or can know it is not for love or beauty but for ledger and broadcloth he is going to break a spear dont be sentimental robert is not so  i could help him i will seek him  off theni let you goseek moore youll not find him  she loosened her hold caroline sped like levelled shaft from bent bow after her rang a jesting gibing laugh look well there is no mistake was the warning given  but there was a mistake miss helstone paused hesitated gazed the figure had suddenly retreated from the gate and was running back hastily to the mill  make haste lina cried shirley meet him before he enters  caroline slowly returned it is not robert she said it has neither his height form nor bearing  i saw it was not robert when i let you go how could you imagine it it is a shabby little figure of a private soldier they had posted him as sentinel he is safe in the mill now i saw the door open and admit him my mind grows easier robert is prepared our warning would have been superfluous and now i am thankful we came too late to give it it has saved us the trouble of a scene how fine to have entered the countinghouse toute éperdue and to have found oneself in presence of messrs armitage and ramsden smoking malone swaggering your uncle sneering mr sykes sipping a cordial and moore himself in his cold manofbusiness vein i am glad we missed it all  i wonder if there are many in the mill shirley  plenty to defend it the soldiers we have twice seen today were going there no doubt and the group we noticed surrounding your cousin in the fields will be with him  what are they doing now shirley what is that noise  hatchets and crowbars against the yard gates they are forcing them are you afraid  no but my heart throbs fast i have a difficulty in standing i will sit down do you feel unmoved  hardly that but i am glad i came we shall see what transpires with our own eyes we are here on the spot and none know it instead of amazing the curate the clothier and the corndealer with a romantic rush on the stage we stand alone with the friendly night its mute stars and these whispering trees whose report our friends will not come to gather  shirley shirley the gates are down that crash was like the felling of great trees now they are pouring through they will break down the mill doors as they have broken the gate what can robert do against so many would to god i were a little nearer himcould hear him speakcould speak to him with my willmy longing to serve himi could not be a useless burden in his way i could be turned to some account  they come on cried shirley how steadily they march in there is discipline in their ranks i will not say there is couragehundreds against tens are no proof of that qualitybut she dropped her voice there is suffering and desperation enough amongst them these goads will urge them forwards  forwards against robert and they hate him shirley is there much danger they will win the day  we shall see moore and helstone are of earths first bloodno bunglersno cravens  a crashsmashshiverstopped their whispers a simultaneously hurled volley of stones had saluted the broad front of the mill with all its windows and now every pane of every lattice lay in shattered and pounded fragments a yell followed this demonstrationa rioters yella northofengland a yorkshire a westriding a westridingclothingdistrictofyorkshire rioters yell  you never heard that sound perhaps reader so much the better for your earsperhaps for your heart since if it rends the air in hate to yourself or to the men or principles you approve the interests to which you wish well wrath wakens to the cry of hate the lion shakes his mane and rises to the howl of the hyena caste stands up ireful against caste and the indignant wronged spirit of the middle rank bears down in zeal and scorn on the famished and furious mass of the operative class it is difficult to be tolerant difficult to be just in such moments  caroline rose shirley put her arm round her they stood together as still as the straight stems of two trees that yell was a long one and when it ceased the night was yet full of the swaying and murmuring of a crowd  what next was the question of the listeners nothing came yet the mill remained mute as a mausoleum  he cannot be alone whispered caroline  i would stake all i have that he is as little alone as he is alarmed responded shirley  shots were discharged by the rioters had the defenders waited for this signal it seemed so the hitherto inert and passive mill woke fire flashed from its empty windowframes a volley of musketry pealed sharp through the hollow  moore speaks at last said shirley and he seems to have the gift of tongues that was not a single voice  he has been forbearing no one can accuse him of rashness alleged caroline their discharge preceded his they broke his gates and his windows they fired at his garrison before he repelled them  what was going on now it seemed difficult in the darkness to distinguish but something terrible a stillrenewing tumult was obviousfierce attacks desperate repulses the millyard the mill itself was full of battle movement there was scarcely any cessation now of the discharge of firearms and there was struggling rushing trampling and shouting between the aim of the assailants seemed to be to enter the mill that of the defenders to beat them off they heard the rebel leader cry to the back lads they heard a voice retort come round we will meet you  to the countinghouse was the order again  welcome we shall have you there was the response and accordingly the fiercest blaze that had yet glowed the loudest rattle that had yet been heard burst from the countinghouse front when the mass of rioters rushed up to it  the voice that had spoken was moores own voice they could tell by its tones that his soul was now warm with the conflict they could guess that the fighting animal was roused in every one of those men there struggling together and was for the time quite paramount above the rational human being  both the girls felt their faces glow and their pulses throb both knew they would do no good by rushing down into the mêlée they desired neither to deal nor to receive blows but they could not have run awaycaroline no more than shirley they could not have fainted they could not have taken their eyes from the dim terrible scenefrom the mass of cloud of smoke the musketlightningfor the world  how and when would it end was the demand throbbing in their throbbing pulses would a juncture arise in which they could be useful was what they waited to see for though shirley put off their toolate arrival with a jest and was ever ready to satirize her own or any other persons enthusiasm she would have given a farm of her best land for a chance of rendering good service  the chance was not vouchsafed her the lookedfor juncture never came it was not likely moore had expected this attack for days perhaps weeks he was prepared for it at every point he had fortified and garrisoned his mill which in itself was a strong building he was a cool brave man he stood to the defence with unflinching firmness those who were with him caught his spirit and copied his demeanour the rioters had never been so met before at other mills they had attacked they had found no resistance an organized resolute defence was what they never dreamed of encountering when their leaders saw the steady fire kept up from the mill witnessed the composure and determination of its owner heard themselves coolly defied and invited on to death and beheld their men falling wounded round them they felt that nothing was to be done here in haste they mustered their forces drew them away from the building a roll was called over in which the men answered to figures instead of names they dispersed wide over the fields leaving silence and ruin behind them the attack from its commencement to its termination had not occupied an hour  day was by this time approaching the west was dim the east beginning to gleam it would have seemed that the girls who had watched this conflict would now wish to hasten to the victors on whose side all their interest had been enlisted but they only very cautiously approached the now battered mill and when suddenly a number of soldiers and gentlemen appeared at the great door opening into the yard they quickly stepped aside into a shed the deposit of old iron and timber whence they could see without being seen  it was no cheering spectacle these premises were now a mere blot of desolation on the fresh front of the summer dawn all the copse up the hollow was shady and dewy the hill at its head was green but just here in the centre of the sweet glen discord broken loose in the night from control had beaten the ground with his stamping hoofs and left it waste and pulverized the mill yawned all ruinous with unglazed frames the yard was thickly bestrewn with stones and brickbats and close under the mill with the glittering fragments of the shattered windows muskets and other weapons lay here and there more than one deep crimson stain was visible on the gravel a human body lay quiet on its face near the gates and five or six wounded men writhed and moaned in the bloody dust  miss keeldars countenance changed at this view it was the aftertaste of the battle death and pain replacing excitement and exertion it was the blackness the bright fire leaves when its blaze is sunk its warmth failed and its glow faded  this is what i wished to prevent she said in a voice whose cadence betrayed the altered impulse of her heart  but you could not prevent it you did your bestit was in vain said caroline comfortingly dont grieve shirley  i am sorry for those poor fellows was the answer while the spark in her glance dissolved to dew are any within the mill hurt i wonder is that your uncle  it is and there is mr malone and o shirley there is robert  well resuming her former tone dont squeeze your fingers quite into my hand i see there is nothing wonderful in that we knew he at least was here whoever might be absent  he is coming here towards us shirley  towards the pump that is to say for the purpose of washing his hands and his forehead which has got a scratch i perceive  he bleeds shirley dont hold me i must go  not a step  he is hurt shirley  fiddlestick  but i must go to him i wish to go so much i cannot bear to be restrained  what for  to speak to him to ask how he is and what i can do for him  to tease and annoy him to make a spectacle of yourself and him before those soldiers mr malone your uncle et cetera would he like it think you would you like to remember it a week hence  am i always to be curbed and kept down demanded caroline a little passionately  for his sake yes and still more for your own i tell you if you showed yourself now you would repent it an hour hence and so would robert  you think he would not like it shirley  far less than he would like our stopping him to say goodnight which you were so sore about  but that was all play there was no danger  and this is serious work he must be unmolested  i only wish to go to him because he is my cousinyou understand  i quite understand but now watch him he has bathed his forehead and the blood has ceased trickling his hurt is really a mere graze i can see it from hence he is going to look after the wounded men  accordingly mr moore and mr helstone went round the yard examining each prostrate form they then gave directions to have the wounded taken up and carried into the mill this duty being performed joe scott was ordered to saddle his masters horse and mr helstones pony and the two gentlemen rode away full gallop to seek surgical aid in different directions  caroline was not yet pacified  shirley shirley i should have liked to speak one word to him before he went she murmured while the tears gathered glittering in her eyes  why do you cry lina asked miss keeldar a little sternly you ought to be glad instead of sorry robert has escaped any serious harm he is victorious he has been cool and brave in combat he is now considerate in triumph is this a timeare these causes for weeping  you do not know what i have in my heart pleaded the otherwhat pain what distractionnor whence it arises i can understand that you should exult in roberts greatness and goodness so do i in one sense but in another i feel so miserable i am too far removed from him i used to be nearer let me alone shirley do let me cry a few minutes it relieves me  miss keeldar feeling her tremble in every limb ceased to expostulate with her she went out of the shed and left her to weep in peace it was the best plan in a few minutes caroline rejoined her much calmer she said with her natural docile gentle manner come shirley we will go home now i promise not to try to see robert again till he asks for me i never will try to push myself on him i thank you for restraining me just now  i did it with a good intention returned miss keeldar  now dear lina she continued let us turn our faces to the cool morning breeze and walk very quietly back to the rectory we will steal in as we stole out none shall know where we have been or what we have seen tonight neither taunt nor misconstruction can consequently molest us tomorrow we will see robert and be of good cheer but i will say no more lest i should begin to cry too i seem hard towards you but i am not so     chapter xx  tomorrow   the two girls met no living soul on their way back to the rectory they let themselves in noiselessly they stole upstairs unheardthe breaking morning gave them what light they needed shirley sought her couch immediately and though the room was strangefor she had never slept at the rectory beforeand though the recent scene was one unparalleled for excitement and terror by any it had hitherto been her lot to witness yet scarce was her head laid on the pillow ere a deep refreshing sleep closed her eyes and calmed her senses  perfect health was shirleys enviable portion though warmhearted and sympathetic she was not nervous powerful emotions could rouse and sway without exhausting her spirit the tempest troubled and shook her while it lasted but it left her elasticity unbent and her freshness quite unblighted as every day brought her stimulating emotion so every night yielded her recreating rest caroline now watched her sleeping and read the serenity of her mind in the beauty of her happy countenance  for herself being of a different temperament she could not sleep the commonplace excitement of the teadrinking and schoolgathering would alone have sufficed to make her restless all night the effect of the terrible drama which had just been enacted before her eyes was not likely to quit her for days it was vain even to try to retain a recumbent posture she sat up by shirleys side counting the slow minutes and watching the june sun mount the heavens  life wastes fast in such vigils as caroline had of late but too often keptvigils during which the mind having no pleasant food to nourish it no manna of hope no hivedhoney of joyous memories tries to live on the meagre diet of wishes and failing to derive thence either delight or support and feeling itself ready to perish with craving want turns to philosophy to resolution to resignation calls on all these gods for aid calls vainlyis unheard unhelped and languishes  caroline was a christian therefore in trouble she framed many a prayer after the christian creed preferred it with deep earnestness begged for patience strength relief this world however we all know is the scene of trial and probation and for any favourable result her petitions had yet wrought it seemed to her that they were unheard and unaccepted she believed sometimes that god had turned his face from her at moments she was a calvinist and sinking into the gulf of religious despair she saw darkening over her the doom of reprobation  most people have had a period or periods in their lives when they have felt thus forsakenwhen having long hoped against hope and still seen the day of fruition deferred their hearts have truly sickened within them this is a terrible hour but it is often that darkest point which precedes the rise of daythat turn of the year when the icy january wind carries over the waste at once the dirge of departing winter and the prophecy of coming spring the perishing birds however cannot thus understand the blast before which they shiver and as little can the suffering soul recognize in the climax of its affliction the dawn of its deliverance yet let whoever grieves still cling fast to love and faith in god god will never deceive never finally desert him whom he loveth he chasteneth these words are true and should not be forgotten  the household was astir at last the servants were up the shutters were opened below caroline as she quitted the couch which had been but a thorny one to her felt that revival of spirits which the return of day of action gives to all but the wholly despairing or actually dying she dressed herself as usual carefully trying so to arrange her hair and attire that nothing of the forlornness she felt at heart should be visible externally she looked as fresh as shirley when both were dressed only that miss keeldars eyes were lively and miss helstones languid  today i shall have much to say to moore were shirleys first words and you could see in her face that life was full of interest expectation and occupation for her he will have to undergo crossexamination she added i dare say he thinks he has outwitted me cleverly and this is the way men deal with womenstill concealing danger from themthinking i suppose to spare them pain they imagined we little knew where they were tonight we know they little conjectured where we were men i believe fancy womens minds something like those of children now that is a mistake  this was said as she stood at the glass training her naturally waved hair into curls by twining it round her fingers she took up the theme again five minutes after as caroline fastened her dress and clasped her girdle  if men could see us as we really are they would be a little amazed but the cleverest the acutest men are often under an illusion about women they do not read them in a true light they misapprehend them both for good and evil their good woman is a queer thing half doll half angel their bad woman almost always a fiend then to hear them fall into ecstasies with each others creationsworshipping the heroine of such a poem novel dramathinking it fine divine fine and divine it may be but often quite artificialfalse as the rose in my best bonnet there if i spoke all i think on this point if i gave my real opinion of some firstrate female characters in firstrate works where should i be dead under a cairn of avenging stones in half an hour  shirley you chatter so i cant fasten you be still and after all authors heroines are almost as good as authoresses heroes  not at all women read men more truly than men read women ill prove that in a magazine paper some day when ive time only it will never be inserted it will be declined with thanks and left for me at the publishers  to be sure you could not write cleverly enough you dont know enough you are not learned shirley  god knows i cant contradict you cary im as ignorant as a stone theres one comfort however you are not much better  they descended to breakfast  i wonder how mrs pryor and hortense moore have passed the night said caroline as she made the coffee selfish being that i am i never thought of either of them till just now they will have heard all the tumult fieldhead and the cottage are so near and hortense is timid in such mattersso no doubt is mrs pryor  take my word for it lina moore will have contrived to get his sister out of the way she went home with miss mann he will have quartered her there for the night as to mrs pryor i own i am uneasy about her but in another halfhour we will be with her  by this time the news of what had happened at the hollow was spread all over the neighbourhood fanny who had been to fieldhead to fetch the milk returned in panting haste with tidings that there had been a battle in the night at mr moores mill and that some said twenty men were killed eliza during fannys absence had been apprised by the butchers boy that the mill was burnt to the ground both women rushed into the parlour to announce these terrible facts to the ladies terminating their clear and accurate narrative by the assertion that they were sure master must have been in it all he and thomas the clerk they were confident must have gone last night to join mr moore and the soldiers mr malone too had not been heard of at his lodgings since yesterday afternoon and joe scotts wife and family were in the greatest distress wondering what had become of their head  scarcely was this information imparted when a knock at the kitchen door announced the fieldhead errandboy arrived in hot haste bearing a billet from mrs pryor it was hurriedly written and urged miss keeldar to return directly as the neighbourhood and the house seemed likely to be all in confusion and orders would have to be given which the mistress of the hall alone could regulate in a postscript it was entreated that miss helstone might not be left alone at the rectory she had better it was suggested accompany miss keeldar  there are not two opinions on that head said shirley as she tied on her own bonnet and then ran to fetch carolines  but what will fanny and eliza do and if my uncle returns  your uncle will not return yet he has other fish to fry he will be galloping backwards and forwards from briarfield to stilbro all day rousing the magistrates in the courthouse and the officers at the barracks and fanny and eliza can have in joe scotts and the clerks wives to bear them company besides of course there is no real danger to be apprehended now weeks will elapse before the rioters can again rally or plan any other attempt and i am much mistaken if moore and mr helstone will not take advantage of last nights outbreak to quell them altogether they will frighten the authorities of stilbro into energetic measures i only hope they will not be too severenot pursue the discomfited too relentlessly  robert will not be cruel we saw that last night said caroline  but he will be hard retorted shirley and so will your uncle  as they hurried along the meadow and plantation path to fieldhead they saw the distant highway already alive with an unwonted flow of equestrians and pedestrians tending in the direction of the usually solitary hollow on reaching the hall they found the backyard gates open and the court and kitchen seemed crowded with excited milkfetchersmen women and childrenwhom mrs gill the housekeeper appeared vainly persuading to take their milkcans and depart it is or was bythebye the custom in the north of england for the cottagers on a country squires estate to receive their supplies of milk and butter from the dairy of the manor house on whose pastures a herd of milch kine was usually fed for the convenience of the neighbourhood miss keeldar owned such a herdall deepdewlapped craven cows reared on the sweet herbage and clear waters of bonny airedale and very proud she was of their sleek aspect and high condition seeing now the state of matters and that it was desirable to effect a clearance of the premises shirley stepped in amongst the gossiping groups she bade them goodmorning with a certain frank tranquil easethe natural characteristic of her manner when she addressed numbers especially if those numbers belonged to the workingclass she was cooler amongst her equals and rather proud to those above her she then asked them if they had all got their milk measured out and understanding that they had she further observed that she wondered what they were waiting for then  were just talking a bit over this battle there has been at your mill mistress replied a man  talking a bit just like you said shirley it is a queer thing all the world is so fond of talking over events you talk if anybody dies suddenly you talk if a fire breaks out you talk if a millowner fails you talk if hes murdered what good does your talking do  there is nothing the lower orders like better than a little downright goodhumoured rating flattery they scorn very much honest abuse they enjoy they call it speaking plainly and take a sincere delight in being the objects thereof the homely harshness of miss keeldars salutation won her the ear of the whole throng in a second  were no war nor some at is aboon us are we asked a man smiling  nor a whit better you that should be models of industry are just as gossiploving as the idle fine rich people that have nothing to do may be partly excused for trifling their time away you who have to earn your bread with the sweat of your brow are quite inexcusable  thats queer mistress suld we never have a holiday because we work hard  never was the prompt answer unless added the mistress with a smile that half belied the severity of her speechunless you knew how to make a better use of it than to get together over rum and tea if you are women or over beer and pipes if you are men and talk scandal at your neighbours expense come friends she added changing at once from bluntness to courtesy oblige me by taking your cans and going home i expect several persons to call today and it will be inconvenient to have the avenues to the house crowded  yorkshire people are as yielding to persuasion as they are stubborn against compulsion the yard was clear in five minutes  thank you and goodbye to you friends said shirley as she closed the gates on a quiet court  now let me hear the most refined of cockneys presume to find fault with yorkshire manners taken as they ought to be the majority of the lads and lasses of the west riding are gentlemen and ladies every inch of them it is only against the weak affectation and futile pomposity of a wouldbe aristocrat they turn mutinous  entering by the back way the young ladies passed through the kitchen or house as the inner kitchen is called to the hall mrs pryor came running down the oak staircase to meet them she was all unnerved her naturally sanguine complexion was pale her usually placid though timid blue eye was wandering unsettled alarmed she did not however break out into any exclamations or hurried narrative of what had happened her predominant feeling had been in the course of the night and was now this morning a sense of dissatisfaction with herself that she could not feel firmer cooler more equal to the demands of the occasion  you are aware she began with a trembling voice and yet the most conscientious anxiety to avoid exaggeration in what she was about to say that a body of rioters has attacked mr moores mill tonight we heard the firing and confusion very plainly here we none of us slept it was a sad night the house has been in great bustle all the morning with people coming and going the servants have applied to me for orders and directions which i really did not feel warranted in giving mr moore has i believe sent up for refreshments for the soldiers and others engaged in the defence for some conveniences also for the wounded i could not undertake the responsibility of giving orders or taking measures i fear delay may have been injurious in some instances but this is not my house you were absent my dear miss keeldar what could i do  were no refreshments sent asked shirley while her countenance hitherto so clear propitious and quiet even while she was rating the milkfetchers suddenly turned dark and warm  i think not my dear  and nothing for the woundedno linen no wine no bedding  i think not i cannot tell what mrs gill did but it seemed impossible to me at the moment to venture to dispose of your property by sending supplies to soldiers provisions for a company of soldiers sounds formidable how many there are i did not ask but i could not think of allowing them to pillage the house as it were i intended to do what was right yet i did not see the case quite clearly i own  it lies in a nutshell notwithstanding these soldiers have risked their lives in defence of my property i suppose they have a right to my gratitude the wounded are our fellowcreatures i suppose we should aid themmrs gill  she turned and called in a voice more clear than soft it rang through the thick oak of the hall and kitchen doors more effectually than a bells summons mrs gill who was deep in breadmaking came with hands and apron in culinary case not having dared to stop to rub the dough from the one or to shake the flour from the other her mistress had never called a servant in that voice save once before and that was when she had seen from the window tartar in full tug with two carriers dogs each of them a match for him in size if not in courage and their masters standing by encouraging their animals while hers was unbefriended then indeed she had summoned john as if the day of judgment were at hand nor had she waited for the said johns coming but had walked out into the lane bonnetless and after informing the carriers that she held them far less of men than the three brutes whirling and worrying in the dust before them had put her hands round the thick neck of the largest of the curs and given her whole strength to the essay of choking it from tartars torn and bleeding eye just above and below which organ the vengeful fangs were inserted five or six men were presently on the spot to help her but she never thanked one of them they might have come before if their will had been good she said she had not a word for anybody during the rest of the day but sat near the hall fire till evening watching and tending tartar who lay all gory stiff and swelled on a mat at her feet she wept furtively over him sometimes and murmured the softest words of pity and endearment in tones whose music the old scarred canine warrior acknowledged by licking her hand or her sandal alternately with his own red wounds as to john his lady turned a cold shoulder on him for a week afterwards  mrs gill remembering this little episode came all of a tremble as she said herself in a firm brief voice miss keeldar proceeded to put questions and give orders that at such a time fieldhead should have evinced the inhospitality of a misers hovel stung her haughty spirit to the quick and the revolt of its pride was seen in the heaving of her heart stirred stormily under the lace and silk which veiled it  how long is it since that message came from the mill  not an hour yet maam answered the housekeeper soothingly  not an hour you might almost as well have said not a day they will have applied elsewhere by this time send a man instantly down to tell them that everything this house contains is at mr moores mr helstones and the soldiers service do that first  while the order was being executed shirley moved away from her friends and stood at the hallwindow silent unapproachable when mrs gill came back she turned the purple flush which painful excitement kindles on a pale cheek glowed on hers the spark which displeasure lights in a dark eye fired her glance  let the contents of the larder and the winecellar be brought up put into the haycarts and driven down to the hollow if there does not happen to be much bread or much meat in the house go to the butcher and baker and desire them to send what they have but i will see for myself  she moved off  all will be right soon she will get over it in an hour whispered caroline to mrs pryor go upstairs dear madam she added affectionately and try to be as calm and easy as you can the truth is shirley will blame herself more than you before the day is over  by dint of a few more gentle assurances and persuasions miss helstone contrived to soothe the agitated lady having accompanied her to her apartment and promised to rejoin her there when things were settled caroline left her to see as she said if she could be useful she presently found that she could be very useful for the retinue of servants at fieldhead was by no means numerous and just now their mistress found plenty of occupation for all the hands at her command and for her own also the delicate goodnature and dexterous activity which caroline brought to the aid of the housekeeper and maidsall somewhat scared by their ladys unwonted mooddid a world of good at once it helped the assistants and appeased the directress a chance glance and smile from caroline moved shirley to an answering smile directly the former was carrying a heavy basket up the cellar stairs  this is a shame cried shirley running to her it will strain your arm  she took it from her and herself bore it out into the yard the cloud of temper was dispelled when she came back the flash in her eye was melted the shade on her forehead vanished she resumed her usual cheerful and cordial manner to those about her tempering her revived spirits with a little of the softness of shame at her previous unjust anger  she was still superintending the lading of the cart when a gentleman entered the yard and approached her ere she was aware of his presence  i hope i see miss keeldar well this morning he said examining with rather significant scrutiny her still flushed face  she gave him a look and then again bent to her employment without reply a pleasant enough smile played on her lips but she hid it the gentleman repeated his salutation stooping that it might reach her ear with more facility  well enough if she be good enough was the answer and so is mr moore too i dare say to speak truth i am not anxious about him some slight mischance would be only his just due his conduct has beenwe will say strange just now till we have time to characterize it by a more exact epithet meantime may i ask what brings him here  mr helstone and i have just received your message that everything at fieldhead was at our service we judged by the unlimited wording of the gracious intimation that you would be giving yourself too much trouble i perceive our conjecture was correct we are not a regiment rememberonly about half a dozen soldiers and as many civilians allow me to retrench something from these too abundant supplies  miss keeldar blushed while she laughed at her own overeager generosity and most disproportionate calculations moore laughed too very quietly though and as quietly he ordered basket after basket to be taken from the cart and remanded vessel after vessel to the cellar  the rector must hear of this he said he will make a good story of it what an excellent army contractor miss keeldar would have been again he laughed adding it is precisely as i conjectured  you ought to be thankful said shirley and not mock me what could i do how could i gauge your appetites or number your band for aught i knew there might have been fifty of you at least to victual you told me nothing and then an application to provision soldiers naturally suggests large ideas  it appears so remarked moore levelling another of his keen quiet glances at the discomfited shirleynow he continued addressing the carter i think you may take what remains to the hollow your load will be somewhat lighter than the one miss keeldar destined you to carry  as the vehicle rumbled out of the yard shirley rallying her spirits demanded what had become of the wounded  there was not a single man hurt on our side was the answer  you were hurt yourself on the temples interposed a quick low voicethat of caroline who having withdrawn within the shade of the door and behind the large person of mrs gill had till now escaped moores notice when she spoke his eye searched the obscurity of her retreat  are you much hurt she inquired  as you might scratch your finger with a needle in sewing  lift your hair and let us see  he took his hat off and did as he was bid disclosing only a narrow slip of courtplaster caroline indicated by a slight movement of the head that she was satisfied and disappeared within the clear obscure of the interior  how did she know i was hurt asked moore  by rumour no doubt but it is too good in her to trouble herself about you for my part it was of your victims i was thinking when i inquired after the wounded what damage have your opponents sustained  one of the rioters or victims as you call them was killed and six were hurt  what have you done with them  what you will perfectly approve medical aid was procured immediately and as soon as we can get a couple of covered wagons and some clean straw they will be removed to stilbro  straw you must have beds and bedding i will send my wagon directly properly furnished and mr yorke i am sure will send his  you guess correctly he has volunteered already and mrs yorkewho like you seems disposed to regard the rioters as martyrs and me and especially mr helstone as murderersis at this moment i believe most assiduously engaged in fitting it up with featherbeds pillows bolsters blankets etc the victims lack no attentions i promise you mr hall your favourite parson has been with them ever since six oclock exhorting them praying with them and even waiting on them like any nurse and carolines good friend miss ainley that very plain old maid sent in a stock of lint and linen something in the proportion of another ladys allowance of beef and wine  that will do where is your sister  well cared for i had her securely domiciled with miss mann this very morning the two set out for wormwood wells a noted wateringplace and will stay there some weeks  so mr helstone domiciled me at the rectory mighty clever you gentlemen think you are i make you heartily welcome to the idea and hope its savour as you chew the cud of reflection upon it gives you pleasure acute and astute why are you not also omniscient how is it that events transpire under your very noses of which you have no suspicion it should be so otherwise the exquisite gratification of outmanoeuvring you would be unknown ah friend you may search my countenance but you cannot read it  moore indeed looked as if he could not  you think me a dangerous specimen of my sex dont you now  a peculiar one at least  but carolineis she peculiar  in her wayyes  her way what is her way  you know her as well as i do  and knowing her i assert that she is neither eccentric nor difficult of control is she  that depends  however there is nothing masculine about her  why lay such emphasis on her do you consider her a contrast in that respect to yourself  you do no doubt but that does not signify caroline is neither masculine nor of what they call the spirited order of women  i have seen her flash out  so have i but not with manly fire it was a short vivid trembling glow that shot up shone vanished  and left her scared at her own daring you describe others besides caroline  the point i wish to establish is that miss helstone though gentle tractable and candid enough is still perfectly capable of defying even mr moores penetration  what have you and she been doing asked moore suddenly  have you had any breakfast  what is your mutual mystery  if you are hungry mrs gill will give you something to eat here step into the oak parlour and ring the bell you will be served as if at an inn or if you like better go back to the hollow  the alternative is not open to me i must go back goodmorning the first leisure i have i will see you again     chapter xxi  mrs pryor   while shirley was talking with moore caroline rejoined mrs pryor upstairs she found that lady deeply depressed she would not say that miss keeldars hastiness had hurt her feelings but it was evident an inward wound galled her to any but a congenial nature she would have seemed insensible to the quiet tender attentions by which miss helstone sought to impart solace but caroline knew that unmoved or slightly moved as she looked she felt valued and was healed by them  i am deficient in selfconfidence and decision she said at last i always have been deficient in those qualities yet i think miss keeldar should have known my character well enough by this time to be aware that i always feel an even painful solicitude to do right to act for the best the unusual nature of the demand on my judgment puzzled me especially following the alarms of the night i could not venture to act promptly for another but i trust no serious harm will result from my lapse of firmness  a gentle knock was here heard at the door it was half opened  caroline come here said a low voice  miss helstone went out there stood shirley in the gallery looking contrite ashamed sorry as any repentant child  how is mrs pryor she asked  rather out of spirits said caroline  i have behaved very shamefully very ungenerously very ungratefully to her said shirley how insolent in me to turn on her thus for what after all was no faultonly an excess of conscientiousness on her part but i regret my error most sincerely tell her so and ask if she will forgive me  caroline discharged the errand with heartfelt pleasure mrs pryor rose came to the door she did not like scenes she dreaded them as all timid people do she said falteringly come in my dear  shirley did come in with some impetuosity she threw her arms round her governess and while she kissed her heartily she said you know you must forgive me mrs pryor i could not get on at all if there was a misunderstanding between you and me  i have nothing to forgive was the reply we will pass it over now if you please the final result of the incident is that it proves more plainly than ever how unequal i am to certain crises  and that was the painful feeling which would remain on mrs pryors mind no effort of shirleys or carolines could efface it thence she could forgive her offending pupil not her innocent self  miss keeldar doomed to be in constant request during the morning was presently summoned downstairs again the rector called first a lively welcome and livelier reprimand were at his service he expected both and being in high spirits took them in equally good part  in the course of his brief visit he quite forgot to ask after his niece the riot the rioters the mill the magistrates the heiress absorbed all his thoughts to the exclusion of family ties he alluded to the part himself and curate had taken in the defence of the hollow  the vials of pharisaical wrath will be emptied on our heads for our share in this business he said but i defy every calumniator i was there only to support the law to play my part as a man and a briton which characters i deem quite compatible with those of the priest and levite in their highest sense your tenant moore he went on has won my approbation a cooler commander i would not wish to see nor a more determined besides the man has shown sound judgment and good sensefirst in being thoroughly prepared for the event which has taken place and subsequently when his wellconcerted plans had secured him success in knowing how to use without abusing his victory some of the magistrates are now well frightened and like all cowards show a tendency to be cruel moore restrains them with admirable prudence he has hitherto been very unpopular in the neighbourhood but mark my words the tide of opinion will now take a turn in his favour people will find out that they have not appreciated him and will hasten to remedy their error and he when he perceives the public disposed to acknowledge his merits will show a more gracious mien than that with which he has hitherto favoured us  mr helstone was about to add to this speech some halfjesting halfserious warnings to miss keeldar on the subject of her rumoured partiality for her talented tenant when a ring at the door announcing another caller checked his raillery and as that other caller appeared in the form of a whitehaired elderly gentleman with a rather truculent countenance and disdainful eyein short our old acquaintance and the rectors old enemy mr yorkethe priest and levite seized his hat and with the briefest of adieus to miss keeldar and the sternest of nods to her guest took an abrupt leave  mr yorke was in no mild mood and in no measured terms did he express his opinion on the transaction of the night moore the magistrates the soldiers the mob leaders each and all came in for a share of his invectives but he reserved his strongest epithetsand real racy yorkshire doric adjectives they werefor the benefit of the fighting parsons the sanguinary demoniac rector and curate according to him the cup of ecclesiastical guilt was now full indeed  the church he said was in a bonny pickle now it was time it came down when parsons took to swaggering amang soldiers blazing away wi bullet and gunpowder taking the lives of far honester men than themselves  what would moore have done if nobody had helped him asked shirley  drunk as hed brewed eaten as hed baked  which means you would have left him by himself to face that mob good he has plenty of courage but the greatest amount of gallantry that ever garrisoned one human breast could scarce avail against two hundred  he had the soldiers those poor slaves who hire out their own blood and spill other folks for money  you abuse soldiers almost as much as you abuse clergymen all who wear red coats are national refuse in your eyes and all who wear black are national swindlers mr moore according to you did wrong to get military aid and he did still worse to accept of any other aid your way of talking amounts to this he should have abandoned his mill and his life to the rage of a set of misguided madmen and mr helstone and every other gentleman in the parish should have looked on and seen the building razed and its owner slaughtered and never stirred a finger to save either  if moore had behaved to his men from the beginning as a master ought to behave they never would have entertained their present feelings towards him  easy for you to talk exclaimed miss keeldar who was beginning to wax warm in her tenants causeyou whose family have lived at briarmains for six generations to whose person the people have been accustomed for fifty years who know all their ways prejudices and preferenceseasy indeed for you to act so as to avoid offending them but mr moore came a stranger into the district he came here poor and friendless with nothing but his own energies to back him nothing but his honour his talent and his industry to make his way for him a monstrous crime indeed that under such circumstances he could not popularize his naturally grave quiet manners all at once could not be jocular and free and cordial with a strange peasantry as you are with your fellowtownsmen an unpardonable transgression that when he introduced improvements he did not go about the business in quite the most politic way did not graduate his changes as delicately as a rich capitalist might have done for errors of this sort is he to be the victim of mob outrage is he to be denied even the privilege of defending himself are those who have the hearts of men in their breasts and mr helstone say what you will of him has such a heart to be reviled like malefactors because they stand by him because they venture to espouse the cause of one against two hundred  come come now be cool said mr yorke smiling at the earnestness with which shirley multiplied her rapid questions  cool must i listen coolly to downright nonsenseto dangerous nonsense no i like you very well mr yorke as you know but i thoroughly dislike some of your principles all that cantexcuse me but i repeat the wordall that cant about soldiers and parsons is most offensive in my ears all ridiculous irrational crying up of one class whether the same be aristocrat or democratall howling down of another class whether clerical or militaryall exacting injustice to individuals whether monarch or mendicantis really sickening to me all arraying of ranks against ranks all party hatreds all tyrannies disguised as liberties i reject and wash my hands of you think you are a philanthropist you think you are an advocate of liberty but i will tell you thismr hall the parson of nunnely is a better friend both of man and freedom than hiram yorke the reformer of briarfield  from a man mr yorke would not have borne this language very patiently nor would he have endured it from some women but he accounted shirley both honest and pretty and her plainspoken ire amused him besides he took a secret pleasure in hearing her defend her tenant for we have already intimated he had robert moores interest very much at heart moreover if he wished to avenge himself for her severity he knew the means lay in his power a word he believed would suffice to tame and silence her to cover her frank forehead with the rosy shadow of shame and veil the glow of her eye under downdrooped lid and lash  what more hast thou to say he inquired as she paused rather it appeared to take breath than because her subject or her zeal was exhausted  say mr yorke was the answer the speaker meantime walking fast from wall to wall of the oak parloursay i have a great deal to say if i could get it out in lucid order which i never can do i have to say that your views and those of most extreme politicians are such as none but men in an irresponsible position can advocate that they are purely opposition views meant only to be talked about and never intended to be acted on make you prime minister of england tomorrow and you would have to abandon them you abuse moore for defending his mill had you been in moores place you could not with honour or sense have acted otherwise than he acted you abuse mr helstone for everything he does mr helstone has his faults he sometimes does wrong but oftener right were you ordained vicar of briarfield you would find it no easy task to sustain all the active schemes for the benefit of the parish planned and persevered in by your predecessor i wonder people cannot judge more fairly of each other and themselves when i hear messrs malone and donne chatter about the authority of the church the dignity and claims of the priesthood the deference due to them as clergymen when i hear the outbreaks of their small spite against dissenters when i witness their silly narrow jealousies and assumptions when their palaver about forms and traditions and superstitions is sounding in my ear when i behold their insolent carriage to the poor their often base servility to the richi think the establishment is indeed in a poor way and both she and her sons appear in the utmost need of reformation turning away distressed from minster tower and village spireay as distressed as a churchwarden who feels the exigence of whitewash and has not wherewithal to purchase limei recall your senseless sarcasms on the fat bishops the pampered parsons old mother church etc i remember your strictures on all who differ from you your sweeping condemnation of classes and individuals without the slightest allowance made for circumstances or temptations and then mr yorke doubt clutches my inmost heart as to whether men exist clement reasonable and just enough to be entrusted with the task of reform i dont believe you are of the number  you have an ill opinion of me miss shirley you never told me so much of your mind before  i never had an opening but i have sat on jessys stool by your chair in the backparlour at briarmains for evenings together listening excitedly to your talk half admiring what you said and half rebelling against it i think you a fine old yorkshireman sir i am proud to have been born in the same county and parish as yourself truthful upright independent you are as a rock based below seas but also you are harsh rude narrow and merciless  not to the poor lass nor to the meek of the earth only to the proud and highminded  and what right have you sir to make such distinctions a prouder a higherminded man than yourself does not exist you find it easy to speak comfortably to your inferiors you are too haughty too ambitious too jealous to be civil to those above you but you are all alike helstone also is proud and prejudiced moore though juster and more considerate than either you or the rector is still haughty stern and in a public sense selfish it is well there are such men as mr hall to be found occasionallymen of large and kind hearts who can love their whole race who can forgive others for being richer more prosperous or more powerful than they are such men may have less originality less force of character than you but they are better friends to mankind  and when is it to be said mr yorke now rising  when is what to be  the wedding  whose wedding  only that of robert gérard moore esq of hollows cottage with miss keeldar daughter and heiress of the late charles cave keeldar of fieldhead hall  shirley gazed at the questioner with rising colour but the light in her eye was not faltering it shone steadilyyes it burned deeply  that is your revenge she said slowly then added would it be a bad match unworthy of the late charles cave keeldars representative  my lass moore is a gentleman his blood is pure and ancient as mine or thine  and we two set store by ancient blood we have family pride though one of us at least is a republican  yorke bowed as he stood before her his lips were mute but his eye confessed the impeachment yes he had family pride you saw it in his whole bearing  moore is a gentleman echoed shirley lifting her head with glad grace she checked herself words seemed crowding to her tongue she would not give them utterance but her look spoke much at the moment what yorke tried to read but could not the language was there visible but untranslatablea poem a fervid lyric in an unknown tongue it was not a plain story however no simple gush of feeling no ordinary loveconfessionthat was obvious it was something other deeper more intricate than he guessed at he felt his revenge had not struck home he felt that shirley triumphed she held him at fault baffled puzzled she enjoyed the moment not he  and if moore is a gentleman you can be only a lady therefore  therefore there would be no inequality in our union  none  thank you for your approbation will you give me away when i relinquish the name of keeldar for that of moore  mr yorke instead of replying gazed at her much puzzled he could not divine what her look signifiedwhether she spoke in earnest or in jest there were purpose and feeling banter and scoff playing mingled on her mobile lineaments  i dont understand thee he said turning away  she laughed take courage sir you are not singular in your ignorance but i suppose if moore understands me that will do will it not  moore may settle his own matters henceforward for me ill neither meddle nor make with them further  a new thought crossed her her countenance changed magically with a sudden darkening of the eye and austere fixing of the features she demanded have you been asked to interfere are you questioning me as anothers proxy  the lord save us whoever weds thee must look about him keep all your questions for robert ill answer no more on em goodday lassie                                       the day being fine or at least fairfor soft clouds curtained the sun and a dim but not chill or waterish haze slept blue on the hillscaroline while shirley was engaged with her callers had persuaded mrs pryor to assume her bonnet and summer shawl and to take a walk with her up towards the narrow end of the hollow  here the opposing sides of the glen approaching each other and becoming clothed with brushwood and stunted oaks formed a wooded ravine at the bottom of which ran the millstream in broken unquiet course struggling with many stones chafing against rugged banks fretting with gnarled treeroots foaming gurgling battling as it went here when you had wandered half a mile from the mill you found a sense of deep solitudefound it in the shade of unmolested trees received it in the singing of many birds for which that shade made a home this was no trodden way the freshness of the wood flowers attested that foot of man seldom pressed them the abounding wild roses looked as if they budded bloomed and faded under the watch of solitude as if in a sultans harem here you saw the sweet azure of bluebells and recognized in pearlwhite blossoms spangling the grass a humble type of some starlit spot in space  mrs pryor liked a quiet walk she ever shunned highroads and sought byways and lonely lanes one companion she preferred to total solitude for in solitude she was nervous a vague fear of annoying encounters broke the enjoyment of quite lonely rambles but she feared nothing with caroline when once she got away from human habitations and entered the still demesne of nature accompanied by this one youthful friend a propitious change seemed to steal over her mind and beam in her countenance when with carolineand caroline onlyher heart you would have said shook off a burden her brow put aside a veil her spirits too escaped from a restraint with her she was cheerful with her at times she was tender to her she would impart her knowledge reveal glimpses of her experience give her opportunities for guessing what life she had lived what cultivation her mind had received of what calibre was her intelligence how and where her feelings were vulnerable  today for instance as they walked along mrs pryor talked to her companion about the various birds singing in the trees discriminated their species and said something about their habits and peculiarities english natural history seemed familiar to her all the wild flowers round their path were recognized by her tiny plants springing near stones and peeping out of chinks in old wallsplants such as caroline had scarcely noticed beforereceived a name and an intimation of their properties it appeared that she had minutely studied the botany of english fields and woods having reached the head of the ravine they sat down together on a ledge of gray and mossy rock jutting from the base of a steep green hill which towered above them she looked round her and spoke of the neighbourhood as she had once before seen it long ago she alluded to its changes and compared its aspect with that of other parts of england revealing in quiet unconscious touches of description a sense of the picturesque an appreciation of the beautiful or commonplace a power of comparing the wild with the cultured the grand with the tame that gave to her discourse a graphic charm as pleasant as it was unpretending  the sort of reverent pleasure with which caroline listenedso sincere so quiet yet so evidentstirred the elder ladys faculties to gentle animation rarely probably had she with her chill repellent outside her diffident mien and incommunicative habits known what it was to excite in one whom she herself could love feelings of earnest affection and admiring esteem delightful doubtless was the consciousness that a young girl towards whom it seemed judging by the moved expression of her eyes and features her heart turned with almost a fond impulse looked up to her as an instructor and clung to her as a friend with a somewhat more marked accent of interest than she often permitted herself to use she said as she bent towards her youthful companion and put aside from her forehead a pale brown curl which had strayed from the confining comb i do hope this sweet air blowing from the hill will do you good my dear caroline i wish i could see something more of colour in these cheeks but perhaps you were never florid  i had red cheeks once returned miss helstone smiling i remember a yeartwo years agowhen i used to look in the glass i saw a different face there to what i see nowrounder and rosier but when we are young added the girl of eighteen our minds are careless and our lives easy  do you continued mrs pryor mastering by an effort that tyrant timidity which made it difficult for her even under present circumstances to attempt the scrutiny of anothers heartdo you at your age fret yourself with cares for the future believe me you had better not let the morrow take thought for the things of itself  true dear madam it is not over the future i pine the evil of the day is sometimes oppressivetoo oppressiveand i long to escape it  that isthe evil of the daythat isyour uncle perhaps is notyou find it difficult to understandhe does not appreciate  mrs pryor could not complete her broken sentences she could not manage to put the question whether mr helstone was too harsh with his niece but caroline comprehended  oh that is nothing she replied my uncle and i get on very well we never quarreli dont call him harshhe never scolds me sometimes i wish somebody in the world loved me but i cannot say that i particularly wish him to have more affection for me than he has as a child i should perhaps have felt the want of attention only the servants were very kind to me but when people are long indifferent to us we grow indifferent to their indifference it is my uncles way not to care for women and girls unless they be ladies that he meets in company he could not alter and i have no wish that he should alter as far as i am concerned i believe it would merely annoy and frighten me were he to be affectionate towards me now but you know mrs pryor it is scarcely living to measure time as i do at the rectory the hours pass and i get them over somehow but i do not live i endure existence but i rarely enjoy it since miss keeldar and you came i have beeni was going to say happier but that would be untrue she paused  how untrue you are fond of miss keeldar are you not my dear  very fond of shirley i both like and admire her but i am painfully circumstanced for a reason i cannot explain i want to go away from this place and to forget it  you told me before you wished to be a governess but my dear if you remember i did not encourage the idea i have been a governess myself great part of my life in miss keeldars acquaintance i esteem myself most fortunate her talents and her really sweet disposition have rendered my office easy to me but when i was young before i married my trials were severe poignant i should not like a i should not like you to endure similar ones it was my lot to enter a family of considerable pretensions to good birth and mental superiority and the members of which also believed that on them was perceptible an unusual endowment of the christian graces that all their hearts were regenerate and their spirits in a peculiar state of discipline i was early given to understand that as i was not their equal so i could not expect to have their sympathy it was in no sort concealed from me that i was held a burden and a restraint in society the gentlemen i found regarded me as a tabooed woman to whom they were interdicted from granting the usual privileges of the sex and yet who annoyed them by frequently crossing their path the ladies too made it plain that they thought me a bore the servants it was signified detested me why i could never clearly comprehend my pupils i was told however much they might love me and how deep soever the interest i might take in them could not be my friends it was intimated that i must live alone and never transgress the invisible but rigid line which established the difference between me and my employers my life in this house was sedentary solitary constrained joyless toilsome the dreadful crushing of the animal spirits the everprevailing sense of friendlessness and homelessness consequent on this state of things began ere long to produce mortal effects on my constitution i sickened the lady of the house told me coolly i was the victim of wounded vanity she hinted that if i did not make an effort to quell my ungodly discontent to cease murmuring against gods appointment and to cultivate the profound humility befitting my station my mind would very likely go to pieces on the rock that wrecked most of my sisterhoodmorbid selfesteemand that i should die an inmate of a lunatic asylum  i said nothing to mrs hardmanit would have been useless but to her eldest daughter i one day dropped a few observations which were answered thus there were hardships she allowed in the position of a governess doubtless they had their trials but she averred with a manner it makes me smile now to recallbut it must be so she miss h had neither view hope nor wish to see these things remedied for in the inherent constitution of english habits feelings and prejudices there was no possibility that they should be governesses she observed must ever be kept in a sort of isolation it is the only means of maintaining that distance which the reserve of english manners and the decorum of english families exact  i remember i sighed as miss hardman quitted my bedside she caught the sound and turning said severely i fear miss grey you have inherited in fullest measure the worst sin of our fallen naturethe sin of pride you are proud and therefore you are ungrateful too mamma pays you a handsome salary and if you had average sense you would thankfully put up with much that is fatiguing to do and irksome to bear since it is so well made worth your while  miss hardman my love was a very strongminded young lady of most distinguished talents the aristocracy are decidedly a very superior class you know both physically and morally and mentally as a high tory i acknowledge that i could not describe the dignity of her voice and mien as she addressed me thus still i fear she was selfish my dear i would never wish to speak ill of my superiors in rank but i think she was a little selfish  i remember continued mrs pryor after a pause another of miss hs observations which she would utter with quite a grand air we she would saywe need the imprudences extravagances mistakes and crimes of a certain number of fathers to sow the seed from which we reap the harvest of governesses the daughters of tradespeople however well educated must necessarily be underbred and as such unfit to be inmates of our dwellings or guardians of our childrens minds and persons we shall ever prefer to place those about our offspring who have been born and bred with somewhat of the same refinement as ourselves  miss hardman must have thought herself something better than her fellowcreatures maam since she held that their calamities and even crimes were necessary to minister to her convenience you say she was religious her religion must have been that of the pharisee who thanked god that he was not as other men are nor even as that publican  my dear we will not discuss the point i should be the last person to wish to instil into your mind any feeling of dissatisfaction with your lot in life or any sentiment of envy or insubordination towards your superiors implicit submission to authorities scrupulous deference to our betters under which term i of course include the higher classes of society are in my opinion indispensable to the wellbeing of every community all i mean to say my dear is that you had better not attempt to be a governess as the duties of the position would be too severe for your constitution not one word of disrespect would i breathe towards either mrs or miss hardman only recalling my own experience i cannot but feel that were you to fall under auspices such as theirs you would contend a while courageously with your doom then you would pine and grow too weak for your work you would come homeif you still had a homebroken down those languishing years would follow of which none but the invalid and her immediate friends feel the heartsickness and know the burden consumption or decline would close the chapter such is the history of many a life i would not have it yours my dear we will now walk about a little if you please  they both rose and slowly paced a green natural terrace bordering the chasm  my dear ere long again began mrs pryor a sort of timid embarrassed abruptness marking her manner as she spoke the young especially those to whom nature has been favourable oftenfrequentlyanticipatelook forward toto marriage as the end the goal of their hopes  and she stopped caroline came to her relief with promptitude showing a great deal more selfpossession and courage than herself on the formidable topic now broached  they do and naturally she replied with a calm emphasis that startled mrs pryor they look forward to marriage with some one they love as the brightest the only bright destiny that can await them are they wrong  oh my dear exclaimed mrs pryor clasping her hands and again she paused caroline turned a searching an eager eye on the face of her friend that face was much agitated my dear she murmured life is an illusion  but not love love is realthe most real the most lasting the sweetest and yet the bitterest thing we know  my dear it is very bitter it is said to be strongstrong as death most of the cheats of existence are strong as to their sweetness nothing is so transitory its date is a moment the twinkling of an eye the sting remains for ever it may perish with the dawn of eternity but it tortures through time into its deepest night  yes it tortures through time agreed caroline except when it is mutual love  mutual love my dear romances are pernicious you do not read them i hope  sometimeswhenever i can get them indeed but romancewriters might know nothing of love judging by the way in which they treat of it  nothing whatever my dear assented mrs pryor eagerly nor of marriage and the false pictures they give of those subjects cannot be too strongly condemned they are not like reality they show you only the green tempting surface of the marsh and give not one faithful or truthful hint of the slough underneath  but it is not always slough objected caroline there are happy marriages where affection is reciprocal and sincere and minds are harmonious marriage must be happy  it is never wholly happy two people can never literally be as one there is perhaps a possibility of content under peculiar circumstances such as are seldom combined but it is as well not to run the riskyou may make fatal mistakes be satisfied my dear let all the single be satisfied with their freedom  you echo my uncles words exclaimed caroline in a tone of dismay you speak like mrs yorke in her most gloomy moments like miss mann when she is most sourly and hypochondriacally disposed this is terrible  no it is only true o child you have only lived the pleasant morning time of life the hot weary noon the sad evening the sunless night are yet to come for you mr helstone you say talks as i talk and i wonder how mrs matthewson helstone would have talked had she been living she died she died  and alas my own mother and father exclaimed caroline struck by a sombre recollection  what of them  did i never tell you that they were separated  i have heard it  they must then have been very miserable  you see all facts go to prove what i say  in this case there ought to be no such thing as marriage  there ought my dear were it only to prove that this life is a mere state of probation wherein neither rest nor recompense is to be vouchsafed  but your own marriage mrs pryor  mrs pryor shrank and shuddered as if a rude finger had pressed a naked nerve caroline felt she had touched what would not bear the slightest contact  my marriage was unhappy said the lady summoning courage at last but yet she hesitated  but yet suggested caroline not immitigably wretched  not in its results at least no she added in a softer tone god mingles something of the balm of mercy even in vials of the most corrosive woe he can so turn events that from the very same blind rash act whence sprang the curse of half our life may flow the blessing of the remainder then i am of a peculiar dispositioni own thatfar from facile without address in some points eccentric i ought never to have married mine is not the nature easily to find a duplicate or likely to assimilate with a contrast i was quite aware of my own ineligibility and if i had not been so miserable as a governess i never should have married and then  carolines eyes asked her to proceed they entreated her to break the thick cloud of despair which her previous words had seemed to spread over life  and then my dear mrthat is the gentleman i marriedwas perhaps rather an exceptional than an average character i hope at least the experience of few has been such as mine was or that few have felt their sufferings as i felt mine they nearly shook my mind relief was so hopeless redress so unattainable but my dear i do not wish to dishearten i only wish to warn you and to prove that the single should not be too anxious to change their state as they may change for the worse  thank you my dear madam i quite understand your kind intentions but there is no fear of my falling into the error to which you allude i at least have no thoughts of marriage and for that reason i want to make myself a position by some other means  my dear listen to me on what i am going to say i have carefully deliberated having indeed revolved the subject in my thoughts ever since you first mentioned your wish to obtain a situation you know i at present reside with miss keeldar in the capacity of companion should she marry and that she will marry ere long many circumstances induce me to conclude i shall cease to be necessary to her in that capacity i must tell you that i possess a small independency arising partly from my own savings and partly from a legacy left me some years since whenever i leave fieldhead i shall take a house of my own i could not endure to live in solitude i have no relations whom i care to invite to close intimacy for as you must have observed and as i have already avowed my habits and tastes have their peculiarities to you my dear i need not say i am attached with you i am happier than i have ever been with any living thing this was said with marked emphasis your society i should esteem a very dear privilegean inestimable privilege a comfort a blessing you shall come to me then caroline do you refuse me i hope you can love me  and with these two abrupt questions she stopped  indeed i do love you was the reply i should like to live with you but you are too kind  all i have went on mrs pryor i would leave to you you should be provided for but never again say i am too kind you pierce my heart child  but my dear madamthis generosityi have no claim  hush you must not talk about it there are some things we cannot bear to hear oh it is late to begin but i may yet live a few years i can never wipe out the past but perhaps a brief space in the future may yet be mine  mrs pryor seemed deeply agitated large tears trembled in her eyes and rolled down her cheeks caroline kissed her in her gentle caressing way saying softly i love you dearly dont cry  but the ladys whole frame seemed shaken she sat down bent her head to her knee and wept aloud nothing could console her till the inward storm had had its way at last the agony subsided of itself  poor thing she murmured returning carolines kiss poor lonely lamb but come she added abruptlycome we must go home  for a short distance mrs pryor walked very fast by degrees however she calmed down to her wonted manner fell into her usual characteristic pacea peculiar one like all her movementsand by the time they reached fieldhead she had reentered into herself the outside was as usual still and shy     chapter xxii  two lives   only half of moores activity and resolution had been seen in his defence of the mill he showed the other half and a terrible half it was in the indefatigable the relentless assiduity with which he pursued the leaders of the riot the mob the mere followers he let alone perhaps an innate sense of justice told him that men misled by false counsel and goaded by privations are not fit objects of vengeance and that he who would visit an even violent act on the bent head of suffering is a tyrant not a judge at all events though he knew many of the number having recognized them during the latter part of the attack when day began to dawn he let them daily pass him on street and road without notice or threat  the leaders he did not know they were strangersemissaries from the large towns most of these were not members of the operative class they were chiefly downdraughts bankrupts men always in debt and often in drink men who had nothing to lose and much in the way of character cash and cleanliness to gain these persons moore hunted like any sleuthhound and well he liked the occupation its excitement was of a kind pleasant to his nature he liked it better than making cloth  his horse must have hated these times for it was ridden both hard and often he almost lived on the road and the fresh air was as welcome to his lungs as the policemans quest to his mood he preferred it to the steam of dyehouses the magistrates of the district must have dreaded him they were slow timid men he liked both to frighten and to rouse them he liked to force them to betray a certain fear which made them alike falter in resolve and recoil in actionthe fear simply of assassination this indeed was the dread which had hitherto hampered every manufacturer and almost every public man in the district helstone alone had ever repelled it the old cossack knew well he might be shot he knew there was risk but such death had for his nerves no terrors it would have been his chosen might he have had a choice  moore likewise knew his danger the result was an unquenchable scorn of the quarter whence such danger was to be apprehended the consciousness that he hunted assassins was the spur in his highmettled tempers flank as for fear he was too proud too hardnatured if you will too phlegmatic a man to fear many a time he rode belated over the moors moonlit or moonless as the case might be with feelings far more elate faculties far better refreshed than when safety and stagnation environed him in the countinghouse four was the number of the leaders to be accounted for two in the course of a fortnight were brought to bay near stilbro the remaining two it was necessary to seek farther off their haunts were supposed to lie near birmingham  meantime the clothier did not neglect his battered mill its reparation was esteemed a light task carpenters and glaziers work alone being needed the rioters not having succeeded in effecting an entrance his grim metal darlingsthe machineshad escaped damage  whether during this busy lifewhether while stern justice and exacting business claimed his energies and harassed his thoughtshe now and then gave one moment dedicated one effort to keep alive gentler fires than those which smoulder in the fane of nemesis it was not easy to discover he seldom went near fieldhead if he did his visits were brief if he called at the rectory it was only to hold conferences with the rector in his study he maintained his rigid course very steadily meantime the history of the year continued troubled there was no lull in the tempest of war her long hurricane still swept the continent there was not the faintest sign of serene weather no opening amid the clouds of battledust and smoke no fall of pure dews genial to the olive no cessation of the red rain which nourishes the baleful and glorious laurel meantime ruin had her sappers and miners at work under moores feet and whether he rode or walked whether he only crossed his countinghouse hearth or galloped over sullen rushedge he was aware of a hollow echo and felt the ground shake to his tread  while the summer thus passed with moore how did it lapse with shirley and caroline let us first visit the heiress how does she look like a lovelorn maiden pale and pining for a neglectful swain does she sit the day long bent over some sedentary task has she for ever a book in her hand or sewing on her knee and eyes only for that and words for nothing and thoughts unspoken  by no means shirley is all right if her wistful cast of physiognomy is not gone no more is her careless smile she keeps her dark old manorhouse light and bright with her cheery presence the gallery and the lowceiled chambers that open into it have learned lively echoes from her voice the dim entrancehall with its one window has grown pleasantly accustomed to the frequent rustle of a silk dress as its wearer sweeps across from room to room now carrying flowers to the barbarous peachbloom salon now entering the diningroom to open its casements and let in the scent of mignonette and sweetbriar anon bringing plants from the staircase window to place in the sun at the open porch door  she takes her sewing occasionally but by some fatality she is doomed never to sit steadily at it for above five minutes at a time her thimble is scarcely fitted on her needle scarce threaded when a sudden thought calls her upstairs perhaps she goes to seek some justthenremembered old ivorybacked needlebook or older chinatopped workbox quite unneeded but which seems at the moment indispensable perhaps to arrange her hair or a drawer which she recollects to have seen that morning in a state of curious confusion perhaps only to take a peep from a particular window at a particular view whence briarfield church and rectory are visible pleasantly bowered in trees she has scarcely returned and again taken up the slip of cambric or square of halfwrought canvas when tartars bold scrape and strangled whistle are heard at the porch door and she must run to open it for him it is a hot day he comes in panting she must convoy him to the kitchen and see with her own eyes that his waterbowl is replenished through the open kitchen door the court is visible all sunny and gay and people with turkeys and their poults peahens and their chicks pearlflecked guineafowls and a bright variety of pure white and purplenecked and blue and cinnamon plumed pigeons irresistible spectacle to shirley she runs to the pantry for a roll and she stands on the door step scattering crumbs around her throng her eager plump happy feathered vassals john is about the stables and john must be talked to and her mare looked at she is still petting and patting it when the cows come in to be milked this is important shirley must stay and take a review of them all there are perhaps some little calves some little newyeaned lambsit may be twins whose mothers have rejected them miss keeldar must be introduced to them by john must permit herself the treat of feeding them with her own hand under the direction of her careful foreman meantime john moots doubtful questions about the farming of certain crofts and ings and holmes and his mistress is necessitated to fetch her gardenhata gipsy strawand accompany him over stile and along hedgerow to hear the conclusion of the whole agricultural matter on the spot and with the said crofts ings and holms under her eye bright afternoon thus wears into soft evening and she comes home to a late tea and after tea she never sews  after tea shirley reads and she is just about as tenacious of her book as she is lax of her needle her study is the rug her seat a footstool or perhaps only the carpet at mrs pryors feet there she always learned her lessons when a child and old habits have a strong power over her the tawny and lionlike bulk of tartar is ever stretched beside her his negro muzzle laid on his fore pawsstraight strong and shapely as the limbs of an alpine wolf one hand of the mistress generally reposes on the loving serfs rude head because if she takes it away he groans and is discontented shirleys mind is given to her book she lifts not her eyes she neither stirs nor speaksunless indeed it be to return a brief respectful answer to mrs pryor who addresses deprecatory phrases to her now and then  my dear you had better not have that great dog so near you he is crushing the border of your dress  oh it is only muslin i can put a clean one on tomorrow  my dear i wish you could acquire the habit of sitting to a table when you read  i will try maam some time but it is so comfortable to do as one has always been accustomed to do  my dear let me beg of you to put that book down you are trying your eyes by the doubtful firelight  no maam not at all my eyes are never tired  at last however a pale light falls on the page from the window she looks the moon is up she closes the volume rises and walks through the room her book has perhaps been a good one it has refreshed refilled rewarmed her heart it has set her brain astir furnished her mind with pictures the still parlour the clean hearth the window opening on the twilight sky and showing its sweet regent new throned and glorious suffice to make earth an eden life a poem for shirley a still deep inborn delight glows in her young veins unmingled untroubled not to be reached or ravished by human agency because by no human agency bestowedthe pure gift of god to his creature the free dower of nature to her child this joy gives her experience of a geniilife buoyant by green steps by glad hills all verdure and light she reaches a station scarcely lower than that whence angels looked down on the dreamer of bethel and her eye seeks and her soul possesses the vision of life as she wishes it no not as she wishes it she has not time to wish the swift glory spreads out sweeping and kindling and multiplies its splendours faster than thought can effect his combinations faster than aspiration can utter her longings shirley says nothing while the trance is upon hershe is quite mute but if mrs pryor speaks to her now she goes out quietly and continues her walk upstairs in the dim gallery  if shirley were not an indolent a reckless an ignorant being she would take a pen at such moments or at least while the recollection of such moments was yet fresh on her spirit she would seize she would fix the apparition tell the vision revealed had she a little more of the organ of acquisitiveness in her head a little more of the love of property in her nature she would take a goodsized sheet of paper and write plainly out in her own queer but clear and legible hand the story that has been narrated the song that has been sung to her and thus possess what she was enabled to create but indolent she is reckless she is and most ignorant for she does not know her dreams are rare her feelings peculiar she does not know has never known and will die without knowing the full value of that spring whose bright fresh bubbling in her heart keeps it green  shirley takes life easily is not that fact written in her eye in her goodtempered moments is it not as full of lazy softness as in her brief fits of anger it is fulgent with quickflashing fire her nature is in her eye so long as she is calm indolence indulgence humour and tenderness possess that large gray sphere incense her a red ray pierces the dew it quickens instantly to flame  ere the month of july was past miss keeldar would probably have started with caroline on that northern tour they had planned but just at that epoch an invasion befell fieldhead a genteel foraging party besieged shirley in her castle and compelled her to surrender at discretion an uncle an aunt and two cousins from the southa mr mrs and two misses sympson of sympson grove shirecame down upon her in state the laws of hospitality obliged her to give in which she did with a facility which somewhat surprised caroline who knew her to be prompt in action and fertile in expedient where a victory was to be gained for her will miss helstone even asked her how it was she submitted so readily she answered old feelings had their power she had passed two years of her early youth at sympson grove  how did she like her relatives  she had nothing in common with them she replied little harry sympson indeed the sole son of the family was very unlike his sisters and of him she had formerly been fond but he was not coming to yorkshireat least not yet  the next sunday the fieldhead pew in briarfield church appeared peopled with a prim trim fidgety elderly gentleman who shifted his spectacles and changed his position every three minutes a patient placidlooking elderly lady in brown satin and two pattern young ladies in pattern attire with pattern deportment shirley had the air of a black swan or a white crow in the midst of this party and very forlorn was her aspect having brought her into respectable society we will leave her there a while and look after miss helstone  separated from miss keeldar for the present as she could not seek her in the midst of her fine relatives scared away from fieldhead by the visiting commotion which the new arrivals occasioned in the neighbourhood caroline was limited once more to the gray rectory the solitary morning walk in remote bypaths the long lonely afternoon sitting in a quiet parlour which the sun forsook at noon or in the garden alcove where it shone bright yet sad on the ripening red currants trained over the trellis and on the fair monthly roses entwined between and through them fell chequered on caroline sitting in her white summer dress still as a garden statue there she read old books taken from her uncles library the greek and latin were of no use to her and its collection of light literature was chiefly contained on a shelf which had belonged to her aunt marysome venerable ladys magazines that had once performed a seavoyage with their owner and undergone a storm and whose pages were stained with salt water some mad methodist magazines full of miracles and apparitions of preternatural warnings ominous dreams and frenzied fanaticism the equally mad letters of mrs elizabeth rowe from the dead to the living a few old english classics from these faded flowers caroline had in her childhood extracted the honey they were tasteless to her now by way of change and also of doing good she would sewmake garments for the poor according to good miss ainleys direction sometimes as she felt and saw her tears fall slowly on her work she would wonder how the excellent woman who had cut it out and arranged it for her managed to be so equably serene in her solitude  i never find miss ainley oppressed with despondency or lost in grief she thought yet her cottage is a still dim little place and she is without a bright hope or near friend in the world i remember though she told me once she had tutored her thoughts to tend upwards to heaven she allowed there was and ever had been little enjoyment in this world for her and she looks i suppose to the bliss of the world to come so do nuns with their close cell their iron lamp their robe strait as a shroud their bed narrow as a coffin she says often she has no fear of deathno dread of the grave no more doubtless had st simeon stylites lifted up terrible on his wild column in the wilderness no more has the hindu votary stretched on his couch of iron spikes both these having violated nature their natural likings and antipathies are reversed they grow altogether morbid i do fear death as yet but i believe it is because i am young poor miss ainley would cling closer to life if life had more charms for her god surely did not create us and cause us to live with the sole end of wishing always to die i believe in my heart we were intended to prize life and enjoy it so long as we retain it existence never was originally meant to be that useless blank pale slowtrailing thing it often becomes to many and is becoming to me among the rest  nobody she went onnobody in particular is to blame that i can see for the state in which things are and i cannot tell however much i puzzle over it how they are to be altered for the better but i feel there is something wrong somewhere i believe single women should have more to dobetter chances of interesting and profitable occupation than they possess now and when i speak thus i have no impression that i displease god by my words that i am either impious or impatient irreligious or sacrilegious my consolation is indeed that god hears many a groan and compassionates much grief which man stops his ears against or frowns on with impotent contempt i say impotent for i observe that to such grievances as society cannot readily cure it usually forbids utterance on pain of its scorn this scorn being only a sort of tinselled cloak to its deformed weakness people hate to be reminded of ills they are unable or unwilling to remedy such reminder in forcing on them a sense of their own incapacity or a more painful sense of an obligation to make some unpleasant effort troubles their ease and shakes their selfcomplacency old maids like the houseless and unemployed poor should not ask for a place and an occupation in the world the demand disturbs the happy and richit disturbs parents look at the numerous families of girls in this neighbourhoodthe armitages the birtwhistles the sykeses the brothers of these girls are every one in business or in professions they have something to do their sisters have no earthly employment but household work and sewing no earthly pleasure but an unprofitable visiting and no hope in all their life to come of anything better this stagnant state of things makes them decline in health they are never well and their minds and views shrink to wondrous narrowness the great wish the sole aim of every one of them is to be married but the majority will never marry they will die as they now live they scheme they plot they dress to ensnare husbands the gentlemen turn them into ridicule they dont want them they hold them very cheap they sayi have heard them say it with sneering laughs many a timethe matrimonial market is overstocked fathers say so likewise and are angry with their daughters when they observe their manœuvresthey order them to stay at home what do they expect them to do at home if you ask they would answer sew and cook they expect them to do this and this only contentedly regularly uncomplainingly all their lives long as if they had no germs of faculties for anything elsea doctrine as reasonable to hold as it would be that the fathers have no faculties but for eating what their daughters cook or for wearing what they sew could men live so themselves would they not be very weary and when there came no relief to their weariness but only reproaches at its slightest manifestation would not their weariness ferment it time to frenzy lucretia spinning at midnight in the midst of her maidens and solomons virtuous woman are often quoted as patterns of what the sex as they say ought to be i dont know lucretia i dare say was a most worthy sort of person much like my cousin hortense moore but she kept her servants up very late i should not have liked to be amongst the number of the maidens hortense would just work me and sarah in that fashion if she could and neither of us would bear it the virtuous woman again had her household up in the very middle of the night she got breakfast over as mrs sykes says before one oclock am but she had something more to do than spin and give out portions she was a manufacturershe made fine linen and sold it she was an agriculturistshe bought estates and planted vineyards that woman was a manager she was what the matrons hereabouts call a clever woman on the whole i like her a good deal better than lucretia but i dont believe either mr armitage or mr sykes could have got the advantage of her in a bargain yet i like her strength and honour were her clothing the heart of her husband safely trusted in her she opened her mouth with wisdom in her tongue was the law of kindness her children rose up and called her blessed her husband also praised her king of israel your model of a woman is a worthy model but are we in these days brought up to be like her men of yorkshire do your daughters reach this royal standard can they reach it can you help them to reach it can you give them a field in which their faculties may be exercised and grow men of england look at your poor girls many of them fading around you dropping off in consumption or decline or what is worse degenerating to sour old maidsenvious backbiting wretched because life is a desert to them or what is worst of all reduced to strive by scarce modest coquetry and debasing artifice to gain that position and consideration by marriage which to celibacy is denied fathers cannot you alter these things perhaps not all at once but consider the matter well when it is brought before you receive it as a theme worthy of thought do not dismiss it with an idle jest or an unmanly insult you would wish to be proud of your daughters and not to blush for them then seek for them an interest and an occupation which shall raise them above the flirt the manœuvrer the mischiefmaking talebearer keep your girls minds narrow and fettered they will still be a plague and a care sometimes a disgrace to you cultivate themgive them scope and work they will be your gayest companions in health your tenderest nurses in sickness your most faithful prop in age     chapter xxiii  an evening out   one fine summer day that caroline had spent entirely alone her uncle being at whinbury and whose long bright noiseless breezeless cloudless hours how many they seemed since sunrise had been to her as desolate as if they had gone over her head in the shadowless and trackless wastes of sahara instead of in the blooming garden of an english home she was sitting in the alcoveher task of work on her knee her fingers assiduously plying the needle her eyes following and regulating their movements her brain working restlesslywhen fanny came to the door looked round over the lawn and borders and not seeing her whom she sought called out miss caroline  a low voice answered fanny it issued from the alcove and thither fanny hastened a note in her hand which she delivered to fingers that hardly seemed to have nerve to hold it miss helstone did not ask whence it came and she did not look at it she let it drop amongst the folds of her work  joe scotts son harry brought it said fanny  the girl was no enchantress and knew no magic spell yet what she said took almost magical effect on her young mistress she lifted her head with the quick motion of revived sensation she shot not a languid but a lifelike questioning glance at fanny  harry scott who sent him  he came from the hollow  the dropped note was snatched up eagerly the seal was brokenit was read in two seconds an affectionate billet from hortense informing her young cousin that she was returned from wormwood wells that she was alone today as robert was gone to whinbury market that nothing would give her greater pleasure than to have carolines company to tea and the good lady added she was quite sure such a change would be most acceptable and beneficial to caroline who must be sadly at a loss both for safe guidance and improving society since the misunderstanding between robert and mr helstone had occasioned a separation from her meilleure amie hortense gérard moore in a postscript she was urged to put on her bonnet and run down directly  caroline did not need the injunction glad was she to lay by the brown holland childs slip she was trimming with braid for the jews basket to hasten upstairs cover her curls with her straw bonnet and throw round her shoulders the black silk scarf whose simple drapery suited as well her shape as its dark hue set off the purity of her dress and the fairness of her face glad was she to escape for a few hours the solitude the sadness the nightmare of her life glad to run down the green lane sloping to the hollow to scent the fragrance of hedge flowers sweeter than the perfume of mossrose or lily true she knew robert was not at the cottage but it was delight to go where he had lately been so long so totally separated from him merely to see his home to enter the room where he had that morning sat felt like a reunion as such it revived her and then illusion was again following her in peri mask the soft agitation of wings caressed her cheek and the air breathing from the blue summer sky bore a voice which whispered robert may come home while you are in his house and then at least you may look in his faceat least you may give him your hand perhaps for a minute you may sit beside him  silence was her austere response but she loved the comforter and the consolation  miss moore probably caught from the window the gleam and flutter of carolines white attire through the branchy garden shrubs for she advanced from the cottage porch to meet her straight unbending phlegmatic as usual she came on no haste or ecstasy was ever permitted to disorder the dignity of her movements but she smiled well pleased to mark the delight of her pupil to feel her kiss and the gentle genial strain of her embrace she led her tenderly in half deceived and wholly flattered half deceived had it not been so she would in all probability have put her to the wicket and shut her out had she known clearly to whose account the chief share of this childlike joy was to be placed hortense would most likely have felt both shocked and incensed sisters do not like young ladies to fall in love with their brothers it seems if not presumptuous silly weak a delusion an absurd mistake they do not love these gentlemenwhatever sisterly affection they may cherish towards themand that others should repels them with a sense of crude romance the first movement in short excited by such discovery as with many parents on finding their children to be in love is one of mixed impatience and contempt reasonif they be rational peoplecorrects the false feeling in time but if they be irrational it is never corrected and the daughter or sisterinlaw is disliked to the end  you would expect to find me alone from what i said in my note observed miss moore as she conducted caroline towards the parlour but it was written this morning since dinner company has come in  and opening the door she made visible an ample spread of crimson skirts overflowing the elbowchair at the fireside and above them presiding with dignity a cap more awful than a crown that cap had never come to the cottage under a bonnet no it had been brought in a vast bag or rather a middlesized balloon of black silk held wide with whalebone the screed or frill of the cap stood a quarter of a yard broad round the face of the wearer the ribbon flourishing in puffs and bows about the head was of the sort called loveribbon there was a good deal of it i may say a very great deal mrs yorke wore the capit became her she wore the gown alsoit suited her no less  that great lady was come in a friendly way to take tea with miss moore it was almost as great and as rare a favour as if the queen were to go uninvited to share potluck with one of her subjects a higher mark of distinction she could not showshe who in general scorned visiting and teadrinking and held cheap and stigmatized as gossips every maid and matron of the vicinage  there was no mistake however miss moore was a favourite with her she had evinced the fact more than onceevinced it by stopping to speak to her in the churchyard on sundays by inviting her almost hospitably to come to briarmains evinced it today by the grand condescension of a personal visit her reasons for the preference as assigned by herself were that miss moore was a woman of steady deportment without the least levity of conversation or carriage also that being a foreigner she must feel the want of a friend to countenance her she might have added that her plain aspect homely precise dress and phlegmatic unattractive manner were to her so many additional recommendations it is certain at least that ladies remarkable for the opposite qualities of beauty lively bearing and elegant taste in attire were not often favoured with her approbation whatever gentlemen are apt to admire in women mrs yorke condemned and what they overlook or despise she patronized  caroline advanced to the mighty matron with some sense of diffidence she knew little of mrs yorke and as a parsons niece was doubtful what sort of a reception she might get she got a very cool one and was glad to hide her discomfiture by turning away to take off her bonnet nor upon sitting down was she displeased to be immediately accosted by a little personage in a blue frock and sash who started up like some fairy from the side of the great dames chair where she had been sitting on a footstool screened from view by the folds of the wide red gown and running to miss helstone unceremoniously threw her arms round her neck and demanded a kiss  my mother is not civil to you said the petitioner as she received and repaid a smiling salute and rose there takes no notice of you it is their way if instead of you a white angel with a crown of stars had come into the room mother would nod stiffly and rose never lift her head at all but i will be your friendi have always liked you  jessie curb that tongue of yours and repress your forwardness said mrs yorke  but mother you are so frozen expostulated jessie miss helstone has never done you any harm why cant you be kind to her you sit so stiff and look so cold and speak so drywhat for thats just the fashion in which you treat miss shirley keeldar and every other young lady who comes to our house and rose there is such an autauti have forgotten the word but it means a machine in the shape of a human being however between you you will drive every soul away from briarmains martin often says so  i am an automaton good let me alone then said rose speaking from a corner where she was sitting on the carpet at the foot of a bookcase with a volume spread open on her kneemiss helstone how do you do she added directing a brief glance to the person addressed and then again casting down her gray remarkable eyes on the book and returning to the study of its pages  caroline stole a quiet gaze towards her dwelling on her young absorbed countenance and observing a certain unconscious movement of the mouth as she reada movement full of character caroline had tact and she had fine instinct she felt that rose yorke was a peculiar childone of the unique she knew how to treat her approaching quietly she knelt on the carpet at her side and looked over her little shoulder at her book it was a romance of mrs radcliffesthe italian  caroline read on with her making no remark presently rose showed her the attention of asking ere she turned the leaf are you ready  caroline only nodded  do you like it inquired rose ere long  long since when i read it as a child i was wonderfully taken with it  why  it seemed to open with such promisesuch foreboding of a most strange tale to be unfolded  and in reading it you feel as if you were far away from englandreally in italyunder another sort of skythat blue sky of the south which travellers describe  you are sensible of that rose  it makes me long to travel miss helstone  when you are a woman perhaps you may be able to gratify your wish  i mean to make a way to do so if one is not made for me i cannot live always in briarfield the whole world is not very large compared with creation i must see the outside of our own round planet at least  how much of its outside  first this hemisphere where we live then the other i am resolved that my life shall be a life not a black trance like the toads buried in marble nor a long slow death like yours in briarfield rectory  like mine what can you mean child  might you not as well be tediously dying as for ever shut up in that glebehousea place that when i pass it always reminds me of a windowed grave i never see any movement about the door i never hear a sound from the wall i believe smoke never issues from the chimneys what do you do there  i sew i read i learn lessons  are you happy  should i be happy wandering alone in strange countries as you wish to do  much happier even if you did nothing but wander remember however that i shall have an object in view but if you only went on and on like some enchanted lady in a fairy tale you might be happier than now in a days wandering you would pass many a hill wood and watercourse each perpetually altering in aspect as the sun shone out or was overcast as the weather was wet or fair dark or bright nothing changes in briarfield rectory the plaster of the parlour ceilings the paper on the walls the curtains carpets chairs are still the same  is change necessary to happiness  yes  is it synonymous with it  i dont know but i feel monotony and death to be almost the same  here jessie spoke  isnt she mad she asked  but rose pursued caroline i fear a wanderers life for me at least would end like that tale you are readingin disappointment vanity and vexation of spirit  does the italian so end  i thought so when i read it  better to try all things and find all empty than to try nothing and leave your life a blank to do this is to commit the sin of him who buried his talent in a napkindespicable sluggard  rose observed mrs yorke solid satisfaction is only to be realized by doing ones duty  right mother and if my master has given me ten talents my duty is to trade with them and make them ten talents more not in the dust of household drawers shall the coin be interred i will not deposit it in a brokenspouted teapot and shut it up in a china closet among teathings i will not commit it to your worktable to be smothered in piles of woollen hose i will not prison it in the linen press to find shrouds among the sheets and least of all mother she got up from the floorleast of all will i hide it in a tureen of cold potatoes to be ranged with bread butter pastry and ham on the shelves of the larder  she stopped then went on mother the lord who gave each of us our talents will come home some day and will demand from all an account the teapot the old stockingfoot the linen rag the willowpattern tureen will yield up their barren deposit in many a house suffer your daughters at least to put their money to the exchangers that they may be enabled at the masters coming to pay him his own with usury  rose did you bring your sampler with you as i told you  yes mother  sit down and do a line of marking  rose sat down promptly and wrought according to orders after a busy pause of ten minutes her mother asked do you think yourself oppressed nowa victim  no mother  yet as far as i understood your tirade it was a protest against all womanly and domestic employment  you misunderstood it mother i should be sorry not to learn to sew you do right to teach me and to make me work  even to the mending of your brothers stockings and the making of sheets  yes  where is the use of ranting and spouting about it then  am i to do nothing but that i will do that and then i will do more now mother i have said my say i am twelve years old at present and not till i am sixteen will i speak again about talents for four years i bind myself an industrious apprentice to all you can teach me  you see what my daughters are miss helstone observed mrs yorke how precociously wise in their own conceits i would rather this i prefer thatsuch is jessies cuckoo song while rose utters the bolder cry i will and i will not  i render a reason mother besides if my cry is bold it is only heard once in a twelvemonth about each birthday the spirit moves me to deliver one oracle respecting my own instruction and management i utter it and leave it it is for you mother to listen or not  i would advise all young ladies pursued mrs yorke to study the characters of such children as they chance to meet with before they marry and have any of their own to consider well how they would like the responsibility of guiding the careless the labour of persuading the stubborn the constant burden and task of training the best  but with love it need not be so very difficult interposed caroline mothers love their children most dearlyalmost better than they love themselves  fine talk very sentimental there is the rough practical part of life yet to come for you young miss  but mrs yorke if i take a little baby into my armsany poor womans infant for instancei feel that i love that helpless thing quite peculiarly though i am not its mother i could do almost anything for it willingly if it were delivered over entirely to my careif it were quite dependent on me  you feel yes yes i dare say now you are led a great deal by your feelings and you think yourself a very sensitive personage no doubt are you aware that with all these romantic ideas you have managed to train your features into an habitually lackadaisical expression better suited to a novelheroine than to a woman who is to make her way in the real world by dint of common sense  no i am not at all aware of that mrs yorke  look in the glass just behind you compare the face you see there with that of any earlyrising hardworking milkmaid  my face is a pale one but it is not sentimental and most milkmaids however red and robust they may be are more stupid and less practically fitted to make their way in the world than i am i think more and more correctly than milkmaids in general do consequently where they would often for want of reflection act weakly i by dint of reflection should act judiciously  oh no you would be influenced by your feelings you would be guided by impulse  of course i should often be influenced by my feelings they were given me to that end whom my feelings teach me to love i must and shall love and i hope if ever i have a husband and children my feelings will induce me to love them i hope in that case all my impulses will be strong in compelling me to love  caroline had a pleasure in saying this with emphasis she had a pleasure in daring to say it in mrs yorkes presence she did not care what unjust sarcasm might be hurled at her in reply she flushed not with anger but excitement when the ungenial matron answered coolly dont waste your dramatic effects that was well saidit was quite fine but it is lost on two womenan old wife and an old maid there should have been a disengaged gentleman presentis mr robert nowhere hid behind the curtains do you think miss moore  hortense who during the chief part of the conversation had been in the kitchen superintending the preparations for tea did not yet quite comprehend the drift of the discourse she answered with a puzzled air that robert was at whinbury mrs yorke laughed her own peculiar short laugh  straightforward miss moore said she patronizingly it is like you to understand my question so literally and answer it so simply your mind comprehends nothing of intrigue strange things might go on around you without your being the wiser you are not of the class the world calls sharpwitted  these equivocal compliments did not seem to please hortense she drew herself up puckered her black eyebrows but still looked puzzled  i have ever been noted for sagacity and discernment from childhood she returned for indeed on the possession of these qualities she peculiarly piqued herself  you never plotted to win a husband ill be bound pursued mrs yorke and you have not the benefit of previous experience to aid you in discovering when others plot  caroline felt this kind language where the benevolent speaker intended she should feel itin her very heart she could not even parry the shafts she was defenceless for the present to answer would have been to avow that the cap fitted mrs yorke looking at her as she sat with troubled downcast eyes and cheek burning painfully and figure expressing in its bent attitude and unconscious tremor all the humiliation and chagrin she experienced felt the sufferer was fair game the strange woman had a natural antipathy to a shrinking sensitive charactera nervous temperament nor was a pretty delicate and youthful face a passport to her affections it was seldom she met with all these obnoxious qualities combined in one individual still more seldom she found that individual at her mercy under circumstances in which she could crush her well she happened this afternoon to be specially bilious and moroseas much disposed to gore as any vicious mother of the herd lowering her large head she made a new charge  your cousin hortense is an excellent sister miss helstone such ladies as come to try their lifes luck here at hollows cottage may by a very little clever female artifice cajole the mistress of the house and have the game all in their own hands you are fond of your cousins society i dare say miss  of which cousins  oh of the ladys of course  hortense is and always has been most kind to me  every sister with an eligible single brother is considered most kind by her spinster friends  mrs yorke said caroline lifting her eyes slowly their blue orbs at the same time clearing from trouble and shining steady and full while the glow of shame left her cheek and its hue turned pale and settledmrs yorke may i ask what you mean  to give you a lesson on the cultivation of rectitude to disgust you with craft and false sentiment  do i need this lesson  most young ladies of the present day need it you are quite a modern young ladymorbid delicate professing to like retirement which implies i suppose that you find little worthy of your sympathies in the ordinary world the ordinary worldeveryday honest folksare better than you think them much better than any bookish romancing chit of a girl can be who hardly ever puts her nose over her uncle the parsons garden wall  consequently of whom you know nothing excuse meindeed it does not matter whether you excuse me or notyou have attacked me without provocation i shall defend myself without apology of my relations with my two cousins you are ignorant in a fit of illhumour you have attempted to poison them by gratuitous insinuations which are far more crafty and false than anything with which you can justly charge me that i happen to be pale and sometimes to look diffident is no business of yours that i am fond of books and indisposed for common gossip is still less your business that i am a romancing chit of a girl is a mere conjecture on your part i never romanced to you nor to anybody you know that i am the parsons niece is not a crime though you may be narrowminded enough to think it so you dislike me you have no just reason for disliking me therefore keep the expression of your aversion to yourself if at any time in future you evince it annoyingly i shall answer even less scrupulously than i have done now  she ceased and sat in white and still excitement she had spoken in the clearest of tones neither fast nor loud but her silver accents thrilled the ear the speed of the current in her veins was just then as swift as it was viewless  mrs yorke was not irritated at the reproof worded with a severity so simple dictated by a pride so quiet turning coolly to miss moore she said nodding her cap approvingly she has spirit in her after allalways speak as honestly as you have done just now she continued and youll do  i repel a recommendation so offensive was the answer delivered in the same pure key with the same clear look i reject counsel poisoned by insinuation it is my right to speak as i think proper nothing binds me to converse as you dictate so far from always speaking as i have done just now i shall never address any one in a tone so stern or in language so harsh unless in answer to unprovoked insult  mother you have found your match pronounced little jessie whom the scene appeared greatly to edify rose had heard the whole with an unmoved face she now said no miss helstone is not my mothers match for she allows herself to be vexed my mother would wear her out in a few weeks shirley keeldar manages bettermother you have never hurt miss keeldars feelings yet she wears armour under her silk dress that you cannot penetrate  mrs yorke often complained that her children were mutinous it was strange that with all her strictness with all her strongmindedness she could gain no command over them a look from their father had more influence with them than a lecture from her  miss mooreto whom the position of witness to an altercation in which she took no part was highly displeasing as being an unimportant secondary postnow rallying her dignity prepared to utter a discourse which was to prove both parties in the wrong and to make it clear to each disputant that she had reason to be ashamed of herself and ought to submit humbly to the superior sense of the individual then addressing her fortunately for her audience she had not harangued above ten minutes when sarahs entrance with the teatray called her attention first to the fact of that damsel having a gilt comb in her hair and a red necklace round her throat and secondly and subsequently to a pointed remonstrance to the duty of making tea after the meal rose restored her to goodhumour by bringing her guitar and asking for a song and afterwards engaging her in an intelligent and sharp crossexamination about guitarplaying and music in general  jessie meantime directed her assiduities to caroline sitting on a stool at her feet she talked to her first about religion and then about politics jessie was accustomed at home to drink in a great deal of what her father said on these subjects and afterwards in company to retail with more wit and fluency than consistency or discretion his opinions antipathies and preferences she rated caroline soundly for being a member of the established church and for having an uncle a clergyman she informed her that she lived on the country and ought to work for her living honestly instead of passing a useless life and eating the bread of idleness in the shape of tithes thence jessie passed to a review of the ministry at that time in office and a consideration of its deserts she made familiar mention of the names of lord castlereagh and mr perceval each of these personages she adorned with a character that might have separately suited moloch and belial she denounced the war as wholesale murder and lord wellington as a hired butcher  her auditress listened with exceeding edification jessie had something of the genius of humour in her nature it was inexpressibly comic to hear her repeating her sires denunciations in his nervous northern doric as hearty a little jacobin as ever pent a free mutinous spirit in a muslin frock and sash not malignant by nature her language was not so bitter as it was racy and the expressive little face gave a piquancy to every phrase which held a beholders interest captive  caroline chid her when she abused lord wellington but she listened delighted to a subsequent tirade against the prince regent jessie quickly read in the sparkle of her hearers eye and the laughter hovering round her lips that at last she had hit on a topic that pleased many a time had she heard the fat adonis of fifty discussed at her fathers breakfasttable and she now gave mr yorkes comments on the themegenuine as uttered by his yorkshire lips  but jessie i will write about you no more this is an autumn evening wet and wild there is only one cloud in the sky but it curtains it from pole to pole the wind cannot rest it hurries sobbing over hills of sullen outline colourless with twilight and mist rain has beat all day on that church tower it rises dark from the stony enclosure of its graveyard the nettles the long grass and the tombs all drip with wet this evening reminds me too forcibly of another evening some years agoa howling rainy autumn evening toowhen certain who had that day performed a pilgrimage to a grave newmade in a heretic cemetery sat near a wood fire on the hearth of a foreign dwelling they were merry and social but they each knew that a gap never to be filled had been made in their circle they knew they had lost something whose absence could never be quite atoned for so long as they lived and they knew that heavy falling rain was soaking into the wet earth which covered their lost darling and that the sad sighing gale was mourning above her buried head the fire warmed them life and friendship yet blessed them but jessie lay cold coffined solitaryonly the sod screening her from the storm                                       mrs yorke folded up her knitting cut short the music lesson and the lecture on politics and concluded her visit to the cottage at an hour early enough to ensure her return to briarmains before the blush of sunset should quite have faded in heaven or the path up the fields have become thoroughly moist with evening dew  the lady and her daughters being gone caroline felt that she also ought to resume her scarf kiss her cousins cheek and trip away homeward if she lingered much later dusk would draw on and fanny would be put to the trouble of coming to fetch her it was both baking and ironing day at the rectory she rememberedfanny would be busy still she could not quit her seat at the little parlour window from no point of view could the west look so lovely as from that lattice with the garland of jessamine round it whose white stars and green leaves seemed now but gray pencil outlinesgraceful in form but colourless in tintagainst the gold incarnadined of a summer eveningagainst the firetinged blue of an august sky at eight oclock pm  caroline looked at the wicketgate beside which hollyoaks spired up tall she looked at the close hedge of privet and laurel fencing in the garden her eyes longed to see something more than the shrubs before they turned from that limited prospect they longed to see a human figure of a certain mould and height pass the hedge and enter the gate a human figure she at last sawnay two frederick murgatroyd went by carrying a pail of water joe scott followed dangling on his forefinger the keys of the mill they were going to lock up mill and stables for the night and then betake themselves home  so must i thought caroline as she half rose and sighed  this is all follyheartbreaking folly she added in the first place though i should stay till dark there will be no arrival because i feel in my heart fate has written it down in todays page of her eternal book that i am not to have the pleasure i long for in the second place if he stepped in this moment my presence here would be a chagrin to him and the consciousness that it must be so would turn half my blood to ice his hand would perhaps be loose and chill if i put mine into it his eye would be clouded if i sought its beam i should look up for that kindling something i have seen in past days when my face or my language or my disposition had at some happy moment pleased him i should discover only darkness i had better go home  she took her bonnet from the table where it lay and was just fastening the ribbon when hortense directing her attention to a splendid bouquet of flowers in a glass on the same table mentioned that miss keeldar had sent them that morning from fieldhead and went on to comment on the guests that lady was at present entertaining on the bustling life she had lately been leading adding divers conjectures that she did not very well like it and much wonderment that a person who was so fond of her own way as the heiress did not find some means of sooner getting rid of this cortége of relatives  but they say she actually will not let mr sympson and his family go she added they wanted much to return to the south last week to be ready for the reception of the only son who is expected home from a tour she insists that her cousin henry shall come and join his friends here in yorkshire i dare say she partly does it to oblige robert and myself  how to oblige robert and you inquired caroline  why my child you are dull dont you knowyou must often have heard  please maam said sarah opening the door the preserves that you told me to boil in treaclethe congfiters as you call themis all burnt to the pan  les confitures elles sont brûlées ah quelle négligence coupable coquine de cuisinière fille insupportable  and mademoiselle hastily taking from a drawer a large linen apron and tying it over her black apron rushed éperdue into the kitchen whence to speak truth exhaled an odour of calcined sweets rather strong than savoury  the mistress and maid had been in full feud the whole day on the subject of preserving certain black cherries hard as marbles sour as sloes sarah held that sugar was the only orthodox condiment to be used in that process mademoiselle maintainedand proved it by the practice and experience of her mother grandmother and greatgrandmotherthat treacle mélasse was infinitely preferable she had committed an imprudence in leaving sarah in charge of the preservingpan for her want of sympathy in the nature of its contents had induced a degree of carelessness in watching their confection whereof the result wasdark and cindery ruin hubbub followed high upbraiding and sobs rather loud than deep or real  caroline once more turning to the little mirror was shading her ringlets from her cheek to smooth them under her cottage bonnet certain that it would not only be useless but unpleasant to stay longer when on the sudden opening of the backdoor there fell an abrupt calm in the kitchen the tongues were checked pulled up as with bit and bridle was itwas itrobert he oftenalmost alwaysentered by

set it i yer way fair as if they did it i malice  to joes observations succeeded a confused sort of pause which caroline though she was listening with both her ears could not understand it was very brief a cry broke ita sound of surprise followed by the sound of a kiss ejaculations but half articulate succeeded  mon dieu mon dieu estce que je my attendais were the words chiefly to be distinguished  et tu te portes toujours bien bonne sœur inquired another voiceroberts certainly  caroline was puzzled obeying an impulse the wisdom of which she had not time to question she escaped from the little parlour by way of leaving the coast clear and running upstairs took up a position at the head of the banisters whence she could make further observations ere presenting herself it was considerably past sunset now dusk filled the passage yet not such deep dusk but that she could presently see robert and hortense traverse it  caroline caroline called hortense a moment afterwards venez voir mon frère  strange commented miss helstone passing strange what does this unwonted excitement about such an everyday occurrence as a return from market portend she has not lost her senses has she surely the burnt treacle has not crazed her  she descended in a subdued flutter yet more was she fluttered when hortense seized her hand at the parlour door and leading her to robert who stood in bodily presence tall and dark against the one window presented her with a mixture of agitation and formality as though they had been utter strangers and this was their first mutual introduction  increasing puzzle he bowed rather awkwardly and turning from her with a strangers embarrassment he met the doubtful light from the window it fell on his face and the enigma of the dream a dream it seemed was at its height she saw a visage like and unlikerobert and no robert  what is the matter said caroline is my sight wrong is it my cousin  certainly it is your cousin asserted hortense  then who was this now coming through the passagenow entering the room caroline looking round met a new robertthe real robert as she felt at once  well said he smiling at her questioning astonished face which is which  ah this is you was the answer  he laughed i believe it is me and do you know who he is you never saw him before but you have heard of him  she had gathered her senses now  it can be only one personyour brother since it is so like you my other cousin louis  clever little Œdipus you would have baffled the sphinx but now see us togetherchange places change again to confuse her louiswhich is the old love now lina  as if it were possible to make a mistake when you speak you should have told hortense to ask but you are not so much alike it is only your height your figure and complexion that are so similar  and i am robert am i not asked the newcomer making a first effort to overcome what seemed his natural shyness  caroline shook her head gently a soft expressive ray from her eye beamed on the real robert it said much  she was not permitted to quit her cousins soon robert himself was peremptory in obliging her to remain glad simple and affable in her demeanour glad for this night at least in light bright spirits for the time she was too pleasant an addition to the cottage circle to be willingly parted with by any of them louis seemed naturally rather a grave still retiring man but the caroline of this evening which was not as you know reader the caroline of every day thawed his reserve and cheered his gravity soon he sat near her and talked to her she already knew his vocation was that of tuition she learned now he had for some years been the tutor of mr sympsons son that he had been travelling with him and had accompanied him to the north she inquired if he liked his post but got a look in reply which did not invite or license further question the look woke carolines ready sympathy she thought it a very sad expression to pass over so sensible a face as louiss for he had a sensible face though not handsome she considered when seen near roberts she turned to make the comparison robert was leaning against the wall a little behind her turning over the leaves of a book of engravings and probably listening at the same time to the dialogue between her and louis  how could i think them alike she asked herself i see now it is hortense louis resembles not robert  and this was in part true he had the shorter nose and longer upper lip of his sister rather than the fine traits of his brother he had her mould of mouth and chinall less decisive accurate and clear than those of the young millowner his air though deliberate and reflective could scarcely be called prompt and acute you felt in sitting near and looking up at him that a slower and probably a more benignant nature than that of the elder moore shed calm on your impressions  robertperhaps aware that carolines glance had wandered towards and dwelt upon him though he had neither met nor answered itput down the book of engravings and approaching took a seat at her side she resumed her conversation with louis but while she talked to him her thoughts were elsewhere her heart beat on the side from which her face was half averted she acknowledged a steady manly kindly air in louis but she bent before the secret power of robert to be so near himthough he was silent though he did not touch so much as her scarffringe or the white hem of her dressaffected her like a spell had she been obliged to speak to him only it would have quelled but at liberty to address another it excited her her discourse flowed freely it was gay playful eloquent the indulgent look and placid manner of her auditor encouraged her to ease the sober pleasure expressed by his smile drew out all that was brilliant in her nature she felt that this evening she appeared to advantage and as robert was a spectator the consciousness contented her had he been called away collapse would at once have succeeded stimulus  but her enjoyment was not long to shine fullorbed a cloud soon crossed it  hortense who for some time had been on the move ordering supper and was now clearing the little table of some books etc to make room for the tray called roberts attention to the glass of flowers the carmine and snow and gold of whose petals looked radiant indeed by candlelight  they came from fieldhead she said intended as a gift to you no doubt we know who is the favourite there not i im sure  it was a wonder to hear hortense jesta sign that her spirits were at highwater mark indeed  we are to understand then that robert is the favourite observed louis  mon cher replied hortense robertcest tout ce quil y a de plus précieux au monde à côté de lui le reste du genre humain nest que du rebutnaije pas raison mon enfant she added appealing to caroline  caroline was obliged to reply yes and her beacon was quenched her star withdrew as she spoke  et toi robert inquired louis  when you shall have an opportunity ask herself was the quiet answer whether he reddened or paled caroline did not examine she discovered that it was late and she must go home home she would go not even robert could detain her now     chapter xxiv  the valley of the shadow of death   the future sometimes seems to sob a low warning of the events it is bringing us like some gathering though yet remote storm which in tones of the wind in flushings of the firmament in clouds strangely torn announces a blast strong to strew the sea with wrecks or commissioned to bring in fog the yellow taint of pestilence covering white western isles with the poisoned exhalations of the east dimming the lattices of english homes with the breath of indian plague at other times this future bursts suddenly as if a rock had rent and in it a grave had opened whence issues the body of one that slept ere you are aware you stand face to face with a shrouded and unthoughtof calamitya new lazarus  caroline helstone went home from hollows cottage in good health as she imagined on waking the next morning she felt oppressed with unwonted languor at breakfast at each meal of the following day she missed all sense of appetite palatable food was as ashes and sawdust to her  am i ill she asked and looked at herself in the glass her eyes were bright their pupils dilated her cheeks seemed rosier and fuller than usual i look well why can i not eat  she felt a pulse beat fast in her temples she felt too her brain in strange activity her spirits were raised hundreds of busy and broken but brilliant thoughts engaged her mind a glow rested on them such as tinged her complexion  now followed a hot parched thirsty restless night towards morning one terrible dream seized her like a tiger when she woke she felt and knew she was ill  how she had caught the fever fever it was she could not tell probably in her late walk home some sweet poisoned breeze redolent of honeydew and miasma had passed into her lungs and veins and finding there already a fever of mental excitement and a languor of long conflict and habitual sadness had fanned the spark to flame and left a welllit fire behind it  it seemed however but a gentle fire after two hot days and worried nights there was no violence in the symptoms and neither her uncle nor fanny nor the doctor nor miss keeldar when she called had any fear for her a few days would restore her every one believed  the few days passed andthough it was still thought it could not long delaythe revival had not begun mrs pryor who had visited her dailybeing present in her chamber one morning when she had been ill a fortnightwatched her very narrowly for some minutes she took her hand and placed her finger on her wrist then quietly leaving the chamber she went to mr helstones study with him she remained closeted a long timehalf the morning on returning to her sick young friend she laid aside shawl and bonnet she stood awhile at the bedside one hand placed in the other gently rocking herself to and fro in an attitude and with a movement habitual to her at last she said i have sent fanny to fieldhead to fetch a few things for me such as i shall want during a short stay here it is my wish to remain with you till you are better your uncle kindly permits my attendance will it to yourself be acceptable caroline  i am sorry you should take such needless trouble i do not feel very ill but i cannot refuse resolutely it will be such comfort to know you are in the house to see you sometimes in the room but dont confine yourself on my account dear mrs pryor fanny nurses me very well  mrs pryor bending over the pale little sufferer was now smoothing the hair under her cap and gently raising her pillow as she performed these offices caroline smiling lifted her face to kiss her  are you free from pain are you tolerably at ease was inquired in a low earnest voice as the selfelected nurse yielded to the caress  i think i am almost happy  you wish to drink your lips are parched  she held a glass filled with some cooling beverage to her mouth  have you eaten anything today caroline  i cannot eat  but soon your appetite will return it must returnthat is i pray god it may  in laying her again on the couch she encircled her in her arms and while so doing by a movement which seemed scarcely voluntary she drew her to her heart and held her close gathered an instant  i shall hardly wish to get well that i may keep you always said caroline  mrs pryor did not smile at this speech over her features ran a tremor which for some minutes she was absorbed in repressing  you are more used to fanny than to me she remarked ere long i should think my attendance must seem strange officious  no quite natural and very soothing you must have been accustomed to wait on sick people maam you move about the room so softly and you speak so quietly and touch me so gently  i am dexterous in nothing my dear you will often find me awkward but never negligent  negligent indeed she was not from that hour fanny and eliza became ciphers in the sickroom mrs pryor made it her domain she performed all its duties she lived in it day and night the patient remonstratedfaintly however from the first and not at all ere long loneliness and gloom were now banished from her bedside protection and solace sat there instead she and her nurse coalesced in wondrous union caroline was usually pained to require or receive much attendance mrs pryor under ordinary circumstances had neither the habit nor the art of performing little offices of service but all now passed with such ease so naturally that the patient was as willing to be cherished as the nurse was bent on cherishing no sign of weariness in the latter ever reminded the former that she ought to be anxious there was in fact no very hard duty to perform but a hireling might have found it hard  with all this care it seemed strange the sick girl did not get well yet such was the case she wasted like any snowwreath in thaw she faded like any flower in drought miss keeldar on whose thoughts danger or death seldom intruded had at first entertained no fears at all for her friend but seeing her change and sink from time to time when she paid her visits alarm clutched her heart she went to mr helstone and expressed herself with so much energy that that gentleman was at last obliged however unwillingly to admit the idea that his niece was ill of something more than a migraine and when mrs pryor came and quietly demanded a physician he said she might send for two if she liked one came but that one was an oracle he delivered a dark saying of which the future was to solve the mystery wrote some prescriptions gave some directionsthe whole with an air of crushing authoritypocketed his fee and went probably he knew well enough he could do no good but didnt like to say so  still no rumour of serious illness got wind in the neighbourhood at hollows cottage it was thought that caroline had only a severe cold she having written a note to hortense to that effect and mademoiselle contented herself with sending two pots of currant jam a recipe for a tisane and a note of advice  mrs yorke being told that a physician had been summoned sneered at the hypochondriac fancies of the rich and idle who she said having nothing but themselves to think about must needs send for a doctor if only so much as their little finger ached  the rich and idle represented in the person of caroline were meantime falling fast into a condition of prostration whose quickly consummated debility puzzled all who witnessed it except one for that one alone reflected how liable is the undermined structure to sink in sudden ruin  sick people often have fancies inscrutable to ordinary attendants and caroline had one which even her tender nurse could not at first explain on a certain day in the week at a certain hour she wouldwhether worse or betterentreat to be taken up and dressed and suffered to sit in her chair near the window this station she would retain till noon was past whatever degree of exhaustion or debility her wan aspect betrayed she still softly put off all persuasion to seek repose until the church clock had duly tolled midday the twelve strokes sounded she grew docile and would meekly lie down returned to the couch she usually buried her face deep in the pillow and drew the coverlets close round her as if to shut out the world and sun of which she was tired more than once as she thus lay a slight convulsion shook the sickbed and a faint sob broke the silence round it these things were not unnoted by mrs pryor  one tuesday morning as usual she had asked leave to rise and now she sat wrapped in her white dressinggown leaning forward in the easychair gazing steadily and patiently from the lattice mrs pryor was seated a little behind knitting as it seemed but in truth watching her a change crossed her pale mournful brow animating its languor a light shot into her faded eyes reviving their lustre she half rose and looked earnestly out mrs pryor drawing softly near glanced over her shoulder from this window was visible the churchyard beyond it the road and there riding sharply by appeared a horseman the figure was not yet too remote for recognition mrs pryor had long sight she knew mr moore just as an intercepting rising ground concealed him from view the clock struck twelve  may i lie down again asked caroline  her nurse assisted her to bed having laid her down and drawn the curtain she stood listening near the little couch trembled the suppressed sob stirred the air a contraction as of anguish altered mrs pryors features she wrung her hands half a groan escaped her lips she now remembered that tuesday was whinbury market day mr moore must always pass the rectory on his way thither just ere noon of that day  caroline wore continually round her neck a slender braid of silk attached to which was some trinket mrs pryor had seen the bit of gold glisten but had not yet obtained a fair view of it her patient never parted with it when dressed it was hidden in her bosom as she lay in bed she always held it in her hand that tuesday afternoon the transient dozemore like lethargy than sleepwhich sometimes abridged the long days had stolen over her the weather was hot while turning in febrile restlessness she had pushed the coverlets a little aside mrs pryor bent to replace them the small wasted hand lying nerveless on the sick girls breast clasped as usual her jealouslyguarded treasure those fingers whose attenuation it gave pain to see were now relaxed in sleep mrs pryor gently disengaged the braid drawing out a tiny locketa slight thing it was such as it suited her small purse to purchase under its crystal face appeared a curl of black hair too short and crisp to have been severed from a female head  some agitated movement occasioned a twitch of the silken chain the sleeper started and woke her thoughts were usually now somewhat scattered on waking her look generally wandering half rising as if in terror she exclaimed dont take it from me robert dont it is my last comfort let me keep it i never tell any one whose hair it is i never show it  mrs pryor had already disappeared behind the curtain reclining far back in a deep armchair by the bedside she was withdrawn from view caroline looked abroad into the chamber she thought it empty as her stray ideas returned slowly each folding its weak wings on the minds sad shore like birds exhausted beholding void and perceiving silence round her she believed herself alone collected she was not yet perhaps healthy selfpossession and selfcontrol were to be hers no more perhaps that world the strong and prosperous live in had already rolled from beneath her feet for ever so at least it often seemed to herself in health she had never been accustomed to think aloud but now words escaped her lips unawares  oh i should see him once more before all is over heaven might favour me thus far she cried god grant me a little comfort before i die was her humble petition  but he will not know i am ill till i am gone and he will come when they have laid me out and i am senseless cold and stiff  what can my departed soul feel then can it see or know what happens to the clay can spirits through any medium communicate with living flesh can the dead at all revisit those they leave can they come in the elements will wind water fire lend me a path to moore  is it for nothing the wind sounds almost articulately sometimessings as i have lately heard it sing at nightor passes the casement sobbing as if for sorrow to come does nothing then haunt it nothing inspire it  why it suggested to me words one night it poured a strain which i could have written down only i was appalled and dared not rise to seek pencil and paper by the dim watchlight  what is that electricity they speak of whose changes make us well or ill whose lack or excess blasts whose even balance revives what are all those influences that are about us in the atmosphere that keep playing over our nerves like fingers on stringed instruments and call forth now a sweet note and now a wailnow an exultant swell and anon the saddest cadence  where is the other world in what will another life consist why do i ask have i not cause to think that the hour is hasting but too fast when the veil must be rent for me do i not know the grand mystery is likely to burst prematurely on me great spirit in whose goodness i confide whom as my father i have petitioned night and morning from early infancy help the weak creation of thy hands sustain me through the ordeal i dread and must undergo give me strength give me patience give meoh give me faith  she fell back on her pillow mrs pryor found means to steal quietly from the room she reentered it soon after apparently as composed as if she had really not overheard this strange soliloquy  the next day several callers came it had become known that miss helstone was worse mr hall and his sister margaret arrived both after they had been in the sickroom quitted it in tears they had found the patient more altered than they expected hortense moore came caroline seemed stimulated by her presence she assured her smiling she was not dangerously ill she talked to her in a low voice but cheerfully during her stay excitement kept up the flush of her complexion she looked better  how is mr robert asked mrs pryor as hortense was preparing to take leave  he was very well when he left  left is he gone from home  it was then explained that some police intelligence about the rioters of whom he was in pursuit had that morning called him away to birmingham and probably a fortnight might elapse ere he returned  he is not aware that miss helstone is very ill  oh no he thought like me that she had only a bad cold  after this visit mrs pryor took care not to approach carolines couch for above an hour she heard her weep and dared not look on her tears  as evening closed in she brought her some tea caroline opening her eyes from a moments slumber viewed her nurse with an unrecognizing glance  i smelt the honeysuckles in the glen this summer morning she said as i stood at the countinghouse window  strange words like these from pallid lips pierce a loving listeners heart more poignantly than steel they sound romantic perhaps in books in real life they are harrowing  my darling do you know me said mrs pryor  i went in to call robert to breakfast i have been with him in the garden he asked me to go a heavy dew has refreshed the flowers the peaches are ripening  my darling my darling again and again repeated the nurse  i thought it was daylightlong after sunrise it looks dark is the moon now set  that moon lately risen was gazing full and mild upon her floating in deep blue space it watched her unclouded  then it is not morning i am not at the cottage who is this i see a shape at my bedside  it is myselfit is your friendyour nurseyour lean your head on my shoulder collect yourself in a lower toneo god take pity give her life and me strength send me courage teach me words  some minutes passed in silence the patient lay mute and passive in the trembling arms on the throbbing bosom of the nurse  i am better now whispered caroline at last much better i feel where i am this is mrs pryor near me i was dreaming i talk when i wake up from dreams people often do in illness how fast your heart beats maam do not be afraid  it is not fear childonly a little anxiety which will pass i have brought you some tea cary your uncle made it himself you know he says he can make a better cup of tea than any housewife can taste it he is concerned to hear that you eat so little he would be glad if you had a better appetite  i am thirsty let me drink  she drank eagerly  what oclock is it maam she asked  past nine  not later oh i have yet a long night before me but the tea has made me strong i will sit up  mrs pryor raised her and arranged her pillows  thank heaven i am not always equally miserable and ill and hopeless the afternoon has been bad since hortense went perhaps the evening may be better it is a fine night i think the moon shines clear  very finea perfect summer night the old churchtower gleams white almost as silver  and does the churchyard look peaceful  yes and the garden also dew glistens on the foliage  can you see many long weeds and nettles amongst the graves or do they look turfy and flowery  i see closed daisyheads gleaming like pearls on some mounds thomas has mown down the dockleaves and rank grass and cleared all away  i always like that to be done it soothes ones mind to see the place in order and i dare say within the church just now that moonlight shines as softly as in my room it will fall through the east window full on the helstone monument when i close my eyes i seem to see poor papas epitaph in black letters on the white marble there is plenty of room for other inscriptions underneath  william farren came to look after your flowers this morning he was afraid now you cannot tend them yourself they would be neglected he has taken two of your favourite plants home to nurse for you  if i were to make a will i would leave william all my plants shirley my trinketsexcept one which must not be taken off my neck and you maam my books after a pausemrs pryor i feel a longing wish for something  for what caroline  you know i always delight to hear you sing sing me a hymn just now sing that hymn which begins      our god our help in ages past        our hope for years to come      our shelter from the stormy blast        our refuge haven home  mrs pryor at once complied  no wonder caroline liked to hear her sing her voice even in speaking was sweet and silver clear in song it was almost divine neither flute nor dulcimer has tones so pure but the tone was secondary compared to the expression which trembled througha tender vibration from a feeling heart  the servants in the kitchen hearing the strain stole to the stairfoot to listen even old helstone as he walked in the garden pondering over the unaccountable and feeble nature of women stood still amongst his borders to catch the mournful melody more distinctly why it reminded him of his forgotten dead wife he could not tell nor why it made him more concerned than he had hitherto been for carolines fading girlhood he was glad to recollect that he had promised to pay wynne the magistrate a visit that evening low spirits and gloomy thoughts were very much his aversion when they attacked him he usually found means to make them march in doublequick time the hymn followed him faintly as he crossed the fields he hastened his customary sharp pace that he might get beyond its reach      thy word commands our flesh to dust        return ye sons of men      all nations rose from earth at first        and turn to earth again      a thousand ages in thy sight        are like an evening gone      short as the watch that ends the night        before the rising sun      time like an everrolling stream        bears all its sons away      they fly forgotten as a dream        dies at the opening day      like flowery fields the nations stand        fresh in the morning light      the flowers beneath the mowers hand        lie withering ere tis night      our god our help in ages past        our hope for years to come      be thou our guard while troubles last        o father be our home  now sing a songa scottish song suggested caroline when the hymn was overye banks and braes o bonnie doon  again mrs pryor obeyed or essayed to obey at the close of the first stanza she stopped she could get no further her full heart flowed over  you are weeping at the pathos of the air come here and i will comfort you said caroline in a pitying accent mrs pryor came she sat down on the edge of her patients bed and allowed the wasted arms to encircle her  you often soothe me let me soothe you murmured the young girl kissing her cheek i hope she added it is not for me you weep  no answer followed  do you think i shall not get better i do not feel very illonly weak  but your mind carolineyour mind is crushed your heart is almost broken you have been so neglected so repulsed left so desolate  i believe grief is and always has been my worst ailment i sometimes think if an abundant gush of happiness came on me i could revive yet  do you wish to live  i have no object in life  you love me caroline  very muchvery trulyinexpressibly sometimes just now i feel as if i could almost grow to your heart  i will return directly dear remarked mrs pryor as she laid caroline down  quitting her she glided to the door softly turned the key in the lock ascertained that it was fast and came back she bent over her she threw back the curtain to admit the moonlight more freely she gazed intently on her face  then if you love me said she speaking quickly with an altered voice if you feel as if to use your own words you could grow to my heart it will be neither shock nor pain for you to know that that heart is the source whence yours was filled that from my veins issued the tide which flows in yours that you are minemy daughtermy own child  mrs pryor  my own child  that isthat meansyou have adopted me  it means that if i have given you nothing else i at least gave you life that i bore you nursed you that i am your true mother no other woman can claim the title it is mine  but mrs james helstonebut my fathers wife whom i do not remember ever to have seen she is my mother  she is your mother james helstone was my husband i say you are mine i have proved it i thought perhaps you were all his which would have been a cruel dispensation for me i find it is not so god permitted me to be the parent of my childs mind it belongs to me it is my propertymy right these features are jamess own he had a fine face when he was young and not altered by error papa my darling gave you your blue eyes and soft brown hair he gave you the oval of your face and the regularity of your lineamentsthe outside he conferred but the heart and the brain are mine the germs are from me and they are improved they are developed to excellence i esteem and approve my child as highly as i do most fondly love her  is what i hear true is it no dream  i wish it were as true that the substance and colour of health were restored to your cheek  my own mother is she one i can be so fond of as i can of you people generally did not like herso i have been given to understand  they told you that well your mother now tells you that not having the gift to please people generally for their approbation she does not care her thoughts are centred in her child does that child welcome or reject her  but if you are my mother the world is all changed to me surely i can live i should like to recover  you must recover you drew life and strength from my breast when you were a tiny fair infant over whose blue eyes i used to weep fearing i beheld in your very beauty the sign of qualities that had entered my heart like iron and pierced through my soul like a sword daughter we have been long parted i return now to cherish you again  she held her to her bosom she cradled her in her arms she rocked her softly as if lulling a young child to sleep  my mothermy own mother  the offspring nestled to the parent that parent feeling the endearment and hearing the appeal gathered her closer still she covered her with noiseless kisses she murmured love over her like a cushat fostering its young  there was silence in the room for a long while                                       does my uncle know  your uncle knows i told him when i first came to stay with you here  did you recognize me when we first met at fieldhead  how could it be otherwise mr and miss helstone being announced i was prepared to see my child  it was that then which moved you i saw you disturbed  you saw nothing caroline i can cover my feelings you can never tell what an age of strange sensation i lived during the two minutes that elapsed between the report of your name and your entrance you can never tell how your look mien carriage shook me  why were you disappointed  what will she be like i had asked myself and when i saw what you were like i could have dropped  mamma why  i trembled in your presence i said i will never own her she shall never know me  but i said and did nothing remarkable i felt a little diffident at the thought of an introduction to strangersthat was all  i soon saw you were diffident that was the first thing which reassured me had you been rustic clownish awkward i should have been content  you puzzle me  i had reason to dread a fair outside to mistrust a popular bearing to shudder before distinction grace and courtesy beauty and affability had come in my way when i was recluse desolate young and ignoranta toilworn governess perishing of uncheered labour breaking down before her time these caroline when they smiled on me i mistook for angels i followed them home and when into their hands i had given without reserve my whole chance of future happiness it was my lot to witness a transfiguration on the domestic hearthto see the white mask lifted the bright disguise put away and opposite me sat down o god i have suffered  she sank on the pillow  i have suffered none sawnone knew there was no sympathy no redemption no redress  take comfort mother it is over now  it is over and not fruitlessly i tried to keep the word of his patience he kept me in the days of my anguish i was afraid with terrori was troubled through great tribulation he brought me through to a salvation revealed in this last time my fear had torment he has cast it out he has given me in its stead perfect love but caroline  thus she invoked her daughter after a pause  mother  i charge you when you next look on your fathers monument to respect the name chiselled there to you he did only good on you he conferred his whole treasure of beauties nor added to them one dark defect all you derived from him is excellent you owe him gratitude leave between him and me the settlement of our mutual account meddle not god is the arbiter this worlds laws never came near usnever they were powerless as a rotten bulrush to protect meimpotent as idiot babblings to restrain him as you said it is all over now the grave lies between us there he sleeps in that church to his dust i say this night what i have never said before james slumber peacefully see your terrible debt is cancelled look i wipe out the long black account with my own hand james your child atones this living likeness of youthis thing with your perfect featuresthis one good gift you gave me has nestled affectionately to my heart and tenderly called me mother husband rest forgiven  dearest mother that is right can papas spirit hear us is he comforted to know that we still love him  i said nothing of love i spoke of forgiveness mind the truth child i said nothing of love on the threshold of eternity should he be there to see me enter will i maintain that  o mother you must have suffered  o child the human heart can suffer it can hold more tears than the ocean holds waters we never know how deep how wide it is till misery begins to unbind her clouds and fill it with rushing blackness  mother forget  forget she said with the strangest spectre of a laugh the north pole will rush to the south and the headlands of europe be locked into the bays of australia ere i forget  hush mother rest be at peace  and the child lulled the parent as the parent had erst lulled the child at last mrs pryor wept she then grew calmer she resumed those tender cares agitation had for a moment suspended replacing her daughter on the couch she smoothed the pillow and spread the sheet the soft hair whose locks were loosened she rearranged the damp brow she refreshed with a cool fragrant essence  mamma let them bring a candle that i may see you and tell my uncle to come into this room byandby i want to hear him say that i am your daughter and mamma take your supper here dont leave me for one minute tonight  o caroline it is well you are gentle you will say to me go and i shall go come and i shall come do this and i shall do it you inherit a certain manner as well as certain features it will always be mamma prefacing a mandatesoftly spoken though from you thank god well she added under her breath he spoke softly too once like a flute breathing tenderness and then when the world was not by to listen discords that split the nerves and curdled the bloodsounds to inspire insanity  it seems so natural mamma to ask you for this and that i shall want nobody but you to be near me or to do anything for me but do not let me be troublesome check me if i encroach  you must not depend on me to check you you must keep guard over yourself i have little moral courage the want of it is my bane it is that which has made me an unnatural parentwhich has kept me apart from my child during the ten years which have elapsed since my husbands death left me at liberty to claim her it was that which first unnerved my arms and permitted the infant i might have retained a while longer to be snatched prematurely from their embrace  how mamma  i let you go as a babe because you were pretty and i feared your loveliness deeming it the stamp of perversity they sent me your portrait taken at eight years old that portrait confirmed my fears had it shown me a sunburnt little rustica heavy bluntfeatured commonplace childi should have hastened to claim you but there under the silver paper i saw blooming the delicacy of an aristocratic flowerlittle lady was written on every trait i had too recently crawled from under the yoke of the fine gentlemanescaped galled crushed paralyzed dyingto dare to encounter his still finer and most fairylike representative my sweet little lady overwhelmed me with dismay her air of native elegance froze my very marrow in my experience i had not met with truth modesty good principle as the concomitants of beauty a form so straight and fine i argued must conceal a mind warped and cruel i had little faith in the power of education to rectify such a mind or rather i entirely misdoubted my own ability to influence it caroline i dared not undertake to rear you i resolved to leave you in your uncles hands matthewson helstone i knew if an austere was an upright man he and all the world thought hardly of me for my strange unmotherly resolve and i deserved to be misjudged  mamma why did you call yourself mrs pryor  it was a name in my mothers family i adopted it that i might live unmolested my married name recalled too vividly my married life i could not bear it besides threats were uttered of forcing me to return to bondage it could not be rather a bier for a bed the grave for a home my new name sheltered me i resumed under its screen my old occupation of teaching at first it scarcely procured me the means of sustaining life but how savoury was hunger when i fasted in peace how safe seemed the darkness and chill of an unkindled hearth when no lurid reflection from terror crimsoned its desolation how serene was solitude when i feared not the irruption of violence and vice  but mamma you have been in this neighbourhood before how did it happen that when you reappeared here with miss keeldar you were not recognized  i only paid a short visit as a bride twenty years ago and then i was very different to what i am nowslender almost as slender as my daughter is at this day my complexion my very features are changed my hair my style of dresseverything is altered you cannot fancy me a slim young person attired in scanty drapery of white muslin with bare arms bracelets and necklace of beads and hair disposed in round grecian curls above my forehead  you must indeed have been different mamma i heard the front door open if it is my uncle coming in just ask him to step upstairs and let me hear his assurance that i am truly awake and collected and not dreaming or delirious  the rector of his own accord was mounting the stairs and mrs pryor summoned him to his nieces apartment  shes not worse i hope he inquired hastily  i think her better she is disposed to converse she seems stronger  good said he brushing quickly into the roomha cary how do did you drink my cup of tea i made it for you just as i like it myself  i drank it every drop uncle it did me good it has made me quite alive i have a wish for company so i begged mrs pryor to call you in  the respected ecclesiastic looked pleased and yet embarrassed he was willing enough to bestow his company on his sick niece for ten minutes since it was her whim to wish it but what means to employ for her entertainment he knew not he hemmedhe fidgeted  youll be up in a trice he observed by way of saying something the little weakness will soon pass off and then you must drink port winea pipe if you canand eat game and oysters ill get them for you if they are to be had anywhere bless me well make you as strong as samson before were done with you  who is that lady uncle standing beside you at the bedfoot  good god he ejaculated shes not wandering is she maam  mrs pryor smiled  i am wandering in a pleasant world said caroline in a soft happy voice and i want you to tell me whether it is real or visionary what lady is that give her a name uncle  we must have dr rile again maam or better still macturk hes less of a humbug thomas must saddle the pony and go for him  no i dont want a doctor mamma shall be my only physician now do you understand uncle  mr helstone pushed up his spectacles from his nose to his forehead handled his snuffbox and administered to himself a portion of the contents thus fortified he answered briefly i see daylight youve told her then maam  and is it true demanded caroline rising on her pillow is she really my mother  you wont cry or make any scene or turn hysterical if i answer yes  cry id cry if you said no it would be terrible to be disappointed now but give her a name how do you call her  i call this stout lady in a quaint black dress who looks young enough to wear much smarter raiment if she wouldi call her agnes helstone she married my brother james and is his widow  and my mother  what a little sceptic it is look at her small face mrs pryor scarcely larger than the palm of my hand alive with acuteness and eagerness to carolineshe had the trouble of bringing you into the world at any rate mind you show your duty to her by quickly getting well and repairing the waste of these cheeksheighho she used to be plump what she has done with it all i cant for the life of me divine  if wishing to get well will help me i shall not be long sick this morning i had no reason and no strength to wish it  fanny here tapped at the door and said that supper was ready  uncle if you please you may send me a little bit of supperanything you like from your own plate that is wiser than going into hysterics is it not  it is spoken like a sage cary see if i dont cater for you judiciously when women are sensible and above all intelligible i can get on with them it is only the vague superfine sensations and extremely wiredrawn notions that put me about let a woman ask me to give her an edible or a wearablebe the same a rocs egg or the breastplate of aaron a share of st johns locusts and honey or the leathern girdle about his loinsi can at least understand the demand but when they pine for they know not whatsympathy sentiment some of these indefinite abstractionsi cant do it i dont know it i havent got itmadam accept my arm  mrs pryor signified that she should stay with her daughter that evening helstone accordingly left them together he soon returned bringing a plate in his own consecrated hand  this is chicken he said but well have partridge tomorrowlift her up and put a shawl over her on my word i understand nursingnow here is the very same little silver fork you used when you first came to the rectory that strikes me as being what you may call a happy thoughta delicate attention take it cary and munch away cleverly  caroline did her best her uncle frowned to see that her powers were so limited he prophesied however great things for the future and as she praised the morsel he had brought and smiled gratefully in his face he stooped over her pillow kissed her and said with a broken rugged accent goodnight bairnie god bless thee  caroline enjoyed such peaceful rest that night circled by her mothers arms and pillowed on her breast that she forgot to wish for any other stay and though more than one feverish dream came to her in slumber yet when she woke up panting so happy and contented a feeling returned with returning consciousness that her agitation was soothed almost as soon as felt  as to the mother she spent the night like jacob at peniel till break of day she wrestled with god in earnest prayer     chapter xxv  the west wind blows   not always do those who dare such divine conflict prevail night after night the sweat of agony may burst dark on the forehead the supplicant may cry for mercy with that soundless voice the soul utters when its appeal is to the invisible spare my beloved it may implore heal my lifes life rend not from me what long affection entwines with my whole nature god of heaven bend hear be clement and after this cry and strife the sun may rise and see him worsted that opening morn which used to salute him with the whisper of zephyrs the carol of skylarks may breathe as its first accents from the dear lips which colour and heat have quitted oh i have had a suffering night this morning i am worse i have tried to rise i cannot dreams i am unused to have troubled me  then the watcher approaches the patients pillow and sees a new and strange moulding of the familiar features feels at once that the insufferable moment draws nigh knows that it is gods will his idol shall be broken and bends his head and subdues his soul to the sentence he cannot avert and scarce can bear  happy mrs pryor she was still praying unconscious that the summer sun hung above the hills when her child softly woke in her arms no piteous unconscious moaningsound which so wastes our strength that even if we have sworn to be firm a rush of unconquerable tears sweeps away the oathpreceded her waking no space of deaf apathy followed the first words spoken were not those of one becoming estranged from this world and already permitted to stray at times into realms foreign to the living caroline evidently remembered with clearness what had happened  mamma i have slept so well i only dreamed and woke twice  mrs pryor rose with a start that her daughter might not see the joyful tears called into her eyes by that affectionate word mamma and the welcome assurance that followed it  for many days the mother dared rejoice only with trembling that first revival seemed like the flicker of a dying lamp if the flame streamed up bright one moment the next it sank dim in the socket exhaustion followed close on excitement  there was always a touching endeavour to appear better but too often ability refused to second will too often the attempt to bear up failed the effort to eat to talk to look cheerful was unsuccessful many an hour passed during which mrs pryor feared that the chords of life could never more be strengthened though the time of their breaking might be deferred  during this space the mother and daughter seemed left almost alone in the neighbourhood it was the close of august the weather was finethat is to say it was very dry and very dusty for an arid wind had been blowing from the east this month past very cloudless too though a pale haze stationary in the atmosphere seemed to rob of all depth of tone the blue of heaven of all freshness the verdure of earth and of all glow the light of day almost every family in briarfield was absent on an excursion miss keeldar and her friends were at the seaside so were mrs yorkes household mr hall and louis moore between whom a spontaneous intimacy seemed to have arisenthe result probably of harmony of views and temperamentwere gone up north on a pedestrian excursion to the lakes even hortense who would fain have stayed at home and aided mrs pryor in nursing caroline had been so earnestly entreated by miss mann to accompany her once more to wormwood wells in the hope of alleviating sufferings greatly aggravated by the insalubrious weather that she felt obliged to comply indeed it was not in her nature to refuse a request that at once appealed to her goodness of heart and by a confession of dependency flattered her amour propre as for robert from birmingham he had gone on to london where he still sojourned  so long as the breath of asiatic deserts parched carolines lips and fevered her veins her physical convalescence could not keep pace with her returning mental tranquillity but there came a day when the wind ceased to sob at the eastern gable of the rectory and at the oriel window of the church a little cloud like a mans hand arose in the west gusts from the same quarter drove it on and spread it wide wet and tempest prevailed a while when that was over the sun broke out genially heaven regained its azure and earth its green the livid choleratint had vanished from the face of nature the hills rose clear round the horizon absolved from that pale malariahaze  carolines youth could now be of some avail to her and so could her mothers nurture both crowned by gods blessing sent in the pure west wind blowing soft as fresh through the everopen chamber lattice rekindled her longlanguishing energies at last mrs pryor saw that it was permitted to hope a genuine material convalescence had commenced it was not merely carolines smile which was brighter or her spirits which were cheered but a certain look had passed from her face and eyea look dread and indescribable but which will easily be recalled by those who have watched the couch of dangerous disease long before the emaciated outlines of her aspect began to fill or its departed colour to return a more subtle change took place all grew softer and warmer instead of a marble mask and glassy eye mrs pryor saw laid on the pillow a face pale and wasted enough perhaps more haggard than the other appearance but less awful for it was a sick living girl not a mere white mould or rigid piece of statuary  now too she was not always petitioning to drink the words i am so thirsty ceased to be her plaint sometimes when she had swallowed a morsel she would say it had revived her all descriptions of food were no longer equally distasteful she could be induced sometimes to indicate a preference with what trembling pleasure and anxious care did not her nurse prepare what was selected how she watched her as she partook of it  nourishment brought strength she could sit up then she longed to breathe the fresh air to revisit her flowers to see how the fruit had ripened her uncle always liberal had bought a gardenchair for her express use he carried her down in his own arms and placed her in it himself and william farren was there to wheel her round the walks to show her what he had done amongst her plants to take her directions for further work  william and she found plenty to talk about they had a dozen topics in commoninteresting to them unimportant to the rest of the world they took a similar interest in animals birds insects and plants they held similar doctrines about humanity to the lower creation and had a similar turn for minute observation on points of natural history the nest and proceedings of some groundbees which had burrowed in the turf under an old cherrytree was one subject of interest the haunts of certain hedgesparrows and the welfare of certain pearly eggs and callow fledglings another  had chamberss journal existed in those days it would certainly have formed miss helstones and farrens favourite periodical she would have subscribed for it and to him each number would duly have been lent both would have put implicit faith and found great savour in its marvellous anecdotes of animal sagacity  this is a digression but it suffices to explain why caroline would have no other hand than williams to guide her chair and why his society and conversation sufficed to give interest to her gardenairings  mrs pryor walking near wondered how her daughter could be so much at ease with a man of the people she found it impossible to speak to him otherwise than stiffly she felt as if a great gulf lay between her caste and his and that to cross it or meet him halfway would be to degrade herself she gently asked caroline are you not afraid my dear to converse with that person so unreservedly he may presume and become troublesomely garrulous  william presume mamma you dont know him he never presumes he is altogether too proud and sensitive to do so william has very fine feelings  and mrs pryor smiled sceptically at the naïve notion of that roughhanded roughheaded fustianclad clown having fine feelings  farren for his part showed mrs pryor only a very sulky brow he knew when he was misjudged and was apt to turn unmanageable with such as failed to give him his due  the evening restored caroline entirely to her mother and mrs pryor liked the evening for then alone with her daughter no human shadow came between her and what she loved during the day she would have her stiff demeanour and cool moments as was her wont between her and mr helstone a very respectful but most rigidly ceremonious intercourse was kept up anything like familiarity would have bred contempt at once in one or both these personages but by dint of strict civility and wellmaintained distance they got on very smoothly  towards the servants mrs pryors bearing was not uncourteous but shy freezing ungenial perhaps it was diffidence rather than pride which made her appear so haughty but as was to be expected fanny and eliza failed to make the distinction and she was unpopular with them accordingly she felt the effect produced it rendered her at times dissatisfied with herself for faults she could not help and with all else dejected chill and taciturn  this mood changed to carolines influence and to that influence alone the dependent fondness of her nursling the natural affection of her child came over her suavely her frost fell away her rigidity unbent she grew smiling and pliant not that caroline made any wordy profession of lovethat would ill have suited mrs pryor she would have read therein the proof of insinceritybut she hung on her with easy dependence she confided in her with fearless reliance these things contented the mothers heart  she liked to hear her daughter say mamma do this please mamma fetch me that mamma read to me sing a little mamma  nobody elsenot one living thinghad ever so claimed her services so looked for help at her hand other people were always more or less reserved and stiff with her as she was reserved and stiff with them other people betrayed consciousness of and annoyance at her weak points caroline no more showed such wounding sagacity or reproachful sensitiveness now than she had done when a suckling of three months old  yet caroline could find fault blind to the constitutional defects that were incurable she had her eyes wide open to the acquired habits that were susceptible of remedy on certain points she would quite artlessly lecture her parent and that parent instead of being hurt felt a sensation of pleasure in discovering that the girl dared lecture her that she was so much at home with her  mamma i am determined you shall not wear that old gown any more its fashion is not becoming it is too strait in the skirt you shall put on your black silk every afternoon in that you look nice it suits you and you shall have a black satin dress for sundaysa real satin not a satinet or any of the shams and mamma when you get the new one mind you must wear it  my dear i thought of the black silk serving me as a best dress for many years yet and i wished to buy you several things  nonsense mamma my uncle gives me cash to get what i want you know he is generous enough and i have set my heart on seeing you in a black satin get it soon and let it be made by a dressmaker of my recommending let me choose the pattern you always want to disguise yourself like a grandmother you would persuade one that you are old and ugly not at all on the contrary when well dressed and cheerful you are very comely indeed your smile is so pleasant your teeth are so white your hair is still such a pretty light colour and then you speak like a young lady with such a clear fine tone and you sing better than any young lady i ever heard why do you wear such dresses and bonnets mamma such as nobody else ever wears  does it annoy you caroline  very much it vexes me even people say you are miserly and yet you are not for you give liberally to the poor and to religious societiesthough your gifts are conveyed so secretly and quietly that they are known to few except the receivers but i will be your ladysmaid myself when i get a little stronger i will set to work and you must be good mamma and do as i bid you  and caroline sitting near her mother rearranged her muslin handkerchief and resmoothed her hair  my own mamma then she went on as if pleasing herself with the thought of their relationship who belongs to me and to whom i belong i am a rich girl now i have something i can love well and not be afraid of loving mamma who gave you this little brooch let me unpin it and look at it  mrs pryor who usually shrank from meddling fingers and near approach allowed the license complacently  did papa give you this mamma  my sister gave it memy only sister cary would that your aunt caroline had lived to see her niece  have you nothing of papasno trinket no gift of his  i have one thing  that you prize  that i prize  valuable and pretty  invaluable and sweet to me  show it mamma is it here or at fieldhead  it is talking to me now leaning on me its arms are round me  ah mamma you mean your teasing daughter who will never let you alone who when you go into your room cannot help running to seek for you who follows you upstairs and down like a dog  whose features still give me such a strange thrill sometimes i half fear your fair looks yet child  you dont you cant mamma i am sorry papa was not good i do so wish he had been wickedness spoils and poisons all pleasant things it kills love if you and i thought each other wicked we could not love each other could we  and if we could not trust each other cary  how miserable we should be mother before i knew you i had an apprehension that you were not goodthat i could not esteem you that dread damped my wish to see you and now my heart is elate because i find you perfectalmost kind clever nice your sole fault is that you are oldfashioned and of that i shall cure you mamma put your work down read to me i like your southern accent it is so pure so soft it has no rugged burr no nasal twang such as almost every ones voice here in the north has my uncle and mr hall say that you are a fine reader mamma mr hall said he never heard any lady read with such propriety of expression or purity of accent  i wish i could reciprocate the compliment cary but really the first time i heard your truly excellent friend read and preach i could not understand his broad northern tongue  could you understand me mamma did i seem to speak roughly  no i almost wished you had as i wished you had looked unpolished your father caroline naturally spoke well quite otherwise than your worthy unclecorrectly gently smoothly you inherit the gift  poor papa when he was so agreeable why was he not good  why he was as he wasand happily of that you child can form no conceptioni cannot tell it is a deep mystery the key is in the hands of his maker there i leave it  mamma you will keep stitching stitching away put down the sewing i am an enemy to it it cumbers your lap and i want it for my head it engages your eyes and i want them for a book here is your favouritecowper  these importunities were the mothers pleasure if ever she delayed compliance it was only to hear them repeated and to enjoy her childs soft halfplayful halfpetulant urgency and then when she yielded caroline would say archly you will spoil me mamma i always thought i should like to be spoiled and i find it very sweet so did mrs pryor     chapter xxvi  old copybooks   by the time the fieldhead party returned to briarfield caroline was nearly well miss keeldar who had received news by post of her friends convalescence hardly suffered an hour to elapse between her arrival at home and her first call at the rectory  a shower of rain was falling gently yet fast on the late flowers and russet autumn shrubs when the garden wicket was heard to swing open and shirleys wellknown form passed the window on her entrance her feelings were evinced in her own peculiar fashion when deeply moved by serious fears or joys she was not garrulous the strong emotion was rarely suffered to influence her tongue and even her eye refused it more than a furtive and fitful conquest she took caroline in her arms gave her one look one kiss then said you are better  and a minute after i see you are safe now but take care god grant your health may be called on to sustain no more shocks  she proceeded to talk fluently about the journey in the midst of vivacious discourse her eye still wandered to caroline there spoke in its light a deep solicitude some trouble and some amaze  she may be better it said but how weak she still is what peril she has come through  suddenly her glance reverted to mrs pryor it pierced her through  when will my governess return to me she asked  may i tell her all demanded caroline of her mother leave being signified by a gesture shirley was presently enlightened on what had happened in her absence  very good was the cool commentvery good but it is no news to me  what did you know  i guessed long since the whole business i have heard somewhat of mrs pryors historynot from herself but from others with every detail of mr james helstones career and character i was acquainted an afternoons sitting and conversation with miss mann had rendered me familiar therewith also he is one of mrs yorkes warning examplesone of the bloodred lights she hangs out to scare young ladies from matrimony i believe i should have been sceptical about the truth of the portrait traced by such fingersboth these ladies take a dark pleasure in offering to view the dark side of lifebut i questioned mr yorke on the subject and he said shirley my woman if you want to know aught about yond james helstone i can only say he was a mantiger he was handsome dissolute soft treacherous courteous cruel dont cry cary well say no more about it  i am not crying shirley or if i am it is nothing go on you are no friend if you withhold from me the truth i hate that false plan of disguising mutilating the truth  fortunately i have said pretty nearly all that i have to say except that your uncle himself confirmed mr yorkes words for he too scorns a lie and deals in none of those conventional subterfuges that are shabbier than lies  but papa is dead they should let him alone now  they should and we will let him alone cry away cary it will do you good it is wrong to check natural tears besides i choose to please myself by sharing an idea that at this moment beams in your mothers eye while she looks at you every drop blots out a sin weep your tears have the virtue which the rivers of damascus lacked like jordan they can cleanse a leprous memory  madam she continued addressing mrs pryor did you think i could be daily in the habit of seeing you and your daughter togethermarking your marvellous similarity in many points observing pardon me your irrepressible emotions in the presence and still more in the absence of your childand not form my own conjectures i formed them and they are literally correct i shall begin to think myself shrewd  and you said nothing observed caroline who soon regained the quiet control of her feelings  nothing i had no warrant to breathe a word on the subject my business it was not i abstained from making it such  you guessed so deep a secret and did not hint that you guessed it  is that so difficult  it is not like you  how do you know  you are not reserved you are frankly communicative  i may be communicative yet know where to stop in showing my treasure i may withhold a gem or twoa curious unbought graven stonean amulet of whose mystic glitter i rarely permit even myself a glimpse goodday  caroline thus seemed to get a view of shirleys character under a novel aspect ere long the prospect was renewed it opened upon her  no sooner had she regained sufficient strength to bear a change of scenethe excitement of a little societythan miss keeldar sued daily for her presence at fieldhead whether shirley had become wearied of her honoured relatives is not known she did not say she was but she claimed and retained caroline with an eagerness which proved that an addition to that worshipful company was not unwelcome  the sympsons were church people of course the rectors niece was received by them with courtesy mr sympson proved to be a man of spotless respectability worrying temper pious principles and worldly views his lady was a very good womanpatient kind wellbred she had been brought up on a narrow system of views starved on a few prejudicesa mere handful of bitter herbs a few preferences soaked till their natural flavour was extracted and with no seasoning added in the cooking some excellent principles made up in a stiff raised crust of bigotry difficult to digest far too submissive was she to complain of this diet or to ask for a crumb beyond it  the daughters were an example to their sex they were tall with a roman nose apiece they had been educated faultlessly all they did was well done history and the most solid books had cultivated their minds principles and opinions they possessed which could not be mended more exactlyregulated lives feelings manners habits it would have been difficult to find anywhere they knew by heart a certain youngladiesschoolroom code of laws on language demeanour etc themselves never deviated from its curious little pragmatical provisions and they regarded with secret whispered horror all deviations in others the abomination of desolation was no mystery to them they had discovered that unutterable thing in the characteristic others call originality quick were they to recognize the signs of this evil and wherever they saw its tracewhether in look word or deed whether they read it in the fresh vigorous style of a book or listened to it in interesting unhackneyed pure expressive languagethey shuddered they recoiled danger was above their heads peril about their steps what was this strange thing being unintelligible it must be bad let it be denounced and chained up  henry sympson the only son and youngest child of the family was a boy of fifteen he generally kept with his tutor when he left him he sought his cousin shirley this boy differed from his sisters he was little lame and pale his large eyes shone somewhat languidly in a wan orbit they were indeed usually rather dim but they were capable of illumination at times they could not only shine but blaze inward emotion could likewise give colour to his cheek and decision to his crippled movements henrys mother loved him she thought his peculiarities were a mark of election he was not like other children she allowed she believed him regeneratea new samuelcalled of god from his birth he was to be a clergyman mr and the misses sympson not understanding the youth let him much alone shirley made him her pet and he made shirley his playmate  in the midst of this family circle or rather outside it moved the tutorthe satellite  yes louis moore was a satellite of the house of sympsonconnected yet apart ever attendant ever distant each member of that correct family treated him with proper dignity the father was austerely civil sometimes irritable the mother being a kind woman was attentive but formal the daughters saw in him an abstraction not a man it seemed by their manner that their brothers tutor did not live for them they were learned so was hebut not for them they were accomplished he had talents too imperceptible to their senses the most spirited sketch from his fingers was a blank to their eyes the most original observation from his lips fell unheard on their ears nothing could exceed the propriety of their behaviour  i should have said nothing could have equalled it but i remember a fact which strangely astonished caroline helstone it wasto discover that her cousin had absolutely no sympathizing friend at fieldhead that to miss keeldar he was as much a mere teacher as little a gentleman as little a man as to the estimable misses sympson  what had befallen the kindhearted shirley that she should be so indifferent to the dreary position of a fellowcreature thus isolated under her roof she was not perhaps haughty to him but she never noticed himshe let him alone he came and went spoke or was silent and she rarely recognized his existence  as to louis moore himself he had the air of a man used to this life and who had made up his mind to bear it for a time his faculties seemed walled up in him and were unmurmuring in their captivity he never laughed he seldom smiled he was uncomplaining he fulfilled the round of his duties scrupulously his pupil loved him he asked nothing more than civility from the rest of the world it even appeared that he would accept nothing morein that abode at least for when his cousin caroline made gentle overtures of friendship he did not encourage themhe rather avoided than sought her one living thing alone besides his pale crippled scholar he fondled in the house and that was the ruffianly tartar who sullen and impracticable to others acquired a singular partiality for hima partiality so marked that sometimes when moore summoned to a meal entered the room and sat down unwelcomed tartar would rise from his lair at shirleys feet and betake himself to the taciturn tutor oncebut onceshe noticed the desertion and holding out her white hand and speaking softly tried to coax him back tartar looked slavered and sighed as his manner was but yet disregarded the invitation and coolly settled himself on his haunches at louis moores side that gentleman drew the dogs big blackmuzzled head on to his knee patted him and smiled one little smile to himself  an acute observer might have remarked in the course of the same evening that after tartar had resumed his allegiance to shirley and was once more couched near her footstool the audacious tutor by one word and gesture fascinated him again he pricked up his ears at the word he started erect at the gesture and came with head lovingly depressed to receive the expected caress as it was given the significant smile again rippled across moores quiet face                                       shirley said caroline one day as they two were sitting alone in the summerhouse did you know that my cousin louis was tutor in your uncles family before the sympsons came down here  shirleys reply was not so prompt as her responses usually were but at last she answered yesof course i knew it well  i thought you must have been aware of the circumstance  well what then  it puzzles me to guess how it chanced that you never mentioned it to me  why should it puzzle you  it seems odd i cannot account for it you talk a great dealyou talk freely how was that circumstance never touched on  because it never was and shirley laughed  you are a singular being observed her friend i thought i knew you quite well i begin to find myself mistaken you were silent as the grave about mrs pryor and now again here is another secret but why you made it a secret is the mystery to me  i never made it a secret i had no reason for so doing if you had asked me who henrys tutor was i would have told you besides i thought you knew  i am puzzled about more things than one in this matter you dont like poor louis why are you impatient at what you perhaps consider his servile position do you wish that roberts brother were more highly placed  roberts brother indeed was the exclamation uttered in a tone like the accents of scorn and with a movement of proud impatience shirley snatched a rose from a branch peeping through the open lattice  yes repeated caroline with mild firmness roberts brother he is thus closely related to gérard moore of the hollow though nature has not given him features so handsome or an air so noble as his kinsman but his blood is as good and he is as much a gentleman were he free  wise humble pious caroline exclaimed shirley ironically men and angels hear her we should not despise plain features nor a laborious yet honest occupation should we look at the subject of your panegyric he is there in the garden she continued pointing through an aperture in the clustering creepers and by that aperture louis moore was visible coming slowly down the walk  he is not ugly shirley pleaded caroline he is not ignoble he is sad silence seals his mind but i believe him to be intelligent and be certain if he had not something very commendable in his disposition mr hall would never seek his society as he does  shirley laughed she laughed again each time with a slightly sarcastic sound well well was her comment on the plea of the man being cyril halls friend and robert moores brother well just tolerate his existence wont we cary you believe him to be intelligent do you not quite an idioteh something commendable in his dispositionid est not an absolute ruffian good your representations have weight with me and to prove that they have should he come this way i will speak to him  he approached the summerhouse unconscious that it was tenanted he sat down on the step tartar now his customary companion had followed him and he couched across his feet  old boy said louis pulling his tawny ear or rather the mutilated remains of that organ torn and chewed in a hundred battles the autumn sun shines as pleasantly on us as on the fairest and richest this garden is none of ours but we enjoy its greenness and perfume dont we  he sat silent still caressing tartar who slobbered with exceeding affection a faint twittering commenced among the trees round something fluttered down as light as leaves they were little birds which lighting on the sward at shy distance hopped as if expectant  the small brown elves actually remember that i fed them the other day again soliloquized louis they want some more biscuit today i forgot to save a fragment eager little sprites i have not a crumb for you  he put his hand in his pocket and drew it out empty  a want easily supplied whispered the listening miss keeldar  she took from her reticule a morsel of sweetcake for that repository was never destitute of something available to throw to the chickens young ducks or sparrows she crumbled it and bending over his shoulder put the crumbs into his hand  there said shethere is a providence for the improvident  this september afternoon is pleasant observed louis moore as not at all discomposed he calmly cast the crumbs on to the grass  even for you  as pleasant for me as for any monarch  you take a sort of harsh solitary triumph in drawing pleasure out of the elements and the inanimate and lower animate creation  solitary but not harsh with animals i feel i am adams son the heir of him to whom dominion was given over every living thing that moveth upon the earth your dog likes and follows me when i go into that yard the pigeons from your dovecot flutter at my feet your mare in the stable knows me as well as it knows you and obeys me better  and my roses smell sweet to you and my trees give you shade  and continued louis no caprice can withdraw these pleasures from me they are mine  he walked off tartar followed him as if in duty and affection bound and shirley remained standing on the summerhouse step caroline saw her face as she looked after the rude tutor it was pale as if her pride bled inwardly  you see remarked caroline apologetically his feelings are so often hurt it makes him morose  you see retorted shirley with ire he is a topic on which you and i shall quarrel if we discuss it often so drop it henceforward and for ever  i suppose he has more than once behaved in this way thought caroline to herself and that renders shirley so distant to him yet i wonder she cannot make allowance for character and circumstances i wonder the general modesty manliness sincerity of his nature do not plead with her in his behalf she is not often so inconsiderate so irritable                                       the verbal testimony of two friends of carolines to her cousins character augmented her favourable opinion of him william farren whose cottage he had visited in company with mr hall pronounced him a real gentleman there was not such another in briarfield hewilliamcould do aught for that man and then to see how t bairns liked him and how t wife took to him first minute she saw him he never went into a house but t childer wor about him directly them little things wor like as if theyd a keener sense nor grownup folks i finding our folks natures  mr hall in answer to a question of miss helstones as to what he thought of louis moore replied promptly that he was the best fellow he had met with since he left cambridge  but he is so grave objected caroline  grave the finest company in the world full of odd quiet outoftheway humour never enjoyed an excursion so much in my life as the one i took with him to the lakes his understanding and tastes are so superior it does a man good to be within their influence and as to his temper and nature i call them fine  at fieldhead he looks gloomy and i believe has the character of being misanthropical  oh i fancy he is rather out of place therein a false position the sympsons are most estimable people but not the folks to comprehend him they think a great deal about form and ceremony which are quite out of louiss way  i dont think miss keeldar likes him  she doesnt know himshe doesnt know him otherwise she has sense enough to do justice to his merits  well i suppose she doesnt know him mused caroline to herself and by this hypothesis she endeavoured to account for what seemed else unaccountable but such simple solution of the difficulty was not left her long she was obliged to refuse miss keeldar even this negative excuse for her prejudice  one day she chanced to be in the schoolroom with henry sympson whose amiable and affectionate disposition had quickly recommended him to her regard the boy was busied about some mechanical contrivance his lameness made him fond of sedentary occupation he began to ransack his tutors desk for a piece of wax or twine necessary to his work moore happened to be absent mr hall indeed had called for him to take a long walk henry could not immediately find the object of his search he rummaged compartment after compartment and at last opening an inner drawer he came uponnot a ball of cord or a lump of beeswax but a little bundle of small marblecoloured cahiers tied with tape henry looked at them what rubbish mr moore stores up in his desk he said i hope he wont keep my old exercises so carefully  what is it  old copybooks  he threw the bundle to caroline the packet looked so neat externally her curiosity was excited to see its contents  if they are only copybooks i suppose i may open them  oh yes quite freely mr moores desk is half minefor he lets me keep all sorts of things in itand i give you leave  on scrutiny they proved to be french compositions written in a hand peculiar but compact and exquisitely clean and clear the writing was recognizable she scarcely needed the further evidence of the name signed at the close of each theme to tell her whose they were yet that name astonished hershirley keeldar sympson grove shire a southern county and a date four years back  she tied up the packet and held it in her hand meditating over it she half felt as if in opening it she had violated a confidence  they are shirleys you see said henry carelessly  did you give them to mr moore she wrote them with mrs pryor i suppose  she wrote them in my schoolroom at sympson grove when she lived with us there mr moore taught her french it is his native language  i know was she a good pupil henry  she was a wild laughing thing but pleasant to have in the room she made lessontime charming she learned fastyou could hardly tell when or how french was nothing to her she spoke it quick quickas quick as mr moore himself  was she obedient did she give trouble  she gave plenty of trouble in a way she was giddy but i liked her im desperately fond of shirley  desperately fondyou small simpleton you dont know what you say  i am desperately fond of her she is the light of my eyes i said so to mr moore last night  he would reprove you for speaking with exaggeration  he didnt he never reproves and reproves as girls governesses do he was reading and he only smiled into his book and said that if miss keeldar was no more than that she was less than he took her to be for i was but a dimeyed shortsighted little chap im afraid i am a poor unfortunate miss caroline helstone i am a cripple you know  never mind henry you are a very nice little fellow and if god has not given you health and strength he has given you a good disposition and an excellent heart and brain  i shall be despised i sometimes think both shirley and you despise me  listen henry generally i dont like schoolboys i have a great horror of them they seem to me little ruffians who take an unnatural delight in killing and tormenting birds and insects and kittens and whatever is weaker than themselves but you are so different i am quite fond of you you have almost as much sense as a man far more god wot she muttered to herself than many men you are fond of reading and you can talk sensibly about what you read  i am fond of reading i know i have sense and i know i have feeling  miss keeldar here entered  henry she said i have brought your lunch here i shall prepare it for you myself  she placed on the table a glass of new milk a plate of something which looked not unlike leather and a utensil which resembled a toastingfork  what are you two about she continued ransacking mr moores desk  looking at your old copybooks returned caroline  my old copybooks  french exercisebooks look here they must be held precious they are kept carefully  she showed the bundle shirley snatched it up did not know one was in existence she said i thought the whole lot had long since lit the kitchen fire or curled the maids hair at sympson grovewhat made you keep them henry  it is not my doing i should not have thought of it it never entered my head to suppose copybooks of value mr moore put them by in the inner drawer of his desk perhaps he forgot them  cest cela he forgot them no doubt echoed shirley they are extremely well written she observed complacently  what a giddy girl you were shirley in those days i remember you so well a slim light creature whom though you were so tall i could lift off the floor i see you with your long countless curls on your shoulders and your streaming sash you used to make mr moore livelythat is at first i believe you grieved him after a while  shirley turned the closelywritten pages and said nothing presently she observed that was written one winter afternoon it was a description of a snow scene  i remember said henry mr moore when he read it cried voilà le français gagné he said it was well done afterwards you made him draw in sepia the landscape you described  you have not forgotten then hal  not at all we were all scolded that day for not coming down to tea when called i can remember my tutor sitting at his easel and you standing behind him holding the candle and watching him draw the snowy cliff the pine the deer couched under it and the halfmoon hung above  where are his drawings harry caroline should see them  in his portfolio but it is padlocked he has the key  ask him for it when he comes in  you should ask him shirley you are shy of him now you are grown a proud lady to him i notice that  shirley you are a real enigma whispered caroline in her ear what queer discoveries i make day by day nowi who thought i had your confidence inexplicable creature even this boy reproves you  i have forgotten auld lang syne you see harry said miss keeldar answering young sympson and not heeding caroline  which you never should have done you dont deserve to be a mans morning star if you have so short a memory  a mans morning star indeed and by a man is meant your worshipful self i suppose come drink your new milk while it is warm  the young cripple rose and limped towards the fire he had left his crutch near the mantelpiece  my poor lame darling murmured shirley in her softest voice aiding him  whether do you like me or mr sam wynne best shirley inquired the boy as she settled him in an armchair  o harry sam wynne is my aversion you are my pet  me or mr malone  you again a thousand times  yet they are great whiskered fellows six feet high each  whereas as long as you live harry you will never be anything more than a little pale lameter  yes i know  you need not be sorrowful have i not often told you who was almost as little as pale as suffering as you and yet potent as a giant and brave as a lion  admiral horatio  admiral horatio viscount nelson and duke of bronte great at heart as a titan gallant and heroic as all the world and age of chivalry leader of the might of england commander of her strength on the deep hurler of her thunder over the flood  a great man but i am not warlike shirley and yet my mind is so restless i burn day and nightfor what i can hardly tellto beto doto suffer i think  harry it is your mind which is stronger and older than your frame that troubles you it is a captive it lies in physical bondage but it will work its own redemption yet study carefully not only books but the world you love nature love her without fear be patientwait the course of time you will not be a soldier or a sailor henry but if you live you will belisten to my prophecyyou will be an author perhaps a poet  an author it is a flasha flash of light to me i willi will ill write a book that i may dedicate it to you  you will write it that you may give your soul its natural release bless me what am i saying more than i understand i believe or can make good here halhere is your toasted oatcake eat and live  willingly here cried a voice outside the open window i know that fragrance of meal bread miss keeldar may i come in and partake  mr hallit was mr hall and with him was louis moore returned from their walkthere is a proper luncheon laid out in the diningroom and there are proper people seated round it you may join that society and share that fare if you please but if your illregulated tastes lead you to prefer illregulated proceedings step in here and do as we do  i approve the perfume and therefore shall suffer myself to be led by the nose returned mr hall who presently entered accompanied by louis moore that gentlemans eye fell on his desk pillaged  burglars said hehenry you merit the ferule  give it to shirley and caroline they did it was alleged with more attention to effect than truth  traitor and false witness cried both the girls we never laid hands on a thing except in the spirit of laudable inquiry  exactly so said moore with his rare smile and what have you ferreted out in your spirit of laudable inquiry  he perceived the inner drawer open  this is empty said he who has taken  here here caroline hastened to say and she restored the little packet to its place he shut it up he locked it in with a small key attached to his watchguard he restored the other papers to order closed the repository and sat down without further remark  i thought you would have scolded much more sir said henry the girls deserve reprimand  i leave them to their own consciences  it accuses them of crimes intended as well as perpetrated sir if i had not been here they would have treated your portfolio as they have done your desk but i told them it was padlocked  and will you have lunch with us here interposed shirley addressing moore and desirous as it seemed to turn the conversation  certainly if i may  you will be restricted to new milk and yorkshire oatcake  vapour le lait frais said louis but for your oatcake and he made a grimace  he cannot eat it said henry he thinks it is like bran raised with sour yeast  come then by special dispensation we will allow him a few cracknels but nothing less homely  the hostess rang the bell and gave her frugal orders which were presently executed she herself measured out the milk and distributed the bread round the cosy circle now enclosing the bright little schoolroom fire she then took the post of toastergeneral and kneeling on the rug fork in hand fulfilled her office with dexterity mr hall who relished any homely innovation on ordinary usages and to whom the husky oatcake was from custom suave as manna seemed in his best spirits he talked and laughed gleefullynow with caroline whom he had fixed by his side now with shirley and again with louis moore and louis met him in congenial spirit he did not laugh much but he uttered in the quietest tone the wittiest things gravely spoken sentences marked by unexpected turns and a quite fresh flavour and poignancy fell easily from his lips he proved himself to bewhat mr hall had said he wasexcellent company caroline marvelled at his humour but still more at his entire selfpossession nobody there present seemed to impose on him a sensation of unpleasant restraint nobody seemed a borea checka chill to him and yet there was the cool and lofty miss keeldar kneeling before the fire almost at his feet  but shirley was cool and lofty no longer at least not at this moment she appeared unconscious of the humility of her present position or if conscious it was only to taste a charm in its lowliness it did not revolt her pride that the group to whom she voluntarily officiated as handmaid should include her cousins tutor it did not scare her that while she handed the bread and milk to the rest she had to offer it to him also and moore took his portion from her hand as calmly as if he had been her equal  you are overheated now he said when she had retained the fork for some time let me relieve you  and he took it from her with a sort of quiet authority to which she submitted passively neither resisting him nor thanking him  i should like to see your pictures louis said caroline when the sumptuous luncheon was discussedwould not you mr hall  to please you i should but for my own part i have cut him as an artist i had enough of him in that capacity in cumberland and westmoreland many a wetting we got amongst the mountains because he would persist in sitting on a campstool catching effects of rainclouds gathering mists fitful sunbeams and what not  here is the portfolio said henry bringing it in one hand and leaning on his crutch with the other  louis took it but he still sat as if he wanted another to speak it seemed as if he would not open it unless the proud shirley deigned to show herself interested in the exhibition  he makes us wait to whet our curiosity she said  you understand opening it observed louis giving her the key you spoiled the lock for me once try now  he held it she opened it and monopolizing the contents had the first view of every sketch herself she enjoyed the treatif treat it werein silence without a single comment moore stood behind her chair and looked over her shoulder and when she had done and the others were still gazing he left his post and paced through the room  a carriage was heard in the lanethe gatebell rang shirley started  there are callers she said and i shall be summoned to the room a pretty figureas they sayi am to receive company i and henry have been in the garden gathering fruit half the morning oh for rest under my own vine and my own figtree happy is the slavewife of the indian chief in that she has no drawingroom duty to perform but can sit at ease weaving mats and stringing beads and peacefully flattening her pickaninnys head in an unmolested corner of her wigwam ill emigrate to the western woods  louis moore laughed  to marry a white cloud or a big buffalo and after wedlock to devote yourself to the tender task of digging your lords maizefield while he smokes his pipe or drinks firewater  shirley seemed about to reply but here the schoolroom door unclosed admitting mr sympson that personage stood aghast when he saw the group around the fire  i thought you alone miss keeldar he said i find quite a party  and evidently from his shocked scandalized air had he not recognized in one of the party a clergyman he would have delivered an extempore philippic on the extraordinary habits of his niece respect for the cloth arrested him  i merely wished to announce he proceeded coldly that the family from de walden hall mr mrs the misses and mr sam wynne are in the drawingroom and he bowed and withdrew  the family from de walden hall couldnt be a worse set murmured shirley  she sat still looking a little contumacious and very much indisposed to stir she was flushed with the fire her dark hair had been more than once dishevelled by the morning wind that day her attire was a light neatly fitting but amply flowing dress of muslin the shawl she had worn in the garden was still draped in a careless fold round her indolent wilful picturesque and singularly pretty was her aspectprettier than usual as if some soft inward emotion stirred who knows how had given new bloom and expression to her features  shirley shirley you ought to go whispered caroline  i wonder why  she lifted her eyes and saw in the glass over the fireplace both mr hall and louis moore gazing at her gravely  if she said with a yielding smileif a majority of the present company maintain that the de walden hall people have claims on my civility i will subdue my inclinations to my duty let those who think i ought to go hold up their hands  again consulting the mirror it reflected an unanimous vote against her  you must go said mr hall and behave courteously too you owe many duties to society it is not permitted you to please only yourself  louis moore assented with a low hear hear  caroline approaching her smoothed her wavy curls gave to her attire a less artistic and more domestic grace and shirley was put out of the room protesting still by a pouting lip against her dismissal  there is a curious charm about her observed mr hall when she was gone and now he added i must away for sweeting is off to see his mother and there are two funerals  henry get your books it is lessontime said moore sitting down to his desk  a curious charm repeated the pupil when he and his master were left alone true is she not a kind of white witch he asked  of whom are you speaking sir  of my cousin shirley  no irrelevant questions study in silence  mr moore looked and spoke sternlysourly henry knew this mood it was a rare one with his tutor but when it came he had an awe of it he obeyed     chapter xxvii  the first bluestocking   miss keeldar and her uncle had characters that would not harmonize that never had harmonized he was irritable and she was spirited he was despotic and she liked freedom he was worldly and she perhaps romantic  not without purpose had he come down to yorkshire his mission was clear and he intended to discharge it conscientiously he anxiously desired to have his niece married to make for her a suitable match give her in charge to a proper husband and wash his hands of her for ever  the misfortune was from infancy upwards shirley and he had disagreed on the meaning of the words suitable and proper she never yet had accepted his definition and it was doubtful whether in the most important step of her life she would consent to accept it  the trial soon came  mr wynne proposed in form for his son samuel fawthrop wynne  decidedly suitable most proper pronounced mr sympson a fine unencumbered estate real substance good connections it must be done  he sent for his niece to the oak parlour he shut himself up there with her alone he communicated the offer he gave his opinion he claimed her consent  it was withheld  no i shall not marry samuel fawthrop wynne  i ask why i must have a reason in all respects he is more than worthy of you  she stood on the hearth she was pale as the white marble slab and cornice behind her her eyes flashed large dilated unsmiling  and i ask in what sense that young man is worthy of me  he has twice your money twice your common sense equal connections equal respectability  had he my money counted fivescore times i would take no vow to love him  please to state your objections  he has run a course of despicable commonplace profligacy accept that as the first reason why i spurn him  miss keeldar you shock me  that conduct alone sinks him in a gulf of immeasurable inferiority his intellect reaches no standard i can esteem there is a second stumblingblock his views are narrow his feelings are blunt his tastes are coarse his manners vulgar  the man is a respectable wealthy man to refuse him is presumption on your part  i refuse pointblank cease to annoy me with the subject i forbid it  is it your intention ever to marry or do you prefer celibacy  i deny your right to claim an answer to that question  may i ask if you expect some man of titlesome peer of the realmto demand your hand  i doubt if the peer breathes on whom i would confer it  were there insanity in the family i should believe you mad your eccentricity and conceit touch the verge of frenzy  perhaps ere i have finished you will see me overleap it  i anticipate no less frantic and impracticable girl take warning i dare you to sully our name by a mésalliance  our name am i called sympson  god be thanked that you are not but be on your guard i will not be trifled with  what in the name of common law and common sense would you or could you do if my pleasure led me to a choice you disapproved  take care take care warning her with voice and hand that trembled alike  why what shadow of power have you over me why should i fear you  take care madam  scrupulous care i will take mr sympson before i marry i am resolved to esteemto admireto love  preposterous stuff indecorous unwomanly  to love with my whole heart i know i speak in an unknown tongue but i feel indifferent whether i am comprehended or not  and if this love of yours should fall on a beggar  on a beggar it will never fall mendicancy is not estimable  on a low clerk a playactor a playwriter oror  take courage mr sympson or what  any literary scrub or shabby whining artist  for the scrubby shabby whining i have no taste for literature and the arts i have and there i wonder how your fawthrop wynne would suit me he cannot write a note without orthographical errors he reads only a sporting paper he was the booby of stilbro grammar school  unladylike language great god to what will she come he lifted hands and eyes  never to the altar of hymen with sam wynne  to what will she come why are not the laws more stringent that i might compel her to hear reason  console yourself uncle were britain a serfdom and you the czar you could not compel me to this step i will write to mr wynne give yourself no further trouble on the subject                                       fortune is proverbially called changeful yet her caprice often takes the form of repeating again and again a similar stroke of luck in the same quarter it appeared that miss keeldaror her fortunehad by this time made a sensation in the district and produced an impression in quarters by her unthought of no less than three offers followed mr wynnes all more or less eligible all were in succession pressed on her by her uncle and all in succession she refused yet amongst them was more than one gentleman of unexceptionable character as well as ample wealth many besides her uncle asked what she meant and whom she expected to entrap that she was so insolently fastidious  at last the gossips thought they had found the key to her conduct and her uncle was sure of it and what is more the discovery showed his niece to him in quite a new light and he changed his whole deportment to her accordingly  fieldhead had of late been fast growing too hot to hold them both the suave aunt could not reconcile them the daughters froze at the view of their quarrels gertrude and isabella whispered by the hour together in their dressingroom and became chilled with decorous dread if they chanced to be left alone with their audacious cousin but as i have said a change supervened mr sympson was appeased and his family tranquillized  the village of nunnely has been alluded toits old church its forest its monastic ruins it had also its hall called the prioryan older a larger a more lordly abode than any briarfield or whinbury owned and what is more it had its man of titleits baronet which neither briarfield nor whinbury could boast this possessionits proudest and most prizedhad for years been nominal only the present baronet a young man hitherto resident in a distant province was unknown on his yorkshire estate  during miss keeldars stay at the fashionable wateringplace of cliffbridge she and her friends had met with and been introduced to sir philip nunnely they encountered him again and again on the sands the cliffs in the various walks sometimes at the public balls of the place he seemed solitary his manner was very unpretendingtoo simple to be termed affable rather timid than proud he did not condescend to their society he seemed glad of it  with any unaffected individual shirley could easily and quickly cement an acquaintance she walked and talked with sir philip she her aunt and cousins sometimes took a sail in his yacht she liked him because she found him kind and modest and was charmed to feel she had the power to amuse him  one slight drawback there waswhere is the friendship without itsir philip had a literary turn he wrote poetrysonnets stanzas ballads perhaps miss keeldar thought him a little too fond of reading and reciting these compositions perhaps she wished the rhyme had possessed more accuracy the measure more music the tropes more freshness the inspiration more fire at any rate she always winced when he recurred to the subject of his poems and usually did her best to divert the conversation into another channel  he would beguile her to take moonlight walks with him on the bridge for the sole purpose as it seemed of pouring into her ear the longest of his ballads he would lead her away to sequestered rustic seats whence the rush of the surf to the sands was heard soft and soothing and when he had her all to himself and the sea lay before them and the scented shade of gardens spread round and the tall shelter of cliffs rose behind them he would pull out his last batch of sonnets and read them in a voice tremulous with emotion he did not seem to know that though they might be rhyme they were not poetry it appeared by shirleys downcast eye and disturbed face that she knew it and felt heartily mortified by the single foible of this good and amiable gentleman  often she tried as gently as might be to wean him from this fanatic worship of the muses it was his monomania on all ordinary subjects he was sensible enough and fain was she to engage him in ordinary topics he questioned her sometimes about his place at nunnely she was but too happy to answer his interrogatories at length she never wearied of describing the antique priory the wild silvan park the hoary church and hamlet nor did she fail to counsel him to come down and gather his tenantry about him in his ancestral halls  somewhat to her surprise sir philip followed her advice to the letter and actually towards the close of september arrived at the priory  he soon made a call at fieldhead and his first visit was not his last he saidwhen he had achieved the round of the neighbourhoodthat under no roof had he found such pleasant shelter as beneath the massive oak beams of the gray manorhouse of briarfield a cramped modest dwelling enough compared with his own but he liked it  presently it did not suffice to sit with shirley in her panelled parlour where others came and went and where he could rarely find a quiet moment to show her the latest production of his fertile muse he must have her out amongst the pleasant pastures and lead her by the still waters têteàtête ramblings she shunned so he made parties for her to his own grounds his glorious forest to remoter sceneswoods severed by the wharfe vales watered by the aire  such assiduity covered miss keeldar with distinction her uncles prophetic soul anticipated a splendid future he already scented the time afar off when with nonchalant air and left foot nursed on his right knee he should be able to make dashinglyfamiliar allusion to his nephew the baronet now his niece dawned upon him no longer a mad girl but a most sensible woman he termed her in confidential dialogues with mrs sympson a truly superior person peculiar but very clever he treated her with exceeding deference rose reverently to open and shut doors for her reddened his face and gave himself headaches with stooping to pick up gloves handkerchiefs and other loose property whereof shirley usually held but insecure tenure he would cut mysterious jokes about the superiority of womans wit over mans wisdom commence obscure apologies for the blundering mistake he had committed respecting the generalship the tactics of a personage not a hundred miles from fieldhead in short he seemed elate as any middencock on pattens  his niece viewed his manœuvres and received his innuendoes with phlegm apparently she did not above half comprehend to what aim they tended when plainly charged with being the preferred of the baronet she said she believed he did like her and for her part she liked him she had never thought a man of rankthe only son of a proud fond mother the only brother of doting sisterscould have so much goodness and on the whole so much sense  time proved indeed that sir philip liked her perhaps he had found in her that curious charm noticed by mr hall he sought her presence more and more and at last with a frequency that attested it had become to him an indispensable stimulus about this time strange feelings hovered round fieldhead restless hopes and haggard anxieties haunted some of its rooms there was an unquiet wandering of some of the inmates among the still fields round the mansion there was a sense of expectancy that kept the nerves strained  one thing seemed clear sir philip was not a man to be despised he was amiable if not highly intellectual he was intelligent miss keeldar could not affirm of him what she had so bitterly affirmed of sam wynne that his feelings were blunt his tastes coarse and his manners vulgar there was sensibility in his nature there was a very real if not a very discriminating love of the arts there was the english gentleman in all his deportment as to his lineage and wealth both were of course far beyond her claims  his appearance had at first elicited some laughing though not illnatured remarks from the merry shirley it was boyish his features were plain and slight his hair sandy his stature insignificant but she soon checked her sarcasm on this point she would even fire up if any one else made uncomplimentary allusion thereto he had a pleasing countenance she affirmed and there was that in his heart which was better than three roman noses than the locks of absalom or the proportions of saul a spare and rare shaft she still reserved for his unfortunate poetic propensity but even here she would tolerate no irony save her own  in short matters had reached a point which seemed fully to warrant an observation made about this time by mr yorke to the tutor louis  yond brother robert of yours seems to me to be either a fool or a madman two months ago i could have sworn he had the game all in his own hands and there he runs the country and quarters himself up in london for weeks together and by the time he comes back hell find himself checkmated louis there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune but once let slip never returns again id write to robert if i were you and remind him of that  robert had views on miss keeldar inquired louis as if the idea was new to him  views i suggested to him myself and views he might have realized for she liked him  as a neighbour  as more than that i have seen her change countenance and colour at the mere mention of his name write to the lad i say and tell him to come home he is a finer gentleman than this bit of a baronet after all  does it not strike you mr yorke that for a mere penniless adventurer to aspire to a rich womans hand is presumptuouscontemptible  oh if you are for high notions and doublerefined sentiment ive naught to say im a plain practical man myself and if robert is willing to give up that royal prize to a ladrivala puling slip of aristocracyi am quite agreeable at his age in his place with his inducements i would have acted differently neither baronet nor duke nor prince should have snatched my sweetheart from me without a struggle but you tutors are such solemn chaps it is almost like speaking to a parson to consult with you                                       flattered and fawned upon as shirley was just now it appeared she was not absolutely spoiledthat her better nature did not quite leave her universal report had indeed ceased to couple her name with that of moore and this silence seemed sanctioned by her own apparent oblivion of the absentee but that she had not quite forgotten himthat she still regarded him if not with love yet with interestseemed proved by the increased attention which at this juncture of affairs a sudden attack of illness induced her to show that tutorbrother of roberts to whom she habitually bore herself with strange alternations of cool reserve and docile respectnow sweeping past him in all the dignity of the moneyed heiress and prospective lady nunnely and anon accosting him as abashed schoolgirls are wont to accost their stern professors bridling her neck of ivory and curling her lip of carmine if he encountered her glance one minute and the next submitting to the grave rebuke of his eye with as much contrition as if he had the power to inflict penalties in case of contumacy  louis moore had perhaps caught the fever which for a few days laid him low in one of the poor cottages of the district which he his lame pupil and mr hall were in the habit of visiting together at any rate he sickened and after opposing to the malady a taciturn resistance for a day or two was obliged to keep his chamber  he lay tossing on his thorny bed one evening henry who would not quit him watching faithfully beside him when a taptoo light to be that of mrs gill or the housemaidsummoned young sympson to the door  how is mr moore tonight asked a low voice from the dark gallery  come in and see him yourself  is he asleep  i wish he could sleep come and speak to him shirley  he would not like it  but the speaker stepped in and henry seeing her hesitate on the threshold took her hand and drew her to the couch  the shaded light showed miss keeldars form but imperfectly yet it revealed her in elegant attire there was a party assembled below including sir philip nunnely the ladies were now in the drawingroom and their hostess had stolen from them to visit henrys tutor her pure white dress her fair arms and neck the trembling chainlet of gold circling her throat and quivering on her breast glistened strangely amid the obscurity of the sickroom her mien was chastened and pensive she spoke gently  mr moore how are you tonight  i have not been very ill and am now better  i heard that you complained of thirst i have brought you some grapes can you taste one  no but i thank you for remembering me  just one  from the rich cluster that filled a small basket held in her hand she severed a berry and offered it to his lips he shook his head and turned aside his flushed face  but what then can i bring you instead you have no wish for fruit yet i see that your lips are parched what beverage do you prefer  mrs gill supplies me with toastandwater i like it best  silence fell for some minutes  do you sufferhave you pain  very little  what made you ill  silence  i wonder what caused this fever to what do you attribute it  miasma perhapsmalaria this is autumn a season fertile in fevers  i hear you often visit the sick in briarfield and nunnely too with mr hall you should be on your guard temerity is not wise  that reminds me miss keeldar that perhaps you had better not enter this chamber or come near this couch i do not believe my illness is infectious i scarcely fearwith a sort of smileyou will take it but why should you run even the shadow of a risk leave me  patience i will go soon but i should like to do something for you before i departany little service  they will miss you below  no the gentlemen are still at table  they will not linger long sir philip nunnely is no winebibber and i hear him just now pass from the diningroom to the drawingroom  it is a servant  it is sir philip i know his step  your hearing is acute  it is never dull and the sense seems sharpened at present sir philip was here to tea last night i heard you sing to him some song which he had brought you i heard him when he took his departure at eleven oclock call you out on to the pavement to look at the evening star  you must be nervously sensitive  i heard him kiss your hand  impossible  no my chamber is over the hall the window just above the front door the sash was a little raised for i felt feverish you stood ten minutes with him on the steps i heard your discourse every word and i heard the salutehenry give me some water  let me give it him  but he half rose to take the glass from young sympson and declined her attendance  and can i do nothing  nothing for you cannot guarantee me a nights peaceful rest and it is all i at present want  you do not sleep well  sleep has left me  yet you said you were not very ill  i am often sleepless when in high health  if i had power i would lap you in the most placid slumberquite deep and hushed without a dream  blank annihilation i do not ask that  with dreams of all you most desire  monstrous delusions the sleep would be delirium the waking death  your wishes are not so chimerical you are no visionary  miss keeldar i suppose you think so but my character is not perhaps quite as legible to you as a page of the last new novel might be  that is possible but this sleepi should like to woo it to your pillow to win for you its favour if i took a book and sat down and read some pages i can well spare half an hour  thank you but i will not detain you  i would read softly  it would not do i am too feverish and excitable to bear a soft cooing vibrating voice close at my ear you had better leave me  well i will go  and no goodnight  yes sir yes mr moore goodnight exit shirley  henry my boy go to bed now it is time you had some repose  sir it would please me to watch at your bedside all night  nothing less called for i am getting better there go  give me your blessing sir  god bless you my best pupil  you never call me your dearest pupil  no nor ever shall                                       possibly miss keeldar resented her former teachers rejection of her courtesy it is certain she did not repeat the offer of it often as her light step traversed the gallery in the course of a day it did not again pause at his door nor did her cooing vibrating voice disturb a second time the hush of the sickroom a sickroom indeed it soon ceased to be mr moores good constitution quickly triumphed over his indisposition in a few days he shook it off and resumed his duties as tutor  that auld lang syne had still its authority both with preceptor and scholar was proved by the manner in which he sometimes promptly passed the distance she usually maintained between them and put down her high reserve with a firm quiet hand  one afternoon the sympson family were gone out to take a carriage airing shirley never sorry to snatch a reprieve from their society had remained behind detained by business as she said the businessa little letterwritingwas soon dispatched after the yard gates had closed on the carriage miss keeldar betook herself to the garden  it was a peaceful autumn day the gilding of the indian summer mellowed the pastures far and wide the russet woods stood ripe to be stripped but were yet full of leaf the purple of heathbloom faded but not withered tinged the hills the beck wandered down to the hollow through a silent district no wind followed its course or haunted its woody borders fieldhead gardens bore the seal of gentle decay on the walks swept that morning yellow leaves had fluttered down again its time of flowers and even of fruits was over but a scantling of apples enriched the trees only a blossom here and there expanded pale and delicate amidst a knot of faded leaves  these single flowersthe last of their raceshirley culled as she wandered thoughtfully amongst the beds she was fastening into her girdle a hueless and scentless nosegay when henry sympson called to her as he came limping from the house  shirley mr moore would be glad to see you in the schoolroom and to hear you read a little french if you have no more urgent occupation  the messenger delivered his commission very simply as if it were a mere matter of course  did mr moore tell you to say that  certainly why not and now do come and let us once more be as we were at sympson grove we used to have pleasant schoolhours in those days  miss keeldar perhaps thought that circumstances were changed since then however she made no remark but after a little reflection quietly followed henry  entering the schoolroom she inclined her head with a decent obeisance as had been her wont in former times she removed her bonnet and hung it up beside henrys cap louis moore sat at his desk turning the leaves of a book open before him and marking passages with his pencil he just moved in acknowledgment of her curtsy but did not rise  you proposed to read to me a few nights ago said he i could not hear you then my attention is now at your service a little renewed practice in french may not be unprofitable your accent i have observed begins to rust  what book shall i take  here are the posthumous works of st pierre read a few pages of the fragments de lamazone  she accepted the chair which he had placed in readiness near his own the volume lay on his deskthere was but one between them her sweeping curls dropped so low as to hide the page from him  put back your hair he said  for one moment shirley looked not quite certain whether she would obey the request or disregard it a flicker of her eye beamed furtive on the professors face perhaps if he had been looking at her harshly or timidly or if one undecided line had marked his countenance she would have rebelled and the lesson had ended there and then but he was only awaiting her complianceas calm as marble and as cool she threw the veil of tresses behind her ear it was well her face owned an agreeable outline and that her cheek possessed the polish and the roundness of early youth or thus robbed of a softening shade the contours might have lost their grace but what mattered that in the present society neither calypso nor eucharis cared to fascinate mentor  she began to read the language had become strange to her tongue it faltered the lecture flowed unevenly impeded by hurried breath broken by anglicized tones she stopped  i cant do it read me a paragraph if you please mr moore  what he read she repeated she caught his accent in three minutes  très bien was the approving comment at the close of the piece  cest presque le français rattrapé nestce pas  you could not write french as you once could i dare say  oh no i should make strange work of my concords now  you could not compose the devoir of la première femme savante  do you still remember that rubbish  every line  i doubt you  i will engage to repeat it word for word  you would stop short at the first line  challenge me to the experiment  i challenge you  he proceeded to recite the following he gave it in french but we must translate on pain of being unintelligible to some readers                                           and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of        the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons        of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they        took them wives of all which they chose  this was in the dawn of time before the morning stars were set and while they yet sang together  the epoch is so remote the mists and dewy gray of matin twilight veil it with so vague an obscurity that all distinct feature of custom all clear line of locality evade perception and baffle research it must suffice to know that the world then existed that men peopled it that mans nature with its passions sympathies pains and pleasures informed the planet and gave it soul  a certain tribe colonized a certain spot on the globe of what race this tribeunknown in what region that spotuntold we usually think of the east when we refer to transactions of that date but who shall declare that there was no life in the west the south the north what is to disprove that this tribe instead of camping under palm groves in asia wandered beneath island oak woods rooted in our own seas of europe  it is no sandy plain nor any circumscribed and scant oasis i seem to realize a forest valley with rocky sides and brown profundity of shade formed by tree crowding on tree descends deep before me here indeed dwell human beings but so few and in alleys so thick branched and overarched they are neither heard nor seen are they savage doubtless they live by the crook and the bow half shepherds half hunters their flocks wander wild as their prey are they happy no not more happy than we are at this day are they good no not better than ourselves their nature is our naturehuman both there is one in this tribe too often miserablea child bereaved of both parents none cares for this child she is fed sometimes but oftener forgotten a hut rarely receives her the hollow tree and chill cavern are her home forsaken lost and wandering she lives more with the wild beast and bird than with her own kind hunger and cold are her comrades sadness hovers over and solitude besets her round unheeded and unvalued she should die but she both lives and grows the green wilderness nurses her and becomes to her a mother feeds her on juicy berry on saccharine root and nut  there is something in the air of this clime which fosters life kindly there must be something too in its dews which heals with sovereign balm its gentle seasons exaggerate no passion no sense its temperature tends to harmony its breezes you would say bring down from heaven the germ of pure thought and purer feeling not grotesquely fantastic are the forms of cliff and foliage not violently vivid the colouring of flower and bird in all the grandeur of these forests there is repose in all their freshness there is tenderness  the gentle charm vouchsafed to flower and tree bestowed on deer and dove has not been denied to the human nursling all solitary she has sprung up straight and graceful nature cast her features in a fine mould they have matured in their pure accurate first lines unaltered by the shocks of disease no fierce dry blast has dealt rudely with the surface of her frame no burning sun has crisped or withered her tresses her form gleams ivorywhite through the trees her hair flows plenteous long and glossy her eyes not dazzled by vertical fires beam in the shade large and open and full and dewy above those eyes when the breeze bares her forehead shines an expanse fair and amplea clear candid page whereon knowledge should knowledge ever come might write a golden record you see in the desolate young savage nothing vicious or vacant she haunts the wood harmless and thoughtful though of what one so untaught can think it is not easy to divine  on the evening of one summer day before the flood being utterly alonefor she had lost all trace of her tribe who had wandered leagues away she knew not whereshe went up from the vale to watch day take leave and night arrive a crag overspread by a tree was her station the oak roots turfed and mossed gave a seat the oak boughs thickleaved wove a canopy  slow and grand the day withdrew passing in purple fire and parting to the farewell of a wild low chorus from the woodlands then night entered quiet as death the wind fell the birds ceased singing now every nest held happy mates and hart and hind slumbered blissfully safe in their lair  the girl sat her body still her soul astir occupied however rather in feeling than in thinking in wishing than hoping in imagining than projecting she felt the world the sky the night boundlessly mighty of all things herself seemed to herself the centrea small forgotten atom of life a spark of soul emitted inadvertent from the great creative source and now burning unmarked to waste in the heart of a black hollow she asked was she thus to burn out and perish her living light doing no good never seen never neededa star in an else starless firmament which nor shepherd nor wanderer nor sage nor priest tracked as a guide or read as a prophecy could this be she demanded when the flame of her intelligence burned so vivid when her life beat so true and real and potent when something within her stirred disquieted and restlessly asserted a godgiven strength for which it insisted she should find exercise  she gazed abroad on heaven and evening heaven and evening gazed back on her she bent down searching bank hill river spread dim below all she questioned responded by oracles she heardshe was impressed but she could not understand above her head she raised her hands joined together  guidancehelpcomfortcome was her cry  there was no voice nor any that answered  she waited kneeling steadfastly looking up yonder sky was sealed the solemn stars shone alien and remote  at last one overstretched chord of her agony slacked she thought something above relented she felt as if something far round drew nigher she heard as if silence spoke there was no language no word only a tone  againa fine full lofty tone a deep soft sound like a storm whispering made twilight undulate  once more profounder nearer clearer it rolled harmonious  yet againa distinct voice passed between heaven and earth  eva  if eva were not this womans name she had none she rose here am i  eva  o night it can be but night that speaks i am here  the voice descending reached earth  eva  lord she cried behold thine handmaid  she had her religionall tribes held some creed  i comea comforter  lord come quickly  the evening flushed full of hope the air panted the moonrising beforeascended large but her light showed no shape  lean towards me eva enter my arms repose thus  thus i lean o invisible but felt and what art thou  eva i have brought a living draught from heaven daughter of man drink of my cup  i drink it is as if sweetest dew visited my lips in a full current my arid heart revives my affliction is lightened my strait and struggle are gone and the night changes the wood the hill the moon the wide skyall change  all change and for ever i take from thy vision darkness i loosen from thy faculties fetters i level in thy path obstacles i with my presence fill vacancy i claim as mine the lost atom of life i take to myself the spark of soulburning heretofore forgotten  o take me o claim me this is a god  this is a son of godone who feels himself in the portion of life that stirs you he is suffered to reclaim his own and so to foster and aid that it shall not perish hopeless  a son of god am i indeed chosen  thou only in this land i saw thee that thou wert fair i knew thee that thou wert mine to me it is given to rescue to sustain to cherish mine own acknowledge in me that seraph on earth named genius  my glorious bridegroom true dayspring from on high all i would have at last i possess i receive a revelation the dark hint the obscure whisper which have haunted me from childhood are interpreted thou art he i sought godborn take me thy bride  unhumbled i can take what is mine did i not give from the altar the very flame which lit evas being come again into the heaven whence thou wert sent  that presence invisible but mighty gathered her in like a lamb to the fold that voice soft but allpervading vibrated through her heart like music her eye received no image and yet a sense visited her vision and her brain as of the serenity of stainless air the power of sovereign seas the majesty of marching stars the energy of colliding elements the rooted endurance of hills wide based and above all as of the lustre of heroic beauty rushing victorious on the night vanquishing its shadows like a diviner sun  such was the bridal hour of genius and humanity who shall rehearse the tale of their afterunion who shall depict its bliss and bale who shall tell how he between whom and the woman god put enmity forged deadly plots to break the bond or defile its purity who shall record the long strife between serpent and seraphhow still the father of lies insinuated evil into good pride into wisdom grossness into glory pain into bliss poison into passion how the dreadless angel defied resisted and repelled how again and again he refined the polluted cup exalted the debased emotion rectified the perverted impulse detected the lurking venom baffled the frontless temptationpurified justified watched and withstood how by his patience by his strength by that unutterable excellence he held from godhis originthis faithful seraph fought for humanity a good fight through time and when times course closed and death was encountered at the end barring with fleshless arm the portals of eternity how genius still held close his dying bride sustained her through the agony of the passage bore her triumphant into his own home heaven restored her redeemed to jehovah her maker and at last before angel and archangel crowned her with the crown of immortality  who shall of these things write the chronicle                                       i never could correct that composition observed shirley as moore concluded your censorpencil scored it with condemnatory lines whose signification i strove vainly to fathom  she had taken a crayon from the tutors desk and was drawing little leaves fragments of pillars broken crosses on the margin of the book  french may be half forgotten but the habits of the french lesson are retained i see said louis my books would now as erst be unsafe with you my newlybound st pierre would soon be like my racinemiss keeldar her mark traced on every page  shirley dropped her crayon as if it burned her fingers  tell me what were the faults of that devoir she asked were they grammatical errors or did you object to the substance  i never said that the lines i drew were indications of faults at all you would have it that such was the case and i refrained from contradiction  what else did they denote  no matter now  mr moore cried henry make shirley repeat some of the pieces she used to say so well by heart  if i ask for any it will be le cheval dompté said moore trimming with his penknife the pencil miss keeldar had worn to a stump  she turned aside her head the neck the clear cheek forsaken by their natural veil were seen to flush warm  ah she has not forgotten you see sir said henry exultant she knows how naughty she was  a smile which shirley would not permit to expand made her lip tremble she bent her face and hid it half with her arms half in her curls which as she stooped fell loose again certainly i was a rebel she answered  a rebel repeated henry yes you and papa had quarrelled terribly and you set both him and mamma and mrs pryor and everybody at defiance you said he had insulted you  he had insulted me interposed shirley  and you wanted to leave sympson grove directly you packed your things up and papa threw them out of your trunk mamma cried mrs pryor cried they both stood wringing their hands begging you to be patient and you knelt on the floor with your things and your upturned box before you looking shirley lookingwhy in one of your passions your features in such passions are not distorted they are fixed but quite beautiful you scarcely look angry only resolute and in a certain haste yet one feels that at such times an obstacle cast across your path would be split as with lightning papa lost heart and called mr moore  enough henry  no it is not enough i hardly know how mr moore managed except that i recollect he suggested to papa that agitation would bring on his gout and then he spoke quietly to the ladies and got them away and afterwards he said to you miss shirley that it was of no use talking or lecturing now but that the teathings were just brought into the schoolroom and he was very thirsty and he would be glad if you would leave your packing for the present and come and make a cup of tea for him and me you came you would not talk at first but soon you softened and grew cheerful mr moore began to tell us about the continent the war and bonapartesubjects we were both fond of listening to after tea he said we should neither of us leave him that evening he would not let us stray out of his sight lest we should again get into mischief we sat one on each side of him we were so happy i never passed so pleasant an evening the next day he gave you missy a lecture of an hour and wound it up by marking you a piece to learn in bossuet as a punishmentlessonle cheval dompté you learned it instead of packing up shirley we heard no more of your running away mr moore used to tease you on the subject for a year afterwards  she never said a lesson with greater spirit subjoined moore she then for the first time gave me the treat of hearing my native tongue spoken without accent by an english girl  she was as sweet as summer cherries for a month afterwards struck in henry a good hearty quarrel always left shirleys temper better than it found it  you talk of me as if i were not present observed miss keeldar who had not yet lifted her face  are you sure you are present asked moore there have been moments since my arrival here when i have been tempted to inquire of the lady of fieldhead if she knew what had become of my former pupil  she is here now  i see her and humble enough but i would neither advise harry nor others to believe too implicitly in the humility which one moment can hide its blushing face like a modest little child and the next lift it pale and lofty as a marble juno  one man in times of old it is said imparted vitality to the statue he had chiselled others may have the contrary gift of turning life to stone  moore paused on this observation before he replied to it his look at once struck and meditative said a strange phrase what may it mean he turned it over in his mind with thought deep and slow as some german pondering metaphysics  you mean he said at last that some men inspire repugnance and so chill the kind heart  ingenious responded shirley if the interpretation pleases you you are welcome to hold it valid i dont care  and with that she raised her head lofty in look and statuelike in hue as louis had described it  behold the metamorphosis he said scarce imagined ere it is realized a lowly nymph develops to an inaccessible goddess but henry must not be disappointed of his recitation and olympia will deign to oblige him let us begin  i have forgotten the very first line  which i have not my memory if a slow is a retentive one i acquire deliberately both knowledge and liking the acquisition grows into my brain and the sentiment into my breast and it is not as the rapidspringing produce which having no root in itself flourishes verdurous enough for a time but too soon falls withered away attention henry miss keeldar consents to favour you voyez ce cheval ardent et impétueux so it commences  miss keeldar did consent to make the effort but she soon stopped  unless i heard the whole repeated i cannot continue it she said  yet it was quickly learnedsoon gained soon gone moralized the tutor he recited the passage deliberately accurately with slow impressive emphasis  shirley by degrees inclined her ear as he went on her face before turned from him returned towards him when he ceased she took the word up as if from his lips she took his very tone she seized his very accent she delivered the periods as he had delivered them she reproduced his manner his pronunciation his expression  it was now her turn to petition  recall le songe dathalie she entreated and say it  he said it for her she took it from him she found lively excitement in the pleasure of making his language her own she asked for further indulgence all the old school pieces were revived and with them shirleys old school days  he had gone through some of the best passages of racine and corneille and then had heard the echo of his own deep tones in the girls voice that modulated itself faithfully on his le chêne et le roseau that most beautiful of la fontaines fables had been recited well recited by the tutor and the pupil had animatedly availed herself of the lesson perhaps a simultaneous feeling seized them now that their enthusiasm had kindled to a glow which the slight fuel of french poetry no longer sufficed to feed perhaps they longed for a trunk of english oak to be thrown as a yule log to the devouring flame moore observed and these are our best pieces and we have nothing more dramatic nervous natural  and then he smiled and was silent his whole nature seemed serenely alight he stood on the hearth leaning his elbow on the mantelpiece musing not unblissfully  twilight was closing on the diminished autumn day the schoolroom windowsdarkened with creeping plants from which no high october winds had as yet swept the sere foliageadmitted scarce a gleam of sky but the fire gave light enough to talk by  and now louis moore addressed his pupil in french and she answered at first with laughing hesitation and in broken phrase moore encouraged while he corrected her henry joined in the lesson the two scholars stood opposite the master their arms round each others waists tartar who long since had craved and obtained admission sat sagely in the centre of the rug staring at the blaze which burst fitful from morsels of coal among the red cinders the group were happy enough but      pleasures are like poppies spread      you seize the flowerits bloom is shed  the dull rumbling sound of wheels was heard on the pavement in the yard  it is the carriage returned said shirley and dinner must be just ready and i am not dressed  a servant came in with mr moores candle and tea for the tutor and his pupil usually dined at luncheon time  mr sympson and the ladies are returned she said and sir philip nunnely is with them  how you did start and how your hand trembled shirley said henry when the maid had closed the shutter and was gone but i know whydont you mr moore i know what papa intends he is a little ugly man that sir philip i wish he had not come i wish sisters and all of them had stayed at de walden hall to dineshirley should once more have made tea for you and me mr moore and we would have had a happy evening of it  moore was locking up his desk and putting away his st pierre that was your plan was it my boy  dont you approve it sir  i approve nothing utopian look life in its iron face stare reality out of its brassy countenance make the tea henry i shall be back in a minute  he left the room so did shirley by another door     chapter xxviii  phŒbe   shirley probably got on pleasantly with sir philip that evening for the next morning she came down in one of her best moods  who will take a walk with me she asked after breakfast isabella and gertrude will you  so rare was such an invitation from miss keeldar to her female cousins that they hesitated before they accepted it their mamma however signifying acquiescence in the project they fetched their bonnets and the trio set out  it did not suit these three young persons to be thrown much together miss keeldar liked the society of few ladies indeed she had a cordial pleasure in that of none except mrs pryor and caroline helstone she was civil kind attentive even to her cousins but still she usually had little to say to them in the sunny mood of this particular morning she contrived to entertain even the misses sympson without deviating from her wonted rule of discussing with them only ordinary themes she imparted to these themes an extraordinary interest the sparkle of her spirit glanced along her phrases  what made her so joyous all the cause must have been in herself the day was not bright it was dima pale waning autumn day the walks through the dun woods were damp the atmosphere was heavy the sky overcast and yet it seemed that in shirleys heart lived all the light and azure of italy as all its fervour laughed in her gray english eye  some directions necessary to be given to her foreman john delayed her behind her cousins as they neared fieldhead on their return perhaps an interval of twenty minutes elapsed between her separation from them and her reentrance into the house in the meantime she had spoken to john and then she had lingered in the lane at the gate a summons to luncheon called her in she excused herself from the meal and went upstairs  is not shirley coming to luncheon asked isabella she said she was hungry  an hour after as she did not quit her chamber one of her cousins went to seek her there she was found sitting at the foot of the bed her head resting on her hand she looked quite pale very thoughtful almost sad  you are not ill was the question put  a little sick replied miss keeldar  certainly she was not a little changed from what she had been two hours before  this change accounted for only by those three words explained no otherwise this changewhencesoever springing effected in a brief ten minutespassed like no light summer cloud she talked when she joined her friends at dinner talked as usual she remained with them during the evening when again questioned respecting her health she declared herself perfectly recovered it had been a mere passing faintness a momentary sensation not worth a thought yet it was felt there was a difference in shirley  the next daythe day the week the fortnight afterthis new and peculiar shadow lingered on the countenance in the manner of miss keeldar a strange quietude settled over her look her movements her very voice the alteration was not so marked as to court or permit frequent questioning yet it was there and it would not pass away it hung over her like a cloud which no breeze could stir or disperse soon it became evident that to notice this change was to annoy her first she shrank from remark and if persisted in she with her own peculiar hauteur repelled it was she ill the reply came with decision  i am not  did anything weigh on her mind had anything happened to affect her spirits  she scornfully ridiculed the idea what did they mean by spirits she had no spirits black or white blue or gray to affect  something must be the mattershe was so altered  she supposed she had a right to alter at her ease she knew she was plainer if it suited her to grow ugly why need others fret themselves on the subject  there must be a cause for the change what was it  she peremptorily requested to be let alone  then she would make every effort to appear quite gay and she seemed indignant at herself that she could not perfectly succeed brief selfspurning epithets burst from her lips when alone fool coward she would term herself poltroon she would say if you must tremble tremble in secret quail where no eye sees you  how dare you she would ask herselfhow dare you show your weakness and betray your imbecile anxieties shake them off rise above them if you cannot do this hide them  and to hide them she did her best she once more became resolutely lively in company when weary of effort and forced to relax she sought solitudenot the solitude of her chamber she refused to mope shut up between four walls but that wilder solitude which lies out of doors and which she could chase mounted on zoë her mare she took long rides of half a day her uncle disapproved but he dared not remonstrate it was never pleasant to face shirleys anger even when she was healthy and gay but now that her face showed thin and her large eye looked hollow there was something in the darkening of that face and kindling of that eye which touched as well as alarmed  to all comparative strangers who unconscious of the alterations in her spirits commented on the alteration in her looks she had one reply  i am perfectly well i have not an ailment  and health indeed she must have had to be able to bear the exposure to the weather she now encountered wet or fair calm or storm she took her daily ride over stilbro moor tartar keeping up at her side with his wolflike gallop long and untiring  twice three times the eyes of gossipsthose eyes which are everywhere in the closet and on the hilltopnoticed that instead of turning on rushedge the top ridge of stilbro moor she rode forwards all the way to the town scouts were not wanting to mark her destination there it was ascertained that she alighted at the door of one mr pearson hall a solicitor related to the vicar of nunnely this gentleman and his ancestors had been the agents of the keeldar family for generations back some people affirmed that miss keeldar was become involved in business speculations connected with hollows millthat she had lost money and was constrained to mortgage her land others conjectured that she was going to be married and that the settlements were preparing                                       mr moore and henry sympson were together in the schoolroom the tutor was waiting for a lesson which the pupil seemed busy in preparing  henry make haste the afternoon is getting on  is it sir  certainly are you nearly ready with that lesson  no  not nearly ready  i have not construed a line  mr moore looked up the boys tone was rather peculiar  the task presents no difficulties henry or if it does bring them to me we will work together  mr moore i can do no work  my boy you are ill  sir i am not worse in bodily health than usual but my heart is full  shut the book come hither harry come to the fireside  harry limped forward his tutor placed him in a chair his lips were quivering his eyes brimming he laid his crutch on the floor bent down his head and wept  this distress is not occasioned by physical pain you say harry you have a grief tell it me  sir i have such a grief as i never had before i wish it could be relieved in some way i can hardly bear it  who knows but if we talk it over we may relieve it what is the cause whom does it concern  the cause sir is shirley it concerns shirley  does it you think her changed  all who know her think her changedyou too mr moore  not seriouslyno i see no alteration but such as a favourable turn might repair in a few weeks besides her own word must go for something she says she is well  there it is sir as long as she maintained she was well i believed her when i was sad out of her sight i soon recovered spirits in her presence now  well harry now has she said anything to you you and she were together in the garden two hours this morning i saw her talking and you listening now my dear harry if miss keeldar has said she is ill and enjoined you to keep her secret do not obey her for her lifes sake avow everything speak my boy  she say she is ill i believe sir if she were dying she would smile and aver nothing ails me  what have you learned then what new circumstance  i have learned that she has just made her will  made her will  the tutor and pupil were silent  she told you that asked moore when some minutes had elapsed  she told me quite cheerfully not as an ominous circumstance which i felt it to be she said i was the only person besides her solicitor pearson hall and mr helstone and mr yorke who knew anything about it and to me she intimated she wished specially to explain its provisions  go on harry  because she said looking down on me with her beautiful eyesoh they are beautiful mr moore i love them i love her she is my star heaven must not claim her she is lovely in this world and fitted for this world shirley is not an angel she is a woman and she shall live with men seraphs shall not have her mr moore if one of the sons of god with wings wide and bright as the sky blue and sounding as the sea having seen that she was fair descended to claim her his claim should be withstoodwithstood by meboy and cripple as i am  henry sympson go on when i tell you  because she said if i made no will and died before you harry all my property would go to you and i do not intend that it should be so though your father would like it but you she said will have his whole estate which is largelarger than fieldhead your sisters will have nothing so i have left them some money though i do not love them both together half so much as i love one lock of your fair hair she said these words and she called me her darling and let me kiss her she went on to tell me that she had left caroline helstone some money too that this manor house with its furniture and books she had bequeathed to me as she did not choose to take the old family place from her own blood and that all the rest of her property amounting to about twelve thousand pounds exclusive of the legacies to my sisters and miss helstone she had willed not to me seeing i was already rich but to a good man who would make the best use of it that any human being could doa man she said that was both gentle and brave strong and mercifula man that might not profess to be pious but she knew he had the secret of religion pure and undefiled before god the spirit of love and peace was with him he visited the fatherless and widows in their affliction and kept himself unspotted from the world then she asked do you approve what i have done harry i could not answer my tears choked me as they do now  mr moore allowed his pupil a moment to contend with and master his emotion he then demanded what else did she say  when i had signified my full consent to the conditions of her will she told me i was a generous boy and she was proud of me and now she added in case anything should happen you will know what to say to malice when she comes whispering hard things in your ear insinuating that shirley has wronged you that she did not love you you will know that i did love you harry that no sister could have loved you bettermy own treasure mr moore sir when i remember her voice and recall her look my heart beats as if it would break its strings she may go to heaven before meif god commands it she must but the rest of my lifeand my life will not be long i am glad of that nowshall be a straight quick thoughtful journey in the path her step has pressed i thought to enter the vault of the keeldars before her should it be otherwise lay my coffin by shirleys side  moore answered him with a weighty calm that offered a strange contrast to the boys perturbed enthusiasm  you are wrong both of youyou harm each other if youth once falls under the influence of a shadowy terror it imagines there will never be full sunlight again its first calamity it fancies will last a lifetime what more did she say anything more  we settled one or two family points between ourselves  i should rather like to know what  but mr moore you smile i could not smile to see shirley in such a mood  my boy i am neither nervous nor poetic nor inexperienced i see things as they are you dont as yet tell me these family points  only sir she asked me whether i considered myself most of a keeldar or a sympson and i answered i was keeldar to the core of the heart and to the marrow of the bones she said she was glad of it for besides her i was the only keeldar left in england and then we agreed on some matters  well  well sir that if i lived to inherit my fathers estate and her house i was to take the name of keeldar and to make fieldhead my residence henry shirley keeldar i said i would be called and i will her name and her manor house are ages old and sympson and sympson grove are of yesterday  come you are neither of you going to heaven yet i have the best hopes of you both with your proud distinctionsa pair of halffledged eaglets now what is your inference from all you have told me put it into words  that shirley thinks she is going to die  she referred to her health  not once but i assure you she is wasting her hands are grown quite thin and so is her cheek  does she ever complain to your mother or sisters  never she laughs at them when they question her mr moore she is a strange being so fair and girlishnot a manlike woman at all not an amazon and yet lifting her head above both help and sympathy  do you know where she is now henry is she in the house or riding out  surely not out sir it rains fast  true which however is no guarantee that she is not at this moment cantering over rushedge of late she has never permitted weather to be a hindrance to her rides  you remember mr moore how wet and stormy it was last wednesdayso wild indeed that she would not permit zoë to be saddled yet the blast she thought too tempestuous for her mare she herself faced on foot that afternoon she walked nearly as far as nunnely i asked her when she came in if she was not afraid of taking cold not i she said it would be too much good luck for me i dont know harry but the best thing that could happen to me would be to take a good cold and fever and so pass off like other christians she is reckless you see sir  reckless indeed go and find out where she is and if you can get an opportunity of speaking to her without attracting attention request her to come here a minute  yes sir  he snatched his crutch and started up to go  harry  he returned  do not deliver the message formally word it as in former days you would have worded an ordinary summons to the schoolroom  i see sir she will be more likely to obey  and harry  sir  i will call you when i want you till then you are dispensed from lessons  he departed mr moore left alone rose from his desk  i can be very cool and very supercilious with henry he said i can seem to make light of his apprehensions and look down du haut de ma grandeur on his youthful ardour to him i can speak as if in my eyes they were both children let me see if i can keep up the same rôle with her i have known the moment when i seemed about to forget it when confusion and submission seemed about to crush me with their soft tyranny when my tongue faltered and i have almost let the mantle drop and stood in her presence not masternobut something else i trust i shall never so play the fool it is well for a sir philip nunnely to redden when he meets her eye he may permit himself the indulgence of submission he may even without disgrace suffer his hand to tremble when it touches hers but if one of her farmers were to show himself susceptible and sentimental he would merely prove his need of a strait waistcoat so far i have always done very well she has sat near me and i have not shakenmore than my desk i have encountered her looks and smiles likewhy like a tutor as i am her hand i never yet touchednever underwent that test her farmer or her footman i am notno serf nor servant of hers have i ever been but i am poor and it behoves me to look to my selfrespectnot to compromise an inch of it what did she mean by that allusion to the cold people who petrify flesh to marble it pleased mei hardly know why i would not permit myself to inquire i never do indulge in scrutiny either of her language or countenance for if i did i should sometimes forget common sense and believe in romance a strange secret ecstasy steals through my veins at moments ill not encourageill not remember it i am resolved as long as may be to retain the right to say with paul i am not mad but speak forth the words of truth and soberness  he paused listening  will she come or will she not come he inquired how will she take the message naïvely or disdainfully like a child or like a queen both characters are in her nature  if she comes what shall i say to her how account firstly for the freedom of the request shall i apologize to her i could in all humility but would an apology tend to place us in the positions we ought relatively to occupy in this matter i must keep up the professor otherwise i hear a door  he waited many minutes passed  she will refuse me henry is entreating her to come she declines my petition is presumption in her eyes let her only come i can teach her to the contrary i would rather she were a little perverse it will steel me i prefer her cuirassed in pride armed with a taunt her scorn startles me from my dreams i stand up myself a sarcasm from her eyes or lips puts strength into every nerve and sinew i have some step approaches and not henrys  the door unclosed miss keeldar came in the message it appeared had found her at her needle she brought her work in her hand that day she had not been riding out she had evidently passed it quietly she wore her neat indoor dress and silk apron this was no thalestris from the fields but a quiet domestic character from the fireside mr moore had her at advantage he should have addressed her at once in solemn accents and with rigid mien perhaps he would had she looked saucy but her air never showed less of crânerie a soft kind of youthful shyness depressed her eyelid and mantled on her cheek the tutor stood silent  she made a full stop between the door and his desk  did you want me sir she asked  i ventured miss keeldar to send for youthat is to ask an interview of a few minutes  she waited she plied her needle  well sir not lifting her eyes what about  be seated first the subject i would broach is one of some moment perhaps i have hardly a right to approach it it is possible i ought to frame an apology it is possible no apology can excuse me the liberty i have taken arises from a conversation with henry the boy is unhappy about your health all your friends are unhappy on that subject it is of your health i would speak  i am quite well she said briefly  yet changed  that matters to none but myself we all change  will you sit down formerly miss keeldar i had some influence with you have i any now may i feel that what i am saying is not accounted positive presumption  let me read some french mr moore or i will even take a spell at the latin grammar and let us proclaim a truce to all sanitary discussions  no no it is time there were discussions  discuss away then but do not choose me for your text i am a healthy subject  do you not think it wrong to affirm and reaffirm what is substantially untrue  i say i am well i have neither cough pain nor fever  is there no equivocation in that assertion is it the direct truth  the direct truth  louis moore looked at her earnestly  i can myself he said trace no indications of actual disease but why then are you altered  am i altered  we will try we will seek a proof  how  i ask in the first place do you sleep as you used to  i do not but it is not because i am ill  have you the appetite you once had  no but it is not because i am ill  you remember this little ring fastened to my watchchain it was my mothers and is too small to pass the joint of my little finger you have many a time sportively purloined it it fitted your forefinger try now  she permitted the test the ring dropped from the wasted little hand louis picked it up and reattached it to the chain an uneasy flush coloured his brow shirley again said it is not because i am ill  not only have you lost sleep appetite and flesh proceeded moore but your spirits are always at ebb besides there is a nervous alarm in your eye a nervous disquiet in your manner these peculiarities were not formerly yours  mr moore we will pause here you have exactly hit it i am nervous now talk of something else what wet weather we havesteady pouring rain  you nervous yes and if miss keeldar is nervous it is not without a cause let me reach it let me look nearer the ailment is not physical i have suspected that it came in one moment i know the day i noticed the change your pain is mental  not at all it is nothing so dignifiedmerely nervous oh dismiss the topic  when it is exhausted not till then nervous alarms should always be communicated that they may be dissipated i wish i had the gift of persuasion and could incline you to speak willingly i believe confession in your case would be half equivalent to cure  no said shirley abruptly i wish that were at all probable but i am afraid it is not  she suspended her work a moment she was now seated resting her elbow on the table she leaned her head on her hand mr moore looked as if he felt he had at last gained some footing in this difficult path she was serious and in her wish was implied an important admission after that she could no longer affirm that nothing ailed her  the tutor allowed her some minutes for repose and reflection ere he returned to the charge once his lips moved to speak but he thought better of it and prolonged the pause shirley lifted her eye to his had he betrayed injudicious emotion perhaps obstinate persistence in silence would have been the result but he looked calm strong trustworthy  i had better tell you than my aunt she said or than my cousins or my uncle they would all make such a bustle and it is that very bustle i dreadthe alarm the flurry the éclat in short i never liked to be the centre of a small domestic whirlpool you can bear a little shockeh  a great one if necessary  not a muscle of the mans frame moved and yet his large heart beat fast in his deep chest what was she going to tell him was irremediable mischief done  had i thought it right to go to you i would never have made a secret of the matter one moment she continued i would have told you at once and asked advice  why was it not right to come to me  it might be righti do not mean that but i could not do it i seemed to have no title to trouble you the mishap concerned me only i wanted to keep it to myself and people will not let me i tell you i hate to be an object of worrying attention or a theme for village gossip besides it may pass away without resultgod knows  moore though tortured with suspense did not demand a quick explanation he suffered neither gesture glance nor word to betray impatience his tranquillity tranquillized shirley his confidence reassured her  great effects may spring from trivial causes she remarked as she loosened a bracelet from her wrist then unfastening her sleeve and partially turning it up look here mr moore  she showed a mark in her white armrather a deep though healedup indentationsomething between a burn and a cut  i would not show that to any one in briarfield but you because you can take it quietly  certainly there is nothing in the little mark to shock its history will explain  small as it is it has taken my sleep away and made me nervous thin and foolish because on account of that little mark i am obliged to look forward to a possibility that has its terrors  the sleeve was readjusted the bracelet replaced  do you know that you try me he said smiling i am a patient sort of man but my pulse is quickening  whatever happens you will befriend me mr moore you will give me the benefit of your selfpossession and not leave me at the mercy of agitated cowards  i make no promise now tell me the tale and then exact what pledge you will  it is a very short tale i took a walk with isabella and gertrude one day about three weeks ago they reached home before me i stayed behind to speak to john after leaving him i pleased myself with lingering in the lane where all was very still and shady i was tired of chattering to the girls and in no hurry to rejoin them as i stood leaning against the gatepillar thinking some very happy thoughts about my future lifefor that morning i imagined that events were beginning to turn as i had long wished them to turn  ah nunnely had been with her the evening before thought moore parenthetically  i heard a panting sound a dog came running up the lane i know most of the dogs in this neighbourhood it was phœbe one of mr sam wynnes pointers the poor creature ran with her head down her tongue hanging out she looked as if bruised and beaten all over i called her i meant to coax her into the house and give her some water and dinner i felt sure she had been illused mr sam often flogs his pointers cruelly she was too flurried to know me and when i attempted to pat her head she turned and snatched at my arm she bit it so as to draw blood then ran panting on directly after mr wynnes keeper came up carrying a gun he asked if i had seen a dog i told him i had seen phœbe  you had better chain up tartar maam he said and tell your people to keep within the house i am after phœbe to shoot her and the groom is gone another way she is raging mad  mr moore leaned back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest miss keeldar resumed her square of silk canvas and continued the creation of a wreath of parmese violets  and you told no one sought no help no cure you would not come to me  i got as far as the schoolroom door there my courage failed i preferred to cushion the matter  why what can i demand better in this world than to be of use to you  i had no claim  monstrous and you did nothing  yes i walked straight into the laundry where they are ironing most of the week now that i have so many guests in the house while the maid was busy crimping or starching i took an italian iron from the fire and applied the light scarlet glowing tip to my arm i bored it well in it cauterized the little wound then i went upstairs  i dare say you never once groaned  i am sure i dont know i was very miserablenot firm or tranquil at all i think there was no calm in my mind  there was calm in your person i remember listening the whole time we sat at luncheon to hear if you moved in the room above all was quiet  i was sitting at the foot of the bed wishing phœbe had not bitten me  and alone you like solitude  pardon me  you disdain sympathy  do i mr moore  with your powerful mind you must feel independent of help of advice of society  so be it since it pleases you  she smiled she pursued her embroidery carefully and quickly but her eyelash twinkled and then it glittered and then a drop fell  mr moore leaned forward on his desk moved his chair altered his attitude  if it is not so he asked with a peculiar mellow change in his voice how is it then  i dont know  you do know but you wont speak all must be locked up in yourself  because it is not worth sharing  because nobody can give the high price you require for your confidence nobody is rich enough to purchase it nobody has the honour the intellect the power you demand in your adviser there is not a shoulder in england on which you would rest your hand for support far less a bosom which you would permit to pillow your head of course you must live alone  i can live alone if need be but the question is not how to live but how to die alone that strikes me in a more grisly light  you apprehend the effects of the virus you anticipate an indefinitely threatening dreadful doom  she bowed  you are very nervous and womanish  you complimented me two minutes since on my powerful mind  you are very womanish if the whole affair were coolly examined and discussed i feel assured it would turn out that there is no danger of your dying at all  amen i am very willing to live if it please god i have felt life sweet  how can it be otherwise than sweet with your endowments and nature do you truly expect that you will be seized with hydrophobia and die raving mad  i expect it and have feared it just now i fear nothing  nor do i on your account i doubt whether the smallest particle of virus mingled with your blood and if it did let me assure you that young healthy faultlessly sound as you are no harm will ensue for the rest i shall inquire whether the dog was really mad i hold she was not mad  tell nobody that she bit me  why should i when i believe the bite innocuous as a cut of this penknife make yourself easy i am easy though i value your life as much as i do my own chance of happiness in eternity look up  why mr moore  i wish to see if you are cheered put your work down raise your head  there  look at me thank you and is the cloud broken  i fear nothing  is your mind restored to its own natural sunny clime  i am very content but i want your promise  dictate  you know in case the worst i have feared should happen they will smother me you need not smile they will they always do my uncle will be full of horror weakness precipitation and that is the only expedient which will suggest itself to him nobody in the house will be selfpossessed but you now promise to befriend meto keep mr sympson away from me not to let henry come near lest i should hurt him mindmind that you take care of yourself too but i shall not injure you i know i shall not lock the chamber door against the surgeons turn them out if they get in let neither the young nor the old macturk lay a finger on me nor mr greaves their colleague and lastly if i give trouble with your own hand administer to me a strong narcoticsuch a sure dose of laudanum as shall leave no mistake promise to do this  moore left his desk and permitted himself the recreation of one or two turns through the room stopping behind shirleys chair he bent over her and said in a low emphatic voice i promise all you askwithout comment without reservation  if female help is needed call in my housekeeper mrs gill let her lay me out if i die she is attached to me she wronged me again and again and again and again i forgave her she now loves me and would not defraud me of a pin confidence has made her honest forbearance has made her kindhearted at this day i can trust both her integrity her courage and her affection call her but keep my good aunt and my timid cousins away once more promise  i promise  that is good in you she said looking up at him as he bent over her and smiling  is it good does it comfort  very much  i will be with youi and mrs gill onlyin any in every extremity where calm and fidelity are needed no rash or coward hand shall meddle  yet you think me childish  i do  ah you despise me  do we despise children  in fact i am neither so strong nor have i such pride in my strength as people think mr moore nor am i so regardless of sympathy but when i have any grief i fear to impart it to those i love lest it should pain them and to those whom i view with indifference i cannot condescend to complain after all you should not taunt me with being childish for if you were as unhappy as i have been for the last three weeks you too would want some friend  we all want a friend do we not  all of us that have anything good in our natures  well you have caroline helstone  yes and you have mr hall  yes mrs pryor is a wise good woman she can counsel you when you need counsel  for your part you have your brother robert  for any righthand defections there is the rev matthewson helstone ma to lean upon for any lefthand fallingsoff there is hiram yorke esq both elders pay you homage  i never saw mrs yorke so motherly to any young man as she is to you i dont know how you have won her heart but she is more tender to you than she is to her own sons you have besides your sister hortense  it appears we are both well provided  it appears so  how thankful we ought to be  yes  how contented  yes  for my part i am almost contented just now and very thankful gratitude is a divine emotion it fills the heart but not to bursting it warms it but not to fever i like to taste leisurely of bliss devoured in haste i do not know its flavour  still leaning on the back of miss keeldars chair moore watched the rapid motion of her fingers as the green and purple garland grew beneath them after a prolonged pause he again asked is the shadow quite gone  wholly as i was two hours since and as i am now are two different states of existence i believe mr moore griefs and fears nursed in silence grow like titan infants  you will cherish such feelings no more in silence  not if i dare speak  in using the word dare to whom do you allude  to you  how is it applicable to me  on account of your austerity and shyness  why am i austere and shy  because you are proud  why am i proud  i should like to know will you be good enough to tell me  perhaps because i am poor for one reason poverty and pride often go together  that is such a nice reason i should be charmed to discover another that would pair with it mate that turtle mr moore  immediately what do you think of marrying to sober poverty manytinted caprice  are you capricious  you are  a libel i am steady as a rock fixed as the polar star  i look out at some early hour of the day and see a fine perfect rainbow bright with promise gloriously spanning the beclouded welkin of life an hour afterwards i look again half the arch is gone and the rest is faded still later the stern sky denies that it ever wore so benign a symbol of hope  well mr moore you should contend against these changeful humours they are your besetting sin one never knows where to have you  miss keeldar i had once for two years a pupil who grew very dear to me henry is dear but she was dearer henry never gives me trouble shewell she did i think she vexed me twentythree hours out of the twentyfour  she was never with you above three hours or at the most six at a time  she sometimes spilled the draught from my cup and stole the food from my plate and when she had kept me unfed for a day and that did not suit me for i am a man accustomed to take my meals with reasonable relish and to ascribe due importance to the rational enjoyment of creature comforts  i know you do i can tell what sort of dinners you like bestperfectly well i know precisely the dishes you prefer  she robbed these dishes of flavour and made a fool of me besides i like to sleep well in my quiet days when i was my own man i never quarrelled with the night for being long nor cursed my bed for its thorns she changed all this  mr moore  and having taken from me peace of mind and ease of life she took from me herselfquite coolly just as if when she was gone the world would be all the same to me i knew i should see her again at some time at the end of two years it fell out that we encountered again under her own roof where she was mistress how do you think she bore herself towards me miss keeldar  like one who had profited well by lessons learned from yourself  she received me haughtily she meted out a wide space between us and kept me aloof by the reserved gesture the rare and alienated glance the word calmly civil  she was an excellent pupil having seen you distant she at once learned to withdraw pray sir admire in her hauteur a careful improvement on your own coolness  conscience and honour and the most despotic necessity dragged me apart from her and kept me sundered with ponderous fetters she was free she might have been clement  never free to compromise her selfrespect to seek where she had been shunned  then she was inconsistent she tantalized as before when i thought i had made up my mind to seeing in her only a lofty stranger she would suddenly show me such a glimpse of loving simplicityshe would warm me with such a beam of reviving sympathy she would gladden an hour with converse so gentle gay and kindlythat i could no more shut my heart on her image than i could close that door against her presence explain why she distressed me so  she could not bear to be quite outcast and then she would sometimes get a notion into her head on a cold wet day that the schoolroom was no cheerful place and feel it incumbent on her to go and see if you and henry kept up a good fire and once there she liked to stay  but she should not be changeful if she came at all she should come oftener  there is such a thing as intrusion  tomorrow you will not be as you are today  i dont know will you  i am not mad most noble berenice we may give one day to dreaming but the next we must awake and i shall awake to purpose the morning you are married to sir philip nunnely the fire shines on you and me and shows us very clearly in the glass miss keeldar and i have been gazing on the picture all the time i have been talking look up what a difference between your head and mine i look old for thirty  you are so grave you have such a square brow and your face is sallow i never regard you as a young man nor as roberts junior  dont you i thought not imagine roberts clearcut handsome face looking over my shoulder does not the apparition make vividly manifest the obtuse mould of my heavy traits there he started i have been expecting that wire to vibrate this last halfhour  the dinnerbell rang and shirley rose  mr moore she said as she gathered up her silks have you heard from your brother lately do you know what he means by staying in town so long does he talk of returning  he talks of returning but what has caused his long absence i cannot tell to speak the truth i thought none in yorkshire knew better than yourself why he was reluctant to come home  a crimson shadow passed across miss keeldars cheek  write to him and urge him to come she said i know there has been no impolicy in protracting his absence thus far it is good to let the mill stand while trade is so bad but he must not abandon the county  i am aware said louis that he had an interview with you the evening before he left and i saw him quit fieldhead afterwards i read his countenance or tried to read it he turned from me i divined that he would be long away some fine slight fingers have a wondrous knack at pulverizing a mans brittle pride i suppose robert put too much trust in his manly beauty and native gentlemanhood those are better off who being destitute of advantage cannot cherish delusion but i will write and say you advise his return  do not say i advise his return but that his return is advisable  the second bell rang and miss keeldar obeyed its call     chapter xxix  louis moore   louis moore was used to a quiet life being a quiet man he endured it better than most men would having a large world of his own in his own head and heart he tolerated confinement to a small still corner of the real world very patiently  how hushed is fieldhead this evening all but mooremiss keeldar the whole family of the sympsons even henryare gone to nunnely sir philip would have them come he wished to make them acquainted with his mother and sisters who are now at the priory kind gentleman as the baronet is he asked the tutor too but the tutor would much sooner have made an appointment with the ghost of the earl of huntingdon to meet him and a shadowy ring of his merry men under the canopy of the thickest blackest oldest oak in nunnely forest yes he would rather have appointed tryst with a phantom abbess or mistpale nun among the wet and weedy relics of that ruined sanctuary of theirs mouldering in the core of the wood louis moore longs to have something near him tonight but not the boybaronet nor his benevolent but stern mother nor his patrician sisters nor one soul of the sympsons  this night is not calm the equinox still struggles in its storms the wild rains of the day are abated the great single cloud disparts and rolls away from heaven not passing and leaving a sea all sapphire but tossed buoyant before a continued longsounding highrushing moonlight tempest the moon reigns glorious glad of the gale as glad as if she gave herself to his fierce caress with love no endymion will watch for his goddess tonight there are no flocks out on the mountains and it is well for tonight she welcomes Æolus  moore sitting in the schoolroom heard the storm roar round the other gable and along the hallfront this end was sheltered he wanted no shelter he desired no subdued sounds or screened position  all the parlours are empty said he i am sick at heart of this cell  he left it and went where the casements larger and freer than the branchscreened lattice of his own apartment admitted unimpeded the darkblue the silverfleeced the stirring and sweeping vision of the autumn nightsky he carried no candle unneeded was lamp or fire the broad and clear though cloudcrossed and fluctuating beam of the moon shone on every floor and wall  moore wanders through all the rooms he seems following a phantom from parlour to parlour in the oak room he stops this is not chill and polished and fireless like the salon the hearth is hot and ruddy the cinders tinkle in the intense heat of their clear glow near the rug is a little worktable a desk upon it a chair near it  does the vision moore has tracked occupy that chair you would think so could you see him standing before it there is as much interest now in his eye and as much significance in his face as if in this household solitude he had found a living companion and was going to speak to it  he makes discoveries a baga small satin baghangs on the chairback the desk is open the keys are in the lock a pretty seal a silver pen a crimson berry or two of ripe fruit on a green leaf a small clean delicate glovethese trifles at once decorate and disarrange the stand they strew order forbids details in a pictureshe puts them tidily away but details give charm  moore spoke  her mark he said here she has beencareless attractive thingcalled away in haste doubtless and forgetting to return and put all to rights why does she leave fascination in her footprints whence did she acquire the gift to be heedless and never offend there is always something to chide in her and the reprimand never settles in displeasure on the heart but for her lover or her husband when it had trickled a while in words would naturally melt from his lips in a kiss better pass half an hour in remonstrating with her than a day in admiring or praising any other woman alive am i muttering soliloquizing stop that  he did stop it he stood thinking and then he made an arrangement for his evenings comfort  he dropped the curtains over the broad window and regal moon he shut out sovereign and court and starry armies he added fuel to the hot but fastwasting fire he lit a candle of which there were a pair on the table he placed another chair opposite that near the workstand and then he sat down his next movement was to take from his pocket a small thick book of blank paper to produce a pencil and to begin to write in a cramp compact hand come near by all means reader do not be shy stoop over his shoulder fearlessly and read as he scribbles  it is nine oclock the carriage will not return before eleven i am certain freedom is mine till then till then i may occupy her room sit opposite her chair rest my elbow on her table have her little mementoes about me  i used rather to like solitudeto fancy her a somewhat quiet and serious yet fair nymph an oread descending to me from lone mountainpasses something of the blue mist of hills in her array and of their chill breeze in her breath but much also of their solemn beauty in her mien i once could court her serenely and imagine my heart easier when i held her to itall mute but majestic  since that day i called s to me in the schoolroom and she came and sat so near my side since she opened the trouble of her mind to me asked my protection appealed to my strengthsince that hour i abhor solitude cold abstraction fleshless skeleton daughter mother and mate of death  it is pleasant to write about what is near and dear as the core of my heart none can deprive me of this little book and through this pencil i can say to it what i willsay what i dare utter to nothing livingsay what i dare not think aloud  we have scarcely encountered each other since that evening once when i was alone in the drawingroom seeking a book of henrys she entered dressed for a concert at stilbro shynessher shyness not minedrew a silver veil between us much cant have i heard and read about maiden modesty but properly used and not hackneyed the words are good and appropriate words as she passed to the window after tacitly but gracefully recognizing me i could call her nothing in my own mind save stainless virgin to my perception a delicate splendour robed her and the modesty of girlhood was her halo i may be the most fatuous as i am one of the plainest of men but in truth that shyness of hers touched me exquisitely it flattered my finest sensations i looked a stupid block i dare say i was alive with a life of paradise as she turned her glance from my glance and softly averted her head to hide the suffusion of her cheek  i know this is the talk of a dreamerof a rapt romantic lunatic i do dream i will dream now and then and if she has inspired romance into my prosaic composition how can i help it  what a child she is sometimes what an unsophisticated untaught thing i see her now looking up into my face and entreating me to prevent them from smothering her and to be sure and give her a strong narcotic i see her confessing that she was not so selfsufficing so independent of sympathy as people thought i see the secret tear drop quietly from her eyelash she said i thought her childish and i did she imagined i despised her despised her it was unutterably sweet to feel myself at once near her and above herto be conscious of a natural right and power to sustain her as a husband should sustain his wife  i worship her perfections but it is her faults or at least her foibles that bring her near to me that nestle her to my heart that fold her about with my love and that for a most selfish but deeplynatural reason these faults are the steps by which i mount to ascendency over her if she rose a trimmed artificial mound without inequality what vantage would she offer the foot it is the natural hill with its mossy breaks and hollows whose slope invites ascent whose summit it is pleasure to gain  to leave metaphor it delights my eye to look on her she suits me if i were a king and she the housemaid that swept my palacestairs across all that space between us my eye would recognize her qualities a true pulse would beat for her in my heart though an unspanned gulf made acquaintance impossible if i were a gentleman and she waited on me as a servant i could not help liking that shirley take from her her education take her ornaments her sumptuous dress all extrinsic advantages take all grace but such as the symmetry of her form renders inevitable present her to me at a cottage door in a stuff gown let her offer me there a draught of water with that smile with that warm goodwill with which she now dispenses manorial hospitalityi should like her i should wish to stay an hour i should linger to talk with that rustic i should not feel as i now do i should find in her nothing divine but whenever i met the young peasant it would be with pleasure whenever i left her it would be with regret  how culpably careless in her to leave her desk open where i know she has money in the lock hang the keys of all her repositories of her very jewelcasket there is a purse in that little satin bag i see the tassel of silver beads hanging out that spectacle would provoke my brother robert all her little failings would i know be a source of irritation to him if they vex me it is a most pleasurable vexation i delight to find her at fault and were i always resident with her i am aware she would be no niggard in thus ministering to my enjoyment she would just give me something to do to rectifya theme for my tutor lectures i never lecture henry never feel disposed to do so if he does wrongand that is very seldom dear excellent lada word suffices often i do no more than shake my head but the moment her minois mutin meets my eye expostulatory words crowd to my lips from a taciturn man i believe she would transform me into a talker whence comes the delight i take in that talk it puzzles myself sometimes the more crâne malin taquin is her mood consequently the clearer occasion she gives me for disapprobation the more i seek her the better i like her she is never wilder than when equipped in her habit and hat never less manageable than when she and zoë come in fiery from a race with the wind on the hills and i confess itto this mute page i may confess iti have waited an hour in the court for the chance of witnessing her return and for the dearer chance of receiving her in my arms from the saddle i have noticed again it is to this page only i would make the remark that she will never permit any man but myself to render her that assistance i have seen her politely decline sir philip nunnelys aid she is always mighty gentle with her young baronet mighty tender for his feelings forsooth and of his very thinskinned amour propre i have marked her haughtily reject sam wynnes now i knowmy heart knows it for it has felt itthat she resigns herself to me unreluctantly is she conscious how my strength rejoices to serve her i myself am not her slavei declare itbut my faculties gather to her beauty like the genii to the glisten of the lamp all my knowledge all my prudence all my calm and all my power stand in her presence humbly waiting a task how glad they are when a mandate comes what joy they take in the toils she assigns does she know it  i have called her careless it is remarkable that her carelessness never compromises her refinement indeed through this very loophole of character the reality depth genuineness of that refinement may be ascertained a whole garment sometimes covers meagreness and malformation through a rent sleeve a fair round arm may be revealed i have seen and handled many of her possessions because they are frequently astray i never saw anything that did not proclaim the ladynothing sordid nothing soiled in one sense she is as scrupulous as in another she is unthinking as a peasant girl she would go ever trim and cleanly look at the pure kid of this little glove at the fresh unsullied satin of the bag  what a difference there is between s and that pearl c h caroline i fancy is the soul of conscientious punctuality and nice exactitude she would precisely suit the domestic habits of a certain fastidious kinsman of mineso delicate dexterous quaint quick quietall done to a minute all arranged to a strawbreadth she would suit robert but what could i do with anything so nearly faultless she is my equal poor as myself she is certainly pretty a little raffaelle head hersraffaelle in feature quite english in expression all insular grace and purity but where is there anything to alter anything to endure anything to reprimand to be anxious about there she is a lily of the valley untinted needing no tint what change could improve her what pencil dare to paint my sweetheart if i ever have one must bear nearer affinity to the rosea sweet lively delight guarded with prickly peril my wife if i ever marry must stir my great frame with a sting now and then she must furnish use to her husbands vast mass of patience i was not made so enduring to be mated with a lamb i should find more congenial responsibility in the charge of a young lioness or leopardess i like few things sweet but what are likewise pungentfew things bright but what are likewise hot i like the summer day whose sun makes fruit blush and corn blanch beauty is never so beautiful as when if i tease it it wreathes back on me with spirit fascination is never so imperial as when roused and half ireful she threatens transformation to fierceness i fear i should tire of the mute monotonous innocence of the lamb i should ere long feel as burdensome the nestling dove which never stirred in my bosom but my patience would exult in stilling the flutterings and training the energies of the restless merlin in managing the wild instincts of the scarce manageable bête fauve my powers would revel  o my pupil o peri too mutinous for heaven too innocent for hell never shall i do more than see and worship and wish for thee alas knowing i could make thee happy will it be my doom to see thee possessed by those who have not that power  however kindly the hand if it is feeble it cannot bend shirley and she must be bent it cannot curb her and she must be curbed  beware sir philip nunnely i never see you walking or sitting at her side and observe her lips compressed or her brow knit in resolute endurance of some trait of your character which she neither admires nor likes in determined toleration of some weakness she believes atoned for by a virtue but which annoys her despite that belief i never mark the grave glow of her face the unsmiling sparkle of her eye the slight recoil of her whole frame when you draw a little too near and gaze a little too expressively and whisper a little too warmlyi never witness these things but i think of the fable of semele reversed  it is not the daughter of cadmus i see nor do i realize her fatal longing to look on jove in the majesty of his godhead it is a priest of juno that stands before me watching late and lone at a shrine in an argive temple for years of solitary ministry he has lived on dreams there is divine madness upon him he loves the idol he serves and prays day and night that his frenzy may be fed and that the oxeyed may smile on her votary she has heard she will be propitious all argos slumbers the doors of the temple are shut the priest waits at the altar  a shock of heaven and earth is feltnot by the slumbering city only by that lonely watcher brave and unshaken in his fanaticism in the midst of silence with no preluding sound he is wrapped in sudden light through the roof through the rent wideyawning vast whiteblazing blue of heaven above pours a wondrous descent dread as the downrushing of stars he has what he asked withdrawforbear to looki am blinded i hear in that fane an unspeakable sound would that i could not hear it i see an insufferable glory burning terribly between the pillars gods be merciful and quench it  a pious argive enters to make an early offering in the cool dawn of morning there was thunder in the night the bolt fell here the shrine is shivered the marble pavement round split and blackened saturnias statue rises chaste grand untouched at her feet piled ashes lie pale no priest remains he who watched will be seen no more                                       there is the carriage let me lock up the desk and pocket the keys she will be seeking them tomorrow she will have to come to me i hear her mr moore have you seen my keys  so she will say in her clear voice speaking with reluctance looking ashamed conscious that this is the twentieth time of asking i will tantalize her keep her with me expecting doubting and when i do restore them it shall not be without a lecture here is the bag too and the purse the glovepenseal she shall wring them all out of me slowly and separatelyonly by confession penitence entreaty i never can touch her hand or a ringlet of her head or a ribbon of her dress but i will make privileges for myself every feature of her face her bright eyes her lips shall go through each change they know for my pleasuredisplay each exquisite variety of glance and curve to delight thrill perhaps more hopelessly to enchain me if i must be her slave i will not lose my freedom for nothing  he locked the desk pocketed all the property and went     chapter xxx  rushedgea confessional   everybody said it was high time for mr moore to return home all briarfield wondered at his strange absence and whinbury and nunnely brought each its separate contribution of amazement  was it known why he stayed away yes it was known twentyforty times over there being at least forty plausible reasons adduced to account for the unaccountable circumstance business it was notthat the gossips agreed he had achieved the business on which he departed long ago his four ringleaders he had soon scented out and run down he had attended their trial heard their conviction and sentence and seen them safely shipped prior to transportation  this was known at briarfield the newspapers had reported it the stilbro courier had given every particular with amplifications none applauded his perseverance or hailed his success though the millowners were glad of it trusting that the terrors of law vindicated would henceforward paralyze the sinister valour of disaffection disaffection however was still heard muttering to himself he swore ominous oaths over the drugged beer of alehouses and drank strange toasts in fiery british gin  one report affirmed that moore dared not come to yorkshire he knew his life was not worth an hours purchase if he did  ill tell him that said mr yorke when his foreman mentioned the rumour and if that does not bring him home full gallop nothing will  either that or some other motive prevailed at last to recall him he announced to joe scott the day he should arrive at stilbro desiring his hackney to be sent to the george for his accommodation and joe scott having informed mr yorke that gentleman made it in his way to meet him  it was marketday moore arrived in time to take his usual place at the market dinner as something of a stranger and as a man of note and action the assembled manufacturers received him with a certain distinction some who in public would scarcely have dared to acknowledge his acquaintance lest a little of the hate and vengeance laid up in store for him should perchance have fallen on them in private hailed him as in some sort their champion when the wine had circulated their respect would have kindled to enthusiasm had not moores unshaken nonchalance held it in a damp low smouldering state  mr yorke the permanent president of these dinners witnessed his young friends bearing with exceeding complacency if one thing could stir his temper or excite his contempt more than another it was to see a man befooled by flattery or elate with popularity if one thing smoothed soothed and charmed him especially it was the spectacle of a public character incapable of relishing his publicityincapable i say disdain would but have incensed it was indifference that appeased his rough spirit  robert leaning back in his chair quiet and almost surly while the clothiers and blanketmakers vaunted his prowess and rehearsed his deedsmany of them interspersing their flatteries with coarse invectives against the operative classwas a delectable sight for mr yorke his heart tingled with the pleasing conviction that these gross eulogiums shamed moore deeply and made him half scorn himself and his work on abuse on reproach on calumny it is easy to smile but painful indeed is the panegyric of those we contemn often had moore gazed with a brilliant countenance over howling crowds from a hostile hustings he had breasted the storm of unpopularity with gallant bearing and soul elate but he drooped his head under the halfbred tradesmens praise and shrank chagrined before their congratulations  yorke could not help asking him how he liked his supporters and whether he did not think they did honour to his cause but it is a pity lad he added that you did not hang these four samples of the unwashed if you had managed that feat the gentry here would have riven the horses out of the coach yoked to a score of asses and drawn you into stilbro like a conquering general  moore soon forsook the wine broke from the party and took the road in less than five minutes mr yorke followed him they rode out of stilbro together  it was early to go home but yet it was late in the day the last ray of the sun had already faded from the cloudedges and the october night was casting over the moorlands the shadow of her approach  mr yorke moderately exhilarated with his moderate libations and not displeased to see young moore again in yorkshire and to have him for his comrade during the long ride home took the discourse much to himself he touched briefly but scoffingly on the trials and the conviction he passed thence to the gossip of the neighbourhood and ere long he attacked moore on his own personal concerns  bob i believe you are worsted and you deserve it all was smooth fortune had fallen in love with you she had decreed you the first prize in her wheeltwenty thousand pounds she only required that you should hold your hand out and take it and what did you do you called for a horse and rode ahunting to warwickshire your sweetheartfortune i meanwas perfectly indulgent she said ill excuse him hes young she waited like patience on a monument till the chase was over and the verminprey run down she expected you would come back then and be a good lad you might still have had her first prize  it capped her beyond expression and me too to find that instead of thundering home in a breakneck gallop and laying your assize laurels at her feet you coolly took coach up to london what you have done there satan knows nothing in this world i believe but sat and sulked your face was never lily fair but it is olive green now youre not as bonny as you were man  and who is to have this prize you talk so much about  only a baronet that is all i have not a doubt in my own mind youve lost her she will be lady nunnely before christmas  hem quite probable  but she need not to have been fool of a lad i swear you might have had her  by what token mr yorke  by every tokenby the light of her eyes the red of her cheeks red they grew when your name was mentioned though of custom they are pale  my chance is quite over i suppose  it ought to be but try it is worth trying i call this sir philip milk and water and then he writes verses they saytags rhymes you are above that bob at all events  would you advise me to propose late as it is mr yorkeat the eleventh hour  you can but make the experiment robert if she has a fancy for youand on my conscience i believe she has or hadshe will forgive much but my lad you are laughing is it at me you had better grin at your own perverseness i see however you laugh at the wrong side of your mouth you have as sour a look at this moment as one need wish to see  i have so quarrelled with myself yorke i have so kicked against the pricks and struggled in a strait waistcoat and dislocated my wrists with wrenching them in handcuffs and battered my hard head by driving it against a harder wall  ha im glad to hear that sharp exercise yon i hope it has done you goodtaen some of the selfconceit out of you  selfconceit what is it selfrespect selftolerance even what are they do you sell the articles do you know anybody who does give an indication they would find in me a liberal chapman i would part with my last guinea this minute to buy  is it so with you robert i find that spicy i like a man to speak his mind what has gone wrong  the machinery of all my nature the whole enginery of this human mill the boiler which i take to be the heart is fit to burst  that suld be putten i print its striking its almost blank verse yell be jingling into poetry just enow if the afflatus comes give way robert never heed me ill bear it this whet time  hideous abhorrent base blunder you may commit in a moment what you will rue for yearswhat life cannot cancel  lad go on i call it pie nuts sugarcandy i like the taste uncommonly go on it will do you good to talk the moor is before us now and there is no life for many a mile round  i will talk i am not ashamed to tell there is a sort of wild cat in my breast and i choose that you shall hear how it can yell  to me it is music what grand voices you and louis have when louis singstones off like a soft deep bellive felt myself tremble again the night is still it listens it is just leaning down to you like a black priest to a blacker penitent confess lad smooth naught down be candid as a convicted justified sanctified methody at an experience meeting make yourself as wicked as beelzebub it will ease your mind  as mean as mammon you would say yorke if i got off horseback and laid myself down across the road would you have the goodness to gallop over me backwards and forwards about twenty times  wi all the pleasure in life if there were no such thing as a coroners inquest  hiram yorke i certainly believed she loved me i have seen her eyes sparkle radiantly when she has found me out in a crowd she has flushed up crimson when she has offered me her hand and said how do you do mr moore  my name had a magical influence over her when others uttered it she changed countenancei know she did she pronounced it herself in the most musical of her many musical tones she was cordial to me she took an interest in me she was anxious about me she wished me well she sought she seized every opportunity to benefit me i considered paused watched weighed wondered i could come to but one conclusionthis is love  i looked at her yorke i saw in her youth and a species of beauty i saw power in her her wealth offered me the redemption of my honour and my standing i owed her gratitude she had aided me substantially and effectually by a loan of five thousand pounds could i remember these things could i believe she loved me could i hear wisdom urge me to marry her and disregard every dear advantage disbelieve every flattering suggestion disdain every wellweighed counsel turn and leave her young graceful graciousmy benefactress attached to me enamoured of me i used to say so to myself dwell on the word mouth it over and over again swell over it with a pleasant pompous complacency with an admiration dedicated entirely to myself and unimpaired even by esteem for her indeed i smiled in deep secrecy at her naïveté and simplicity in being the first to love and to show it that whip of yours seems to have a good heavy handle yorke you can swing it about your head and knock me out of the saddle if you choose i should rather relish a loundering whack  tak patience robert till the moon rises and i can see you speak plain outdid you love her or not i could like to know i feel curious  sirsiri sayshe is very pretty in her own style and very attractive she has a look at times of a thing made out of fire and air at which i stand and marvel without a thought of clasping and kissing it i felt in her a powerful magnet to my interest and vanity i never felt as if nature meant her to be my other and better self when a question on that head rushed upon me i flung it off saying brutally i should be rich with her and ruined without hervowing i would be practical and not romantic  a very sensible resolve what mischief came of it bob  with this sensible resolve i walked up to fieldhead one night last august it was the very eve of my departure for birmingham for you see i wanted to secure fortunes splendid prize i had previously dispatched a note requesting a private interview i found her at home and alone  she received me without embarrassment for she thought i came on business i was embarrassed enough but determined i hardly know how i got the operation over but i went to work in a hard firm fashionfrightful enough i dare say i sternly offered myselfmy fine personwith my debts of course as a settlement  it vexed me it kindled my ire to find that she neither blushed trembled nor looked down she responded i doubt whether i have understood you mr moore  and i had to go over the whole proposal twice and word it as plainly as a b c before she would fully take it in and then what did she do instead of faltering a sweet yes or maintaining a soft confused silence which would have been as good she started up walked twice fast through the room in the way that she only does and no other woman and ejaculated god bless me  yorke i stood on the hearth backed by the mantelpiece against it i leaned and prepared for anythingeverything i knew my doom and i knew myself there was no misunderstanding her aspect and voice she stopped and looked at me  god bless me she piteously repeated in that shocked indignant yet saddened accent you have made a strange proposalstrange from you and if you knew how strangely you worded it and looked it you would be startled at yourself you spoke like a brigand who demanded my purse rather than like a lover who asked my heart  a queer sentence was it not yorke and i knew as she uttered it it was true as queer her words were a mirror in which i saw myself  i looked at her dumb and wolfish she at once enraged and shamed me  gérard moore you know you dont love shirley keeldar i might have broken out into false swearingvowed that i did love her but i could not lie in her pure face i could not perjure myself in her truthful presence besides such hollow oaths would have been vain as void she would no more have believed me than she would have believed the ghost of judas had he broken from the night and stood before her her female heart had finer perceptions than to be cheated into mistaking my halfcoarse halfcold admiration for truethrobbing manly love  what next happened you will say mr yorke  why she sat down in the windowseat and cried she cried passionately her eyes not only rained but lightened they flashed open large dark haughty upon me they said you have pained me you have outraged me you have deceived me  she added words soon to looks  i did respecti did admirei did like you she saidyes as much as if you were my brother and youyou want to make a speculation of me you would immolate me to that mill your moloch  i had the common sense to abstain from any word of excuse any attempt at palliation i stood to be scorned  sold to the devil for the time being i was certainly infatuated when i did speak what do you think i said  whatever my own feelings were i was persuaded you loved me miss keeldar  beautiful was it not she sat quite confounded is it robert moore that speaks i heard her mutter is it a manor something lower  do you mean she asked alouddo you mean you thought i loved you as we love those we wish to marry  it was my meaning and i said so  you conceived an idea obnoxious to a womans feelings was her answer you have announced it in a fashion revolting to a womans soul you insinuate that all the frank kindness i have shown you has been a complicated a bold and an immodest manœuvre to ensnare a husband you imply that at last you come here out of pity to offer me your hand because i have courted you let me say this your sight is jaundiced you have seen wrong your mind is warped you have judged wrong your tongue betrays you you now speak wrong i never loved you be at rest there my heart is as pure of passion for you as yours is barren of affection for me  i hope i was answered yorke  i seem to be a blind besotted sort of person was my remark  loved you she cried why i have been as frank with you as a sisternever shunned you never feared you you cannot she affirmed triumphantlyyou cannot make me tremble with your coming nor accelerate my pulse by your influence  i alleged that often when she spoke to me she blushed and that the sound of my name moved her  not for your sake she declared briefly i urged explanation but could get none  when i sat beside you at the school feast did you think i loved you then when i stopped you in maythorn lane did you think i loved you then when i called on you in the countinghouse when i walked with you on the pavement did you think i loved you then  so she questioned me and i said i did  by the lord yorke she rose she grew tall she expanded and refined almost to flame there was a trembling all through her as in live coal when its vivid vermilion is hottest  that is to say that you have the worst opinion of me that you deny me the possession of all i value most that is to say that i am a traitor to all my sisters that i have acted as no woman can act without degrading herself and her sex that i have sought where the incorrupt of my kind naturally scorn and abhor to seek she and i were silent for many a minute lucifer star of the morning she went on thou art fallen you once high in my esteem are hurled down you once intimate in my friendship are cast out go  i went not i had heard her voice tremble seen her lip quiver i knew another storm of tears would fall and then i believed some calm and some sunshine must come and i would wait for it  as fast but more quietly than before the warm rain streamed down there was another sound in her weepinga softer more regretful sound while i watched her eyes lifted to me a gaze more reproachful than haughty more mournful than incensed  o moore said she it was worse than et tu brute  i relieved myself by what should have been a sigh but it became a groan a sense of cainlike desolation made my breast ache  there has been error in what i have done i said and it has won me bitter wages which i will go and spend far from her who gave them  i took my hat all the time i could not have borne to depart so and i believed she would not let me nor would she but for the mortal pang i had given her pride that cowed her compassion and kept her silent  i was obliged to turn back of my own accord when i reached the door to approach her and to say forgive me  i could if there was not myself to forgive too was her reply but to mislead a sagacious man so far i must have done wrong  i broke out suddenly with some declamation i do not remember i know that it was sincere and that my wish and aim were to absolve her to herself in fact in her case selfaccusation was a chimera  at last she extended her hand for the first time i wished to take her in my arms and kiss her i did kiss her hand many times  some day we shall be friends again she said when you have had time to read my actions and motives in a true light and not so horribly to misinterpret them time may give you the right key to all then perhaps you will comprehend me and then we shall be reconciled  farewell drops rolled slow down her cheeks she wiped them away  i am sorry for what has happeneddeeply sorry she sobbed so was i god knows thus were we severed  a queer tale commented mr yorke  ill do it no more vowed his companion never more will i mention marriage to a woman unless i feel love henceforth credit and commerce may take care of themselves bankruptcy may come when it lists i have done with slavish fear of disaster i mean to work diligently wait patiently bear steadily let the worst come i will take my axe and an emigrants berth and go out with louis to the west he and i have settled it no woman shall ever again look at me as miss keeldar looked ever again feel towards me as miss keeldar felt in no womans presence will i ever again stand at once such a fool and such a knave such a brute and such a puppy  tut said the imperturbable yorke you make too much of it but still i say i am capped firstly that she did not love you and secondly that you did not love her you are both young you are both handsome you are both well enough for wit and even for tempertake you on the right side what ailed you that you could not agree  we never have been never could be at home with each other yorke admire each other as we might at a distance still we jarred when we came very near i have sat at one side of a room and observed her at the other perhaps in an excited genial moment when she had some of her favourites round herher old beaux for instance yourself and helstone with whom she is so playful pleasant and eloquent i have watched her when she was most natural most lively and most lovely my judgment has pronounced her beautiful beautiful she is at times when her mood and her array partake of the splendid i have drawn a little nearer feeling that our terms of acquaintance gave me the right of approach i have joined the circle round her seat caught her eye and mastered her attention then we have conversed and others thinking me perhaps peculiarly privileged have withdrawn by degrees and left us alone were we happy thus left for myself i must say no always a feeling of constraint came over me always i was disposed to be stern and strange we talked politics and business no soft sense of domestic intimacy ever opened our hearts or thawed our language and made it flow easy and limpid if we had confidences they were confidences of the countinghouse not of the heart nothing in her cherished affection in me made me better gentler she only stirred my brain and whetted my acuteness she never crept into my heart or influenced its pulse and for this good reason no doubt because i had not the secret of making her love me  well lad it is a queer thing i might laugh at thee and reckon to despise thy refinements but as it is dark night and we are by ourselves i dont mind telling thee that thy talk brings back a glimpse of my own past life twentyfive years ago i tried to persuade a beautiful woman to love me and she would not i had not the key to her nature she was a stone wall to me doorless and windowless  but you loved her yorke you worshipped mary cave your conduct after all was that of a mannever of a fortunehunter  ay i did love her but then she was beautiful as the moon we do not see tonight there is naught like her in these days miss helstone maybe has a look of her but nobody else  who has a look of her  that blackcoated tyrants niecethat quiet delicate miss helstone many a time i have put on my spectacles to look at the lassie in church because she has gentle blue een wi long lashes and when she sits in shadow and is very still and very pale and is happen about to fall asleep wi the length of the sermon and the heat of the biggin she is as like one of canovas marbles as aught else  was mary cave in that style  far granderless lasslike and fleshlike you wondered why she hadnt wings and a crown she was a stately peaceful angel was my mary  and you could not persuade her to love you  not with all i could do though i prayed heaven many a time on my bended knees to help me  mary cave was not what you think her yorke i have seen her picture at the rectory she is no angel but a fair regularfeatured taciturnlooking womanrather too white and lifeless for my taste but supposing she had been something better than she was  robert interrupted yorke i could fell you off your horse at this moment however ill hold my hand reason tells me you are right and i am wrong i know well enough that the passion i still have is only the remnant of an illusion if miss cave had possessed either feeling or sense she could not have been so perfectly impassible to my regard as she showed herself she must have preferred me to that copperfaced despot  supposing yorke she had been educated no women were educated in those days supposing she had possessed a thoughtful original mind a love of knowledge a wish for information which she took an artless delight in receiving from your lips and having measured out to her by your hand supposing her conversation when she sat at your side was fertile varied imbued with a picturesque grace and genial interest quiet flowing but clear and bounteous supposing that when you stood near her by chance or when you sat near her by design comfort at once became your atmosphere and content your element supposing that whenever her face was under your gaze or her idea filled your thoughts you gradually ceased to be hard and anxious and pure affection love of home thirst for sweet discourse unselfish longing to protect and cherish replaced the sordid cankering calculations of your trade supposing with all this that many a time when you had been so happy as to possess your marys little hand you had felt it tremble as you held it just as a warm little bird trembles when you take it from its nest supposing you had noticed her shrink into the background on your entrance into a room yet if you sought her in her retreat she welcomed you with the sweetest smile that ever lit a fair virgin face and only turned her eyes from the encounter of your own lest their clearness should reveal too much supposing in short your mary had been not cold but modest not vacant but reflective not obtuse but sensitive not inane but innocent not prudish but purewould you have left her to court another woman for her wealth  mr yorke raised his hat wiped his forehead with his handkerchief  the moon is up was his first not quite relevant remark pointing with his whip across the moor there she is rising into the haze staring at us wi a strange red glower she is no more silver than old helstones brow is ivory what does she mean by leaning her cheek on rushedge i that way and looking at us wi a scowl and a menace  yorke if mary had loved you silently yet faithfully chastely yet fervently as you would wish your wife to love would you have left her  roberthe lifted his arm he held it suspended and pausedrobert this is a queer world and men are made of the queerest dregs that chaos churned up in her ferment i might swear sounding oathsoaths that would make the poachers think there was a bittern booming in bilberry mossthat in the case you put death only should have parted me from mary but i have lived in the world fiftyfive years i have been forced to study human nature and to speak a dark truth the odds are if mary had loved and not scorned me if i had been secure of her affection certain of her constancy been irritated by no doubts stung by no humiliationsthe odds are he let his hand fall heavy on the saddlethe odds are i should have left her  they rode side by side in silence ere either spoke again they were on the other side of rushedge briarfield lights starred the purple skirt of the moor robert being the youngest and having less of the past to absorb him than his comrade recommenced first  i believei daily find it provedthat we can get nothing in this world worth keeping not so much as a principle or a conviction except out of purifying flame or through strengthening peril we err we fall we are humbled then we walk more carefully we greedily eat and drink poison out of the gilded cup of vice or from the beggars wallet of avarice we are sickened degraded everything good in us rebels against us our souls rise bitterly indignant against our bodies there is a period of civil war if the soul has strength it conquers and rules thereafter  what art thou going to do now robert what are thy plans  for my private plans ill keep them to myselfwhich is very easy as at present i have none no private life is permitted a man in my positiona man in debt for my public plans my views are a little altered while i was in birmingham i looked a little into reality considered closely and at their source the causes of the present troubles of this country i did the same in london unknown i could go where i pleased mix with whom i would i went where there was want of food of fuel of clothing where there was no occupation and no hope i saw some with naturally elevated tendencies and good feelings kept down amongst sordid privations and harassing griefs i saw many originally low and to whom lack of education left scarcely anything but animal wants disappointed in those wants ahungered athirst and desperate as famished animals i saw what taught my brain a new lesson and filled my breast with fresh feelings i have no intention to profess more softness or sentiment than i have hitherto professed mutiny and ambition i regard as i have always regarded them i should resist a riotous mob just as heretofore i should open on the scent of a runaway ringleader as eagerly as ever and run him down as relentlessly and follow him up to condign punishment as rigorously but i should do it now chiefly for the sake and the security of those he misled something there is to look to yorke beyond a mans personal interest beyond the advancement of welllaid schemes beyond even the discharge of dishonouring debts to respect himself a man must believe he renders justice to his fellowmen unless i am more considerate to ignorance more forbearing to suffering than i have hitherto been i shall scorn myself as grossly unjustwhat now he said addressing his horse which hearing the ripple of water and feeling thirsty turned to a wayside trough where the moonbeam was playing in a crystal eddy  yorke pursued moore ride on i must let him drink  yorke accordingly rode slowly forwards occupying himself as he advanced in discriminating amongst the many lights now spangling the distance those of briarmains stilbro moor was left behind plantations rose dusk on either hand they were descending the hill below them lay the valley with its populous parish they felt already at home  surrounded no longer by heath it was not startling to mr yorke to see a hat rise and to hear a voice speak behind the wall the words however were peculiar  when the wicked perisheth there is shouting it said and added as the whirlwind passeth so is the wicked no more with a deeper growl terrors take hold of him as waters hell is naked before him he shall die without knowledge  a fierce flash and sharp crack violated the calm of night yorke ere he turned knew the four convicts of birmingham were avenged     chapter xxxi  uncle and niece   the die was cast sir philip nunnely knew it shirley knew it mr sympson knew it that evening when all the fieldhead family dined at nunnely priory decided the business  two or three things conduced to bring the baronet to a point he had observed that miss keeldar looked pensive and delicate this new phase in her demeanour smote him on his weak or poetic side a spontaneous sonnet brewed in his brain and while it was still working there one of his sisters persuaded his ladylove to sit down to the piano and sing a balladone of sir philips own ballads it was the least elaborate the least affectedout of all comparison the best of his numerous efforts  it chanced that shirley the moment before had been gazing from a window down on the park she had seen that stormy moonlight which le professeur louis was perhaps at the same instant contemplating from her own oakparlour lattice she had seen the isolated trees of the domainbroad strong spreading oaks and hightowering heroic beecheswrestling with the gale her ear had caught the full roar of the forest lower down the swift rushing of clouds the moon to the eye hasting swifter still had crossed her vision she turned from sight and soundtouched if not rapt wakened if not inspired  she sang as requested there was much about love in the balladfaithful love that refused to abandon its object love that disaster could not shake love that in calamity waxed fonder in poverty clung closer the words were set to a fine old air in themselves they were simple and sweet perhaps when read they wanted force when well sung they wanted nothing shirley sang them well she breathed into the feeling softness she poured round the passion force her voice was fine that evening its expression dramatic she impressed all and charmed one  on leaving the instrument she went to the fire and sat down on a seatsemistool semicushion the ladies were round her none of them spoke the misses sympson and the misses nunnely looked upon her as quiet poultry might look on an egret an ibis or any other strange fowl what made her sing so they never sang so was it proper to sing with such expression with such originalityso unlike a schoolgirl decidedly not it was strange it was unusual what was strange must be wrong what was unusual must be improper shirley was judged  moreover old lady nunnely eyed her stonily from her great chair by the fireside her gaze said this woman is not of mine or my daughters kind i object to her as my sons wife  her son catching the look read its meaning he grew alarmed what he so wished to win there was danger he might lose he must make haste  the room they were in had once been a picturegallery sir philips fathersir moncktonhad converted it into a saloon but still it had a shadowy longwithdrawing look a deep recess with a windowa recess that held one couch one table and a fairy cabinetformed a room within a room two persons standing there might interchange a dialogue and so it were neither long nor loud none be the wiser  sir philip induced two of his sisters to perpetrate a duet he gave occupation to the misses sympson the elder ladies were conversing together he was pleased to remark that meantime shirley rose to look at the pictures he had a tale to tell about one ancestress whose dark beauty seemed as that of a flower of the south he joined her and began to tell it  there were mementoes of the same lady in the cabinet adorning the recess and while shirley was stooping to examine the missal and the rosary on the inlaid shelf and while the misses nunnely indulged in a prolonged screech guiltless of expression pure of originality perfectly conventional and absolutely unmeaning sir philip stooped too and whispered a few hurried sentences at first miss keeldar was struck so still you might have fancied that whisper a charm which had changed her to a statue but she presently looked up and answered they parted miss keeldar returned to the fire and resumed her seat the baronet gazed after her then went and stood behind his sisters mr sympsonmr sympson onlyhad marked the pantomime  that gentleman drew his own conclusions had he been as acute as he was meddling as profound as he was prying he might have found that in sir philips face whereby to correct his inference ever shallow hasty and positive he went home quite cockahoop  he was not a man that kept secrets well when elate on a subject he could not avoid talking about it the next morning having occasion to employ his sons tutor as his secretary he must needs announce to him in mouthing accents and with much flimsy pomp of manner that he had better hold himself prepared for a return to the south at an early day as the important business which had detained him mr sympson so long in yorkshire was now on the eve of fortunate completion his anxious and laborious efforts were likely at last to be crowned with the happiest success a truly eligible addition was about to be made to the family connections  in sir philip nunnely louis moore conjectured  whereupon mr sympson treated himself simultaneously to a pinch of snuff and a chuckling laugh checked only by a sudden choke of dignity and an order to the tutor to proceed with business  for a day or two mr sympson continued as bland as oil but also he seemed to sit on pins and his gait when he walked emulated that of a hen treading a hot girdle he was for ever looking out of the window and listening for chariotwheels bluebeards wifesiseras motherwere nothing to him he waited when the matter should be opened in form when himself should be consulted when lawyers should be summoned when settlement discussions and all the delicious worldly fuss should pompously begin  at last there came a letter he himself handed it to miss keeldar out of the bag he knew the handwriting he knew the crest on the seal he did not see it opened and read for shirley took it to her own room nor did he see it answered for she wrote her reply shut up and was very long about itthe best part of a day he questioned her whether it was answered she responded yes  again he waitedwaited in silence absolutely not daring to speak kept mute by something in shirleys facea very awful somethinginscrutable to him as the writing on the wall to belshazzar he was moved more than once to call daniel in the person of louis moore and to ask an interpretation but his dignity forbade the familiarity daniel himself perhaps had his own private difficulties connected with that baffling bit of translation he looked like a student for whom grammars are blank and dictionaries dumb                                       mr sympson had been out to while away an anxious hour in the society of his friends at de walden hall he returned a little sooner than was expected his family and miss keeldar were assembled in the oak parlour addressing the latter he requested her to step with him into another room he wished to have with her a strictly private interview  she rose asking no questions and professing no surprise  very well sir she said in the tone of a determined person who is informed that the dentist is come to extract that large double tooth of his from which he has suffered such a purgatory this month past she left her sewing and her thimble in the windowseat and followed her uncle where he led  shut into the drawingroom the pair took seats each in an armchair placed opposite a few yards between them  i have been to de walden hall said mr sympson he paused miss keeldars eyes were on the pretty whiteandgreen carpet that information required no response she gave none  i have learned he went on slowlyi have learned a circumstance which surprises me  resting her cheek on her forefinger she waited to be told what circumstance  it seems that nunnely priory is shut upthat the family are gone back to their place in shire it seems that the baronetthat the baronetthat sir philip himself has accompanied his mother and sisters  indeed said shirley  may i ask if you share the amazement with which i received this news  no sir  is it news to you  yes sir  i meani mean pursued mr sympson now fidgeting in his chair quitting his hitherto brief and tolerably clear phraseology and returning to his customary wordy confused irritable stylei mean to have a thorough explanation i will not be put off iishall insist on being heard and onon having my own way my questions must be answered i will have clear satisfactory replies i am not to be trifled with silence  it is a strange and an extraordinary thinga very singulara most odd thing i thought all was right knew no other and therethe family are gone  i suppose sir they had a right to go  sir philip is gone with emphasis  shirley raised her brows bon voyage said she  this will not do this must be altered maam  he drew his chair forward he pushed it back he looked perfectly incensed and perfectly helpless  come come now uncle expostulated shirley do not begin to fret and fume or we shall make no sense of the business ask me what you want to know i am as willing to come to an explanation as you i promise you truthful replies  i wanti demand to know miss keeldar whether sir philip has made you an offer  he has  you avow it  i avow it but now go on consider that point settled  he made you an offer that night we dined at the priory  it is enough to say that he made it go on  he proposed in the recessin the room that used to be a picturegallerythat sir monckton converted into it saloon  no answer  you were both examining a cabinet i saw it all my sagacity was not at faultit never is subsequently you received a letter from him on what subjectof what nature were the contents  no matter  maam is that the way in which you speak to me  shirleys foot tapped quick on the carpet  there you sit silent and sullenyou who promised truthful replies  sir i have answered you thus far proceed  i should like to see that letter  you cannot see it  i must and shall maam i am your guardian  having ceased to be a ward i have no guardian  ungrateful being reared by me as my own daughter  once more uncle have the kindness to keep to the point let us both remain cool for my part i do not wish to get into a passion but you know once drive me beyond certain bounds i care little what i sayi am not then soon checked listen you have asked me whether sir philip made me an offer that question is answered what do you wish to know next  i desire to know whether you accepted or refused him and know it i will  certainly you ought to know it i refused him  refused him youyou shirley keeldar refused sir philip nunnely  i did  the poor gentleman bounced from his chair and first rushed and then trotted through the room  there it is there it is there it is  sincerely speaking i am sorry uncle you are so disappointed  concession contrition never do any good with some people instead of softening and conciliating they but embolden and harden them of that number was mr sympson  i disappointed what is it to me have i an interest in it you would insinuate perhaps that i have motives  most people have motives of some sort for their actions  she accuses me to my face i that have been a parent to her she charges with bad motives  bad motives i did not say  and now you prevaricate you have no principles  uncle you tire me i want to go away  go you shall not i will be answered what are your intentions miss keeldar  in what respect  in respect of matrimony  to be quiet and to do just as i please  just as you please the words are to the last degree indecorous  mr sympson i advise you not to become insulting you know i will not bear that  you read french your mind is poisoned with french novels you have imbibed french principles  the ground you are treading now returns a mighty hollow sound under your feet beware  it will end in infamy sooner or later i have foreseen it all along  do you assert sir that something in which i am concerned will end in infamy  that it willthat it will you said just now you would act as you please you acknowledge no rulesno limitations  silly stuff and vulgar as silly  regardless of decorum you are prepared to fly in the face of propriety  you tire me uncle  what madamwhat could be your reasons for refusing sir philip  at last there is another sensible question i shall be glad to reply to it sir philip is too young for me i regard him as a boy all his relationshis mother especiallywould be annoyed if he married me such a step would embroil him with them i am not his equal in the worlds estimation  is that all  our dispositions are not compatible  why a more amiable gentleman never breathed  he is very amiablevery excellenttruly estimable but not my masternot in one point i could not trust myself with his happiness i would not undertake the keeping of it for thousands i will accept no hand which cannot hold me in check  i thought you liked to do as you please you are vastly inconsistent  when i promise to obey it shall be under the conviction that i can keep that promise i could not obey a youth like sir philip besides he would never command me he would expect me always to ruleto guideand i have no taste whatever for the office  you no taste for swaggering and subduing and ordering and ruling  not my husband only my uncle  where is the difference  there is a slight differencethat is certain and i know full well any man who wishes to live in decent comfort with me as a husband must be able to control me  i wish you had a real tyrant  a tyrant would not hold me for a day not for an hour i would rebelbreak from himdefy him  are you not enough to bewilder ones brain with your selfcontradiction  it is evident i bewilder your brain  you talk of sir philip being young he is twoandtwenty  my husband must be thirty with the sense of forty  you had better pick out some old mansome whiteheaded or baldheaded swain  no thank you  you could lead some doting fool you might pin him to your apron  i might do that with a boy but it is not my vocation did i not say i prefer a masterone in whose presence i shall feel obliged and disposed to be good one whose control my impatient temper must acknowledge a man whose approbation can reward whose displeasure punish me a man i shall feel it impossible not to love and very possible to fear  what is there to hinder you from doing all this with sir philip he is a baroneta man of rank property connections far above yours if you talk of intellect he is a poethe writes verses which you i take it cannot do with all your cleverness  neither his title wealth pedigree nor poetry avail to invest him with the power i describe these are featherweights they want ballast a measure of sound solid practical sense would have stood him in better stead with me  you and henry rave about poetry you used to catch fire like tinder on the subject when you were a girl  o uncle there is nothing really valuable in this world there is nothing glorious in the world to come that is not poetry  marry a poet then in gods name  show him me and i will  sir philip  not at all you are almost as good a poet as he  madam you are wandering from the point  indeed uncle i wanted to do so and i shall be glad to lead you away with me do not let us get out of temper with each other it is not worth while  out of temper miss keeldar i should be glad to know who is out of temper  i am not yet  if you mean to insinuate that i am i consider that you are guilty of impertinence  you will be soon if you go on at that rate  there it is with your pert tongue you would try the patience of a job  i know i should  no levity miss this is not a laughing matter it is an affair i am resolved to probe thoroughly convinced that there is mischief at the bottom you described just now with far too much freedom for your years and sex the sort of individual you would prefer as a husband pray did you paint from the life  shirley opened her lips but instead of speaking she only glowed rosered  i shall have an answer to that question affirmed mr sympson assuming vast courage and consequence on the strength of this symptom of confusion  it was an historical picture uncle from several originals  several originals bless my heart  i have been in love several times  this is cynical  with heroes of many nations  what next  and philosophers  she is mad  dont ring the bell uncle you will alarm my aunt  your poor dear aunt what a niece has she  once i loved socrates  pooh no trifling maam  i admired themistocles leonidas epaminondas  miss keeldar  to pass over a few centuries washington was a plain man but i liked him but to speak of the actual present  ah the actual present  to quit crude schoolgirl fancies and come to realities  realities that is the test to which you shall be brought maam  to avow before what altar i now kneelto reveal the present idol of my soul  you will make haste about it if you please it is near luncheon time and confess you shall  confess i must my heart is full of the secret it must be spoken i only wish you were mr helstone instead of mr sympson you would sympathize with me better  madam it is a question of common sense and common prudence not of sympathy and sentiment and so on did you say it was mr helstone  not precisely but as near as may be they are rather alike  i will know the name i will have particulars  they positively are rather alike their very faces are not dissimilara pair of human falconsand dry direct decided both but my hero is the mightier of the two his mind has the clearness of the deep sea the patience of its rocks the force of its billows  rant and fustian  i dare say he can be harsh as a sawedge and gruff as a hungry raven  miss keeldar does the person reside in briarfield answer me that  uncle i am going to tell you his name is trembling on my tongue  speak girl  that was well said uncle speak girl it is quite tragic england has howled savagely against this man uncle and she will one day roar exultingly over him he has been unscared by the howl and he will be unelated by the shout  i said she was mad she is  this country will change and change again in her demeanour to him he will never change in his duty to her come cease to chafe uncle ill tell you his name  you shall tell me or  listen arthur wellesley lord wellington  mr sympson rose up furious he bounced out of the room but immediately bounced back again shut the door and resumed his seat  maam you shall tell me this will your principles permit you to marry a man without moneya man below you  never a man below me  in a high voice will you miss keeldar marry a poor man  what right have you mr sympson to ask me  i insist upon knowing  you dont go the way to know  my family respectability shall not be compromised  a good resolution keep it  madam it is you who shall keep it  impossible sir since i form no part of your family  do you disown us  i disdain your dictatorship  whom will you marry miss keeldar  not mr sam wynne because i scorn him not sir philip nunnely because i only esteem him  whom have you in your eye  four rejected candidates  such obstinacy could not be unless you were under improper influence  what do you mean there are certain phrases potent to make my blood boil improper influence what old womans cackle is that  are you a young lady  i am a thousand times better i am an honest woman and as such i will be treated  do you know leaning mysteriously forward and speaking with ghastly solemnitydo you know the whole neighbourhood teems with rumours respecting you and a bankrupt tenant of yours the foreigner moore  does it  it does your name is in every mouth  it honours the lips it crosses and i wish to the gods it may purify them  is it that person who has power to influence you  beyond any whose cause you have advocated  is it he you will marry  he is handsome and manly and commanding  you declare it to my face the flemish knave the low trader  he is talented and venturous and resolute prince is on his brow and ruler in his bearing  she glories in it she conceals nothing no shame no fear  when we speak the name of moore shame should be forgotten and fear discarded the moores know only honour and courage  i say she is mad  you have taunted me till my blood is up you have worried me till i turn again  that moore is the brother of my sons tutor would you let the usher call you sister  bright and broad shone shirleys eye as she fixed it on her questioner now  no no not for a province of possession not for a century of life  you cannot separate the husband from his family  what then  mr louis moores sister you will be  mr sympson i am sick at heart with all this weak trash i will bear no more your thoughts are not my thoughts your aims are not my aims your gods are not my gods we do not view things in the same light we do not measure them by the same standard we hardly speak in the same tongue let us part  it is not she resumed much excitedit is not that i hate you you are a good sort of man perhaps you mean well in your way but we cannot suit we are ever at variance you annoy me with small meddling with petty tyranny you exasperate my temper and make and keep me passionate as to your small maxims your narrow rules your little prejudices aversions dogmas bundle them off mr sympson go offer them a sacrifice to the deity you worship ill none of them i wash my hands of the lot i walk by another creed light faith and hope than you  another creed i believe she is an infidel  an infidel to your religion an atheist to your god  anatheist  your god sir is the world in my eyes you too if not an infidel are an idolater i conceive that you ignorantly worship in all things you appear to me too superstitious sir your god your great bel your fishtailed dagon rises before me as a demon you and such as you have raised him to a throne put on him a crown given him a sceptre behold how hideously he governs see him busied at the work he likes bestmaking marriages he binds the young to the old the strong to the imbecile he stretches out the arm of mezentius and fetters the dead to the living in his realm there is hatredsecret hatred there is disgustunspoken disgust there is treacheryfamily treachery there is vicedeep deadly domestic vice in his dominions children grow unloving between parents who have never loved infants are nursed on deception from their very birth they are reared in an atmosphere corrupt with lies your god rules at the bridal of kings look at your royal dynasties your deity is the deity of foreign aristocracies analyze the blue blood of spain your god is the hymen of france what is french domestic life all that surrounds him hastens to decay all declines and degenerates under his sceptre your god is a masked death  this language is terrible my daughters and you must associate no longer miss keeldar there is danger in such companionship had i known you a little earlierbut extraordinary as i thought you i could not have believed  now sir do you begin to be aware that it is useless to scheme for me that in doing so you but sow the wind to reap the whirlwind i sweep your cobweb projects from my path that i may pass on unsullied i am anchored on a resolve you cannot shake my heart my conscience shall dispose of my handthey only know this at last  mr sympson was becoming a little bewildered  never heard such language he muttered again and again never was so addressed in my lifenever was so used  you are quite confused sir you had better withdraw or i will  he rose hastily we must leave this place they must pack up at once  do not hurry my aunt and cousins give them time  no more intercourse shes not proper  he made his way to the door he came back for his handkerchief he dropped his snuffbox leaving the contents scattered on the carpet he stumbled out tartar lay outside across the mat mr sympson almost fell over him in the climax of his exasperation he hurled an oath at the dog and a coarse epithet at his mistress  poor mr sympson he is both feeble and vulgar said shirley to herself my head aches and i am tired she added and leaning her head upon a cushion she softly subsided from excitement to repose one entering the room a quarter of an hour afterwards found her asleep when shirley had been agitated she generally took this natural refreshment it would come at her call  the intruder paused in her unconscious presence and said miss keeldar  perhaps his voice harmonized with some dream into which she was passing it did not startle it hardly roused her without opening her eyes she but turned her head a little so that her cheek and profile before hidden by her arm became visible she looked rosy happy half smiling but her eyelashes were wet she had wept in slumber or perhaps before dropping asleep a few natural tears had fallen after she had heard that epithet no manno womanis always strong always able to bear up against the unjust opinion the vilifying word calumny even from the mouth of a fool will sometimes cut into unguarded feelings shirley looked like a child that had been naughty and punished but was now forgiven and at rest  miss keeldar again said the voice this time it woke her she looked up and saw at her side louis moorenot close at her side but standing with arrested step two or three yards from her  o mr moore she said i was afraid it was my uncle again he and i have quarrelled  mr sympson should let you alone was the reply can he not see that you are as yet far from strong  i assure you he did not find me weak i did not cry when he was here  he is about to evacuate fieldheadso he says he is now giving orders to his family he has been in the schoolroom issuing commands in a manner which i suppose was a continuation of that with which he has harassed you  are you and henry to go  i believe as far as henry is concerned that was the tenor of his scarcely intelligible directions but he may change all tomorrow he is just in that mood when you cannot depend on his consistency for two consecutive hours i doubt whether he will leave you for weeks yet to myself he addressed some words which will require a little attention and comment byandby when i have time to bestow on them at the moment he came in i was busied with a note i had got from mr yorkeso fully busied that i cut short the interview with him somewhat abruptly i left him raving here is the note i wish you to see it it refers to my brother robert and he looked at shirley  i shall be glad to hear news of him is he coming home  he is come he is in yorkshire mr yorke went yesterday to stilbro to meet him  mr moore something is wrong  did my voice tremble he is now at briarmains and i am going to see him  what has occurred  if you turn so pale i shall be sorry i have spoken it might have been worse robert is not dead but much hurt  o sir it is you who are pale sit down near me  read the note let me open it  miss keeldar read the note it briefly signified that last night robert moore had been shot at from behind the wall of milldean plantation at the foot of the brow that he was wounded severely but it was hoped not fatally of the assassin or assassins nothing was known they had escaped no doubt mr yorke observed it was done in revenge it was a pity illwill had ever been raised but that could not be helped now  he is my only brother said louis as shirley returned the note i cannot hear unmoved that ruffians have laid in wait for him and shot him down like some wild beast from behind a wall  be comforted be hopeful he will get betteri know he will  shirley solicitous to soothe held her hand over mr moores as it lay on the arm of the chair she just touched it lightly scarce palpably  well give me your hand he said it will be for the first time it is in a moment of calamity give it me  awaiting neither consent nor refusal he took what he asked  i am going to briarmains now he went on i want you to step over to the rectory and tell caroline helstone what has happened will you do this she will hear it best from you  immediately said shirley with docile promptitude ought i to say that there is no danger  say so  you will come back soon and let me know more  i will either come or write  trust me for watching over caroline i will communicate with your sister too but doubtless she is already with robert  doubtless or will be soon goodmorning now  you will bear up come what may  we shall see that  shirleys fingers were obliged to withdraw from the tutors louis was obliged to relinquish that hand folded clasped hidden in his own  i thought i should have had to support her he said as he walked towards briarmains and it is she who has made me strong that look of pity that gentle touch no down was ever softer no elixir more potent it lay like a snowflake it thrilled like lightning a thousand times i have longed to possess that handto have it in mine i have possessed it for five minutes i held it her fingers and mine can never be strangers more having met once they must meet again     chapter xxxii  the schoolboy and the woodnymph   briarmains being nearer than the hollow mr yorke had conveyed his young comrade there he had seen him laid in the best bed of the house as carefully as if he had been one of his own sons the sight of his blood welling from the treacherously inflicted wound made him indeed the son of the yorkshire gentlemans heart the spectacle of the sudden event of the tall straight shape prostrated in its pride across the road of the fine southern head laid low in the dust of that youth in prime flung at once before him pallid lifeless helplessthis was the very combination of circumstances to win for the victim mr yorkes liveliest interest  no other hand was there to raiseto aid no other voice to question kindly no other brain to concert measures he had to do it all himself this utter dependence of the speechless bleeding youth as a youth he regarded him on his benevolence secured that benevolence most effectually well did mr yorke like to have power and to use it he had now between his hands power over a fellowcreatures life it suited him  no less perfectly did it suit his saturnine better half the incident was quite in her way and to her taste some women would have been terrorstruck to see a gory man brought in over their threshold and laid down in their hall in the howe of the night there you would suppose was subjectmatter for hysterics no mrs yorke went into hysterics when jessie would not leave the garden to come to her knitting or when martin proposed starting for australia with a view to realize freedom and escape the tyranny of matthew but an attempted murder near her doora halfmurdered man in her best bedset her straight cheered her spirits gave her cap the dash of a turban  mrs yorke was just the woman who while rendering miserable the drudging life of a simple maidservant would nurse like a heroine a hospital full of plague patients she almost loved moore her tough heart almost yearned towards him when she found him committed to her chargeleft in her arms as dependent on her as her youngestborn in the cradle had she seen a domestic or one of her daughters give him a draught of water or smooth his pillow she would have boxed the intruders ears she chased jessie and rose from the upper realm of the house she forbade the housemaids to set their foot in it  now if the accident had happened at the rectory gates and old helstone had taken in the martyr neither yorke nor his wife would have pitied him they would have adjudged him right served for his tyranny and meddling as it was he became for the present the apple of their eye  strange louis moore was permitted to cometo sit down on the edge of the bed and lean over the pillow to hold his brothers hand and press his pale forehead with his fraternal lips and mrs yorke bore it well she suffered him to stay half the day there she once suffered him to sit up all night in the chamber she rose herself at five oclock of a wet november morning and with her own hands lit the kitchen fire and made the brothers a breakfast and served it to them herself majestically arrayed in a boundless flannel wrapper a shawl and her nightcap she sat and watched them eat as complacently as a hen beholds her chickens feed yet she gave the cook warning that day for venturing to make and carry up to mr moore a basin of sagogruel and the housemaid lost her favour because when mr louis was departing she brought him his surtout aired from the kitchen and like a forward piece as she was helped him on with it and accepted in return a smile a thank you my girl and a shilling two ladies called one day pale and anxious and begged earnestly humbly to be allowed to see mr moore one instant mrs yorke hardened her heart and sent them packingnot without opprobrium  but how was it when hortense moore came not so bad as might have been expected the whole family of the moores really seemed to suit mrs yorke so as no other family had ever suited her hortense and she possessed an exhaustless mutual theme of conversation in the corrupt propensities of servants their views of this class were similar they watched them with the same suspicion and judged them with the same severity hortense too from the very first showed no manner of jealousy of mrs yorkes attentions to robertshe let her keep the post of nurse with little interference and for herself found ceaseless occupation in fidgeting about the house holding the kitchen under surveillance reporting what passed there and in short making herself generally useful visitors they both of them agreed in excluding sedulously from the sickroom they held the young millowner captive and hardly let the air breathe or the sun shine on him  mr macturk the surgeon to whom moores case had been committed pronounced his wound of a dangerous but he trusted not of a hopeless character at first he wished to place with him a nurse of his own selection but this neither mrs yorke nor hortense would hear of they promised faithful observance of directions he was left therefore for the present in their hands  doubtless they executed the trust to the best of their ability but something got wrong the bandages were displaced or tampered with great loss of blood followed macturk being summoned came with steed afoam he was one of those surgeons whom it is dangerous to vexabrupt in his best moods in his worst savage on seeing moores state he relieved his feelings by a little flowery language with which it is not necessary to strew the present page a bouquet or two of the choicest blossoms fell on the unperturbed head of one mr graves a stony young assistant he usually carried about with him with a second nosegay he gifted another young gentleman in his trainan interesting facsimile of himself being indeed his own son but the full corbeille of blushing bloom fell to the lot of meddling womankind en masse  for the best part of one winter night himself and satellites were busied about moore there at his bedside shut up alone with him in his chamber they wrought and wrangled over his exhausted frame they three were on one side of the bed and death on the other the conflict was sharp it lasted till day broke when the balance between the belligerents seemed so equal that both parties might have claimed the victory  at dawn graves and young macturk were left in charge of the patient while the senior went himself in search of additional strength and secured it in the person of mrs horsfall the best nurse on his staff to this woman he gave moore in charge with the sternest injunctions respecting the responsibility laid on her shoulders she took this responsibility stolidly as she did also the easychair at the bedhead that moment she began her reign  mrs horsfall had one virtueorders received from macturk she obeyed to the letter the ten commandments were less binding in her eyes than her surgeons dictum in other respects she was no woman but a dragon hortense moore fell effaced before her mrs yorke withdrewcrushed yet both these women were personages of some dignity in their own estimation and of some bulk in the estimation of others perfectly cowed by the breadth the height the bone and the brawn of mrs horsfall they retreated to the back parlour she for her part sat upstairs when she liked and downstairs when she preferred it she took her dram three times a day and her pipe of tobacco four times  as to moore no one now ventured to inquire about him mrs horsfall had him at drynurse it was she who was to do for him and the general conjecture now ran that she did for him accordingly  morning and evening macturk came to see him his case thus complicated by a new mischance was become one of interest in the surgeons eyes he regarded him as a damaged piece of clockwork which it would be creditable to his skill to set agoing again graves and young macturkmoores sole other visitorscontemplated him in the light in which they were wont to contemplate the occupant for the time being of the dissectingroom at stilbro infirmary  robert moore had a pleasant time of itin pain in danger too weak to move almost too weak to speak a sort of giantess his keeper the three surgeons his sole society thus he lay through the diminishing days and lengthening nights of the whole drear month of november  in the commencement of his captivity moore used feebly to resist mrs horsfall he hated the sight of her rough bulk and dreaded the contact of her hard hands but she taught him docility in a trice she made no account whatever of his six feet his manly thews and sinews she turned him in his bed as another woman would have turned a babe in its cradle when he was good she addressed him as my dear and honey and when he was bad she sometimes shook him did he attempt to speak when macturk was there she lifted her hand and bade him hush like a nurse checking a forward child if she had not smoked if she had not taken gin it would have been better he thought but she did both once in her absence he intimated to macturk that that woman was a dramdrinker  pooh my dear sir they are all so was the reply he got for his pains but horsfall has this virtue added the surgeondrunk or sober she always remembers to obey me                                       at length the latter autumn passed its fogs its rains withdrew from england their mourning and their tears its winds swept on to sigh over lands far away behind november came deep winterclearness stillness frost accompanying  a calm day had settled into a crystalline evening the world wore a north pole colouring all its lights and tints looked like the refletsa of white or violet or pale green gems the hills wore a lilac blue the setting sun had purple in its red the sky was ice all silvered azure when the stars rose they were of white crystal not gold gray or cerulean or faint emerald huescool pure and transparenttinged the mass of the landscape      a find me an english word as good reader and i will gladly         dispense with the french word reflections wont do  what is this by itself in a wood no longer green no longer even russet a wood neutral tintthis dark blue moving object why it is a schoolboya briarfield grammarschool boywho has left his companions now trudging home by the highroad and is seeking a certain tree with a certain mossy mound at its root convenient as a seat why is he lingering here the air is cold and the time wears late he sits down what is he thinking about does he feel the chaste charm nature wears tonight a pearlwhite moon smiles through the gray trees does he care for her smile  impossible to say for he is silent and his countenance does not speak as yet it is no mirror to reflect sensation but rather a mask to conceal it this boy is a stripling of fifteenslight and tall of his years in his face there is as little of amenity as of servility his eye seems prepared to note any incipient attempt to control or overreach him and the rest of his features indicate faculties alert for resistance wise ushers avoid unnecessary interference with that lad to break him in by severity would be a useless attempt to win him by flattery would be an effort worse than useless he is best let alone time will educate and experience train him  professedly martin yorke it is a young yorke of course tramples on the name of poetry talk sentiment to him and you would be answered by sarcasm here he is wandering alone waiting duteously on nature while she unfolds a page of stern of silent and of solemn poetry beneath his attentive gaze  being seated he takes from his satchel a booknot the latin grammar but a contraband volume of fairy tales there will be light enough yet for an hour to serve his keen young vision besides the moon waits on him her beam dim and vague as yet fills the glade where he sits  he reads he is led into a solitary mountain region all round him is rude and desolate shapeless and almost colourless he hears bells tinkle on the wind forthriding from the formless folds of the mist dawns on him the brightest visiona greenrobed lady on a snowwhite palfrey he sees her dress her gems and her steed she arrests him with some mysterious question he is spellbound and must follow her into fairyland  a second legend bears him to the seashore there tumbles in a strong tide boiling at the base of dizzy cliffs it rains and blows a reef of rocks black and rough stretches far into the sea all along and among and above these crags dash and flash sweep and leap swells wreaths drifts of snowy spray some lone wanderer is out on these rocks treading with cautious step the wet wild seaweed glancing down into hollows where the brine lies fathoms deep and emerald clear and seeing there wilder and stranger and huger vegetation than is found on land with treasure of shellssome green some purple some pearlyclustered in the curls of the snaky plants he hears a cry looking up and forward he sees at the bleak point of the reef a tall pale thingshaped like man but made of spraytransparent tremulous awful it stands not alone they are all human figures that wanton in the rocksa crowd of foamwomena band of white evanescent nereids  hush shut the book hide it in the satchel martin hears a tread he listens noyes once more the dead leaves lightly crushed rustle on the wood path martin watches the trees part and a woman issues forth  she is a lady dressed in dark silk a veil covering her face martin never met a lady in this wood beforenor any female save now and then a village girl come to gather nuts tonight the apparition does not displease him he observes as she approaches that she is neither old nor plain but on the contrary very youthful and but that he now recognizes her for one whom he has often wilfully pronounced ugly he would deem that he discovered traits of beauty behind the thin gauze of that veil  she passes him and says nothing he knew she would all women are proud monkeys and he knows no more conceited doll than that caroline helstone the thought is hardly hatched in his mind when the lady retraces those two steps she had got beyond him and raising her veil reposes her glance on his face while she softly asks are you one of mr yorkes sons  no human evidence would ever have been able to persuade martin yorke that he blushed when thus addressed yet blush he did to the ears  i am he said bluntly and encouraged himself to wonder superciliously what would come next  you are martin i think was the observation that followed  it could not have been more felicitous it was a simple sentencevery artlessly a little timidly pronounced but it chimed in harmony to the youths nature it stilled him like a note of music  martin had a keen sense of his personality he felt it right and sensible that the girl should discriminate him from his brothers like his father he hated ceremony it was acceptable to hear a lady address him as martin and not mr martin or master martin which form would have lost her his good graces for ever worse if possible than ceremony was the other extreme of slipshod familiarity the slight tone of bashfulness the scarcely perceptible hesitation was considered perfectly in place  i am martin he said  are your father and mother well it was lucky she did not say papa and mamma that would have undone all and rose and jessie  i suppose so  my cousin hortense is still at briarmains  oh yes  martin gave a comic halfsmile and demigroan the halfsmile was responded to by the lady who could guess in what sort of odour hortense was likely to be held by the young yorkes  does your mother like her  they suit so well about the servants they cant help liking each other  it is cold tonight  why are you out so late  i lost my way in this wood  now indeed martin allowed himself a refreshing laugh of scorn  lost your way in the mighty forest of briarmains you deserve never more to find it  i never was here before and i believe i am trespassing now you might inform against me if you chose martin and have me fined it is your fathers wood  i should think i knew that but since you are so simple as to lose your way i will guide you out  you need not i have got into the track now i shall be right martin a little quickly how is mr moore  martin had heard certain rumours it struck him that it might be amusing to make an experiment  going to die nothing can save him all hope flung overboard  she put her veil aside she looked into his eyes and said to die  to die all along of the women my mother and the rest they did something about his bandages that finished everything he would have got better but for them i am sure they should be arrested cribbed tried and brought in for botany bay at the very least  the questioner perhaps did nor hear this judgment she stood motionless in two minutes without another word she moved forwards no goodnight no further inquiry this was not amusing nor what martin had calculated on he expected something dramatic and demonstrative it was hardly worth while to frighten the girl if she would not entertain him in return he called miss helstone  she did not hear or turn he hastened after and overtook her  come are you uneasy about what i said  you know nothing about death martin you are too young for me to talk to concerning such a thing  did you believe me its all flummery moore eats like three men they are always making sago or tapioca or something good for him i never go into the kitchen but there is a saucepan on the fire cooking him some dainty i think i will play the old soldier and be fed on the fat of the land like him  martin martin here her voice trembled and she stopped  it is exceedingly wrong of you martin you have almost killed me  again she stopped she leaned against a tree trembling shuddering and as pale as death  martin contemplated her with inexpressible curiosity in one sense it was as he would have expressed it nuts to him to see this it told him so much and he was beginning to have a great relish for discovering secrets in another sense it reminded him of what he had once felt when he had heard a blackbird lamenting for her nestlings which matthew had crushed with a stone and that was not a pleasant feeling unable to find anything very appropriate to say in order to comfort her he began to cast about in his mind what he could do he smiled the lads smile gave wondrous transparency to his physiognomy  eureka he cried ill set all straight byandby you are better now miss caroline walk forward he urged  not reflecting that it would be more difficult for miss helstone than for himself to climb a wall or penetrate a hedge he piloted her by a short cut which led to no gate the consequence was he had to help her over some formidable obstacles and while he railed at her for helplessness he perfectly liked to feel himself of use  martin before we separate assure me seriously and on your word of honour that mr moore is better  how very much you think of that moore  nobutmany of his friends may ask me and i wish to be able to give an authentic answer  you may tell them he is well enough only idle you may tell them that he takes mutton chops for dinner and the best of arrowroot for supper i intercepted a basin myself one night on its way upstairs and ate half of it  and who waits on him martin who nurses him  nurses him the great baby why a woman as round and big as our largest waterbutta rough hardfavoured old girl i make no doubt she leads him a rich life nobody else is let near him he is chiefly in the dark it is my belief she knocks him about terribly in that chamber i listen at the wall sometimes when i am in bed and i think i hear her thumping him you should see her fist she could hold half a dozen hands like yours in her one palm after all notwithstanding the chops and jellies he gets i would not be in his shoes in fact it is my private opinion that she eats most of what goes up on the tray to mr moore i wish she may not be starving him  profound silence and meditation on carolines part and a sly watchfulness on martins  you never see him i suppose martin  i no i dont care to see him for my own part  silence again  did not you come to our house once with mrs pryor about five weeks since to ask after him again inquired martin  yes  i dare say you wished to be shown upstairs  we did wish it we entreated it but your mother declined  ay she declined i heard it all she treated you as it is her pleasure to treat visitors now and then she behaved to you rudely and harshly  she was not kind for you know martin we are relations and it is natural we should take an interest in mr moore but here we must part we are at your fathers gate  very well what of that i shall walk home with you  they will miss you and wonder where you are  let them i can take care of myself i suppose  martin knew that he had already incurred the penalty of a lecture and dry bread for his tea no matter the evening had furnished him with an adventure it was better than muffins and toast  he walked home with caroline on the way he promised to see mr moore in spite of the dragon who guarded his chamber and appointed an hour on the next day when caroline was to come to briarmains wood and get tidings of him he would meet her at a certain tree the scheme led to nothing still he liked it  having reached home the dry bread and the lecture were duly administered to him and he was dismissed to bed at an early hour he accepted his punishment with the toughest stoicism  ere ascending to his chamber he paid a secret visit to the diningroom a still cold stately apartment seldom used for the family customarily dined in the back parlour he stood before the mantelpiece and lifted his candle to two pictures hung abovefemale heads one a type of serene beauty happy and innocent the other more lovely but forlorn and desperate  she looked like that he said gazing on the latter sketch when she sobbed turned white and leaned against the tree  i suppose he pursued when he was in his room and seated on the edge of his palletbedi suppose she is what they call in loveyes in love with that long thing in the next chamber whisht is that horsfall clattering him i wonder he does not yell out it really sounds as if she had fallen on him tooth and nail but i suppose she is making the bed i saw her at it once she hit into the mattresses as if she was boxing it is queer zillah they call her zillahzillah horsfall is a woman and caroline helstone is a woman they are two individuals of the same speciesnot much alike though is she a pretty girl that caroline i suspect she is very nice to look atsomething so clear in her face so soft in her eyes i approve of her looking at me it does me good she has long eyelashes their shadow seems to rest where she gazes and to instil peace and thought if she behaves well and continues to suit me as she has suited me today i may do her a good turn i rather relish the notion of circumventing my mother and that ogress old horsfall not that i like humouring moore but whatever i do ill be paid for and in coin of my own choosing i know what reward i will claimone displeasing to moore and agreeable to myself  he turned into bed     chapter xxxiii  martins tactics   it was necessary to the arrangement of martins plan that he should stay at home that day accordingly he found no appetite for breakfast and just about schooltime took a severe pain about his heart which rendered it advisable that instead of setting out to the grammar school with mark he should succeed to his fathers armchair by the fireside and also to his morning paper this point being satisfactorily settled and mark being gone to mr summers class and matthew and mr yorke withdrawn to the countinghouse three other exploitsnay fourremained to be achieved  the first of these was to realize the breakfast he had not yet tasted and with which his appetite of fifteen could ill afford to dispense the second third fourth to get his mother miss moore and mrs horsfall successfully out of the way before four oclock that afternoon  the first was for the present the most pressing since the work before him demanded an amount of energy which the present empty condition of his youthful stomach did not seem likely to supply  martin knew the way to the larder and knowing this way he took it the servants were in the kitchen breakfasting solemnly with closed doors his mother and miss moore were airing themselves on the lawn and discussing the closed doors aforesaid martin safe in the larder made fastidious selection from its stores his breakfast had been delayed he was determined it should be recherché it appeared to him that a variety on his usual somewhat insipid fare of bread and milk was both desirable and advisable the savoury and the salutary he thought might be combined there was store of rosy apples laid in straw upon a shelf he picked out three there was pastry upon a dish he selected an apricot puff and a damson tart on the plain household bread his eye did not dwell but he surveyed with favour some currant teacakes and condescended to make choice of one thanks to his claspknife he was able to appropriate a wing of fowl and a slice of ham a cantlet of cold custardpudding he thought would harmonize with these articles and having made this final addition to his booty he at length sallied forth into the hall  he was already halfway acrossthree steps more would have anchored him in the harbour of the back parlourwhen the front door opened and there stood matthew better far had it been the old gentleman in full equipage of horns hoofs and tail  matthew sceptic and scoffer had already failed to subscribe a prompt belief in that pain about the heart he had muttered some words amongst which the phrase shamming abraham had been very distinctly audible and the succession to the armchair and newspaper had appeared to affect him with mental spasms the spectacle now before himthe apples the tarts the teacakes the fowl ham and puddingoffered evidence but too well calculated to inflate his opinion of his own sagacity  martin paused interdit one minute one instant the next he knew his ground and pronounced all well with the true perspicacity des âmes élites he at once saw how this at first sight untoward event might be turned to excellent account he saw how it might be so handled as to secure the accomplishment of his second tasknamely the disposal of his mother he knew that a collision between him and matthew always suggested to mrs yorke the propriety of a fit of hysterics he further knew that on the principle of calm succeeding to storm after a morning of hysterics his mother was sure to indulge in an afternoon of bed this would accommodate him perfectly  the collision duly took place in the hall a dry laugh an insulting sneer a contemptuous taunt met by a nonchalant but most cutting reply were the signals they rushed at it martin who usually made little noise on these occasions made a great deal now in flew the servants mrs yorke miss moore no female hand could separate them mr yorke was summoned  sons said he one of you must leave my roof if this occurs again i will have no cain and abel strife here  martin now allowed himself to be taken off he had been hurt he was the youngest and slightest he was quite cool in no passion he even smiled content that the most difficult part of the labour he had set himself was over  once he seemed to flag in the course of the morning  it is not worth while to bother myself for that caroline he remarked but a quarter of an hour afterwards he was again in the diningroom looking at the head with dishevelled tresses and eyes turbid with despair  yes he said i made her sob shudder almost faint ill see her smile before ive done with her besides i want to outwit all these womenites  directly after dinner mrs yorke fulfilled her sons calculation by withdrawing to her chamber now for hortense  that lady was just comfortably settled to stockingmending in the back parlour when martinlaying down a book which stretched on the sofa he was still indisposed according to his own account he had been perusing in all the voluptuous ease of a yet callow pachalazily introduced some discourse about sarah the maid at the hollow in the course of much verbal meandering he insinuated information that this damsel was said to have three suitorsfrederic murgatroyd jeremiah pighills and johnofmallysofhannahsofdebs and that miss mann had affirmed she knew for a fact that now the girl was left in sole charge of the cottage she often had her swains to meals and entertained them with the best the house afforded  it needed no more hortense could not have lived another hour without betaking herself to the scene of these nefarious transactions and inspecting the state of matters in person mrs horsfall remained  martin master of the field now extracted from his mothers workbasket a bunch of keys with these he opened the sideboard cupboard produced thence a black bottle and a small glass placed them on the table nimbly mounted the stairs made for mr moores door tapped the nurse opened  if you please maam you are invited to step into the back parlour and take some refreshment you will not be disturbed the family are out  he watched her down he watched her in himself shut the door he knew she was safe  the hard work was done now for the pleasure he snatched his cap and away for the wood  it was yet but halfpast three it had been a fine morning but the sky looked dark now it was beginning to snow the wind blew cold the wood looked dismal the old tree grim yet martin approved the shadow on his path he found a charm in the spectral aspect of the doddered oak  he had to wait to and fro he walked while the flakes fell faster and the wind which at first had but moaned pitifully howled  she is long in coming he muttered as he glanced along the narrow track i wonder he subjoined what i wish to see her so much for she is not coming for me but i have power over her and i want her to come that i may use that power  he continued his walk  now he resumed when a further period had elapsed if she fails to come i shall hate and scorn her  it struck four he heard the church clock far away a step so quick so light that but for the rustling of leaves it would scarcely have sounded on the woodwalk checked his impatience the wind blew fiercely now and the thickening white storm waxed bewildering but on she came and not dismayed  well martin she said eagerly how is he  it is queer how she thinks of him reflected martin the blinding snow and bitter cold are nothing to her i believe yet she is but a chittyfaced creature as my mother would say i could find in my heart to wish i had a cloak to wrap her in  thus meditating to himself he neglected to answer miss helstone  you have seen him  no  oh you promised you would  i mean to do better by you than that didnt i say i dont care to see him  but now it will be so long before i get to know any thing certain about him and i am sick of waiting martin do see him and give him caroline helstones regards and say she wished to know how he was and if anything could be done for his comfort  i wont  you are changed you were so friendly last night  come we must not stand in this wood it is too cold  but before i go promise me to come again tomorrow with news  no such thing i am much too delicate to make and keep such appointments in the winter season if you knew what a pain i had in my chest this morning and how i went without breakfast and was knocked down besides youd feel the impropriety of bringing me here in the snow come i say  are you really delicate martin  dont i look so  you have rosy cheeks  thats hectic will you comeor you wont  where  with me i was a fool not to bring a cloak i would have made you cosy  you are going home my nearest road lies in the opposite direction  put your arm through mine ill take care of you  but the wallthe hedgeit is such hard work climbing and you are too slender and young to help me without hurting yourself  you shall go through the gate  but  but butwill you trust me or not  she looked into his face  i think i will anything rather than return as anxious as i came  i cant answer for that this however i promise you be ruled by me and you shall see moore yourself  see him myself  yourself  but dear martin does he know  ah im dear now no he doesnt know  and your mother and the others  all is right  caroline fell into a long silent fit of musing but still she walked on with her guide they came in sight of briarmains  have you made up your mind he asked  she was silent  decide we are just on the spot i wont see himthat i tell youexcept to announce your arrival  martin you are a strange boy and this is a strange step but all i feel is and has been for a long time strange i will see him  having said that you will neither hesitate nor retract  no  here we are then do not be afraid of passing the parlour window no one will see you my father and matthew are at the mill mark is at school the servants are in the back kitchen miss moore is at the cottage my mother in her bed and mrs horsfall in paradise observei need not ring i open the door the hall is empty the staircase quiet so is the gallery the whole house and all its inhabitants are under a spell which i will not break till you are gone  martin i trust you  you never said a better word let me take your shawl i will shake off the snow and dry it for you you are cold and wet never mind there is a fire upstairs are you ready  yes  follow me  he left his shoes on the mat mounted the stair unshod caroline stole after with noiseless step there was a gallery and there was a passage at the end of that passage martin paused before a door and tapped he had to tap twicethrice a voice known to one listener at last said come in  the boy entered briskly  mr moore a lady called to inquire after you none of the women were about it is washingday and the maids are over the crown of the head in soapsuds in the back kitchen so i asked her to step up  up here sir  up here sir but if you object she shall go down again  is this a place or am i a person to bring a lady to you absurd lad  no so ill take her off  martin you will stay here who is she  your grandmother from that château on the scheldt miss moore talks about  martin said the softest whisper at the door dont be foolish  is she there inquired moore hastily he had caught an imperfect sound  she is there fit to faint she is standing on the mat shocked at your want of filial affection  martin you are an evil cross between an imp and a page what is she like  more like me than you for she is young and beautiful  you are to show her forward do you hear  come miss caroline  miss caroline repeated moore  and when miss caroline entered she was encountered in the middle of the chamber by a tall thin wasted figure who took both her hands  i give you a quarter of an hour said martin as he withdrew no more say what you have to say in that time till it is past i will wait in the gallery nothing shall approach ill see you safe away should you persist in staying longer i leave you to your fate  he shut the door in the gallery he was as elate as a king he had never been engaged in an adventure he liked so well for no adventure had ever invested him with so much importance or inspired him with so much interest  you are come at last said the meagre man gazing on his visitress with hollow eyes  did you expect me before  for a month near two months we have been very near and i have been in sad pain and danger and misery cary  i could not come  couldnt you but the rectory and briarmains are very nearnot two miles apart  there was pain and there was pleasure in the girls face as she listened to these implied reproaches it was sweet it was bitter to defend herself  when i say i could not come i mean i could not see you for i came with mamma the very day we heard what had happened mr macturk then told us it was impossible to admit any stranger  but afterwardsevery fine afternoon these many weeks past i have waited and listened something here carylaying his hand on his breasttold me it was impossible but that you should think of me not that i merit thought but we are old acquaintancewe are cousins  i came again robert mamma and i came again  did you come that is worth hearing since you came again we will sit down and talk about it  they sat down caroline drew her chair up to his the air was now dark with snow an iceland blast was driving it wildly this pair neither heard the long wuthering rush nor saw the white burden it drifted each seemed conscious but of one thingthe presence of the other  so mamma and you came again  and mrs yorke did treat us strangely we asked to see you no said she not in my house i am at present responsible for his life it shall not be forfeited for half an hours idle gossip but i must not tell you all she said it was very disagreeable however we came yet againmamma miss keeldar and i this time we thought we should conquer as we were three against one and shirley was on our side but mrs yorke opened such a battery  moore smiled what did she say  things that astonished us shirley laughed at last i cried mamma was seriously annoyed we were all three driven from the field since that time i have only walked once a day past the house just for the satisfaction of looking up at your window which i could distinguish by the drawn curtains i really dared not come in  i have wished for you caroline  i did not know that i never dreamt one instant that you thought of me if i had but most distantly imagined such a possibility  mrs yorke would still have beaten you  she would not stratagem should have been tried if persuasion failed i would have come to the kitchen door the servants should have let me in and i would have walked straight upstairs in fact it was far more the fear of intrusionthe fear of yourselfthat baffled me than the fear of mrs yorke  only last night i despaired of ever seeing you again weakness has wrought terrible depression in meterrible depression  and you sit alone  worse than alone  but you must be getting better since you can leave your bed  i doubt whether i shall live i see nothing for it after such exhaustion but decline  youyou shall go home to the hollow  dreariness would accompany nothing cheerful come near me  i will alter this this shall be altered were there ten mrs yorkes to do battle with  cary you make me smile  do smile smile again shall i tell you what i should like  tell me anythingonly keep talking i am saul but for music i should perish  i should like you to be brought to the rectory and given to me and mamma  a precious gift i have not laughed since they shot me till now  do you suffer pain robert  not so much pain now but i am hopelessly weak and the state of my mind is inexpressibledark barren impotent do you not read it all in my face i look a mere ghost  altered yet i should have known you anywhere but i understand your feelings i experienced something like it since we met i too have been very ill  very ill  i thought i should die the tale of my life seemed told every night just at midnight i used to wake from awful dreams and the book lay open before me at the last page where was written finis i had strange feelings  you speak my experience  i believed i should never see you again and i grew so thinas thin as you are now i could do nothing for myselfneither rise nor lie down and i could not eat yet you see i am better  comfortersad as sweet i am too feeble to say what i feel but while you speak i do feel  here i am at your side where i thought never more to be here i speak to you i see you listen to me willinglylook at me kindly did i count on that i despaired  moore sigheda sigh so deep it was nearly a groan he covered his eyes with his hand  may i be spared to make some atonement  such was his prayer  and for what  we will not touch on it now cary unmanned as i am i have not the power to cope with such a topic was mrs pryor with you during your illness  yescaroline smiled brightlyyou know she is mamma  i have heardhortense told me but that tale too i will receive from yourself does she add to your happiness  what mamma she is dear to me how dear i cannot say i was altogether weary and she held me up  i deserve to hear that in a moment when i can scarce lift my hand to my head i deserve it  it is no reproach against you  it is a coal of fire heaped on my head and so is every word you address to me and every look that lights your sweet face come still nearer lina and give me your handif my thin fingers do not scare you  she took those thin fingers between her two little hands she bent her head et les effleura de ses lèvres i put that in french because the word effleurer is an exquisite word moore was much moved a large tear or two coursed down his hollow cheek  ill keep these things in my heart cary that kiss i will put by and you shall hear of it again one day  come out cried martin opening the doorcome away you have had twenty minutes instead of a quarter of an hour  she will not stir yet you hempseed  i dare not stay longer robert  can you promise to return  no she cant responded martin the thing mustnt become customary i cant be troubled its very well for once ill not have it repeated  youll not have it repeated  hush dont vex him we could not have met today but for him but i will come again if it is your wish that i should come  it is my wishmy one wishalmost the only wish i can feel  come this minute my mother has coughed got up set her feet on the floor let her only catch you on the stairs miss caroline youre not to bid him goodbyestepping between her and mooreyou are to march  my shawl martin  i have it ill put it on for you when you are in the hall  he made them part he would suffer no farewell but what could be expressed in looks he half carried caroline down the stairs in the hall he wrapped her shawl round her and but that his mothers tread then creaked in the gallery and but that a sentiment of diffidencethe proper natural therefore the noble impulse of his boys heartheld him back he would have claimed his reward he would have said now miss caroline for all this give me one kiss but ere the words had passed his lips she was across the snowy road rather skimming than wading the drifts  she is my debtor and i will be paid  he flattered himself that it was opportunity not audacity which had failed him he misjudged the quality of his own nature and held it for something lower than it was     chapter xxxiv  case of domestic persecutionremarkable instance of pious perseverance in the discharge of religious duties   martin having known the taste of excitement wanted a second draught having felt the dignity of power he loathed to relinquish it miss helstonethat girl he had always called ugly and whose face was now perpetually before his eyes by day and by night in dark and in sunshinehad once come within his sphere it fretted him to think the visit might never be repeated  though a schoolboy he was no ordinary schoolboy he was destined to grow up an original at a few years later date he took great pains to pare and polish himself down to the pattern of the rest of the world but he never succeeded an unique stamp marked him always he now sat idle at his desk in the grammar school casting about in his mind for the means of adding another chapter to his commenced romance he did not yet know how many commenced liferomances are doomed never to get beyond the first or at most the second chapter his saturday halfholiday he spent in the wood with his book of fairy legends and that other unwritten book of his imagination  martin harboured an irreligious reluctance to see the approach of sunday his father and mother while disclaiming community with the establishment failed not duly once on the sacred day to fill their large pew in briarfield church with the whole of their blooming family theoretically mr yorke placed all sects and churches on a level mrs yorke awarded the palm to moravians and quakers on account of that crown of humility by these worthies worn neither of them were ever known however to set foot in a conventicle  martin i say disliked sunday because the morning service was long and the sermon usually little to his taste this saturday afternoon however his woodland musings disclosed to him a newfound charm in the coming day  it proved a day of deep snowso deep that mrs yorke during breakfast announced her conviction that the children both boys and girls would be better at home and her decision that instead of going to church they should sit silent for two hours in the back parlour while rose and martin alternately read a succession of sermonsjohn wesleys sermons john wesley being a reformer and an agitator had a place both in her own and her husbands favour  rose will do as she pleases said martin not looking up from the book which according to his custom then and in afterlife he was studying over his bread and milk  rose will do as she is told and martin too observed the mother  i am going to church  so her son replied with the ineffable quietude of a true yorke who knows his will and means to have it and who if pushed to the wall will let himself be crushed to death provided no way of escape can be found but will never capitulate  it is not fit weather said the father  no answer the youth read studiously he slowly broke his bread and sipped his milk  martin hates to go to church but he hates still more to obey said mrs yorke  i suppose i am influenced by pure perverseness  yes you are  mother i am not  by what then are you influenced  by a complication of motives the intricacies of which i should as soon think of explaining to you as i should of turning myself inside out to exhibit the internal machinery of my frame  hear martin hear him cried mr yorke i must see and have this lad of mine brought up to the bar nature meant him to live by his tongue hesther your third son must certainly be a lawyer he has the stockintradebrass selfconceit and wordswordswords  some bread rose if you please requested martin with intense gravity serenity phlegm the boy had naturally a low plaintive voice which in his dour moods rose scarcely above a ladys whisper the more inflexibly stubborn the humour the softer the sadder the tone he rang the bell and gently asked for his walkingshoes  but martin urged his sire there is drift all the way a man could hardly wade through it however lad he continued seeing that the boy rose as the church bell began to toll this is a case wherein i would by no means balk the obdurate chap of his will go to church by all means there is a pitiless wind and a sharp frozen sleet besides the depth under foot go out into it since thou prefers it to a warm fireside  martin quietly assumed his cloak comforter and cap and deliberately went out  my father has more sense than my mother he pronounced how women miss it they drive the nail into the flesh thinking they are hammering away at insensate stone  he reached church early  now if the weather frightens her and it is a real december tempest or if that mrs pryor objects to her going out and i should miss her after all it will vex me but tempest or tornado hail or ice she ought to come and if she has a mind worthy of her eyes and features she will come she will be here for the chance of seeing me as i am here for the chance of seeing her she will want to get a word respecting her confounded sweetheart as i want to get another flavour of what i think the essence of lifea taste of existence with the spirit preserved in it and not evaporated adventure is to stagnation what champagne is to flat porter  he looked round the church was cold silent empty but for one old woman as the chimes subsided and the single bell tolled slowly another and another elderly parishioner came dropping in and took a humble station in the free sittings it is always the frailest the oldest and the poorest that brave the worst weather to prove and maintain their constancy to dear old mother church this wild morning not one affluent family attended not one carriage party appearedall the lined and cushioned pews were empty only on the bare oaken seats sat ranged the grayhaired elders and feeble paupers  ill scorn her if she doesnt come muttered martin shortly and savagely to himself the rectors shovelhat had passed the porch mr helstone and his clerk were in the vestry  the bells ceasedthe readingdesk was filledthe doors were closedthe service commenced void stood the rectory pewshe was not there martin scorned her  worthless thing vapid thing commonplace humbug like all other girlsweakly selfish shallow  such was martins liturgy  she is not like our picture her eyes are not large and expressive her nose is not straight delicate hellenic her mouth has not that charm i thought it had which i imagined could beguile me of sullenness in my worst moods what is she a threadpaper a doll a toy a girl in short  so absorbed was the young cynic he forgot to rise from his knees at the proper place and was still in an exemplary attitude of devotion when the litany over the first hymn was given out to be so caught did not contribute to soothe him he started up red for he was as sensitive to ridicule as any girl to make the matter worse the church door had reopened and the aisles were filling patter patter patter a hundred little feet trotted in it was the sunday scholars according to briarfield winter custom these children had till now been kept where there was a warm stove and only led into church just before the communion and sermon  the little ones were settled first and at last when the boys and the younger girls were all arrangedwhen the organ was swelling high and the choir and congregation were rising to uplift a spiritual songa tall class of young women came quietly in closing the procession their teacher having seen them seated passed into the rectory pew the frenchgray cloak and small beaver bonnet were known to martin it was the very costume his eyes had ached to catch miss helstone had not suffered the storm to prove an impediment after all she was come to church martin probably whispered his satisfaction to his hymn book at any rate he therewith hid his face two minutes  satisfied or not he had time to get very angry with her again before the sermon was over she had never once looked his way at least he had not been so lucky as to encounter a glance  if he saidif she takes no notice of me if she shows i am not in her thoughts i shall have a worse a meaner opinion of her than ever most despicable would it be to come for the sake of those sheepfaced sunday scholars and not for my sake or that long skeleton moores  the sermon found an end the benediction was pronounced the congregation dispersed she had not been near him  now indeed as martin set his face homeward he felt that the sleet was sharp and the east wind cold  his nearest way lay through some fields it was a dangerous because an untrodden way he did not care he would take it near the second stile rose a clump of trees was that an umbrella waiting there yes an umbrella held with evident difficulty against the blast behind it fluttered a frenchgray cloak martin grinned as he toiled up the steep encumbered field difficult to the foot as a slope in the upper realms of etna there was an inimitable look in his face when having gained the stile he seated himself coolly thereupon and thus opened a conference which for his own part he was willing to prolong indefinitely  i think you had better strike a bargain exchange me for mrs pryor  i was not sure whether you would come this way martin but i thought i would run the chance there is no such thing as getting a quiet word spoken in the church or churchyard  will you agreemake over mrs pryor to my mother and put me in her skirts  as if i could understand you what puts mrs pryor into your head  you call her mamma dont you  she is my mamma  not possibleor so inefficient so careless a mamma i should make a five times better one you may laugh i have no objection to see you laugh your teethi hate ugly teeth but yours are as pretty as a pearl necklace and a necklace of which the pearls are very fair even and well matched too  martin what now i thought the yorkes never paid compliments  they have not done till this generation but i feel as if it were my vocation to turn out a new variety of the yorke species i am rather tired of my own ancestors we have traditions going back for four agestales of hiram which was the son of hiram which was the son of samuel which was the son of john which was the son of zerubbabel yorke all from zerubbabel down to the last hiram were such as you see my father before that there was a godfrey we have his picture it hangs in moores bedroom it is like me of his character we know nothing but i am sure it was different to his descendants he has long curling dark hair he is carefully and cavalierly dressed having said that he is like me i need not add that he is handsome  you are not handsome martin  no but wait awhilejust let me take my time i mean to begin from this day to cultivate to polish and we shall see  you are a very strange a very unaccountable boy martin but dont imagine you ever will be handsome you cannot  i mean to try but we were talking about mrs pryor she must be the most unnatural mamma in existence coolly to let her daughter come out in this weather mine was in such a rage because i would go to church she was fit to fling the kitchen brush after me  mamma was very much concerned about me but i am afraid i was obstinate i would go  to see me  exactly i thought of nothing else i greatly feared the snow would hinder you from coming you dont know how pleased i was to see you all by yourself in the pew  i came to fulfil my duty and set the parish a good example and so you were obstinate were you i should like to see you obstinate i should wouldnt i have you in good discipline if i owned you let me take the umbrella  i cant stay two minutes our dinner will be ready  and so will ours and we have always a hot dinner on sundays roast goose today with applepie and ricepudding i always contrive to know the bill of fare well i like these things uncommonly but ill make the sacrifice if you will  we have a cold dinner my uncle will allow no unnecessary cooking on the sabbath but i must return the house would be in commotion if i failed to appear  so will briarmains bless you i think i hear my father sending out the overlooker and five of the dyers to look in six directions for the body of his prodigal son in the snow and my mother repenting her of her many misdeeds towards me now i am gone  martin how is mr moore  that is what you came for just to say that word  come tell me quickly  hang him he is no worse but as illused as evermewed up kept in solitary confinement they mean to make either an idiot or a maniac of him and take out a commission of lunacy horsfall starves him you saw how thin he was  you were very good the other day martin  what day i am always gooda model  when will you be so good again  i see what you are after but youll not wheedle mei am no catspaw  but it must be done it is quite a right thing and a necessary thing  how you encroach remember i managed the matter of my own free will before  and you will again  i wont the business gave me far too much trouble i like my ease  mr moore wishes to see me martin and i wish to see him  i dare say coolly  it is too bad of your mother to exclude his friends  tell her so  his own relations  come and blow her up  you know that would advance nothing well i shall stick to my point see him i will if you wont help me ill manage without help  do there is nothing like selfreliance selfdependence  i have no time to reason with you now but i consider you provoking goodmorning  away she went the umbrella shut for she could not carry it against the wind  she is not vapid she is not shallow said martin i shall like to watch and mark how she will work her way without help if the storm were not of snow but of firesuch as came refreshingly down on the cities of the plainshe would go through it to procure five minutes speech of that moore now i consider i have had a pleasant morning the disappointments got time on the fears and fits of anger only made that short discourse pleasanter when it came at last she expected to coax me at once shell not manage that in one effort she shall come again again and yet again it would please me to put her in a passionto make her cry i want to discover how far she will gowhat she will do and dareto get her will it seems strange and new to find one human being thinking so much about another as she thinks about moore but it is time to go home my appetite tells me the hour wont i walk into that goose and well try whether matthew or i shall get the largest cut of the applepie today     chapter xxxv  wherein matters make some progress but not much   martin had planned well he had laid out a dexterously concerted scheme for his private amusement but older and wiser schemers than he are often doomed to see their finestspun projects swept to annihilation by the sudden broom of fate that fell housewife whose red arm none can control in the present instance this broom was manufactured out of the tough fibres of moores own stubborn purpose bound tight with his will he was now resuming his strength and making strange head against mrs horsfall each morning he amazed that matron with a fresh astonishment first he discharged her from her valet duties he would dress himself then he refused the coffee she brought him he would breakfast with the family lastly he forbade her his chamber on the same day amidst the outcries of all the women in the place he put his head out of doors the morning after he followed mr yorke to his countinghouse and requested an envoy to fetch a chaise from the red house inn he was resolved he said to return home to the hollow that very afternoon mr yorke instead of opposing aided and abetted him the chaise was sent for though mrs yorke declared the step would be his death it came moore little disposed to speak made his purse do duty for his tongue he expressed his gratitude to the servants and to mrs horsfall by the chink of his coin the latter personage approved and understood this language perfectly it made amends for all previous contumacy she and her patient parted the best friends in the world  the kitchen visited and soothed moore betook himself to the parlour he had mrs yorke to appease not quite so easy a task as the pacification of her housemaids there she sat plunged in sullen dudgeon the gloomiest speculations on the depths of mans ingratitude absorbing her thoughts he drew near and bent over her she was obliged to look up if it were only to bid him avaunt there was beauty still in his pale wasted features there was earnestness and a sort of sweetnessfor he was smilingin his hollow eyes  goodbye he said and as he spoke the smile glittered and melted he had no iron mastery of his sensations now a trifling emotion made itself apparent in his present weak state  and what are you going to leave us for she asked we will keep you and do anything in the world for you if you will only stay till you are stronger  goodbye he again said and added you have been a mother to me give your wilful son one embrace  like a foreigner as he was he offered her first one cheek then the other she kissed him  what a troublewhat a burden i have been to you he muttered  you are the worst trouble now headstrong youth was the answer i wonder who is to nurse you at hollows cottage your sister hortense knows no more about such matters than a child  thank god for i have had nursing enough to last me my life  here the little girls came injessie crying rose quiet but grave moore took them out into the hall to soothe pet and kiss them he knew it was not in their mothers nature to bear to see any living thing caressed but herself she would have felt annoyed had he fondled a kitten in her presence  the boys were standing about the chaise as moore entered it but for them he had no farewell to mr yorke he only said you have a good riddance of me that was an unlucky shot for you yorke it turned briarmains into an hospital come and see me at the cottage soon  he drew up the glass the chaise rolled away in half an hour he alighted at his own garden wicket having paid the driver and dismissed the vehicle he leaned on that wicket an instant at once to rest and to muse  six months ago i passed out at this gate said he a proud angry disappointed man i come back sadder and wiser weakly enough but not worried a cold gray yet quiet world lies rounda world where if i hope little i fear nothing all slavish terrors of embarrassment have left me let the worst come i can work as joe scott does for an honourable living in such doom i yet see some hardship but no degradation formerly pecuniary ruin was equivalent in my eyes to personal dishonour it is not so now i know the difference ruin is an evil but one for which i am prepared the day of whose coming i know for i have calculated i can yet put it off six monthsnot an hour longer if things by that time alter which is not probable if fetters which now seem indissoluble should be loosened from our trade of all things the most unlikely to happen i might conquer in this long struggle yeti mightgood god what might i not do but the thought is a brief madness let me see things with sane eyes ruin will come lay her axe to my fortunes roots and hew them down i shall snatch a sapling i shall cross the sea and plant it in american woods louis will go with me will none but louis go i cannot telli have no right to ask  he entered the house  it was afternoon twilight yet out of doorsstarless and moonless twilight for though keenly freezing with a dry black frost heaven wore a mask of clouds congealed and fast locked the milldam too was frozen the hollow was very still indoors it was already dark sarah had lit a good fire in the parlour she was preparing tea in the kitchen  hortense said moore as his sister bustled up to help him off with his cloak i am pleased to come home  hortense did not feel the peculiar novelty of this expression coming from her brother who had never before called the cottage his home and to whom its narrow limits had always heretofore seemed rather restrictive than protective still whatever contributed to his happiness pleased her and she expressed herself to that effect  he sat down but soon rose again he went to the window he came back to the fire  hortense  mon frère  this little parlour looks very clean and pleasantunusually bright somehow  it is true brother i have had the whole house thoroughly and scrupulously cleaned in your absence  sister i think on this first day of your return home you ought to have a friend or so to tea if it were only to see how fresh and spruce you have made the little place  true brother if it were not late i might send for miss mann  so you might but it really is too late to disturb that good lady and the evening is much too cold for her to come out  how thoughtful in you dear gérard we must put it off till another day  i want some one today dear sistersome quiet guest who would tire neither of us  miss ainley  an excellent person they say but she lives too far off tell harry scott to step up to the rectory with a request from you that caroline helstone should come and spend the evening with you  would it not be better tomorrow dear brother  i should like her to see the place as it is just now its brilliant cleanliness and perfect neatness are so much to your credit  it might benefit her in the way of example  it might and must she ought to come  he went into the kitchen  sarah delay tea half an hour he then commissioned her to dispatch harry scott to the rectory giving her a twisted note hastily scribbled in pencil by himself and addressed miss helstone  scarcely had sarah time to get impatient under the fear of damage to her toast already prepared when the messenger returned and with him the invited guest  she entered through the kitchen quietly tripped up sarahs stairs to take off her bonnet and furs and came down as quietly with her beautiful curls nicely smoothed her graceful merino dress and delicate collar all trim and spotless her gay little workbag in her hand she lingered to exchange a few kindly words with sarah and to look at the new tortoiseshell kitten basking on the kitchen hearth and to speak to the canarybird which a sudden blaze from the fire had startled on its perch and then she betook herself to the parlour  the gentle salutation the friendly welcome were interchanged in such tranquil sort as befitted cousins meeting a sense of pleasure subtle and quiet as a perfume diffused itself through the room the newlykindled lamp burnt up bright the tray and the singing urn were brought in  i am pleased to come home repeated mr moore  they assembled round the table hortense chiefly talked she congratulated caroline on the evident improvement in her health her colour and her plump cheeks were returning she remarked it was true there was an obvious change in miss helstone all about her seemed elastic depression fear forlornness were withdrawn no longer crushed and saddened and slow and drooping she looked like one who had tasted the cordial of hearts ease and been lifted on the wing of hope  after tea hortense went upstairs she had not rummaged her drawers for a month past and the impulse to perform that operation was now become resistless during her absence the talk passed into carolines hands she took it up with ease she fell into her best tone of conversation a pleasing facility and elegance of language gave fresh charm to familiar topics a new music in the always soft voice gently surprised and pleasingly captivated the listener unwonted shades and lights of expression elevated the young countenance with character and kindled it with animation  caroline you look as if you had heard good tidings said moore after earnestly gazing at her for some minutes  do i  i sent for you this evening that i might be cheered but you cheer me more than i had calculated  i am glad of that and i really cheer you  you look brightly move buoyantly speak musically  it is pleasant to be here again  truly it is pleasant i feel it so and to see health on your cheek and hope in your eye is pleasant cary but what is this hope and what is the source of this sunshine i perceive about you  for one thing i am happy in mamma i love her so much and she loves me long and tenderly she nursed me now when her care has made me well i can occupy myself for and with her all the day i say it is my turn to attend to her and i do attend to her i am her waitingwoman as well as her child i likeyou would laugh if you knew what pleasure i have in making dresses and sewing for her she looks so nice now robert i will not let her be oldfashioned and then she is charming to talk tofull of wisdom ripe in judgment rich in information exhaustless in stores her observant faculties have quietly amassed every day that i live with her i like her better i esteem her more highly i love her more tenderly  that for one thing then cary you talk in such a way about mamma it is enough to make one jealous of the old lady  she is not old robert  of the young lady then  she does not pretend to be young  well of the matron but you said mammas affection was one thing that made you happy now for the other thing  i am glad you are better  what besides  i am glad we are friends  you and i  yes i once thought we never should be  cary some day i mean to tell you a thing about myself that is not to my credit and consequently will not please you  ah dont i cannot bear to think ill of you  and i cannot bear that you should think better of me than i deserve  well but i half know your thing indeed i believe i know all about it  you do not  i believe i do  whom does it concern besides me  she coloured she hesitated she was silent  speak cary whom does it concern  she tried to utter a name and could not  tell me there is none present but ourselves be frank  but if i guess wrong  i will forgive whisper cary  he bent his ear to her lips still she would not or could not speak clearly to the point seeing that moore waited and was resolved to hear something she at last said miss keeldar spent a day at the rectory about a week since the evening came on very wintry and we persuaded her to stay all night  and you and she curled your hair together  how do you know that  and then you chattered and she told you  it was not at curlinghair time so you are not as wise as you think and besides she didnt tell me  you slept together afterwards  we occupied the same room and bed we did not sleep much we talked the whole night through  ill be sworn you did and then it all came outtant pis i would rather you had heard it from myself  you are quite wrong she did not tell me what you suspectshe is not the person to proclaim such things but yet i inferred something from parts of her discourse i gathered more from rumour and i made out the rest by instinct  but if she did not tell you that i wanted to marry her for the sake of her money and that she refused me indignantly and scornfully you need neither start nor blush nor yet need you prick your trembling fingers with your needle that is the plain truth whether you like it or notif such was not the subject of her august confidences on what point did they turn you say you talked the whole night through what about  about things we never thoroughly discussed before intimate friends as we have been but you hardly expect i should tell you  yes yes cary you will tell me you said we were friends and friends should always confide in each other  but you are sure you wont repeat it  quite sure  not to louis  not even to louis what does louis care for young ladies secrets  robert shirley is a curious magnanimous being  i dare say i can imagine there are both odd points and grand points about her  i have found her chary in showing her feelings but when they rush out riverlike and pass full and powerful before youalmost without leave from heryou gaze wonder you admire andi thinklove her  you saw this spectacle  yes at dead of night when all the house was silent and starlight and the cold reflection from the snow glimmered in our chamber then i saw shirleys heart  her hearts core do you think she showed you that  her hearts core  and how was it  like a shrine for it was holy like snow for it was pure like flame for it was warm like death for it was strong  can she love tell me that  what think you  she has loved none that have loved her yet  who are those that have loved her  he named a list of gentlemen closing with sir philip nunnely  she has loved none of these  yet some of them were worthy of a womans affection  of some womens but not of shirleys  is she better than others of her sex  she is peculiar and more dangerous to take as a wiferashly  i can imagine that  she spoke of you  oh she did i thought you denied it  she did not speak in the way you fancy but i asked her and i would make her tell me what she thought of you or rather how she felt towards you i wanted to know i had long wanted to know  so had i but let us hear she thinks meanly she feels contemptuously doubtless  she thinks of you almost as highly as a woman can think of a man you know she can be eloquent i yet feel in fancy the glow of the language in which her opinion was conveyed  but how does she feel  till you shocked her she said you had shocked her but she would not tell me how she felt as a sister feels towards a brother of whom she is at once fond and proud  ill shock her no more cary for the shock rebounded on myself till i staggered again but that comparison about sister and brother is all nonsense she is too rich and proud to entertain fraternal sentiments for me  you dont know her robert and somehow i fancy now i had other ideas formerly that you cannot know her you and she are not so constructed as to be able thoroughly to understand each other  it may be so i esteem her i admire her and yet my impressions concerning her are harshperhaps uncharitable i believe for instance that she is incapable of love  shirley incapable of love  that she will never marry i imagine her jealous of compromising her pride of relinquishing her power of sharing her property  shirley has hurt your amour propre  she did hurt it though i had not an emotion of tenderness nor a spark of passion for her  then robert it was very wicked in you to want to marry her  and very mean my little pastor my pretty priestess i never wanted to kiss miss keeldar in my life though she has fine lips scarlet and round as ripe cherries or if i did wish it it was the mere desire of the eye  i doubt now whether you are speaking the truth the grapes or the cherries are sourhung too high  she has a pretty figure a pretty face beautiful hair i acknowledge all her charms and feel none of them or only feel them in a way she would disdain i suppose i was truly tempted by the mere gilding of the bait caroline what a noble fellow your robert isgreat good disinterested and then so pure  but not perfect he made a great blunder once and we will hear no more about it  and shall we think no more about it cary shall we not despise him in our heartgentle but just compassionate but upright  never we will remember that with what measure we mete it shall be measured unto us and so we will give no scorn only affection  which wont satisfy i warn you of that something besides affectionsomething far stronger sweeter warmerwill be demanded one day is it there to give  caroline was moved much moved  be calm lina said moore soothingly i have no intention because i have no right to perturb your mind now nor for months to come dont look as if you would leave me we will make no more agitating allusions we will resume our gossip do not tremble look me in the face see what a poor pale grim phantom i ammore pitiable than formidable  she looked shyly there is something formidable still pale as you are she said as her eye fell under his  to return to shirley pursued moore is it your opinion that she is ever likely to marry  she loves  platonicallytheoreticallyall humbug  she loves what i call sincerely  did she say so  i cannot affirm that she said so no such confession as i love this man or that passed her lips  i thought not  but the feeling made its way in spite of her and i saw it she spoke of one man in a strain not to be misunderstood her voice alone was sufficient testimony having wrung from her an opinion on your character i demanded a second opinion ofanother person about whom i had my conjectures though they were the most tangled and puzzled conjectures in the world i would make her speak i shook her i chid her i pinched her fingers when she tried to put me off with gibes and jests in her queer provoking way and at last out it came the voice i say was enough hardly raised above a whisper and yet such a soft vehemence in its tones there was no confession no confidence in the matter to these things she cannot condescend but i am sure that mans happiness is dear to her as her own life  who is it  i charged her with the fact she did not deny she did not avow but looked at me i saw her eyes by the snowgleam it was quite enough i triumphed over her mercilessly  what right had you to triumph do you mean to say you are fancy free  whatever i am shirley is a bondswoman lioness she has found her captor mistress she may be of all round her but her own mistress she is not  so you exulted at recognizing a fellowslave in one so fair and imperial  i did robert you say right in one so fair and imperial  you confess ita fellowslave  i confess nothing but i say that haughty shirley is no more free than was hagar  and who pray is the abraham the hero of a patriarch who has achieved such a conquest  you still speak scornfully and cynically and sorely but i will make you change your note before i have done with you  we will see that can she marry this cupidon  cupidon he is just about as much a cupidon as you are a cyclops  can she marry him  you will see  i want to know his name cary  guess it  is it any one in this neighbourhood  yes in briarfield parish  then it is some person unworthy of her i dont know a soul in briarfield parish her equal  guess  impossible i suppose she is under a delusion and will plunge into some absurdity after all  caroline smiled  do you approve the choice asked moore  quite quite  then i am puzzled for the head which owns this bounteous fall of hazel curls is an excellent little thinking machine most accurate in its working it boasts a correct steady judgment inherited from mamma i suppose  and i quite approve and mamma was

doris not that the jargon well sit down quietly and guess your riddle  but mamma charmedtheres the puzzle  ill tell you what mamma said when i told her depend upon it my dear such a choice will make

been flirting with miss mann she showed me the other day a plant you had given herfanny i am ready     chapter xxxvi  written in the schoolroom   louis moores doubts respecting the immediate evacuation of fieldhead by mr sympson turned out to be perfectly well founded the very next day after the grand quarrel about sir philip nunnely a sort of reconciliation was patched up between uncle and niece shirley who could never find it in her heart to be or to seem inhospitable except in the single instance of mr donne begged the whole party to stay a little longer she begged in such earnest it was evident she wished it for some reason they took her at her word indeed the uncle could not bring himself to leave her quite unwatchedat full liberty to marry robert moore as soon as that gentleman should be able mr sympson piously prayed this might never be the case to reassert his supposed pretensions to her hand they all stayed  in his first rage against all the house of moore mr sympson had so conducted himself towards mr louis that that gentlemanpatient of labour or suffering but intolerant of coarse insolencehad promptly resigned his post and could now be induced to resume and retain it only till such time as the family should quit yorkshire mrs sympsons entreaties prevailed with him thus far his own attachment to his pupil constituted an additional motive for concession and probably he had a third motive stronger than either of the other two probably he would have found it very hard indeed to leave fieldhead just now  things went on for some time pretty smoothly miss keeldars health was reestablished her spirits resumed their flow moore had found means to relieve her from every nervous apprehension and indeed from the moment of giving him her confidence every fear seemed to have taken wing her heart became as lightsome her manner as careless as those of a little child that thoughtless of its own life or death trusts all responsibility to its parents he and william farrenthrough whose medium he made inquiries concerning the state of phœbeagreed in asserting that the dog was not mad that it was only illusage which had driven her from home for it was proved that her master was in the frequent habit of chastising her violently their assertion might or might not be true the groom and gamekeeper affirmed to the contraryboth asserting that if hers was not a clear case of hydrophobia there was no such disease but to this evidence louis moore turned an incredulous ear he reported to shirley only what was encouraging she believed him and right or wrong it is certain that in her case the bite proved innocuous  november passed december came the sympsons were now really departing it was incumbent on them to be at home by christmas their packages were preparing they were to leave in a few days one winter evening during the last week of their stay louis moore again took out his little blank book and discoursed with it as follows                                       she is lovelier than ever since that little cloud was dispelled all the temporary waste and wanness have vanished it was marvellous to see how soon the magical energy of youth raised her elastic and revived her blooming  after breakfast this morning when i had seen her and listened to her and so to speak felt her in every sentient atom of my frame i passed from her sunny presence into the chill drawingroom taking up a little gilt volume i found it to contain a selection of lyrics i read a poem or two whether the spell was in me or in the verse i know not but my heart filled genially my pulse rose i glowed notwithstanding the frost air i too am young as yet though she said she never considered me young i am barely thirty there are moments when life for no other reason than my own youth beams with sweet hues upon me  it was time to go to the schoolroom i went that same schoolroom is rather pleasant in a morning the sun then shines through the low lattice the books are in order there are no papers strewn about the fire is clear and clean no cinders have fallen no ashes accumulated i found henry there and he had brought with him miss keeldar they were together  i said she was lovelier than ever she is a fine rose not deep but delicate opens on her cheek her eye always dark clear and speaking utters now a language i cannot render it is the utterance seen not heard through which angels must have communed when there was silence in heaven her hair was always dusk as night and fine as silk her neck was always fair flexible polished but both have now a new charm the tresses are soft as shadow the shoulders they fall on wear a goddess grace once i only saw her beauty now i feel it  henry was repeating his lesson to her before bringing it to me one of her hands was occupied with the book he held the other that boy gets more than his share of privileges he dares caress and is caressed what indulgence and compassion she shows him too much if this went on henry in a few years when his soul was formed would offer it on her altar as i have offered mine  i saw her eyelid flitter when i came in but she did not look up now she hardly ever gives me a glance she seems to grow silent too to me she rarely speaks and when i am present she says little to others in my gloomy moments i attribute this change to indifference aversion what not in my sunny intervals i give it another meaning i say were i her equal i could find in this shyness coyness and in that coyness love as it is dare i look for it what could i do with it if found  this morning i dared at least contrive an hours communion for her and me i dared not only wish but will an interview with her i dared summon solitude to guard us very decidedly i called henry to the door without hesitation i said go where you will my boy but till i call you return not here  henry i could see did not like his dismissal that boy is young but a thinker his meditative eye shines on me strangely sometimes he half feels what links me to shirley he half guesses that there is a dearer delight in the reserve with which i am treated than in all the endearments he is allowed the young lame halfgrown lion would growl at me now and then because i have tamed his lioness and am her keeper did not the habit of discipline and the instinct of affection hold him subdued go henry you must learn to take your share of the bitter of life with all of adams race that have gone before or will come after you your destiny can be no exception to the common lot be grateful that your love is overlooked thus early before it can claim any affinity to passion an hours fret a pang of envy suffice to express what you feel jealousy hot as the sun above the line rage destructive as the tropic storm the clime of your sensations ignoresas yet  i took my usual seat at the desk quite in my usual way i am blessed in that power to cover all inward ebullition with outward calm no one who looks at my slow face can guess the vortex sometimes whirling in my heart and engulfing thought and wrecking prudence pleasant is it to have the gift to proceed peacefully and powerfully in your course without alarming by one eccentric movement it was not my present intention to utter one word of love to her or to reveal one glimpse of the fire in which i wasted presumptuous i never have been presumptuous i never will be rather than even seem selfish and interested i would resolutely rise gird my loins part and leave her and seek on the other side of the globe a new life cold and barren as the rock the salt tide daily washes my design this morning was to take of her a near scrutinyto read a line in the page of her heart before i left i determined to know what i was leaving  i had some quills to make into pens most mens hands would have trembled when their hearts were so stirred mine went to work steadily and my voice when i called it into exercise was firm  this day week you will be alone at fieldhead miss keeldar  yes i rather think my uncles intention to go is a settled one now  he leaves you dissatisfied  he is not pleased with me  he departs as he cameno better for his journey this is mortifying  i trust the failure of his plans will take from him all inclination to lay new ones  in his way mr sympson honestly wished you well all he has done or intended to do he believed to be for the best  you are kind to undertake the defence of a man who has permitted himself to treat you with so much insolence  i never feel shocked at or bear malice for what is spoken in character and most perfectly in character was that vulgar and violent onset against me when he had quitted you worsted  you cease now to be henrys tutor  i shall be parted from henry for a while if he and i live we shall meet again somehow for we love each other and be ousted from the bosom of the sympson family for ever happily this change does not leave me stranded it but hurries into premature execution designs long formed  no change finds you off your guard i was sure in your calm way you would be prepared for sudden mutation i always think you stand in the world like a solitary but watchful thoughtful archer in a wood and the quiver on your shoulder holds more arrows than one your bow is provided with a second string such too is your brothers wont you two might go forth homeless hunters to the loneliest western wilds all would be well with you the hewn tree would make you a hut the cleared forest yield you fields from its stripped bosom the buffalo would feel your rifleshot and with lowered horns and hump pay homage at your feet  and any indian tribe of blackfeet or flatheads would afford us a bride perhaps  no hesitating i think not the savage is sordid i thinkthat is i hopeyou would neither of you share your hearth with that to which you could not give your heart  what suggested the wild west to your mind miss keeldar have you been with me in spirit when i did not see you have you entered into my daydreams and beheld my brain labouring at its scheme of a future  she had separated a slip of paper for lighting tapersa spill as it is calledinto fragments she threw morsel by morsel into the fire and stood pensively watching them consume she did not speak  how did you learn what you seem to know about my intentions  i know nothing i am only discovering them now i spoke at hazard  your hazard sounds like divination a tutor i will never be again never take a pupil after henry and yourself not again will i sit habitually at another mans tableno more be the appendage of a family i am now a man of thirty i have never been free since i was a boy of ten i have such a thirst for freedom such a deep passion to know her and call her mine such a daydesire and nightlonging to win her and possess her i will not refuse to cross the atlantic for her sake her i will follow deep into virgin woods mine it shall not be to accept a savage girl as a slaveshe could not be a wife i know no white woman whom i love that would accompany me but i am certain liberty will await me sitting under a pine when i call her she will come to my loghouse and she shall fill my arms  she could not hear me speak so unmoved and she was moved it was righti meant to move her she could not answer me nor could she look at me i should have been sorry if she could have done either her cheek glowed as if a crimson flower through whose petals the sun shone had cast its light upon it on the white lid and dark lashes of her downcast eye trembled all that is graceful in the sense of halfpainful halfpleasing shame  soon she controlled her emotion and took all her feelings under command i saw she had felt insurrection and was waking to empire she sat down there was that in her face which i could read it said i see the line which is my limit nothing shall make me pass it i feeli know how far i may reveal my feelings and when i must clasp the volume i have advanced to a certain distance as far as the true and sovereign and undegraded nature of my kind permits now here i stand rooted my heart may break if it is baffled let it break it shall never dishonour me it shall never dishonour my sisterhood in me suffering before degradation death before treachery  i for my part said if she were poor i would be at her feet if she were lowly i would take her in my arms her gold and her station are two griffins that guard her on each side love looks and longs and dares not passion hovers round and is kept at bay truth and devotion are scared there is nothing to lose in winning her no sacrifice to make it is all clear gain and therefore unimaginably difficult  difficult or not something must be done something must be said i could not and would not sit silent with all that beauty modestly mute in my presence i spoke thus and still i spoke with calm quiet as my words were i could hear they fell in a tone distinct round and deep  still i know i shall be strangely placed with that mountain nymph liberty she is i suspect akin to that solitude which i once wooed and from which i now seek a divorce these oreads are peculiar they come upon you with an unearthly charm like some starlight evening they inspire a wild but not warm delight their beauty is the beauty of spirits their grace is not the grace of life but of seasons or scenes in nature theirs is the dewy bloom of morning the languid flush of evening the peace of the moon the changefulness of clouds i want and will have something different this elfish splendour looks chill to my vision and feels frozen to my touch i am not a poet i cannot live with abstractions you miss keeldar have sometimes in your laughing satire called me a material philosopher and implied that i live sufficiently for the substantial certainly i feel material from head to foot and glorious as nature is and deeply as i worship her with the solid powers of a solid heart i would rather behold her through the soft human eyes of a loved and lovely wife than through the wild orbs of the highest goddess of olympus  juno could not cook a buffalo steak as you like it said she  she could not but i will tell you who couldsome young penniless friendless orphan girl i wish i could find such a onepretty enough for me to love with something of the mind and heart suited to my taste not uneducatedhonest and modest i care nothing for attainments but i would fain have the germ of those sweet natural powers which nothing acquired can rival any temper fate willsi can manage the hottest to such a creature as this i should like to be first tutor and then husband i would teach her my language my habits and my principles and then i would reward her with my love  reward her lord of the creationreward her ejaculated she with a curled lip  and be repaid a thousandfold  if she willed it monseigneur  and she should will it  you have stipulated for any temper fate wills compulsion is flint and a blow to the metal of some souls  and love the spark it elicits  who cares for the love that is but a sparkseen flown upward and gone  i must find my orphan girl tell me how miss keeldar  advertise and be sure you add when you describe the qualifications she must be a good plain cook  i must find her and when i do find her i shall marry her  not you and her voice took a sudden accent of peculiar scorn  i liked this i had roused her from the pensive mood in which i had first found her i would stir her further  why doubt it  you marry  yes of course nothing more evident than that i can and shall  the contrary is evident mr moore  she charmed me in this moodwaxing disdainful half insulting pride temper derision blent in her large fine eye that had just now the look of a merlins  favour me with your reasons for such an opinion miss keeldar  how will you manage to marry i wonder  i shall manage it with ease and speed when i find the proper person  accept celibacy and she made a gesture with her hand as if she gave me something take it as your doom  no you cannot give what i already have celibacy has been mine for thirty years if you wish to offer me a gift a parting present a keepsake you must change the boon  take worse then  howwhat  i now felt and looked and spoke eagerly i was unwise to quit my sheetanchor of calm even for an instant it deprived me of an advantage and transferred it to her the little spark of temper dissolved in sarcasm and eddied over her countenance in the ripples of a mocking smile  take a wife that has paid you court to save your modesty and thrust herself upon you to spare your scruples  only show me where  any stout widow that has had a few husbands already and can manage these things  she must not be rich then oh these riches  never would you have gathered the produce of the goldbearing garden you have not courage to confront the sleepless dragon you have not craft to borrow the aid of atlas  you look hot and haughty  and you far haughtier yours is the monstrous pride which counterfeits humility  i am a dependant i know my place  i am a woman i know mine  i am poor i must be proud  i have received ordinances and own obligations stringent as yours  we had reached a critical point now and we halted and looked at each other she would not give in i felt beyond this i neither felt nor saw a few moments yet were mine the end was comingi heard its rushbut not come i would dally wait talk and when impulse urged i would act i am never in a hurry i never was in a hurry in my whole life hasty people drink the nectar of existence scalding hot i taste it cool as dew i proceeded apparently miss keeldar you are as little likely to marry as myself i know you have refused threenay fouradvantageous offers and i believe a fifth have you rejected sir philip nunnely  i put this question suddenly and promptly  did you think i should take him  i thought you might  on what grounds may i ask  conformity of rank age pleasing contrast of temperfor he is mild and amiableharmony of intellectual tastes  a beautiful sentence let us take it to pieces conformity of rank he is quite above me compare my grange with his palace if you please i am disdained by his kith and kin suitability of age we were born in the same year consequently he is still a boy while i am a womanten years his senior to all intents and purposes contrast of temper mild and amiable is he iwhat tell me  sister of the spotted bright quick fiery leopard  and you would mate me with a kidthe millennium being yet millions of centuries from mankind being yet indeed an archangel high in the seventh heaven uncommissioned to descend unjust barbarian harmony of intellectual tastes he is fond of poetry and i hate it  do you that is news  i absolutely shudder at the sight of metre or at the sound of rhyme whenever i am at the priory or sir philip at fieldhead harmony indeed when did i whip up syllabub sonnets or string stanzas fragile as fragments of glass and when did i betray a belief that those pennybeads were genuine brilliants  you might have the satisfaction of leading him to a higher standard of improving his tastes  leading and improving teaching and tutoring bearing and forbearing pah my husband is not to be my baby i am not to set him his daily lesson and see that he learns it and give him a sugarplum if he is good and a patient pensive pathetic lecture if he is bad but it is like a tutor to talk of the satisfaction of teaching i suppose you think it the finest employment in the world i dont i reject it improving a husband no i shall insist upon my husband improving me or else we part  god knows it is needed  what do you mean by that mr moore  what i say improvement is imperatively needed  if you were a woman you would school monsieur votre mari charmingly it would just suit you schooling is your vocation  may i ask whether in your present just and gentle mood you mean to taunt me with being a tutor  yes bitterly and with anything else you pleaseany defect of which you are painfully conscious  with being poor for instance  of course that will sting you you are sore about your poverty you brood over that  with having nothing but a very plain person to offer the woman who may master my heart  exactly you have a habit of calling yourself plain you are sensitive about the cut of your features because they are not quite on an apollo pattern you abase them more than is needful in the faint hope that others may say a word in their behalfwhich wont happen your face is nothing to boast of certainlynot a pretty line nor a pretty tint to be found therein  compare it with your own  it looks like a god of egypta great sandburied stone head or rather i will compare it to nothing so lofty it looks like tartar you are my mastiffs cousin i think you as much like him as a man can be like a dog  tartar is your dear companion in summer when you rise early and run out into the fields to wet your feet with the dew and freshen your cheek and uncurl your hair with the breeze you always call him to follow you you call him sometimes with a whistle that you learned from me in the solitude of your wood when you think nobody but tartar is listening you whistle the very tunes you imitated from my lips or sing the very songs you have caught up by ear from my voice i do not ask whence flows the feeling which you pour into these songs for i know it flows out of your heart miss keeldar in the winter evenings tartar lies at your feet you suffer him to rest his head on your perfumed lap you let him couch on the borders of your satin raiment his rough hide is familiar with the contact of your hand i once saw you kiss him on that snowwhite beauty spot which stars his broad forehead it is dangerous to say i am like tartar it suggests to me a claim to be treated like tartar  perhaps sir you can extort as much from your penniless and friendless young orphan girl when you find her  oh could i find her such as i image her something to tame first and teach afterwards to break in and then to fondle to lift the destitute proud thing out of poverty to establish power over and then to be indulgent to the capricious moods that never were influenced and never indulged before to see her alternately irritated and subdued about twelve times in the twentyfour hours and perhaps eventually when her training was accomplished to behold her the exemplary and patient mother of about a dozen children only now and then lending little louis a cordial cuff by way of paying the interest of the vast debt she owes his father oh i went on my orphan girl would give me many a kiss she would watch on the threshold for my coming home of an evening she would run into my arms she would keep my hearth as bright as she would make it warm god bless the sweet idea find her i must  her eyes emitted an eager flash her lips opened but she reclosed them and impetuously turned away  tell me tell me where she is miss keeldar  another movement all haughtiness and fire and impulse  i must know you can tell me you shall tell me  i never will  she turned to leave me could i now let her part as she had always parted from me no i had gone too far not to finish i had come too near the end not to drive home to it all the encumbrance of doubt all the rubbish of indecision must be removed at once and the plain truth must be ascertained she must take her part and tell me what it was i must take mine and adhere to it  a minute madam i said keeping my hand on the doorhandle before i opened it we have had a long conversation this morning but the last word has not been spoken yet it is yours to speak it  may i pass  no i guard the door i would almost rather die than let you leave me just now without speaking the word i demand  what dare you expect me to say  what i am dying and perishing to hear what i must and will hear what you dare not now suppress  mr moore i hardly know what you mean you are not like yourself  i suppose i hardly was like my usual self for i scared herthat i could see it was right she must be scared to be won  you do know what i mean and for the first time i stand before you myself i have flung off the tutor and beg to introduce you to the man and remember he is a gentleman  she trembled she put her hand to mine as if to remove it from the lock she might as well have tried to loosen by her soft touch metal welded to metal she felt she was powerless and receded and again she trembled  what change i underwent i cannot explain but out of her emotion passed into me a new spirit i neither was crushed nor elated by her lands and gold i thought not of them cared not for them they were nothingdross that could not dismay me i saw only herselfher young beautiful form the grace the majesty the modesty of her girlhood  my pupil i said  my master was the low answer  i have a thing to tell you  she waited with declined brow and ringlets drooped  i have to tell you that for four years you have been growing into your tutors heart and that you are rooted there now i have to declare that you have bewitched me in spite of sense and experience and difference of station and estate you have so looked and spoken and moved so shown me your faults and your virtuesbeauties rather they are hardly so stern as virtuesthat i love youlove you with my life and strength it is out now  she sought what to say but could not find a word she tried to rally but vainly i passionately repeated that i loved her  well mr moore what then was the answer i got uttered in a tone that would have been petulant if it had not faltered  have you nothing to say to me have you no love for me  a little bit  i am not to be tortured i will not even play at present  i dont want to play i want to go  i wonder you dare speak of going at this moment you go what with my heart in your hand to lay it on your toilet and pierce it with your pins from my presence you do not stir out of my reach you do not stray till i receive a hostagepledge for pledgeyour heart for mine  the thing you want is mislaidlost some time since let me go and seek it  declare that it is where your keys often arein my possession  you ought to know and where are my keys mr moore indeed and truly i have lost them again and mrs gill wants some money and i have none except this sixpence  she took the coin out of her apron pocket and showed it in her palm i could have trifled with her but it would not do life and death were at stake mastering at once the sixpence and the hand that held it i demanded am i to die without you or am i to live for you  do as you please far be it from me to dictate your choice  you shall tell me with your own lips whether you doom me to exile or call me to hope  go i can bear to be left  perhaps i too can bear to leave you but reply shirley my pupil my sovereignreply  die without me if you will live for me if you dare  i am not afraid of you my leopardess i dare live for and with you from this hour till my death now then i have you you are mine i will never let you go wherever my home be i have chosen my wife if i stay in england in england you will stay if i cross the atlantic you will cross it also our lives are riveted our lots intertwined  and are we equal then sir are we equal at last  you are younger frailer feebler more ignorant than i  will you be good to me and never tyrannize  will you let me breathe and not bewilder me you must not smile at present the world swims and changes round me the sun is a dizzying scarlet blaze the sky a violet vortex whirling over me  i am a strong man but i staggered as i spoke all creation was exaggerated colour grew more vivid motion more rapid life itself more vital i hardly saw her for a moment but i heard her voicepitilessly sweet she would not subdue one of her charms in compassion perhaps she did not know what i felt  you name me leopardess remember the leopardess is tameless said she  tame or fierce wild or subdued you are mine  i am glad i know my keeper and am used to him only his voice will i follow only his hand shall manage me only at his feet will i repose  i took her back to her seat and sat down by her side i wanted to hear her speak again i could never have enough of her voice and her words  how much do you love me i asked  ah you know i will not gratify youi will not flatter  i dont know half enough my heart craves to be fed if you knew how hungry and ferocious it is you would hasten to stay it with a kind word or two  poor tartar said she touching and patting my handpoor fellow stalwart friend shirleys pet and favourite lie down  but i will not lie down till i am fed with one sweet word  and at last she gave it  dear louis be faithful to me never leave me i dont care for life unless i may pass it at your side  something more  she gave me a change it was not her way to offer the same dish twice  sir she said starting up at your peril you ever again name such sordid things as money or poverty or inequality it will be absolutely dangerous to torment me with these maddening scruples i defy you to do it  my face grew hot i did once more wish i were not so poor or she were not so rich she saw the transient misery and then indeed she caressed me blent with torment i experienced rapture  mr moore said she looking up with a sweet open earnest countenance teach me and help me to be good i do not ask you to take off my shoulders all the cares and duties of property but i ask you to share the burden and to show me how to sustain my part well your judgment is well balanced your heart is kind your principles are sound i know you are wise i feel you are benevolent i believe you are conscientious be my companion through life be my guide where i am ignorant be my master where i am faulty be my friend always  so help me god i will                                       yet again a passage from the blank book if you like reader if you dont like it pass it over  the sympsons are gone but not before discovery and explanation my manner must have betrayed something or my looks i was quiet but i forgot to be guarded sometimes i stayed longer in the room than usual i could not bear to be out of her presence i returned to it and basked in it like tartar in the sun if she left the oak parlour instinctively i rose and left it too she chid me for this procedure more than once i did it with a vague blundering idea of getting a word with her in the hall or elsewhere yesterday towards dusk i had her to myself for five minutes by the hall fire we stood side by side she was railing at me and i was enjoying the sound of her voice the young ladies passed and looked at us we did not separate ere long they repassed and again looked mrs sympson came we did not move mr sympson opened the diningroom door shirley flashed him back full payment for his spying gaze she curled her lip and tossed her tresses the glance she gave was at once explanatory and defiant it said i like mr moores society and i dare you to find fault with my taste  i asked do you mean him to understand how matters are  i do said she but i leave the development to chance there will be a scene i neither invite it nor fear it only you must be present for i am inexpressibly tired of facing him solus i dont like to see him in a rage he then puts off all his fine proprieties and conventional disguises and the real human being below is what you would call commun plat basvilain et un peu méchant his ideas are not clean mr moore they want scouring with soft soap and fullers earth i think if he could add his imagination to the contents of mrs gills buckingbasket and let her boil it in her copper with rainwater and bleachingpowder i hope you think me a tolerable laundress it would do him incalculable good  this morning fancying i heard her descend somewhat early i was down instantly i had not been deceived there she was busy at work in the breakfastparlour of which the housemaid was completing the arrangement and dusting she had risen betimes to finish some little keepsake she intended for henry i got only a cool reception which i accepted till the girl was gone taking my book to the windowseat very quietly even when we were alone i was slow to disturb her to sit with her in sight was happiness and the proper happiness for early morningserene incomplete but progressive had i been obtrusive i knew i should have encountered rebuff not at home to suitors was written on her brow therefore i read on stole now and then a look watched her countenance soften and open as she felt i respected her mood and enjoyed the gentle content of the moment  the distance between us shrank and the light hoarfrost thawed insensibly ere an hour elapsed i was at her side watching her sew gathering her sweet smiles and her merry words which fell for me abundantly we sat as we had a right to sit side by side my arm rested on her chair i was near enough to count the stitches of her work and to discern the eye of her needle the door suddenly opened  i believe if i had just then started from her she would have despised me thanks to the phlegm of my nature i rarely start when i am welloff bien comfortable i am not soon stirred bien i wastrès bienconsequently immutable no muscle moved i hardly looked to the door  goodmorning uncle said she addressing that personage who paused on the threshold in a state of petrifaction  have you been long downstairs miss keeldar and alone with mr moore  yes a very long time we both came down early it was scarcely light  the proceeding is improper  it was at first i was rather cross and not civil but you will perceive that we are now friends  i perceive more than you would wish me to perceive  hardly sir said i we have no disguises will you permit me to intimate that any further observations you have to make may as well be addressed to me henceforward i stand between miss keeldar and all annoyance  you what have you to do with miss keeldar  to protect watch over serve her  you siryou the tutor  not one word of insult sir interposed she not one syllable of disrespect to mr moore in this house  do you take his part  his part oh yes  she turned to me with a sudden fond movement which i met by circling her with my arm she and i both rose  good ged was the cry from the morninggown standing quivering at the door ged i think must be the cognomen of mr sympsons lares when hard pressed he always invokes this idol  come forward uncle you shall hear alltell him all louis  i dare him to speakthe beggar the knave the specious hypocrite the vile insinuating infamous menialstand apart from my niece sir let her go  she clung to me with energy i am near my future husband she said who dares touch him or me  her husband he raised and spread his hands he dropped into a seat  a while ago you wanted much to know whom i meant to marry my intention was then formed but not mature for communication now it is ripe sunmellowed perfect take the crimson peachtake louis moore  but savagely you shall not have him he shall not have you  i would die before i would have another i would die if i might not have him  he uttered words with which this page shall never be polluted  she turned white as death she shook all over she lost her strength i laid her down on the sofa just looked to ascertain that she had not faintedof which with a divine smile she assured me i kissed her and then if i were to perish i cannot give a clear account of what happened in the course of the next five minutes she has sincethrough tears laughter and tremblingtold me that i turned terrible and gave myself to the demon she says i left her made one bound across the room that mr sympson vanished through the door as if shot from a cannon i also vanished and she heard mrs gill scream  mrs gill was still screaming when i came to my senses i was then in another apartmentthe oak parlour i think i held sympson before me crushed into a chair and my hand was on his cravat his eyes rolled in his head i was strangling him i think the housekeeper stood wringing her hands entreating me to desist i desisted that moment and felt at once as cool as stone but i told mrs gill to fetch the redhouse inn chaise instantly and informed mr sympson he must depart from fieldhead the instant it came though half frightened out of his wits he declared he would not repeating the former order i added a commission to fetch a constable i said you shall go by fair means or foul  he threatened prosecution i cared for nothing i had stood over him once before not quite so fiercely as now but full as austerely it was one night when burglars attempted the house at sympson grove and in his wretched cowardice he would have given a vain alarm without daring to offer defence i had then been obliged to protect his family and his abode by mastering himselfand i had succeeded i now remained with him till the chaise came i marshalled him to it he scolding all the way he was terribly bewildered as well as enraged he would have resisted me but knew not how he called for his wife and daughters to come i said they should follow him as soon as they could prepare the smoke the fume the fret of his demeanour was inexpressible but it was a fury incapable of producing a deed that man properly handled must ever remain impotent i know he will never touch me with the law i know his wife over whom he tyrannizes in trifles guides him in matters of importance i have long since earned her undying mothers gratitude by my devotion to her boy in some of henrys ailments i have nursed himbetter she said than any woman could nurse she will never forget that she and her daughters quitted me today in mute wrath and consternation but she respects me when henry clung to my neck as i lifted him into the carriage and placed him by her side when i arranged her own wrapping to make her warm though she turned her head from me i saw the tears start to her eyes she will but the more zealously advocate my cause because she has left me in anger i am glad of thisnot for my own sake but for that of my life and idolmy shirley  once again he writes a week afteri am now at stilbro i have taken up my temporary abode with a frienda professional man in whose business i can be useful every day i ride over to fieldhead how long will it be before i can call that place my home and its mistress mine i am not easy not tranquil i am tantalized sometimes tortured to see her now one would think she had never pressed her cheek to my shoulder or clung to me with tenderness or trust i feel unsafe she renders me miserable i am shunned when i visit her she withdraws from my reach once this day i lifted her face resolved to get a full look down her deep dark eyes difficult to describe what i read there pantheress beautiful forestborn wily tameless peerless nature she gnaws her chain i see the white teeth working at the steel she has dreams of her wild woods and pinings after virgin freedom i wish sympson would come again and oblige her again to entwine her arms about me i wish there was danger she should lose me as there is risk i shall lose her no final loss i do not fear but long delay  it is now nightmidnight i have spent the afternoon and evening at fieldhead some hours ago she passed me coming down the oak staircase to the hall she did not know i was standing in the twilight near the staircase window looking at the frostbright constellations how closely she glided against the banisters how shyly shone her large eyes upon me how evanescent fugitive fitful she lookedslim and swift as a northern streamer  i followed her into the drawingroom mrs pryor and caroline helstone were both there she has summoned them to bear her company awhile in her white evening dress with her long hair flowing full and wavy with her noiseless step her pale cheek her eye full of night and lightning she looked i thought spiritlikea thing made of an element the child of a breeze and a flame the daughter of ray and raindropa thing never to be overtaken arrested fixed i wished i could avoid following her with my gaze as she moved here and there but it was impossible i talked with the other ladies as well as i could but still i looked at her she was very silent i think she never spoke to menot even when she offered me tea it happened that she was called out a minute by mrs gill i passed into the moonlit hall with the design of getting a word as she returned nor in this did i fail  miss keeldar stay one instant said i meeting her  why the hall is too cold  it is not cold for me at my side it should not be cold for you  but i shiver  with fear i believe what makes you fear me you are quiet and distant why  i may well fear what looks like a great dark goblin meeting me in the moonlight  do notdo not pass stay with me awhile let us exchange a few quiet words it is three days since i spoke to you alone such changes are cruel  i have no wish to be cruel she responded softly enough indeed there was softness in her whole deportmentin her face in her voice but there was also reserve and an air fleeting evanishing intangible  you certainly give me pain said i it is hardly a week since you called me your future husband and treated me as such now i am once more the tutor for you i am addressed as mr moore and sir your lips have forgotten louis  no louis no it is an easy liquid namenot soon forgotten  be cordial to louis then approach himlet him approach  i am cordial said she hovering aloof like a white shadow  your voice is very sweet and very low i answered quietly advancing you seem subdued but still startled  noquite calm and afraid of nothing she assured me  of nothing but your votary  i bent a knee to the flags at her feet  you see i am in a new world mr moore i dont know myself i dont know you but rise when you do so i feel troubled and disturbed  i obeyed it would not have suited me to retain that attitude long i courted serenity and confidence for her and not vainly she trusted and clung to me again  now shirley i said you can conceive i am far from happy in my present uncertain unsettled state  oh yes you are happy she cried hastily you dont know how happy you are any change will be for the worse  happy or not i cannot bear to go on so much longer you are too generous to require it  be reasonable louis be patient i like you because you are patient  like me no longer then love me instead fix our marriage day think of it tonight and decide  she breathed a murmur inarticulate yet expressive darted or melted from my armsand i lost her     chapter xxxvii  the windingup   yes reader we must settle accounts now i have only briefly to narrate the final fates of some of the personages whose acquaintance we have made in this narrative and then you and i must shake hands and for the present separate  let us turn to the curatesto the muchloved though longneglected come forward modest merit malone i see promptly answers the invocation he knows his own description when he hears it  no peter augustus we can have nothing to say to you it wont do impossible to trust ourselves with the touching tale of your deeds and destinies are you not aware peter that a discriminating public has its crotchets that the unvarnished truth does not answer that plain facts will not digest do you not know that the squeak of the real pig is no more relished now than it was in days of yore were i to give the catastrophe of your life and conversation the public would sweep off in shrieking hysterics and there would be a wild cry for salvolatile and burnt feathers impossible would be pronounced here untrue would be responded there inartistic would be solemnly decided note well whenever you present the actual simple truth it is somehow always denounced as a liethey disown it cast it off throw it on the parish whereas the product of your own imagination the mere figment the sheer fiction is adopted petted termed pretty proper sweetly naturalthe little spurious wretch gets all the comfits the honest lawful bantling all the cuffs such is the way of the world peter and as you are the legitimate urchin rude unwashed and naughty you must stand down  make way for mr sweeting  here he comes with his lady on his armthe most splendid and the weightiest woman in yorkshiremrs sweeting formerly miss dora sykes they were married under the happiest auspices mr sweeting having been just inducted to a comfortable living and mr sykes being in circumstances to give dora a handsome portion they lived long and happily together beloved by their parishioners and by a numerous circle of friends  there i think the varnish has been put on very nicely  advance mr donne  this gentleman turned out admirablyfar better than either you or i could possibly have expected reader he too married a most sensible quiet ladylike little woman the match was the making of him he became an exemplary domestic character and a truly active parish priest as a pastor he to his dying day conscientiously refused to act the outside of the cup and platter he burnished up with the best polishingpowder the furniture of the altar and temple he looked after with the zeal of an upholsterer the care of a cabinetmaker his little school his little church his little parsonage all owed their erection to him and they did him credit each was a model in its way if uniformity and taste in architecture had been the same thing as consistency and earnestness in religion what a shepherd of a christian flock mr donne would have made there was one art in the mastery of which nothing mortal ever surpassed mr donne it was that of begging by his own unassisted efforts he begged all the money for all his erections in this matter he had a grasp of plan a scope of action quite unique he begged of high and lowof the shoeless cottage brat and the coroneted duke he sent out beggingletters far and wideto old queen charlotte to the princesses her daughters to her sons the royal dukes to the prince regent to lord castlereagh to every member of the ministry then in office and what is more remarkable he screwed something out of every one of these personages it is on record that he got five pounds from the closefisted old lady queen charlotte and two guineas from the royal profligate her eldest son when mr donne set out on begging expeditions he armed himself in a complete suit of brazen mail that you had given a hundred pounds yesterday was with him no reason why you should not give two hundred today he would tell you so to your face and ten to one get the money out of you people gave to get rid of him after all he did some good with the cash he was useful in his day and generation  perhaps i ought to remark that on the premature and sudden vanishing of mr malone from the stage of briarfield parish you cannot know how it happened reader your curiosity must be robbed to pay your elegant love of the pretty and pleasing there came as his successor another irish curate mr macarthey i am happy to be able to inform you with truth that this gentleman did as much credit to his country as malone had done it discredit he proved himself as decent decorous and conscientious as peter was rampant boisterous and this last epithet i choose to suppress because it would let the cat out of the bag he laboured faithfully in the parish the schools both sunday and day schools flourished under his sway like green bay trees being human of course he had his faults these however were proper steadygoing clerical faultswhat many would call virtues the circumstance of finding himself invited to tea with a dissenter would unhinge him for a week the spectacle of a quaker wearing his hat in the church the thought of an unbaptized fellowcreature being interred with christian ritesthese things could make strange havoc in mr macartheys physical and mental economy otherwise he was sane and rational diligent and charitable  i doubt not a justiceloving public will have remarked ere this that i have thus far shown a criminal remissness in pursuing catching and bringing to condign punishment the wouldbe assassin of mr robert moore here was a fine opening to lead my willing readers a dance at once decorous and excitinga dance of law and gospel of the dungeon the dock and the deadthraw you might have liked it reader but i should not i and my subject would presently have quarrelled and then i should have broken down i was happy to find that facts perfectly exonerated me from the attempt the murderer was never punished for the good reason that he was never caughtthe result of the further circumstance that he was never pursued the magistrates made a shuffling as if they were going to rise and do valiant things but since moore himself instead of urging and leading them as heretofore lay still on his little cottagecouch laughing in his sleeve and sneering with every feature of his pale foreign face they considered better of it and after fulfilling certain indispensable forms prudently resolved to let the matter quietly drop which they did  mr moore knew who had shot him and all briarfield knew it was no other than michael hartley the halfcrazed weaver once before alluded to a frantic antinomian in religion and a mad leveller in politics the poor soul died of delirium tremens a year after the attempt on moore and robert gave his wretched widow a guinea to bury him                                       the winter is over and gone spring has followed with beamy and shadowy with flowery and showery flight we are now in the heart of summerin midjunethe june of 1812  it is burning weather the air is deep azure and red gold it fits the time it fits the age it fits the present spirit of the nations the nineteenth century wantons in its giant adolescence the titan boy uproots mountains in his game and hurls rocks in his wild sport this summer bonaparte is in the saddle he and his host scour russian deserts he has with him frenchmen and poles italians and children of the rhine six hundred thousand strong he marches on old moscow under old moscows walls the rude cossack waits him barbarian stoic he waits without fear of the boundless ruin rolling on he puts his trust in a snowcloud the wilderness the wind and the hailstorm are his refuge his allies are the elementsair fire water and what are these three terrible archangels ever stationed before the throne of jehovah they stand clothed in white girdled with golden girdles they uplift vials brimming with the wrath of god their time is the day of vengeance their signal the word of the lord of hosts thundering with the voice of his excellency  hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war  go your ways pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon the earth  it is done the earth is scorched with fire the sea becomes as the blood of a dead man the islands flee away the mountains are not found  in this year lord wellington assumed the reins in spain they made him generalissimo for their own salvations sake in this year he took badajos he fought the field of vittoria he captured pampeluna he stormed san sebastian in this year he won salamanca  men of manchester i beg your pardon for this slight résumé of warlike facts but it is of no consequence lord wellington is for you only a decayed old gentleman now i rather think some of you have called him a dotard you have taunted him with his age and the loss of his physical vigour what fine heroes you are yourselves men like you have a right to trample on what is mortal in a demigod scoff at your ease your scorn can never break his grand old heart  but come friends whether quakers or cottonprinters let us hold a peacecongress and let out our venom quietly we have been talking with unseemly zeal about bloody battles and butchering generals we arrive now at a triumph in your line on the 18th of june 1812 the orders in council were repealed and the blockaded ports thrown open you know very wellsuch of you as are old enough to rememberyou made yorkshire and lancashire shake with your shout on that occasion the ringers cracked a bell in briarfield belfry it is dissonant to this day the association of merchants and manufacturers dined together at stilbro and one and all went home in such a plight as their wives would never wish to witness more liverpool started and snorted like a riverhorse roused amongst his reeds by thunder some of the american merchants felt threatenings of apoplexy and had themselves bledall like wise men at this first moment of prosperity prepared to rush into the bowels of speculation and to delve new difficulties in whose depths they might lose themselves at some future day stocks which had been accumulating for years now went off in a moment in the twinkling of an eye warehouses were lightened ships were laden work abounded wages rose the good time seemed come these prospects might be delusive but they were brilliantto some they were even true at that epoch in that single month of june many a solid fortune was realized                                       when a whole province rejoices the humblest of its inhabitants tastes a festal feeling the sound of public bells rouses the most secluded abode as if with a call to be gay and so caroline helstone thought when she dressed herself more carefully than usual on the day of this trading triumph and went attired in her neatest muslin to spend the afternoon at fieldhead there to superintend certain millinery preparations for a great event the last appeal in these matters being reserved for her unimpeachable taste she decided on the wreath the veil the dress to be worn at the altar she chose various robes and fashions for more ordinary occasions without much reference to the brides opinionthat lady indeed being in a somewhat impracticable mood  louis had presaged difficulties and he had found themin fact his mistress had shown herself exquisitely provoking putting off her marriage day by day week by week month by month at first coaxing him with soft pretences of procrastination and in the end rousing his whole deliberate but determined nature to revolt against her tyranny at once so sweet and so intolerable  it had needed a sort of tempestshock to bring her to the point but there she was at last fettered to a fixed day there she lay conquered by love and bound with a vow  thus vanquished and restricted she pined like any other chained denizen of deserts her captor alone could cheer her his society only could make amends for the lost privilege of liberty in his absence she sat or wandered alone spoke little and ate less  she furthered no preparations for her nuptials louis was himself obliged to direct all arrangements he was virtually master of fieldhead weeks before he became so nominallythe least presumptuous the kindest master that ever was but with his lady absolute she abdicated without a word or a struggle go to mr moore ask mr moore was her answer when applied to for orders never was wooer of wealthy bride so thoroughly absolved from the subaltern part so inevitably compelled to assume a paramount character  in all this miss keeldar partly yielded to her disposition but a remark she made a year afterwards proved that she partly also acted on system louis she said would never have learned to rule if she had not ceased to govern the incapacity of the sovereign had developed the powers of the premier  it had been intended that miss helstone should act as bridesmaid at the approaching nuptials but fortune had destined her another part  she came home in time to water her plants she had performed this little task the last flower attended to was a rosetree which bloomed in a quiet green nook at the back of the house this plant had received the refreshing shower she was now resting a minute near the wall stood a fragment of sculptured stonea monkish reliconce perhaps the base of a cross she mounted it that she might better command the view she had still the watering pot in one hand with the other her pretty dress was held lightly aside to avoid trickling drops she gazed over the wall along some lonely fields beyond three dusk trees rising side by side against the sky beyond a solitary thorn at the head of a solitary lane far off she surveyed the dusk moors where bonfires were kindling the summer evening was warm the bellmusic was joyous the blue smoke of the fires looked soft their red flame bright above them in the sky whence the sun had vanished twinkled a silver pointthe star of love  caroline was not unhappy that eveningfar otherwise but as she gazed she sighed and as she sighed a hand circled her and rested quietly on her waist caroline thought she knew who had drawn near she received the touch unstartled  i am looking at venus mamma see she is beautiful how white her lustre is compared with the deep red of the bonfires  the answer was a closer caress and caroline turned and looked not into mrs pryors matron face but up at a dark manly visage she dropped her wateringpot and stepped down from the pedestal  i have been sitting with mamma an hour said the intruder i have had a long conversation with her where meantime have you been  to fieldhead shirley is as naughty as ever robert she will neither say yes nor no to any question put she sits alone i cannot tell whether she is melancholy or nonchalant if you rouse her or scold her she gives you a look half wistful half reckless which sends you away as queer and crazed as herself what louis will make of her i cannot tell for my part if i were a gentleman i think i would not dare undertake her  never mind them they were cut out for each other louis strange to say likes her all the better for these freaks he will manage her if any one can she tries him however he has had a stormy courtship for such a calm character but you see it all ends in victory for him caroline i have sought you to ask an audience why are those bells ringing  for the repeal of your terrible lawthe orders you hate so much you are pleased are you not  yesterday evening at this time i was packing some books for a seavoyage they were the only possessions except some clothes seeds roots and tools which i felt free to take with me to canada i was going to leave you  to leave me to leave me  her little fingers fastened on his arm she spoke and looked affrighted  not nownot now examine my faceyes look at me well is the despair of parting legible thereon  she looked into an illuminated countenance whose characters were all beaming though the page itself was dusk this face potent in the majesty of its traits shed down on her hope fondness delight  will the repeal do you goodmuch good immediate good she inquired  the repeal of the orders in council saves me now i shall not turn bankrupt now i shall not give up business now i shall not leave england now i shall be no longer poor now i can pay my debts now all the cloth i have in my warehouses will be taken off my hands and commissions given me for much more this day lays for my fortunes a broad firm foundation on which for the first time in my life i can securely build  caroline devoured his words she held his hand in hers she drew a long breath  you are saved your heavy difficulties are lifted  they are lifted i breathe i can act  at last oh providence is kind thank him robert  i do thank providence  and i also for your sake she looked up devoutly  now i can take more workmen give better wages lay wiser and more liberal plans do some good be less selfish now caroline i can have a housea home which i can truly call mineand now  he paused for his deep voice was checked  and now he resumednow i can think of marriage now i can seek a wife  this was no moment for her to speak she did not speak  will caroline who meekly hopes to be forgiven as she forgiveswill she pardon all i have made her suffer all that long pain i have wickedly caused her all that sickness of body and mind she owed to me will she forget what she knows of my poor ambition my sordid schemes will she let me expiate these things will she suffer me to prove that as i once deserted cruelly trifled wantonly injured basely i can now love faithfully cherish fondly treasure tenderly  his hand was in carolines still a gentle pressure answered him  is caroline mine  caroline is yours  i will prize her the sense of her value is here in my heart the necessity for her society is blended with my life not more jealous shall i be of the blood whose flow moves my pulses than of her happiness and wellbeing  i love you too robert and will take faithful care of you  will you take faithful care of me faithful care as if that rose should promise to shelter from tempest this hard gray stone but she will care for me in her way these hands will be the gentle ministrants of every comfort i can taste i know the being i seek to entwine with my own will bring me a solace a charity a purity to which of myself i am a stranger  suddenly caroline was troubled her lip quivered  what flutters my dove asked moore as she nestled to and then uneasily shrank from him  poor mamma i am all mamma has must i leave her  do you know i thought of that difficulty i and mamma have discussed it  tell me what you wish what you would like and i will consider if it is possible to consent but i cannot desert her even for you i cannot break her heart even for your sake  she was faithful when i was falsewas she not i never came near your sickbed and she watched it ceaselessly  what must i do anything but leave her  at my wish you never shall leave her  she may live very near us  with usonly she will have her own rooms and servant for this she stipulates herself  you know she has an income that with her habits makes her quite independent  she told me that with a gentle pride that reminded me of somebody else  she is not at all interfering and incapable of gossip  i know her cary but if instead of being the personification of reserve and discretion she were something quite opposite i should not fear her  yet she will be your motherinlaw the speaker gave an arch little nod moore smiled  louis and i are not of the order of men who fear their mothersinlaw cary our foes never have been nor will be those of our own household i doubt not my motherinlaw will make much of me  that she willin her quiet way you know she is not demonstrative and when you see her silent or even cool you must not fancy her displeased it is only a manner she has be sure to let me interpret for her whenever she puzzles you always believe my account of the matter robert  oh implicitly jesting apart i feel that she and i will suiton ne peut mieux hortense you know is exquisitely susceptiblein our french sense of the wordand not perhaps always reasonable in her requirements yet dear honest girl i never painfully wounded her feelings or had a serious quarrel with her in my life  no you are most generously considerate indeed most tenderly indulgent to her and you will be considerate with mamma you are a gentleman all through robert to the bone and nowhere so perfect a gentleman as at your own fireside  a eulogium i like it is very sweet i am well pleased my caroline should view me in this light  mamma just thinks of you as i do  not quite i hope  she does not want to marry youdont be vain but she said to me the other day my dear mr moore has pleasing manners he is one of the few gentlemen i have seen who combine politeness with an air of sincerity  mamma is rather a misanthropist is she not not the best opinion of the sterner sex  she forbears to judge them as a whole but she has her exceptions whom she admireslouis and mr hall and of late yourself she did not like you once i knew that because she would never speak of you but robert  well what now what is the new thought  you have not seen my uncle yet  i have mamma called him into the room he consents conditionally if i prove that i can keep a wife i may have her and i can keep her better than he thinksbetter than i choose to boast  if you get rich you will do good with your money robert  i will do good you shall tell me how indeed i have some schemes of my own which you and i will talk about on our own hearth one day i have seen the necessity of doing good i have learned the downright folly of being selfish caroline i foresee what i will now foretell this war must ere long draw to a close trade is likely to prosper for some years to come there may be a brief misunderstanding between england and america but that will not last what would you think if one dayperhaps ere another ten years elapselouis and i divide briarfield parish betwixt us louis at any rate is certain of power and property he will not bury his talents he is a benevolent fellow and has besides an intellect of his own of no trifling calibre his mind is slow but strong it must work it may work deliberately but it will work well he will be made magistrate of the districtshirley says he shall she would proceed impetuously and prematurely to obtain for him this dignity if he would let her but he will not as usual he will be in no haste ere he has been master of fieldhead a year all the district will feel his quiet influence and acknowledge his unassuming superiority a magistrate is wanted they will in time invest him with the office voluntarily and unreluctantly everybody admires his future wife and everybody will in time like him he is of the pâte generally approved bon comme le paindaily bread for the most fastidious good for the infant and the aged nourishing for the poor wholesome for the rich shirley in spite of her whims and oddities her dodges and delays has an infatuated fondness for him she will one day see him as universally beloved as even she could wish he will also be universally esteemed considered consulted depended ontoo much so his advice will be always judicious his help always goodnatured ere long both will be in inconvenient request he will have to impose restrictions as for me if i succeed as i intend to do my success will add to his and shirleys income i can double the value of their mill property i can line yonder barren hollow with lines of cottages and rows of cottagegardens  robert and root up the copse  the copse shall be firewood ere five years elapse the beautiful wild ravine shall be a smooth descent the green natural terrace shall be a paved street there shall be cottages in the dark ravine and cottages on the lonely slopes the rough pebbled track shall be an even firm broad black sooty road bedded with the cinders from my mill and my mill carolinemy mill shall fill its present yard  horrible you will change our blue hillcountry air into the stilbro smoke atmosphere  i will pour the waters of pactolus through the valley of briarfield  i like the beck a thousand times better  i will get an act for enclosing nunnely common and parcelling it out into farms  stilbro moor however defies you thank heaven what can you grow in bilberry moss what will flourish on rushedge  caroline the houseless the starving the unemployed shall come to hollows mill from far and near and joe scott shall give them work and louis moore esq shall let them a tenement and mrs gill shall mete them a portion till the first payday  she smiled up in his face  such a sunday school as you will have cary such collections as you will get such a day school as you and shirley and miss ainley will have to manage between you the mill shall find salaries for a master and mistress and the squire or the clothier shall give a treat once a quarter  she mutely offered a kissan offer taken unfair advantage of to the extortion of about a hundred kisses  extravagant daydreams said moore with a sigh and smile yet perhaps we may realize some of them meantime the dew is falling mrs moore i shall take you in                                       it is august the bells clash out again not only through yorkshire but through england from spain the voice of a trumpet has sounded long it now waxes louder and louder it proclaims salamanca won this night is briarfield to be illuminated on this day the fieldhead tenantry dine together the hollows mill workpeople will be assembled for a like festal purpose the schools have a grand treat this morning there were two marriages solemnized in briarfield churchlouis gérard moore esq late of antwerp to shirley daughter of the late charles cave keeldar esq of fieldhead robert gérard moore esq of hollows mill to caroline niece of the rev matthewson helstone ma rector of briarfield  the ceremony in the first instance was performed by mr helstone hiram yorke esq of briarmains giving the bride away in the second instance mr hall vicar of nunnely officiated amongst the bridal train the two most noticeable personages were the youthful bridesmen henry sympson and martin yorke  i suppose robert moores prophecies were partially at least fulfilled the other day i passed up the hollow which tradition says was once green and lone and wild and there i saw the manufacturers daydreams embodied in substantial stone and brick and ashesthe cinderblack highway the cottages and the cottage gardens there i saw a mighty mill and a chimney ambitious as the tower of babel i told my old housekeeper when i came home where i had been  ay said she this world has queer changes i can remember the old mill being builtthe very first it was in all the district and then i can remember it being pulled down and going with my lakelasses companions to see the foundationstone of the new one laid the two mr moores made a great stir about it they were there and a deal of fine folk besides and both their ladies very bonny and grand they looked but mrs louis was the grandest she always wore such handsome dresses mrs robert was quieter like mrs louis smiled when she talked she had a real happy glad goodnatured look but she had een that pierced a body through there is no such ladies nowadays  what was the hollow like then martha  different to what it is now but i can tell of it clean different again when there was neither mill nor cot nor hall except fieldhead within two miles of it i can tell one summer evening fifty years syne my mother coming running in just at
