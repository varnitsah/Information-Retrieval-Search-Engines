68976888	lost in the forest by rm ballantyne   in this book we meet once again wandering will one of ballantynes perpetual heroes  they are on a touristic cruise in the eastern pacific when the second mate griffin eggs on some of the seamen to mutiny and take over the ship  the captain and some of the senior officers are cast off in a ships dinghy to survive however they can while will and others of his party are retained on board the rover because of their medical knowledge which griffin believes might one day come in useful  they visit a small island to restock the larder and then head for the mainland of south america  on arriving a party goes ashore including our heroes landing through heavy surf  everyone made it to shore but griffin touches ground on quicksand and suddenly disappears from sight never to be seen again at this point our heroes manage to give the mutineers the slip and disappear into the forest unfortunately they become disorientated so their original plan of regaining the coast and then travelling northward along it until they should come to some major settlement had to be abandoned  hence the title of the book  thereafter we are given an interesting tour of the andes very well written and entertaining  eventually our heroes find a way to where they can take ship for england   lost in the forest by rm ballantyne    chapter one  at seaan alarming cry and a rescue  at sea once more said will osten in a meditative mood  our hero made this remark one night to himself which was overheard and replied to by his friend captain dall in a manner that surprised him  its my opinion doctor said the captain in a low voice that this is the last time you or i will ever be at sea or anywhere else if our skipper dont look better after his men for a more rascally crew i never set eyes on and from a word or two i have heard dropped now and then i feel sure some mischief is in the wind  come aft with me to a place where we aint so likely to be overheard by eavesdroppers and ill tell you all about it  will osten was so much astonished at his friends remark that he followed him to the after part of the ship without uttering a word and there sat down on the taffrail to listen to what he had to communicate  there was no moon in the clear sky and the hosts of stars that studded the dark vault overhead did not shed any appreciable light on the waters of the pacific on which the rover floated almost motionless  that beautiful and mysterious phosphorescence which sometimes illumines the sea was gleaming in vivid flashes in the vessels wake and a glowing trail of it appeared to follow the rudder like a serpent of lambent fire  it was one of those calm peaceful nights in which god seems to draw nearer than usual to the souls of his creatures  the only sounds that broke the profound stillness were the pattering of reefpoints on the sails as the vessel rose and sank gently on the oily swell the measured tread of the officer of the watch and the humming of the man at the wheel as he stood idly at his post for the vessel had scarcely steeringway  doctor said captain dall in a low whisper taking will osten by the buttonhole and bending forward until his eyes were close to those of his young friend i little thought when i set sail from england that in a few weeks after my good ship the foam would come a wreck an sink to the bottom of the pacific before my eyes  still less did i think that i should be cast on a coral island have to fight like a naked savage and be saved at last by missionaries from being roasted and eaten  yet all this has happened within a few months  at any other time will osten would have smiled at the solemn manner in which this was said but there was something in the hour and also in the tone of his friends voice which tended to repress levity and raise a feeling of anxiety in his mind  well captain he said what has this to do with the present evil that you seem to apprehend  to do with it lad nothingxcept that it reminds me that we little know what is in store for us  here are we becalmedthree days sail from the coral island where the niggers were so near converting us into cooked victuals and i wouldnt at this minute give twopence in security for the life of any one on board the rover  why what mean you asked will with increasing perplexity  some of the crew are bad enough no doubt but many of them are evidently good menwhat is it that you fear  fear why theres everything to fear said the captain in a suppressed but excited whisper drawing still closer to his friend ive often sailed in these seas and i know that while some of the traders sailing between these islands and south america and other parts are decentish enough others are as great cutthroats as ever deserved to swing at the yardarm  but thats not the point  i have overheard of late some of the rascals plotting to murder the officers and take this ship  but i cannot point em out for though i heard their voices i couldnt see their faces  i think i know who they are but could not swear to em and it would be worse than useless to denounce them till we have some evidence to go on  i therefore want you to help me with your advice and assistance so that we may get up a counterplot to spoil their funfor im quite certain that if we fail tohark whats that  will did not answer but both listened intently to the sound which had interrupted captain dalls discourse  it was evident that the officer and men of the watch had also heard it for they too had ceased to walk to and fro and their figures could be dimly seen in a listening attitude at the gangway  for several minutes they listened without hearing anythingthen a hoarse guttural shout broke the stillness of the night for a few seconds and died away  the men looked at each other and some of the more superstitious among them grew pale  again the cry was repeated somewhat nearer and again all was still  some of the oldest hands in the watch stood transfixed and powerless with terror  they would have faced death in any form manfully but this mysterious sound unnerved them  the officer of the watch went down to report it to captain blathers who immediately came on deck  just as he appeared the cry was repeated and a slight splash was heard  some one in distress cried captain blathers promptly a crew for the starboard quarterboat to pick him up  stand by to lower  be smart lads  these words heartily uttered put superstitious fears to flight at once  the men threw off their jackets the boat was lowered and in a few minutes was pulling about and searching in all directions  our hero was one of the first to leap into her and he pulled the bow oar  for some time they rowed about in vain  the night was intensely dark and the cry was not repeated so that they had nothing to guide them in their movements  a lantern was fixed in the ship half way up the mizzen rigging but the lantern in the boat was concealed until the moment when it should be required because it is easier for men to distinguish surrounding objects in comparative darkness than when a light is glaring near them  presently will osten saw a dark object like a small canoe right ahead of the boat  back waterall he shouted  the men obeyed but it was too late the boat struck the object and overturned it  will saw something like a human form roll into the water and heard a gurgling cry  without a moments hesitation he leaped overboard head foremost and catching hold of the object brought it to the surface  he remembered at that moment having heard of a fact which is worth stating here  the best way to save a drowning man is to approach him from behind seize him under the armpits and then getting on your back draw him partly on to your breast and swim on your back to the shore or to a place of safety  thought is quicker than the lightning flash  will could not of course carry out this plan fully nevertheless the memory of it served him in good stead for the instant he caught the drowning man by the hair he kept him at arms length and thus avoided his deathclutch until he could grasp him under the armpits from behind and thus render him powerless  he then rose and drew him gently upon his breast at the same time striking out with his feet and shouting  bear a hand ladsive got him  a loud hurrah burst from the men in the boat and was reechoed vehemently from the ship  they had overshot the spot only by a few yards  instantly they pulled round two strokes brought them to the spot where will was swimming and in another moment our hero and the rescued man were hauled into the boat  the men gave vent to another loud and prolonged cheer which was again replied to from the ship  the boat was soon alongside and the rescued man who proved to be a man of colour in a very emaciated and exhausted condition was hoisted on board  his story was soon told  he was not a native of the islands but had been living on one of them and had gone off to fish in a canoe when a gale sprang up and blew him out to sea  four days and nights had he been exposed to the storm in his frail bark without food or water and was on the point of perishing when the ship chanced to pass near him  the utterance of the cry which had attracted attention was almost the last effort of which he was capable  he spoke a little broken english having learnt it while serving on board of an english trading vessel  his name he said was bunco and a fine powerfullooking fellow he was despite the sad condition to which he had been reduced his shoulders and indeed most parts of his body were blistered by the continual washing of the sea over him and when he was lifted on board his skin was icy cold  had he not been a man of iron mould he must certainly have perished  the poor fellow was at once taken into the cabin and carefully attended to  he was first bathed in fresh water then rolled in blankets and a tumbler of hot wine and water administered which greatly revived him and soon caused him to fall into a sound sleep  whether it was that this incident softened the hearts of the seamen for a time or that their plans were not yet ripe for execution we cannot tell but certain it is that nothing whatever occurred to justify captain dalls suspicions for several weeks after that    chapter two  describes a mutiny and shows that the best of friends may part sooner than they expect  a wilful man will have his way  that this is a true proverb is almost universally admitted indeed there is reason to believe that it is equally true of women as of men nevertheless captain blathers did not believe it although he was himself a living illustration of its truth he laughed at captain dall when that worthy warned him of the mutinous intentions of his crew and when several weeks had passed away without any signs of disaffection appearing he rallied him a good deal about what he styled his suspicious disposition and refused to take any steps to guard against surprise  the consequence was that when the storm did break he was utterly unprepared to meet it  griffin the second mate was the leader of the conspiracy but so ably did he act his villainous part that no one suspected him  he was a tall powerful swarthy man with a handsome but forbidding countenance  one evening a little before sunset while the captain was sitting at tea with those who usually messed in the cabin griffin looked down the skylight and reported a sail on the weather bow  the captain immediately rose and went on deck  the moment he appeared he was seized by griffin  captain blathers was an active and powerful man and very passionate  he clenched his fist and struck the second mate a blow on the chest which caused him to stagger back but before he could repeat it two sailors seized him from behind and held him fast  the noise of the scuffle at once brought up the first mate who was followed by will osten captain dall and others all of whom were seized by the crew and secured as they successively made their appearance  resistance was of course offered by each but in vain for the thing was promptly and thoroughly carried out  four strong men stood at the head of the companion with ropes ready to secure their prisoners while the greater part of the crew stood close by armed with pistols and cutlasses  it is of no use resisting captain blathers said griffin when the former was pinioned you see we are quite prepared and thoroughly in earnest  the captain looked round and a glance sufficed to convince him that this was true  not a friendly eye met his because those of the crew who were suspected of being favourable to him or who could not be safely relied on had been seized by another party of mutineers at the same time that those in the cabin were captured and among them were three friends of our heromr cupples the mate muggins and larry ohale seamen belonging to the lost foam to which captain dall had referred while conversing with will  for a few seconds captain blathers face blazed with wrath and he seemed about to make a desperate attempt to break his bonds but by a strong effort he restrained himself  what do you intend to do he asked at length in a deep husky voice  to take possession of this ship replied the second mate with a slightly sarcastic smile  these men have taken a fancy to lead a free roving life and to make me their captain and i am inclined to fall in with their fancy and to relieve you of the command  scoundrel exclaimed the captain say rather that you have misled the men and that  he checked himself and then said sternly and pray what do you intend to do with me  i shall allow you a boat and provisions captain blathers for the use of yourself and your friends and then bid you farewell  you see we are mercifully inclined and have no desire to shed your blood  ho there lower one of the quarter boats  this order was obeyed with promptitude  some provisions were thrown into the boat and the captain was cast loose and ordered to get into it  he turned to make a last appeal to the crew but griffin presented a pistol at his head and ordered him peremptorily to get into the boat it is probable that he would have made another effort had not two of the men forced him over the side  seeing this will osten was so indignant and so anxious to quit the ship that he stepped forward with alacrity to follow him  no no my fine young fellow said griffin thrusting him back we want your help as a doctor a little longer  it may be that you are not inclined to serve us but we can find a way of compelling you if youre not  come mr dall be good enough to go next  when captain dalls hands were loosed he shook his fist in the second mates face and said rascal youll swing for this yet mark my words youll swing for it  having relieved his feelings thus he went over the side  while this was going on larry ohale muggins and mr cupples with several others were brought to the gangway  griffin addressed these before ordering them into the boat  my lads he said i have no objection to your remaining aboard if you choose to take part with us  i for one will have nothing to do with e said mr cupples sternly  then you may go said griffin with a sneer  muggins who to use one of his own phrases looked as sulky as a bear with a broken head made no reply but larry ohale exclaimed sure then what better can i do than take part with yees  its a heavenly raigin o the arth this an good company  put me down on the books capting griffin dear  id niver desart ye in your troublesbe no mains  there was a slight laugh at this and larry was graciously cast loose and permitted to remain  both will osten and muggins gazed at him however in amazement for they had supposed that their comrade would rather have taken his chance in the captains boat  suddenly an intelligent gleam shot athwart the rough visage of muggins and he said  of coorse ill remain too  it would be madness for an old salt like me to go paddlin about the ocean in a cockleshell of a boat when he has the chance of sailin in a good ship  put me down too capting  im game for anything amost from pitch an toss to manslaughter  so muggins was added to the ships company and poor mr cupples went over the side with a face almost as long as his thin body because of what he deemed the depravity and desertion of his old shipmates several of the ships crew who refused to join also went into the boat which was then cast loose and dropped rapidly astern  the whole of this exciting scene passed so quickly that it was only when the boat was far away like a speck on the sea that will osten realised the fact that he had actually said farewell perhaps for over to his late comrades  but he had not much time given him for reflection for the new captain after changing the course of the ship and making a few arrangements to suit the altered state of affairs ordered him to go forward and do duty as a common seaman telling him that he did not intend to have any landlubbers or idlers aboard and that he would be called to do doctors work when his services should be required  that night our hero contrived to hold a whispering interview in a dark corner of the forecastle with his friends larry ohale and muggins  he found that the former had resolved to join the crew in order to be near himself that muggins had joined because of his desire to share the fortunes of larry and that both had made up their minds to effect their escape on the first favourable opportunity  now ye see boys said larry this is how it is  dont open your breadbasket hatch so wide growled muggins else youll be overheerdthats wot it is  this is how it is repeated larry not bein fish nor gulls nor say sarpints we havent the ghost of a chance of gettin away from this ship till were close to land an even then we wont have much chance if its suspected that we want to escape  what thenwhy let us from this hour agree to give each other the cowld shoulder and go at our work as if we liked it  youre right larry said will  if they see us much together theyll naturally suspect that we are plotting so  at this point a voice growled from an adjacent hammock  avast spinnin yarns there will e  ay its that seacook larry ohale cried muggins aloud he was always over fond o talking  larry who at the first sound had slipped away to his hammock shouted from under the blankets ye spalpeen its no more me than yersilf sure id have been draimin of ould ireland if yehadntsnore me grandmotheryawn or the pig  a prolonged snore terminated this sentence and muggins turned into his hammock while will osten rose with a quiet laugh and went on deck  one morning some weeks after the conversation just related our hero was leaning over the bulwarks near the forechains watching the play of the clear waves as the ship glided quietly but swiftly through them before a light breeze  will was in a meditative frame of mind and had stood there gazing dreamily down for nearly half an hour when his elbow was touched by the man named bunco who had long before recovered from his exposure in the canoe  will was a little surprised for he had not had much intercourse with the man and could not comprehend the confidential and peculiar look and tone with which he now addressed him  mister osen he said in a low voice after a few preliminary words you be tink of escape  will was startled why do you think so he asked in some alarm  ha said the man with a broad grin me keep eyes in headme doos not in pocket  ho ho  yis me see an hear berry well muggins go too if hims canand larry ohale ho yis  now me go too  you too  yis  you save me life me know dis here part ob the univarsebin bornded an riz here  not far off from de land today  you let me go too an me show you how you kin do  at this point bunco was interrupted by a shout of land ho from the lookout at the masthead  where away cried griffin  on the leebow sir  instantly all eyes and glasses were turned in the direction indicated where in a short time a blue line like a low cloud was faintly seen on the faroff horizon    chapter three  describes a tremendous but bloodless fight  proverbial philosophy tells usand every one must have learned from personal experiencethat there is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip  heroes in every rank of life are peculiarly liable to such slips and our hero was no exception to the rule  finding that the vessel in which he sailed was now little if at all better than a pirate he had fondly hoped that he should make his escape on the first point of south america at which they touched  land was at last in sight  hope was high in the breast of will osten and expressive glances passed between him and his friends in captivity when alas the land turned out to be a small island so low that they could see right across it and so scantily covered with vegetation that human beings evidently deemed it unworthy of being possessed  theres niver a sowl upon it remarked larry ohale in a tone of chagrin  maybe not said griffin who overheard the observation but theres plenty of bodies on it if not souls and as we are short of provisions i intend to layto and give you a chance of seeing them get ready to go ashore im not afraid of you wandering too far  griffin wound up this speech with a low chuckle and a leer which sent a chill to the heart not only of will osten but of larry and muggins also for it convinced them that their new master had guessed their intention and that he would of course take every precaution to prevent its being carried out  after the first depression of spirits consequent on this discovery the three friends became more than ever determined to outwit their enemy and resolved to act in the meantime with perfect submission and prompt obedienceas they had hitherto done  of course each reserved in his own mind the right of rebellion if griffin should require them to do any criminal act and they hoped fervently that they should not fall in with any vessel that might prove a temptation to their new captain  a few minutes after this the order was given to lower one of the boats and a crew jumped into her among whom were larry and muggins  will osten asked permission to go and griffin granted his request with a grin that was the reverse of amiable  musha what sort o bodies did the capting main said larry when they had pulled beyond earshot of the ship  ha paddy replied one of the men theyre pleasant fat bodies amusin to catch and much thought of by aldermenturtles no less  ah then its jokin ye are  not i  i never joke  turthles is itgreen fat an all  ay an shells too  sure its for the coppers theyre wanted  just so larry an if youll ship your oar an jump out wi the painter well haul the boat up an show you how to catch em  as the sailor spoke the boats keel grated on the sand and the irishman sprang over the side followed by his comrades who regarded the expedition in the light of a good spree  the party had to wait some time however for the anticipated sport  it was near sunset when they landed but turtles are not always ready to deliver themselves up even though the honour of being eaten by london aldermen sometimes awaits them  it is usually night before the creatures come out of the sea to enjoy a snooze on the beach  the men did not remain idle however  they dragged the boat a considerable distance from the water and then turned it keel up supporting one gunwale on several forked sticks so that a convenient shelter was provided  this lookout house was still further improved by having a soft carpet of leaves and grass spread beneath it  when these preparations had been made those men who had never seen turtleturning performed were instructed in their duties by an experienced hand  the process being simple the explanation was short and easy  you see lads said the instructor leaning against the boat and stuffing down the glowing tobacco in his pipe with the point of his apparently fireproof little fingeryou see lads this is ow it is all that youve got for to do is to keep parfitly still till the turtles comes out o the sea dye seethen as the dook o wellinton said at waterlooup boys an at em  wen ov coorse each man fixes his eyes on the turtle nearest him runs out ketches him by the rim of his shell an turns him slap over on his backdye understand  clear as ditch wather said larry  humph said muggins  well then boys continued the old salt with the fireproof little finger yed better go an count the sand or the stars when they comes out for there wont be nothin to do for an hour to come  having delivered himself thus he refilled his pipe and lay down to enjoy it under the boat while the others followed his example or sauntered along the shore or wandered among the bushes until the time for action should arrive  will osten and his two friends availed themselves of the opportunity to retire and hold an earnest consultation as to their future prospects and plans  as this was the first time they had enjoyed a chance of conversing without the fear of being overheard they made the most of it and numerous were the projects which were proposed and rejected in eager earnest tonesat least on the part of larry and will  as for muggins although always earnest he was never eager  tremendous indeed must have been the influence which could rouse him into a state of visible excitement  during the discussion the other two grew so warm that they forgot all about time and turtles and would certainly have prolonged their talk for another hour had not one of the men appeared telling them to clap a stopper on their potatotraps and return to the boat as the sport was going to begin  the moon had risen and commenced her course through a sky which was so clear that the planets shone like resplendent jewels and the distant stars like diamond dust  not a breath of air ruffled the surface of the sea nevertheless its slumbering energies were indicated by the waves on the outlying coral reef which approaching one by one slowly and solemnly fell with what can only be called a quiet roar hissed gently for a moment on the sand and then passed with a sigh into absolute silence  dont it seem as if the sea wor sleepin whispered one of the men while they all lay watching under the boat  ay an snorin too answered another  whisht exclaimed a third if old neptune hears ye hell wake up an change his tune  och sure hes woke up already whispered larry pointing with great excitement to a dark object which at that moment appeared to emerge from the sea  mums the word boys whispered the old salt who had charge of the party the critters are comin an england expecs every man for to do his dooty as old nelson said  in the course of a few minutes several more dark objects emerged from the sea and waddled with a kind of sigh or low grunt slowly up the beach where they lay evidently intending to have a nap  with breathless but eager interest the sailors lay perfectly still until fifteen of the dark objects were on the sands and sufficient time was allowed them to fall into their first nap  then the word turn was given and leaping up each man rushed swiftly but silently upon his prey  the turtles were pounced upon so suddenly that almost before they were wide awake they were caught a bursting cheer followed and instantly ten splendid animals were turned over on their backs in which position being unable to turn again they lay flapping their flippers violently  thats the way to go it shouted one of the men who after turning his turtle dashed after one of the other five which were now hastening back to the sea with laborious but slow haste  his comrades followed suit instantly with a wild cheer  now to the uninitiated this was the only moment of danger in that bloodless fight  being aware of his incapacity for swift flight the turtle when in the act of running away from danger makes use of each flipper alternately in dashing the sand to an incredible height behind and around him to the endangering of the pursuers eyes if he be not particularly careful  sometimes incautious men have their eyes so filled with sand in this way that it almost blinds them for a time and severe inflammation is occasionally the result  the old saltpeter grant by name but better known among his shipmates as old peterwas well aware of this habit of the turtle but having a spice of mischief in him he said nothing about it  the consequences were severe on some of the men particularly on muggins  our sedate friend was the only one who failed to turn a turtle at the first rush he had tripped over a stone at starting and when he gathered himself up and ran to the scene of action the turtles were in full retreat burning with indignation at his bad fortune he resolved to redeem his character and with this end in view made a desperate rush at a particularly large turtle which appeared almost too fat for its own shell  it chanced that larry ohale having already turned two also set his affections on this turtle and made a rush at it seeing which muggins slyly ran behind him tripped up his heels and passed on  have a care cried will osten laughing hell bite  bad luck to yez shouted larry leaping up and following hard on muggins heels  just then the turtle began to use his flippers in desperation  sand flew in all directions  the pursuers nothing daunted though surprised partially closed their eyes bent down their heads and advanced  larry opened his mouth to shouta shower of sand filled it he opened his eyes in astonishmentanother shower shut them both up causing him to howl while he coughed and spluttered  but muggins pressed on valorously  one often reads in the history of war of brave and reckless heroes who go through storms of shot and shell almost scathless while others are falling like autumn leaves around them  something similar happened on the present occasion  while larry and several of the other men were left behind pitifully and tenderly picking the sand out of their eyes the bold mugginscovered with sand from head to foot but still not mortally woundedadvanced singlehanded against the foerushed at the turtle tripped over it rose again quailed for a second before the tremendous fire burst through it and finally catching the big creature by the rim turned him on his back and uttered a roar rather than a cheer of triumph  this was the last capture made that night  immediately after their victory the men returned to the boat where they kindled an immense bonfire and prepared to spend the night leaving the turtles to kick helplessly on their backs till the morning light should enable them to load the boat and return with their prizes to the ship  meanwhile pipes were loaded and lit and doctor will as old peter called him looked after the wounded    chapter four  in which another fight is recorded and an escape is made but whether fortunate or the reverse remains to be seen  the supply of fresh meat thus secured was very acceptable to the crew of the rover and their circumstances were further improved by the addition of a number of fresh cocoanuts which were collected on the island by bunco that individual being the only one on board who could perform with ease the difficult feat of climbing the cocoanut palms after a couple of days spent at this island the rover weighed anchor and stood away for the coast of south america which she sighted about two weeks afterwards  here one evening they were becalmed not far from land and griffin ordered a boat to be lowered with a crew to go ashore  the captain had been in low spirits that day from what cause was not known and no one ever found out the reason but certain it is that he was unusually morose and gruff  he was also rather absent and did not observe the fact that larry ohale muggins and will osten were among the crew of the boat  the mate observed it however and having a shrewd suspicion of their intentions ordered them to leave it  what said you asked griffin of the mate as he was about to go over the side  i was about to change some of the crew he replied confidentially it would be as well to keep ohale and  oh never mind said griffin roughly let em go  the mate of course stepped back and griffin got into the boat which was soon on its way to the land  on nearing the shore it was found that a tremendous surf broke upon the beachowing to its exposure to the long rolling swell of the pacific  when the boat which was a small one entered this surf it became apparent that the attempt to land was full of danger  each wave that bore them on its crest for a second and then left them behind was so gigantic that nothing but careful steering could save them from turning broadside on and being rolled over like a cask  griffin was a skilful steersman but he evidently was not at that time equal to the occasion  he steered wildly  when they were close to the beach the boat upset  every man swam towards a place where a small point of land caused a sort of eddy and checked the force of the undertow  they all reached it in a few minutes with the exception of griffin who had found bottom on a sandbank and stood waist deep laughing apparently at the struggles of his comrades  youd better come ashore shouted one of the men  griffin replied by another laugh in the midst of which he sank suddenly and disappeared  it might have been a quicksandit might have been a sharkno one ever could tell but the unhappy man had gone to his accounthe was never more seen  the accident had been observed from the ship and the mate at once lowered a boat and hastened to the rescue  those on shore observed this and awaited its approach  before it was half way from the beach however peter grant said to his comrades  ill tell e wot it is boys seems to me that providence has given us a chance of gittin away from that ship  i never was a pirate an i dont mean for to become one so all who are of my way of thinkin come over here  will osten and his friends were so glad to find that a shipmate had unknown to them harboured thoughts of escaping that they at once leaped to his side but none of the others followed  they were all determined reckless men and had no intention of giving up their wild course  moreover they were not prepared to allow their comrades to go off quietly  one of them in particular a very savage by nature as well as a giant stoutly declared that he not only meant to stick by the ship himself but would compel the others to do so too and for this purpose placed himself between them and the woods which at that part of the coast approached close to the sea  those who took his part joined him and for a few moments the two parties stood gazing at each other in silence  there was good ground for hesitation on both sides for on the one hand will osten and his three friends were resolute and powerful fellows while on the other the giant and his comrades besides being stout men were eight in number  now it chanced that our hero had in early boyhood learned an art which we humbly submit has been unfairly brought into disreputewe refer to the art of boxing good reader allow us to state that we do not advocate pugilism  we never saw a prizefight and have an utter abhorrence of the ring  we not only dislike the idea of seeing two men pommel each others faces into a jelly but we think the looking at such a sight tends to demoralise  there is a vast difference however between this and the use of the gloves by means of which a man may learn the useful art of selfdefence and may perhaps in the course of his life have the happiness of applying his knowledge to the defence of a mother a sister or a wife as well as self  if it be objectionable to use the gloves because they represent the fist then is it equally objectionable to use the foil because it represents the sword  but pray forgive this digression  ten to one in your case reader it is unnecessary because sensible people are more numerous than foolish  howbeit whether right or wrong will osten had as we have said acquired the by no means unimportant knowledge of where to hit and how to hit  he had also the good sense to discern when to hit and he invariably acted on the principal thatwhatever is worth doing is worth doing well  on the present occasion will walked suddenly up to the giant and without uttering a word planted upon his body two blows which are we believe briefly termed by the fancy onetwo  we do not pretend to much knowledge on this point but we are quite certain that number one lit upon the giants chest and took away his breath while number two fell upon his forehead and removed his senses  before he had time to recover either breath or senses number three ended the affair by flattening his nose and stretching his body on the sand  at this sudden and quite unexpected proceeding larry ohale burst into a mingled laugh and cheer which he appropriately concluded by springing on and flooring the man who stood opposite to him  muggins and the old salt were about to follow his example but their opponents turned and fled doubling on their tracks and making for the boat  larry muggins and old peter being thoroughly roused would have followed them regardless of consequences and undoubtedly would have been overpowered by numbers for the boat had just reached the shore had not will osten bounded ahead of them and turning round shouted energetically  follow me lads if you would be free  now or never  luckily the tone in which will said this impressed them so much that they stopped in their wild career and when they looked back and saw their young friend running away towards the woods as fast as his legs could carry him and heard the shout of the reinforced seamen as they started from the waters edge to give chase they hesitated no longer turning round they also fled  it is however due to larry ohale to say that he shook his fist at the enemy and uttered a complex howl of defiance before turning tail  well was it for all of them that day that the woods were near and that they were dense and intricate  old peter although a sturdy man and active for his years was not accustomed to running and had no wind for a race with young men  his comrades would never have deserted him so that all would have certainly been captured but for a fortunate accident  they had not run more than half a mile and their pursuers were gaining on them at every strideas they could tell by the sound of their voiceswhen will osten who led fell headlong into a deep hole that had been concealed by rank undergrowth  old peter who was close at his heels fell after him and larry who followed peter to encourage and spur him on also tumbled in  muggins alone was able to stop short in time  hallo boys he cried in a hoarse whisper are yer timbers damaged  broke to smithereens groaned larry from the abyss  will osten who had scrambled out in a moment cried hastily jump in muggins  ill lead em off the scent  stop till i return boys dye hear  ay ay said larry  away went will at right angles to their former course uttering a shout of defiance only just in time for the mate of the rover who led the chase was close on him  soon the sounds told those in hiding that the ruse had been successful  the sounds died away in the distance and the deep silence of the forest succeededbroken only now and then by the cry of some wild animal  meanwhile our hero used his legs so well that he not only left his pursuers out of sight and hearing behind but circled gradually around until he returned to the hole where his comrades lay  here they all remained for nearly an hour and then deeming themselves safe issued forth none the worse of their tumble  they commenced to return to the coast having settled that this was their wisest course and that they could easily avoid their late comrades by keeping well to the northward this deviation however was unfortunate  those who have tried it know well how difficult it is to find ones way in a dense forest  the more they attempted to get out of the wood the deeper they got into it and at length when night began to close in they were forced to come to the conclusion that they were utterly lostlost in the foresta livin example as larry ohale expressed it of the babes in the wood    chapter five  shows what the lost ones did and how they were found  the condition of being lost is a sad one in any circumstances but being lost in a foresta virgin foresta forest of unknown extent in a vast continent such as that of south america must be admitted to be a peculiarly severe misfortune  nevertheless we are bound to say that our hero and his friends did not appear to regard their lost condition in this light  perhaps their indifference arose partly from their ignorance of what was entailed in being lost in the forest  the proverb says that where ignorance is bliss tis folly to be wise  whether that be true or not there can be no question that it is sometimes an advantage to be ignorant  had our lost friends known the extent of the forest in which they were lost the number of its wild fourfooted inhabitants and the difficulties and dangers that lay before them it is certain that they could not have walked along as lightheartedly as they did and it is probable that they would have been less able to meet those difficulties and dangers when they appeared  be this as it may will osten and larry ohale muggins and old peter continued to wander through the forest after discovering that they were lost until the increasing darkness rendered further progress impossible then they stopped and sat down on the stump of a fallen tree  it is clear said our hero that we shall have to pass the night here for there is no sign of human habitation and the light is failing fast  thats so said muggins curtly  im afeard on it observed old peter with a sigh  faix i wouldnt mind spindin the night said larry av it wornt that weve got no grub  it would be some comfort to know the name o the country were lost in  i can tell you that larry said will osten we are in peru though what part of it i confess i do not know  peroo is it  well thats a comfortanyhow  i dont xacly see where the comfort o that lies said muggins  thats cause yer intellects is obtoose boy retorted larry dont ye know that its a blissin to know where ye are wotiver else ye dont know  supposin now a stranger shud ax me where are ye paddyov course i cud say at wance in peroo yer honour an if he shud go for to penetrate deeper into my knowledge o geography sure i cud tell him that peroo is in south ameriky wan o the five quarters o the globe dye see  but suppose for the sake of argyment as shikspur says that the stranger wos to ax ye wot ye knowd about peroo what ud ye say to that lad asked old peter  wot would i say  why id ax him with a look of offended dignity if he took me for a schoolmaster an then may be id ax him wot he knowd about it himselfan krekt him av he wos wrong  i can tell you this much about it at all events said will with a laugh that it is a republic and a celebrated country for gold mines  and i can add to yer information said old peter that theres an oncommon lot o tigers an other wild beasts in it and that if we would avoid bein eat up alive we must kindle a fire an go to sleep in a tree  by good luck ive got my flint and steel with me  by equal good luck i have two biscuits in my pocket said will come before we do anything else let us inquire into our resources  each man at once turned his pockets inside out with the following result  our hero besides two large coarse seabiscuits produced one of those useful knives which contain innumerable blades with pickers tweezers corkscrews and other indescribable implements also a notebook a pencil a small pocketcase of surgical instruments without which he never moved during his wanderings and a testamentthe one that had been given to him on his last birthday by his mother  old peter contributed to the general fund his flint steel and tindermost essential and fortunate contributionsand a huge claspknife  indeed we may omit the mention of knives in this record for each man possessed one as a matter of course  it was by no means a matter of course however but a subject of intense gratification to at least three of the party that muggins had two pipes and an unusually large supply of tobacco  larry also had a short black pipe and a picker besides a crooked sixpence which he always kept about him for luck a long piece of stout twine and a lump of cheese  the sum total was not great but was extremely useful in the circumstances  all this wealth having been collected together it was agreed that the biscuits cheese tobacco and pipes should be common property  they were accordingly divided with the utmost care by will who by the way did not require a pipe as he was not a smoker  we do not record this as an evidence of his superior purity  by no means  will osten we regret to say was not a man of strong principle  all the principle he had and the good feelings which actuated him were the result of his mothers teachingnot of his own seeking  he did not smoke because his mother had discouraged smoking thereforenot having acquired the habithe disliked it  thousands of men might and would have been free from this habit today had they been affectionately dissuaded from it in early youth  so too in reference to his testamentwill always carried it about with him not because he valued it much for its own sake or read it often but because it was the last gift he received from his mother  it reminded him of her besides it was small and did not take up much room in his pocket  blessed influence of mothers  if they only knew the greatness of their power and were more impressed with the importance of using it for the glory of god this would be a happier world  the costume of these wanderers like their small possessions was varied  all wore white duck trousers and blue guernsey or cotton shirts with souwesters or straw hats but the coats and cravats differed larry wore a rough pilotcloth coat and being eccentric on the point a scarlet cotton neckerchief  old peter wore a blue jacket with a black tie loosely fastened sailor fashion round his exposed throat muggins wore the dirty canvas jacket in which he had been engaged in scraping down the masts of the rover when he left her  will osten happened to have on a dark blue cloth shootingcoat and a white straw hat which was fortunate for being in reality the leader of the party it was well that his costume should accord with that responsible and dignified position  they had no weapons of any kind so their first care was to supply themselves with stout cudgels which each cut in proportion to his notions of the uses and capacities of such implementsthat of larry ohale being of course a genuine shillelah while the weapon cut by muggins was a close imitation of the club of hercules or of that used by the giant who was acquainted with the celebrated giantkiller named jack  now boys if were goin to ait and slaip the sooner we set about it the better observed larry rising and commencing to collect sticks for a fire  the others immediately followed his example and in a few minutes a bright blaze illuminated the dark recesses of the tangled forest while myriads of sparks rose into and hung upon the leafy canopy overhead  there was something cheering as well as romantic in this  it caused the wanderers to continue their work with redoubled vigour  soon a fire that would have roasted an ox whole roared and sent its forked tongues upwards  in the warm blaze of it they sat down to their uncommonly meagre supper of half a biscuit and a small bit of cheese eachwhich was washed down by a draught from a neighbouring stream  they had finished this and were in the act of lighting their pipes when a roar echoed through the woods which caused them to pause in their operations and glance uneasily at each other  sure its a tiger exclaimed larry  theres no tigers in them parts said muggins  i dont know that lad observed old peter  ive heard that there are jaguars an critters o that sort which is as big and as bad as tigers an goes by the name but praps  old peters observations were here cut short by the loud report of a gun close at hand  as if by instinct every man leaped away from the light of the fire and sheltered himself behind a tree  for some time they stood listening eagerly to every sound but no foe appeared nor was there a repetition of the shot  the longer they listened the more inclined were they to believe that their senses had deceived them and larry ohales heart was beginning to make a troublesome attack on his ribs as he thought of ghostsespecially foreign ghostswhen all eyes were attracted to a human form which appeared to flit to and fro among the tree stems in the distance as if to avoid the strong light of the fire  knowing that one man with a gun could make certain of shooting the whole party if he chose and that he would not be more likely to attempt violence if trust in his generosity were displayed will osten with characteristic impetuosity suddenly walked into the full blaze of the firelight and made signals to the stranger to approach  larry and the others although they disapproved of the rashness of their young leader were not the men to let him face danger alone  they at once joined him and awaited the approach of the apparition  it advanced slowly taking advantage of every bush and tree and keeping its piece always pointed towards the fire  they observed that it was black and partially naked  suddenly muggins exclaimedi do blieve its he paused  sure its the niggeroch av it isnt bunco cried larry  bunco it was sure enough and the moment he perceived that he was recognised he discarded all precaution walked boldly into the encampment and shook them all heartily by the hand    chapter six  bunco becomes a friend in need and indeed and larry comes to grief in a small way  sure yer face is a sight for sore eyes though it is black and ugly exclaimed larry as he wrung the hand of the goodhumoured native who grinned from ear to ear with delight at having found his friends  wot ever brought ye here inquired muggins  mine legses replied bunco with a twinkle in his coalblack eyes  yer legses eh repeated muggins in a tone of sarcasmso i supposes for its on them that a man usually goeses but what caused you for to desart the ship  cause i no want for be pyrit more nor yourself mister muggles  muggins you lump of ebonydont miscall me  well dat be all sameonly a litil bit more ogly retorted bunco with a grin an me no want to lose sight ob doctor osn here me come for to show him how to go troo de forest  thats right my good fellow cried will with a laugh slapping the native on the shoulder you have just come in the nick of time to take care of us all for besides having utterly lost ourselves we are quite ignorant of forest ways in this regionno better than children in fact  true for ye boy riglar babes in the wood as i said before added larry ohale  well that being the case continued will you had better take command at once bunco and show us how to encamp for we have finished our pipes and a very light supper and would fain go to sleep  its a pity you did not arrive sooner my poor fellow for we have not a scrap of food left for you and your gun will be of no use till daylight  to this bunco replied by displaying his teeth and giving vent to a low chuckle while he lifted the flap of his peajacket and exhibited three fat birds hanging at the belt with which he supported his nether garments  hooray shouted larry seizing one of the birds and beginning to pluck it good luck to your black mug well ait it right off  thats your sort cried muggins whose mouth watered at the thought of such a delightful addition to his poor supper  hand me one of em larry and ill pluck it  larry obeyed old peter seized and operated on the last bird and bunco raked the embers of the fire together while will osten looked on and laughed  in a very few minutes the three birds were plucked and cleaned and larry in virtue of his office was going to cook them when will suggested that he had better resign in favour of bunco who was doubtless better acquainted than himself with the best modes of forest cookery  to this larry objected a little at first but he was finally prevailed on to give in and bunco went to work in his own fashion  it was simple enough  first he cut three short sticks and pointed them at each end then he split each bird open and laying it flat thrust a stick through it and stuck it up before the glowing fire to roast  when one side was pretty well done he turned the other and while that was cooking cut off a few scraps from the halfroasted side and tried them  we need scarcely add that none of the party were particular  the birds were disposed of in an incredibly short time and then the pipes were refilled for a second smoke  how comes it inquired will when this process was going on that you managed to escape and to bring a gun away with you  we would not have left the ship without you but our own escape was a sudden affair we scarcely expected to accomplish it at the time we did  i suppose you had a sharp run for it  run ductor no me no runme walk away quite comfrabil an tooked what me please see here  as he spoke bunco opened a small canvas bag which no one had taken notice of up to that moment and took from it a large quantity of broken biscuit a lump of salt beef several cocoanuts a horn of gunpowder and a bag of shot and ballall of which he spread out in front of the fire with much ostentation  the satisfaction caused by this was very great and even muggins in the fulness of his heart declared that after all there were worse things than being lost in a forest  well and how did you manage to get away said will returning to the original question  git away why dis here wos de way  when me did see the rincumcoshindy goin on ashore me say now bunco you time come look alive so wen de raskil called de fuss mate orders out de boat in great hurry me slip into it like one fish  then dey all land an go off like mad into de woods arter youas you do knows  ob coorse me stop to look arter de boat you knows it would

satisfactory account of yourself said will osten  an purtily towld observed larry where did ye larn english boy for ye have the brogue parfict as me granmother used to say to the pig when she got in her dotage me granmother not the pig only says she the words isnt quite distinc  couldnt ye give us a skitch o yer life bunco  thus appealed to the gratified native began without hesitation and gave the following account of himself  me dun know when me was born  faix it wasnt yesterday said larry interrupting  no nor de day before tomorrow nother retorted bunco but it was in callyforny anyhow  me fadder him wos a injin  oh come interrupted muggins in a remonstrative tone  yis him wos a injin repeated bunco stoutly  wos he a steamingine inquired muggins with a slight touch of sarcasm  he means an indian muggins explained will  then why dont he say wot he means  however go ahead ebony  hims wos a injin resumed bunco ant me moder him wos a spanish halfbreed from dis yer countryperu  me live for years in de forests an plains an mountains ob callyforny huntin an fightin  oh dem were de happy days  after dat me find a wife what i lub berry moche den me leave her for short time an go wid tradin party to de coast here meet wid a capn of ship wot wos a big raskil  him tice me aboord an sail away  short ob hands him wos so him took me an me never see me wife no more  there was something quite touching in the tone in which the poor fellow said this insomuch that larry became sympathetic and abused the captain who had kidnapped him in no measured terms  had larry known that acts similar to this wicked and heartless one were perpetrated by traders in the south seas very frequently he would have made his terms of abuse more general  how long ago was that inquired old peter  tree year sighed bunco  since dat day i hab bin in two tree ships but nebber run away cause why wots de use ob run away on island only now me got on sout meriky which me know is not far from nord meriky an me bin here before wid me moder so kin show you how to goand speak spanish toome moder speak dat you sees but mesilf larn english aboord two tree ships an so speak him fust rate now  so ye do boy said larry whose sympathetic heart was drawn towards the unfortunate and illused native an faix well go on travellin through this forest till we comes to callyforny an finds your missus so cheer up bunco and let us see how were to go to roost for it seems that we must slaip on a tree this night  during the course of the conversation which we have just detailed the wild denizens of the forest had been increasing their dismal cries and the seamen unused to such sounds had been kept in a state of nervous anxiety which each did his utmost to conceal  they were all brave men but it requires a very peculiar kind of bravery to enable a man to sit and listen with cool indifference to sounds which he does not understand issuing from gloomy recesses at his back where there are acknowledged though unknown dangers close at hand  bunco therefore grinning goodhumouredly as usual rose and selected a gigantic tree as their dormitory  the trunk of this tree spread out a few feet above its base into several branches any one of which would have been deemed a large tree in england and these branches were again subdivided into smaller stems with a network of foliage which rendered it quite possible for a man to move about upon them with facility and to find a convenient couch herethe fire at the foot of the tree having been replenishedeach man sought and found repose  it was observed that larry ohale made a large soft couch below the tree on the ground  youre not going to sleep there larry said will osten on observing what he was about  why the tigers will be picking your bones before morning if you do  och  im not afraid of em replied larry howsever i do main to slaip up the tree if i can  that night some time after all the party had been buried in profound repose they were awakened by a crash and a tremendous howl just below them  each started up and pushing aside the leaves gazed anxiously down  a dark object was seen moving below and bunco was just going to point his gun at it when a gruff voice was heard to say  arrah didnt i know it  its famous ive bin since i was a mere boy for rowlin about in me slaip an sure the branch of a tree is only fit for a bird after all  but good luck to yer wisdom an foresight larry ohale for yeve come down soft anyhow an if theres anythingll cure ye o this bad habitslaipin on treesll do it in the coorse o time i make no doubt wotiver    chapter seven  wherein are recounted dangers difficulties and perplexities faced and overcome  next morning the travellers rose with the sun and descended from the tree in which they had spent the nightmuch refreshed and ready for anything  it was well that they were thus prepared for whatever might befall them for there were several incidents in store for them that day which tried them somewhat and would have perplexed them sadly had they been without a guide  perhaps we are scarcely entitled to bestow that title on bunco for he was as thoroughly lost in the forest as were any of his companions in the sense at least of being ignorant as to where he was or how far from the nearest human habitation but he was acquainted with forestlife knew the signs and symptoms of the wilderness and could track his way through pathless wastes in a manner that was utterly incomprehensible to his companions and could not be explained by himself  moreover he was a shrewd fellow as well as bold and possessed a strong sense of humour which he did not fail at times to gratify at the expense of his friends  this tendency was exhibited by him in the first mornings march during which he proved his superiority in woodcraft and firmly established himself in the confidence of the party  the incident occurred thus  after a hearty and hasty breakfastfor being lost they were all anxious to get found as soon as possiblethey set forth in single file bunco leading old peter muggins and larry following and will osten bringing up the rear  during the first hour they walked easily and pleasantly enough through level and rather open woodland where they met few obstacles worth mentioning so that larry and muggins whose minds were filled with the idea of wild beasts and who were much excited by the romance of their novel position kept a sharp lookout on the bushes right and left the one shouldering his gigantic cudgel the other flourishing his shillelah in a humorous freeandeasy way and both feeling convinced that with such weapons they were more than a match for any tiger alive  when several hours had elapsed however without producing any sign or sound of game they began to feel disappointment and to regard their guide as an exaggerator if not worse and when in course of time the underwood became more dense and their passage through the forest more difficult they began to make slighting remarks about their darkskinned friend and to question his fitness for the duties of guide  in particular mugginswho was becoming fatigued owing partly to the weight of his club as well as to the weight of his body and the shortness of his legsat last broke out on him and declared that he would follow no further  why said he gruffly its as plain as the nose on yer nutmeg face that yere steerin a wrong coorse  youll never make the coast on this tack  oh yis wees will replied bunco with a quiet smile  no wees wont ye lump o mahogany retorted muggins  dont the coast run nor and by west here away  troo assented bunco with a nod  well and aint we goin due north just now so that the coast lies away on our left an for the last three hours youve bin bearin away to the right something like nor and by east if its not nor east an by east the coast being all the while on yer port beam you grampusthats so aint it  yis dats so replied bunco with a grin  then shiver my timbers why dont ye shove yer helm hard a starboard an lay yer right coorse  come lads ill go to the wheel now for a spell  will osten was about to object to this but bunco gave him a peculiar glance which induced him to agree to the proposal so muggins went ahead and the rest followed  at the place where this dispute occurred there chanced to be a stretch of comparatively open ground leading away to the left  into this glade the hardy seamen turned with an air of triumph  his triumph however was shortlived for at a turn in the glade he came to a place where the underwood was so dense and so interlaced with vines and creeping plants that further advance was absolutely impossible  after yawing about for some minutes in search of a channel as larry expressed it muggins suddenly gave in and exclaimedim a dutchman boys if we hant got embayed  its let go the anchor an take soundins ll be the nixt order i spose captain muggins said larry touching his cap  or let the tother pilot take the helm said old peter hes all my fancy painted him as milton says in paraphrases lost  right peter cried will osten we must dethrone muggins and reinstate bunco  ha yous willin for to do second fiddil now said the native turning with a grin to muggins as he was about to resume his place at the head of the party  no never ye leatherjawed kangaroo but ive no objections to do the drum on yer skull with this for a drumstick  he flourished his club as he spoke and bunco bounding away with a laugh led the party back on their track for a few paces then turning sharp to the right he conducted them into a narrow opening in the thicket and proceeded in a zigzag manner that utterly confused poor muggins inducing him from that hour to resign himself with blind faith to the guidance of his conqueror  well would it be for humanity in general and for rulers in particular if there were more of mugginss spirit abroad inducing men to give in and resign cheerfully when beaten fairly  if the sailors were disappointed at not meeting with any wild creatures during the first part of their walk they were more than compensated by the experiences of the afternoon  while they were walking quietly along several snakessome of considerable lengthwriggled out of their path and larry trod on one which twirled round his foot causing him to leap off the ground like a grasshopper and utter a yell compared to which all his previous shoutings were like soft music  bunco calmed his fears however and comforted the party by saying that these snakes were harmless  nevertheless they felt a strong sensation of aversion to the reptiles which it was not easy to overcome and muggins began to think seriously that being lost in the forest was after all a pleasure mingled considerably with alloy  not long after the incident of the snake strange sounds were heard from time to time in the bushes and all the party except bunco began to glance uneasily from side to side and grasped their weapons firmly  suddenly a frightfullooking face was observed by larry peeping through the bushes right over mugginss unconscious head  the horrified irishman who thought it was no other than a visitant from the world of fiends was going to utter a shout of warning when a long hairy arm was stretched out from the bushes and mugginss hat was snatched from his head  och ye spalpeen cried larry hurling his cudgel at the ugly creature  the weapon was truly aimed it hit the monkey on the back causing it to drop the hat and vanish from the spotshrieking  well done larry cried will osten why didnt you warn us to expect visits from such brutes bunco  why cause me tink you know all bout im  hab larn im from jo gruffy  from who  from jo gruffy  him as you was say last night do tell all bout de countries ob de world and wot sort of treeses an hanimals in im  der be plenty ob dem hanimalshow you call im mongkees in peroo big an leetil  well exclaimed our hero with a laugh possibly geography may refer to the fact if so i had forgotten it but im sorry to hear that they are numerous for they are much too bold to be pleasant companions  dey do us no harm said bunco grinning only chok full ob fun  git along wid ye cried larry  its my belaif theyre yer own relations or ye wouldnt stick up for them  thus admonished the native resumed the march and led them through the jungle into deeper and darker shades  here the forest was quite free from underwood and the leafy canopy overhead was so dense that the sky could seldom be seen  everything appeared to be steeped in a soft mellow shade of yellowish green which was delightfully cool and refreshing in a land lying so very near to the equator  the howling and hoarse barking of wild beasts was now heard to an extent that fully satisfied larry ohale and his friend muggins  there were patches of dense jungle here and there in which it was supposed the animals lay concealed and each of these were carefully examined by our travellers that there was need for caution became apparent from the fact that bunco carried his gun at full cock in the hollow of his left arm and had a stern earnest expression of visage which was quite new to his nautical companions and made a deep impression on them  curious and interesting change of sentimentthe man whom while at sea they had treated with goodhumoured contempt was ere long clung to and regarded almost with reverence  be quiet boys here he said an no make noise  keep de eyes open  after this he did not speak but gave his directions by signs    chapter eight  in which bunco displays uncommon valour and tigers come to grief  advancing cautiously the travellers arrived at the brink of a dark ravine in the bottom of which there was a good deal of brushwood with here and there several pools of water  they had remained a short time here on the top of the bank listening to the various barks and cries of the wild animals around them when their attention was arrested by several loud yelps which sounded as if some creature were approaching them fast  bunco signed to them to stoop and follow him  they did so and had not advanced a hundred yards when the loud clatter of hoofs was heard  bunco crouched instantly and held his gun in readiness while his black eyes glittered and his expressive features seemed to blaze with eagerness  his followers also crouched among the bushes and each grasped his club with a feeling that it was but a poor weapon of defence after allthough better than nothing  they had not to wait long for in a few minutes a beautiful black wild horse came racing like the wind along the clear part of the ravine in the direction of the place where they were concealed  the magnificent creature was going at his utmost speed being pursued by a large tiger and the steam burst from his distended nostrils while his voluminous mane and tail waved wildly in the air  the tiger gained on him rapidly its bounds were tremendous at each leap it rose several feet from the ground  the poor horse was all but exhausted for he slipped and came down on his knees when abreast of and not thirty yards distant from the place where the travellers lay  the tiger did not miss his opportunity  he crouched and ran along with the twisting motion of a huge cat then he sprang a clear distance of twenty feet and alighted on the horses back seizing him by the neck with a fearful growl  now came buncos opportunity  while the noble horse reared and plunged violently in a vain attempt to get rid of his enemy the cautious native took a steady aim and was so long about it that some of the party nearly lost patience with him  at last he fired and the tiger fell off the horse rolling and kicking about in all directionsevidently badly wounded  the horse meanwhile galloped away and was soon lost to view  instead of loading and firing again bunco threw down his gun and drawing a long knife rushed in upon his victim  his comrades who thought him mad sprang after him but he had closed with the tiger and plunged his knife into it before they came up  the creature uttered a tremendous roar and writhed rapidly about throwing up clouds of dust from the dry ground while bunco made another dash at him and a plunge with his long knife but he missed the blow and fell  his comrades closed in and brandished their clubs but the rapid motions of man and beast rendered it impossible for them to strike an effective blow without running the risk of hitting the man instead of the tiger  in the midst of a whirlwind of dust and leaves and a tempest of roars and yells the bold native managed to drive his knife three times into the animals side when it rolled over with a savage growl and expired  are ye hurt bunco inquired will osten with much anxiety when the man rose covered with dust and blood and stood before them  no moche hurt only scrash a bit  scratched a bit exclaimed larry its torn to tatters ye ought to be for bein so venturesome  thats so said muggins ye shouldnt ha done it bunco what would have comed of us if yed bin killed eh  oh dat am noting said bunco drawing himself up proudly me hab kill lots of dem before but dis one hims die hard  will osten who was anxious to ascertain whether the man had really escaped serious injury put a stop to the conversation by hurrying him off to the nearest pool and washing his wounds  they proved as he had said to be triflingonly a slight bite on the shoulder and a few tears by the animals claws on the arms and thighs  when these were dressed bunco went to work actively to skin the tigeran operation which he performed with great expedition and then having rolled it into a convenient bundle and slung it on his back he reloaded his gun and again resumed his duties as guide  they had not gone far when a fierce growling behind them told that other wild animals probably tigers had scented out the carcass of the slain animal and were already quarrelling over their meal  shortly after this they came suddenly and quite unexpectedly on a house or hut which turned out to be the residence of a man who was half spaniard half indian  the man received them kindly and finding that bunco could speak spanish offered them hospitality with great politeness and evident satisfaction  good luck to e boy said larry when their host invited them to partake of a substantial meal to which he had been about to sit down when they arrived its myselfll be proud to welcome ye to ould ireland if iver ye come that way  ask him bunco said will osten where we are how far we are from the coast and what is the name and distance of the nearest town  to these questions the spaniard replied that they were in the northern part of the republic of ecuador and not as they had supposed in peru which lay some hundreds of miles to the southward that a couple of days walking would bring them to the coast and that in two days more they could reach the town of tacames  this being one of the few ports on the western coast of south america where vessels touched was a place from which they might probably be able to make their way to california he added that there was a rumour of gold having been discovered of late in that region but for his part he didnt believe it for he had heard the same rumour several times before and nothing had ever come of it at least as far as he knew  yere wrong there intirely mister whatsyername said larry ohale pausing for a moment in the midst of his devotion to the good things spread before him  sure its my own brother ted as wos out there a year gone by an he swore he picked up goold like stones an putt them in his pocket but the capting o the ship he sailed in towld him it wos brass an his mates laughed at him to that extint that he flung it all overboord in a passion  faix ive made up my mind that there is goold in callyforny and that wan larry ohale is distined for to make his fortin thereso ill throuble ye for another hunk o that pottimus or wotiver ye call it  prime prog it is anyhow  an earnest discussion here followed as to the probability of gold having been found in california and whether it was worth their while to try their fortune in that direction  during the course of the meal the spaniard incidentally mentioned that on the previous night a tiger had broken into his enclosure and injured a bullock so badly that he had been obliged to kill it and he had little doubt the same beast would pay him another visit that night  this was good news to the travellers all of whom were keenthough not all expertsportsmen  as evening had already set in they begged to be allowed to rest for a little so as to be ready for the tiger when he came  their host at once conducted them into a small room where several hammocks were suspended from the walls  into these they quickly jumped and in a few minutes the concert played by their noses told a tale of sweet repose after a day of unusual toil  for several hours they slept and then the spaniard awoke them with the information that the tiger was coming  up they sprang as a matter of course and with considerable noise too but bunco soon impressed them with the necessity of being quiet  the spaniard had only two guns one of which he handed to will osten  the seamen were of necessity left to be spectators  it is necessary here to describe the spaniards hut which was peculiar as to its architecture  it was a mere shed made of bamboo canes closely placed together and roofed with large cocoa and other leaves  the floor was of rough boards covered with matting  the whole structure stood on the top of a number of strong posts about twelve or fourteen feet from the ground and the entrance was gained by a ladder which could be drawn up at night  the object of this great elevation and the ladder was protection from the nocturnal visit of wild beasts such as tigers or jaguars as well as monkeys of a large size  in the door of this hut there was a hole of about two feet square at which the host stationed himself with the muzzle of his gun thrust through it  two smaller holes in the walls which served for windows were used on the present occasion as loopholes by will osten and bunco  perfect silence was maintained for about half an hour  the sky was cloudless and the moon full  not a breath of wind stirred a leaf of the forest that encircled the small clearing  the buzz of mosquitoes or the flapping about of a huge bat alone disturbed the silence of the night and the watchers were beginning to fear it would turn out to be a false alarm when the cattle in the yard began to low in a quick yet mournful tone  they knew full well that their enemy was at hand  a few minutes that appeared an age of anxiety followed  then some bullocks that had been purposely fastened near the hut began to bellow furiously another instant and the tiger cleared the fence with a magnificent bound alighted in the yard and crouched for a spring  the moon shone full in his glaring eyeballs making his head a splendid target  three shots crashed out in one report and with a roar that would have done credit to the monarch of the african wilderness this king of the western forest fell down and died  he was a fullgrown tiger with a beautifully marked skin which bunco was not long in stripping from the carcass while the spaniard who was highly delighted by this success set about preparing breakfast  they were all too much excited to think of going to bed again and besides it was within an hour of daybreak  during the morning will osten persuaded his host to give him one of his old guns in exchange for a beautiful silvermounted hunting knife which was the only article of value that he happened to possess  with this useful addition to their arms the travellers resumed their journey shortly after dawn being convoyed several miles on their way by their amiable host  they parted from him finally with much regret and many professions of gratitude and esteem especially from larry who in the fulness of his impulsive nature reiterated his pressing invitation to pay him a visit in his swait little cabin in the bog of clonave county westmeath ould ireland  we will not drag the reader through every step of the rough and adventurous journey which was accomplished by our travellers in the succeeding week during which they became so familiar with tigers that muggins thought no more of their roaring than he did of the mewing of cats while larry actually got the length of kicking the sarpints out of his way although he did express his conviction now and then that the counthry wos mightily in want of a visit from saint patrick  they travelled steadily and surely under the guidance of the faithful bunco through tangled brake and wild morass and dense forest and many a mile of sandy plain until at length they reached the small town and port of tacames into which they entered one sultry afternoon footsore and weary with their clothes torn almost to tatters and without a single coinof any realm whateverin their pockets  well here we are at last said will osten with a sigh  true for ye responded larry  thats so said muggins  its all well as ends well which wos billy cowpers opinion observed old peter  bunco made no remark but he gave a quiet grunt which might have meant anythingor nothingas they entered the town    chapter nine  describes a surgical operation and records the deliberations of a council  the town of tacames in the republic of ecuador is not large neither is it important to the world but it appeared both large and important in the eyes of our hero and his comrades  in their circumstances any town would have been regarded as a city of refuge and their joy on arriving was not much if at all marred by the smallness and the poor appearance of the town which at that time consisted of about twenty houses  they were built on the top of posts about twelve or fourteen feet from the groundlike the hut of the spaniard already described because being closely walled in by a dense jungle tigers and huge monkeys were bold enough to pay the inhabitants nocturnal and unwelcome visits very frequently  a curiouslooking place observed will osten as they drew near  so would the natives obsarve of london or liverpool said old peter  with less cause however replied will  that depends on taste retorted old peter  be no manes put in larry it neither depinds on taste nor smell but feelinsee now heres how it is  we being in tickamis feels it coorious well av the natives here wos in london they would feel it coorious  its all a matter o feelin dye seewan o the five senses  wot a muddlehead you are larry growled muggins ye dont even know that theres six senses  only five said the irishman firmlyseein hearin tastin smellin and feelin wots the sixth sense  one that you are chock full ofits nonsense replied muggins  think o that now exclaimed larry with a broad grin sure i wint an forgot it an the sevinth wan too called common sense of which muggins you havent got no more in yer skull than a bluefaced baboon hallo wots that  is it a wild baist on its hindlegs or only a mad man  he pointed as he spoke to a man who approached them from the town and whose appearance as well as his actions were well calculated to surprise them  he was a finelooking man of gigantic size with a poncho over his shoulders and a spanishlooking sombrero on his head but the most curious thing about him was his gait  at one moment he sauntered holding his face between both hands next moment he bent double and appeared to stamp with his feet  then he hurried forward a few paces but paused abruptly bent down and stamped again  presently he caught sight of the travellers  at once his antics ceased  he raised himself erect and advancing quickly lifted his sombrero and saluted them with the air of a prince  will osten addressed him in english and to his surprise as well as gratification the spaniard replied in the same tongue which he spoke however in a most remarkable way having learned it chiefly from the skippers of those vessels that touched at the port  i sall be happy to offer you hospitabilities gentelmans said don diegofor so he styled himself  if you vill come to meen house you vill grub there  the grin of unnatural ferocity which don diego put on while he spoke surprised and perplexed the travellers not a little but he suddenly explained the mystery by clutching his hair setting his teeth and muttering wildly while he gave a quick stamp with his foot  skuse me gentelmans i got most desperable tack of toothick  will osten attempted to console don diego by telling him that he was a surgeon and that if he could only obtain a pair of pincers he would soon remedy that evil but the spaniard shook his head and assured him that there was a miserable man in the town calling himself a vendor of physic who had already nearly driven him mad by attempting several times to pull the tooth but in vain  indeed said the don the last time he have try i fraid i shut up won of his days lightit was so sore  will osten ultimately persuaded the spaniard however to consent to an operation and the whole party accompanied him to his house which was the most substantial in the town  leaving his comrades there will went with bunco in search of the apothecary whom he soon found and who readily lent him a pair of forceps with which he returned to the residence of don diego  considering his size will deemed it advisable to have larry and muggins standing by ready to hold him if he should prove obstreperous  this was a wise precaution for the moment will began to pull at the obstinate grinder the gigantic don began to roar and then to struggle  the tooth was terribly firm  will did not wonder that the native dentist had failed  the first wrench had no effect on it  the seconda very powerful onewas equally futile but it caused don diego to roar hideously and to kick so will gave a nod to his assistants who unceremoniously seized the big man in their iron gripe and held him fast  then our hero threw all his strength into a final effort and the tooth came out with a crash and along with it a terrible yell from don diego who sent larry and muggins staggering against the wall  the relief experienced by the poor man was almost instantaneous as soon as he could speak he thanked will in fervid spanish and with genuine gratitude  it is interesting to observe how often matters of apparently slight moment in human affairs form turningpoints which lead to important results  the incident which we have just related caused don diego to entertain such kindly feelings towards will osten that he not only invited him to stay at his house with his companions during their residence in tacames but insisted on his accepting a very large fee for the service he had rendered him  of course this was not objected to in the circumstances but a still better piece of good fortune than this befell the wanderers  will found that a number of the inhabitants had been attacked with dysentery and that the ignorance of the vendor of physic was so great that he could do nothing for them except make a few daring experiments which were eminently unsuccessful  to these poor invalids our embryo doctor was so useful that after a few days dosing with proper medicine their health and spirits began to improve rapidly and their gratitude was such that they heaped upon him every delicacy that the place afforded such as bananas plantains oranges lemons pumpkins melons sweet potatoes beef goats flesh venison and pork besides filling his pockets with doubloons  thus it came to pass that from absolute destitution will and his comrades suddenly leaped into a condition of comparative affluence  at the end of a week a council was called to discuss future proceedings  the council chamber was as usual the forest and spanish cigarettes assisted the deliberations  will being called to the chair which was a tree stump opened the proceedings by propounding the question what shall we do now for of course we must not trespass too long on the hospitality of don diego  i dont see why we shudnt said larry praps hell have another touch o toothache an ll want another grinder tuck out  that may be nevertheless it behoves us to fix our future plans without delay  as there are no vessels in port just now and we cannot tell when any will arrive it is worth while considering whether we cannot travel by land also we must decide whether california or england is to be our destination  i vote for callyforny said larry ohale with much energy  goold for ever is my motto  make our fortunes right off go home take villas in ould ireland an kape our carriages wid flunkeys an maidservants an such like  sure av we cant get by say we can walk  if i had wings which is wot i havent said muggins with slow precision of utterance i might fly over the andes likewise the atlantic to england or if i had legs ten fathoms long i might walk to callyforny but havin only short legs more used to the sea than to the land i votes for stoppin where we are for some time an praps a sail will heave in sight an take us off dye see  ho exclaimed bunco with a nod of approval and wees kin go huntin for amoosement in de meaninwhiles  its my opinion sir observed old peter that as were all dependent on the money earned by yourself the least we can do is to leave you to settle the matter of when we start and where we go  what say you mates  a general assent being given to this will osten decided that they should remain where they were for a week or a fortnight longer in the hope of a vessel arriving and that in the meantime as suggested by bunco they should amuse themselves by going on a hunting expedition  in accordance with this plan they immediately set about making preparation for a start by borrowing from their host two small canoes each made of the trunk of a large tree hollowed out  bunco acted as steersman in one of these  will osten after a few hours practice deemed himself sufficiently expert to take the post of honour in the other and then bidding adieu to don diego and embarking with their guns and a large supply of ammunition and provisions they commenced the ascent of the river tacames little thinking that some of the party would never descend that river or see don diego again    chapter ten  hunting in the wilds of ecuador  there is something very delightful and exhilarating in the first start on a hunting expedition into a wild and almost unknown region  after one gets into the thick of it the thoughts are usually too busy and too much in earnest with the actual realities in hand to permit of much rambling into the regions of romancewe say much because there is always some rambling of this sortbut during the first day before the actual work has well begun while the adventures are as yet only anticipated and the mind is free to revel in imaginings of what is possible and probable there is a wild exultation which swells the heart and induces an irresistible tendency to shout  indeed on the present occasion some of the party did shout lustily in order to vent their feelings and larry ohale in particular caused the jungle to echo so loudly with the sounds of his enthusiasm that the affrighted apes and jaguars must have trembled in their skins if they were possessed of ordinary feelings  the scenery with its accompaniments was most beautiful and interesting  the river a narrow one flowed through a dense and continuous forest rich and lofty trees overarched it affording agreeable shade and on the branches were to be seen great numbers of kingfishers parrots and other birds of rich plumage which filled the air at least with sound if not with melody  the concert was further swelled by the constant cries of wild beastssuch as the howl of a tiger or the scream of a monkey  but there is no pleasure without some alloy  on this river mosquitoes were the alloy  these tormenting creatures persecuted the hunters by night as well as by day for they are amongst the few insects which indulge in the pernicious habit of never going to bed  we cannot indeed say authoritatively that mosquitoes never sleep but we can and do say that they torment human beings and rob them of their sleep if possible without intermission  larry ohale being of a fiery nature was at first driven nearly to distraction and as he said himself he did little else than slap his own face day and night in trying to kill the little varmints muggins bore up stoically and all of them became callous in course of time  fish of many kinds were seen in the clear water and their first success in the sporting way was the spearing of two fine mullet  soon after this incident a herd of brown deer were seen to rush out of the jungle and dash down an open glade with noses up and antlers resting back on their necks  a shot from buncos gun alarmed but did not hit them for bunco had been taken by surprise and was in an unstable canoe  before the deer had disappeared two or three loud roars were heard  quick go ashore whispered bunco running his canoe in among the overhanging bushes and jumping out  three tigers bounded at that moment from the jungle in pursuit of the deer  bunco took rapid aim but his old flint gun missed fire luckily will osten having followed his example was ready  he fired and one of the tigers fell mortally wounded  before he could wriggle into the jungle bunco ran up and put a bullet into his brain  this was a splendid beginning and the hunters were loud in their congratulations of each other while bunco skinned the tiger  but the reader must not suppose that we intend to chronicle every incident of this kind  we record this as a specimen of their work during the following three weeks  they did not indeed shoot a tiger daily but they bagged several within that period besides a number of deer and other game  we must hasten however to tell of an event which put a sudden stop to our heros hunting at that time and resulted in the breakingup of that hitherto united and harmonious party  one evening a little before sunset they came upon a small clearing in the midst of which was a little house erected in the usual way upon wooden legs  the hunters found to their surprise that it was inhabited by an englishman named gordon who received them with great hospitality and evident pleasure  he lived almost alone having only one negro manservant whose old mother performed the duties of housekeeper  here they passed the night in pleasant intercourse with a man who besides being a countrymanand therefore full of interest about england from which he heard regularly but at long intervalswas remarkably intelligent and had travelled in almost every quarter of the globe  as to his motive for secluding himself in such a wild spot they did not presume to inquire and never found it out  next day they bade their host adieu promising to make a point of spending another night in his house on their return  our hunters had not gone far when a growl in one of the bushes induced them to land and search for the growler  they found him in the person of a large tiger which will osten caught a glimpse of sneaking away with the lithe motions of a gigantic cat  a hurried shot wounded the beast which instead of flying turned round suddenly and with a bound alighted on our heros shoulders  the shock hurled him violently to the ground during the momentary but terrific struggle for life that followed will had presence of mind to draw his huntingknife and plunge it twice deep into the tigers side but the active claws of the creature tore his thighs and arms several large bloodvessels were injured the light faded from the eyes of wandering will his strong arm lost its cunning and in the midst of a loud report mingled with a roar like thunder in his ears he fainted away  when will recovered his senses he found himself stretched on his back on a low couch in a hut with a man kneeling over him and his comrades gazing into his face with expressions of deep anxiety  will attempted to speak but could not then he tried to move and in doing so fainted  on recovering consciousness he observed that no one was near him except larry ohale who lay extended at his side looking through the open doorway of the hut while a series of the most seraphic smiles played on his expressive countenance  it would have been an interesting study to have watched the irishman on that occasion  just before will osten opened his eyes he was looking into his pale face with an expression that was ludicrously woebegone the instant he observed the slightest motion in his patient however he became suddenly abstracted and gazed as we have said with a seraphic expression through the doorway  poor larry acted thus in order to avoid alarming his patient by his looks but in spite of his utmost caution will caught him in the transition state which so tickled his risible faculties that he burst into a laugh which only got the length of a sigh however and nearly produced another fainting fit  ah then darlin whispered larry with the tenderness of a woman dont do it now  sure yell go off again av ye do  kape quiet dear  tis all right yell be in a day or two  bad luck to the baist that did it  this latter remark brought the scene of the tigerhunt suddenly to wills remembrance and he whispered for he had not strength to speak aloud  was he killed  who saved me  kilt cried larry forgetting his caution in his excitement faix he was an bunco did it tooblissins on his dirty faceputt the ball betune his two eyes an took the laist bit of skin off yer own nose but the blood was spoutin from ye like wather an if it hadnt bin that the cliver feller knowed all about tyin up anthere honey i wint an forgotdont mind meoch sure hes off again  this was true  our hero had lost almost the last drop of blood that he could spare with the slightest chance of recovery and the mere exertion of listening was too much for him  for many weeks he lay in the hut of that hospitable englishman slowly but gradually returning from the brink of the grave and during this period he found his host to be a friend in need not only to his torn and weak body but also to his soul  day after day gordon sat beside his couch with unwearied kindness chatting to him about the old country telling him anecdotes of his former life and gradually leading him to raise his thoughts from the consideration of time to eternity  will osten like every unconverted man rebelled at this at first but gordon was not a man to be easily repulsed  he did not force religious thoughts on will but his own thoughts were so saturated if we may say so with religion that he could not avoid the subject and his spirit and manner were so winning that our hero was at last pleased to listen  wills recovery was slow and tedious  before he was able to leave gordons cottage his independent spirit was subdued by the spirit of god and he was enabled to exchange slavery to self for freedom in the service of jesus christ  for many a day after that did will osten lie helpless on his couch perusing with deep interest the testament given to him by his mother when he left home  during this period his companions did not forsake him but spent their time in hunting and conveying the proceeds to tacames where they disposed of them profitably  on one of these occasions they found that an english ship had touched at the port in passing and among other things larry brought a number of old newspapers to the invalid  among the first that he opened will read the announcement of the sudden death of his own father  no information was given beyond the usual and formal statement with the simple addition of the words deeply regretted  we need not say that this was a terrible shock to the poor wanderera shock which was rendered all the more severe when he reflected that he had parted from his father in anger  in his weak condition will could not bear up under the blow and for some days he lay in such a depressed state of mind and body that his comrades began to fear for his life  but after that he rallied and a sudden improvement took place in his health  one day he called his companions round him and said  friends i have resolved to leave you and return to europe  you know my reasons  i am not a companion but only a drag upon you besides my mother is left unprotected  you will excuse me if i decline to enter into a discussion on this point  i have not strength for it and my resolve is fixed  will paused and larry ohale with a leer on his countenance asked by what road he meant to travel  across the andes to the northern coast of south america answered will smiling  an you as waik as wather with legs like the pins of a watherwagtail  that will soon mend said will jumping up and pulling on his clothes get ready to go out hunting with me larry if you have a mind to  despite the remonstrances of his friend will osten went out with his gun trembling with weakness at every step  he was soon induced to return to the cottage but his resolve was fixed  next day he went out again and finally in the course of a week or two had recovered so much of his old vigour that he felt able to set out on his journey  of course there were many disputings and arguings as to who should go with him but it was finally agree that larry and bunco should be his companions  indeed these two would take no denial and vowed that if he declined to accept of them as comrades they would follow him as a rearguard  muggins and old peter decided that they would return to tacames and make their way thence to california  just before parting larry took muggins aside and said in as dismal a tone as his jovial spirit was capable of its little i thought mate that you an me would come for to part in this way but ov coorse i couldnt leave mr osten in such a fix so dye see i must say farewell but kape yer weather eye open ould boy for as sure as larry ohale has got two legs which makes a pair youll see him in callyforny yit diggin for his fortin  in the main time as i know yell want money an as ive made a lot more than you by huntin becase of being a better shot dye seeheres a small sum which i axes you to accept of as a testimoniyall of my ondyin friendship  muggins bluntly refused the leathern bag which larry thrust into his hand but he ultimately allowed him to force it into his pocketand turned away with a sigh  it was a lovely morning when wandering will sorrowfully bade his friends farewell and with his faithful followers turned his face towards the snowcapped range of the mighty andes    chapter eleven  wandering will travels finds his profession profitable and sees a good deal of life in new forms  the first part of the journey was performed in a canoe on the tacames river up which they ascended with considerable speed  the scenery was delightfully varied  in some places the stream was wide in others very narrow fringed along the banks with the most luxuriant timber and brushwood in which the concert kept up by birds and beasts was constant but not disagreeable to the ears of such enthusiastic sportsmen as will osten larry ohale and bunco  the only disagreeable objects in the landscape were the alligators which hideously ugly creatures were seen covered with mud crawling along the banks and over slimy places with a sluggish motion of their bodies and an antediluvian sort of glare in their eyes that was peculiarly disgusting  they were found to be comparatively harmless however  if they had chanced to catch a man asleep they would have seized him no doubt and dragged him into the water but being arrant cowards they had not the pluck to face even a little boy when he was in motion  towards the afternoon of the first day the hunters came to a long bend in the river  here will osten resolved to leave bunco to proceed alone with the canoe while he and larry crossed the country in search of game  their friend gordon had given them an elaborate chart of the route up to the mountains so that they knew there was a narrow neck of jungle over which they might pass and meet the canoe after it had traversed the bend in the river  have you got the tinderbox larry inquired will as they were about to start  ay an the powder an shot too not to mintion the bowieknife  bad luck to the wild baists as comes to close quarters wid me anyhow  he displayed an enormous and glittering knife as he spoke with which he made two or three savage cuts and thrusts at imaginary tigers before returning it to its sheath  cautioning bunco to keep a good lookout for them on the other side of the neck of land the hunters entered the forest  for several hours they trudged through bush and brake over hill and dale in jungle and morass meadow and ravine without seeing anything worth powder and shot although they heard the cries of many wild creatures  och theres wan at long last whispered larry on coming to the edge of a precipice that overlooked a gorge or hollow at the bottom of which a tiger was seen tearing to pieces the carcase of a poor goat that it had captured  it was a long shot but larry was impatient  he raised his gun fired and missed  will osten fired immediately and wounded the brute which limped away howling and escaped  the carcass of the goat however remained so the hunters cut off the best parts of the flesh for supper and then hastened to rejoin the canoe for the shades of night were beginning to fall  for an hour longer they walked and then suddenly they both stopped and looked at each other  i do belaive weve gone an lost ourselves again said larry  i am afraid you are right replied will with a half smile come try to climb to the top of yonder tree on the eminence perhaps you may be able to see from it how the land lies  larry went off at once but on coming down said it was so dark that he could see nothing but dense forest everywhere  there was nothing for it now but to encamp in the woods  selecting therefore a large spreading tree larry kindled a fire under it and his companion in trouble discharged several shots in succession to let bunco know their position if he should be within hearing  neither will nor larry took troubles of this kind much to heart  as soon as a roaring fire was blazing with the sparks flying in clouds into the trees overhead and the savoury smell of roasting goats flesh perfuming the air they threw care to the dogs and gave themselves up to the enjoyment of the hour feeling assured that bunco would never desert them and that all should be well on the morrow  after supper they ascended the tree for the howling of wild beasts increased as the night advanced warning them that it would be dangerous to sleep on the ground  here they made a sort of stage or platform among the branches which was converted into a comfortable couch by being strewn six inches deep with leaves  only one at a time dared venture to sleep however for creatures that could climb had to be guarded against  at first this was a light duty but as time passed by it became extremely irksome and when larry was awakened by will to take his second spell of watching he vented his regrets in innumerable grunts growls coughs and gasps while he endeavoured to rub his eyes open with his knuckles  have a care lad said will with a sleepy laugh as he lay down the tigers will mistake your noise for an invitation to  a snore terminated the speech  bad luck to them yawned larry endeavouring to gaze round him  in less than a minute his chin fell forward on his breast and he began to tumble backwards  awaking with a start under the impression that he was falling off the tree he threw out both his arms violently and recovered himself  come larry he muttered to himself with a facetious smile of the most idiotical description dont give way like that boy  aint ye standin sintry an its death by law to slaip at yer post  och but the eyes o me wont kape open  lean yer back agin that branch to kape ye from fallin  therenow howld up like a manlike amanould booy  his words came slower and slower until at the last his head dropped forward on his chest and he fell into a profound sleep to the immense delight of a very small monkey which had been watching his motions for some time and which now ventured to approach and touch the various articles that lay beside the sleepers with intense alarm yet with fiendish glee depicted on its small visage  thus some hours of the night were passed but before morning the rest of the sleepers was rudely broken by one of the most appalling roars they had yet heard  they were up and wide awake instantly with their guns ready and fingers on the triggers  its draimin we must have  a rustling in the branches overhead checked him and next moment the roar was repeated  larry with an irresistible feeling of alarm echoed it and fired right above his headdoing nothing more serious however than accelerating the flight of the already horrified monkey  the shot was followed by another roar which ended in something like a hideous laugh  sure tis a hieena exclaimed larry reloading in violent haste  a hyena exclaimed willay and a black one too  come down bunco you scoundrel else ill put a bullet in your thick skull  at this invocation the rustling overhead increased and bunco dropped upon the platform grinning from ear to ear at the success of his practical joke  och ye blackymoor cried larry seizing the native by the throat and shaking him what dye mean be such doins eh  me mean noting said bunco still chuckling prodigiously but it am most glorus fun for fright de bowld irishesman  sit down ye kangaroo an tell us how ye found us out cried larry  you heard our shots i suppose said will  to this bunco replied that he had not only heard their shots but had seen them light their fire and eat their supper and prepare their couch and go to sleep all of which he enjoyed so intensely in prospect of the joke he meant to perpetrate that he was obliged to retire several times during the evening to a convenient distance and roar in imitation of a tiger merely to relieve his feelings without betraying his presence  he added that the canoe was about five minutes walk from where they sat and somewhat mollified the indignation of his comrades by saying that he would watch during the remainder of the night while they slept  next morning at daybreak the party reembarked in the canoe and continued their journey  soon the character of the country changed after a few days the thick forests had disappeared and richly cultivated small farms took their place  everywhere they were most hospitably entertained by the inhabitants who styled will physico because bunco made a point of introducing him as a doctor  one evening they arrived at a little town with a small and rapid stream of water passing through it  there was a square in the centre of the town surrounded by orange lemon and other trees which formed an agreeable shade and filled the air with fragrance  not only was there no doctor here but one was seldom or never seen  immediately therefore our physico was besieged for advice and his lancet in particular was in great request for the community appeared to imagine that bloodletting was a cure for all the ills that flesh is heir to  will of course did his best for them and was surprised as well as pleased by the number of doubloons with which the grateful people fed him  after passing some days very pleasantly here will made preparations to continue his journey when an express arrived bringing intelligence from several of the surrounding towns to the effect that a sort of revolution had broken out  it was fomented by a certain colonel in the employment of the state who finding that his services and those of his followers were not paid with sufficient regularity took the simple method of recruiting his finances by a levy on the various towns in his neighbourhood  he was in fact a bandit  some towns submitted others remonstrated and a few resisted  when it was ascertained that the colonel and his men were on their way to the town in which our travellers sojourned preparations were at once made for defence and of course will osten and his comrades could do no less than volunteer their services    chapter twelve  in which terrible things are treated ofthe andes are crossed the orinoco descended and the book ended  at the time of which we write it was not an uncommon thing in the provinces on the western coast of south america for dissatisfied military officers with a number of malcontents to get up miniature revolutions which were generally put down after much plundering and bloodshed  these bands of armed men went about like regular banditti disturbing the peace of the whole country  they were not much heard of in europe because intercommunication and telegraphy did not exist then as they do now and insignificant affairs of the kind were not taken much notice of  one effect of the threatened attack on the town about which we write was that the people became desperately excited and tremendously vigorous in their preparations  arms were sought out and distributed chests were opened and gold and silverin quantities that amazed will and his friendstaken out and buried in the woods  pistols guns and swords were produced in abundance with plenty of ammunition and the manner in which the men handled these proved that they meant to make a determined stand  trees were felled and the roads leading to the town barricaded  as the express came along he spread the news around and farmers came in from all quarters driving their cattle before them  all the arrangements for defence were made under the direction of don pedro a retired officer who proved to be quite equal to the occasion posted his men judiciously and sent out scouts on horseback  will osten larry and bunco were left to do as they pleased so they armed themselves procured horses kept close together and rode about the town observing the arrangements  the night passed without alarm but early in the morning a horseman arrived with the news that the rebels were advancing  a few hours afterwards they appeared in full view some were mounted but the majority were on foot and a more villainous set of rascals could not well be imagined  they advanced irregularly evidently not expecting opposition from so insignificant a town but those who first approached the barricades were received with such a galling fire that several were killed many wounded and the rest driven back  their leader a tall dark man on a powerful charger rode to the front in a towering passion and endeavoured to rally the men  at that moment a bold idea flashed upon will osten  he suddenly put spurs to his horse galloped round to the lowest part of the barricade leaped over it and drawing his sword charged the leader of the rebels like a thunderbolt  the man faced him and raised his sword to defend himself but wills first cut was so powerful that it broke down his guard cleft his helmet and tumbled him out of the saddle  the contending parties had scarce time to realise what was being done when the deed was completed and a wild cheer burst from the townspeople high above which there sounded a terrific hooroo and next instant larry ohale followed by bunco shot from the barricades and charged the foe  the consternation caused by the suddenness and the unexpected nature of this onset made the banditti waver and when they beheld the townsmen pouring out from their defences and rushing at them with an evident determination to conquer or die they turned and fled the rout was complete and for some time the people of the town continued to chase and slay the enemy until the pursuit was suddenly stopped by an event as terrible as it was unexpected  for some weeks previous to the day when the town was assaulted the neighbourhood and indeed the whole of the surrounding provinces had been visited by a series of slight earthquakes  so common are these tremblings and heavings of the earth in south america that unless very severe not much notice is taken of them  at the time of which we write the slight shocks had been so frequent that the people were comparatively indifferent to them  on the very day of the assault there had been several smarter shocks than usual and some of the more thoughtful among the inhabitants remembered that it was on an unusually dry summer similar to the one that was then passing that a terrible earthquake had visited the province of venezuela and entirely demolished the city of caraccas  but the sudden attack of the rebels had for the time banished all thought of earthquakes  it was while the people of the town were pursuing their enemies that another shock of the earthquake occurred and it was so violent that many of the pursuers paused while others turned at once and ran back to the town  here they found the women and children in a state of consternation for they had more thoroughly realised the force of the shock and the dreadful scenes that had taken place in caraccas when upwards of ten thousand of the inhabitants perished were still fresh in their memory  another shock occurred just as don pedro will osten and his friends galloped into the principal square of the town  here there were hundreds of cattle which had been driven there for safety and crowds of people hurrying to and fro  the horsemen rode towards the principal church of the town which had been made a place of temporary retreat for the women and children  they had got within a few hundred yards of it when there came a shock so terrible that it seemed as if the binding forces of nature were being dissolved  hollow thunderings were heard deep in the bowels of the earth which heaved and undulated almost as if it had been in a semiliquid state while great rents and fissures occurred here and there  will ostens horse stumbled into one of these and threw him but he leaped up unhurt  don pedro and the others pulled up and dismounted hastily  before they could make up their minds which way to turn or what to do another shock occurred the houses on either side of them began to sway to and fro and one not far distant fell just then a terrible crash was heard and will osten turned round in time to see the large church in the act of falling  women and children were rushing out of it frantically but those within were doomed  one wild and awful shriek mingled with the roar of the tumbling edifice and five hundred souls were instantaneously buried in a common grave  terrible though this event was much of the impression it was fitted to make on those who witnessed it was lost because of the danger that surrounded themselves  the shock or series of shocks continued for several minutes during which time the houses were falling into ruins in all directions and there was so much danger in remaining in any of the streets that most of the inhabitants who had escaped flocked as with one consent into the great squaremany of them however being killed by falling masonry on their way thither  others nearer the outskirts of the town fled into the woods  when this shock ceased the earthquake appeared to have terminated for that time but even if it had continued further damage could scarcely have been done for the little town was reduced to a heap of ruins  the desolation was complete  scarcely a house was left uninjured and the greater part of the buildings were completely demolished  but the sights that met the eye were not more terrible than the sounds which filled the ear  death and destruction reigned on every side  groans of agony and frantic cries for deliverance were heard issuing from beneath the ruins while men women and children were seen rushing about with dishevelled hair and bloodshot eyes wildly searching for and shouting the names of their lost relatives and friends or crying to god for mercy  it was a sickening and terrible sighta sight in regard to which those who dwell in the more favoured parts of our sinsmitten world can form but a very faint conception  at first all was disorder but by degrees the spirits of the survivors began to calm down a little and then systematic efforts were made to rescue those who had not been killed outright  it need scarcely be said that in this work our hero and his companions were conspicuously energetic  will and don pedro organised the men into gangs and wherever cries or groans were heard they tore up and removed the ruins so vigorously that the poor sufferers were speedily released but in performing this work they uncovered the torn crushed and mangled bodies of hundreds of the dead  come here larry said will in a low sad tone as he stood on a pile of rubbish digging towards a spot where he had heard a faint cry as if from a female  the irishman leaped to his side and saw a small hand sticking out of the rubbish  it quivered convulsively showing that life still remained  with desperate eagerness yet tender care the two men disentombed the poor creature who proved to be a women with a child clasped tightly in her broken and lacerated right arm  the woman was alive but the poor child was dead the skull having been completely smashed and its brains scattered on its mothers bosom  as they carried them away the woman also expired  in the course of a few hours great numbers of wounded persons young and old were laid under the lemontrees by the banks of the little stream that traversed the town  some were slightly hurt but by far the greater number were terribly crushed and laceratedmany of them past all hope of recovery  to these sufferers will osten now gave his undivided attention washing and bandaging wounds amputating limbs and endeavouring by every means to relieve them and save their lives while to the dying he tried in the little spanish he knew to convey words of spiritual comfort sometimes finding it impossible to do more than whisper the name of jesus in a dying ear while hurriedly passing from one to another  if earnest heartexpressive glances from eyes that were slowly fading conveyed any evidence of good having been done wills labour of love was not spent in vain  reader a volume would not suffice to detail a tithe of the sights and scenes of thrilling and dreadful interest that occurred in that small south american town on the occasion of the earthquake  yet awful though these were they were as nothing compared with the more stupendous calamities that have been caused by earthquakes in that land of instability not only in times long past but in times so very recent that the moss cannot yet have begun to cover nor the weather to stain the tombstones and monuments of those who perished  for many weeks will osten remained there tending the sick and dying then he bade his kind unfortunate friends farewell and once more turning his face towards the cordillera of the andes resumed his homeward journey with his faithful attendants  there are times in the career of a manespecially of one who leads a wandering and adventurous lifewhen it seems as though the events of a lifetime were compressed into the period of a few months or weeks or even days  such at least was the experience of our hero while he travelled in the equatorial regions of south america  events succeeded each other with such rapidity and accumulated on each other to such an extent that when he looked back it appeared utterly incredible that he and his companions had landed on the coast of peru only a few months before  it was natural indeed that in such a region where the phenomena and the forces of nature are so wild and vast one incident or adventure should follow quickly on the heels of another but it did not seem to be altogether natural that each incident should be more singular or tremendous than its predecessor  in short there seemed to be neither rhyme nor reason as larry said in the fact that they should be continually getting out of the fryingpan into the fire  yet so it was and now that they had left the low country and plunged into the magnificent recesses of the great andes the metaphor was still applicable though not perhaps equally appropriate for whereas the valleys they had quitted were sweltering in tropical heat the mountains they had now ascended were clothed in wintry snow  far down in the valleys will osten and his friends had left their canoe and hired mules with an arriero or muledriver to guide them over the difficult and somewhat dangerous passes of the andes  they had reached the higher altitudes of the mountains when we again introduce them to the reader and were urging their mules forward in order to reach a somewhat noted pass before the breaking out of a storm which the arriero knew from certain indications in the sky was rapidly approaching  the party consisted of fourwill larry bunco and the arrierowith three baggagemules  on reaching an elevated position at a turn in the road whence they could see far in advance they halted  why i had supposed this was the pass said will osten turning to bunco ask the arriero how far off it is now  troth its my belaif that theres no pass at all said larry somewhat doggedly as he shifted about uneasily in the saddle havent we bin comin up to places all day that we thought was the passbut they wasnt i dont think mister arryhairo knows it hisself and this baist of a mule has blistered my hands an amost broke my arms with baitin of itnot to mintion other parts o me body  och but its a grand place afther allvery nigh as purty as the lakes of killarney only a bit bigger  the country was indeed a little bigger  from the dizzy ledge on which they stood a scene of the wildest sublimity met their gaze and for a few minutes the travellers regarded it in profound silence  mountains crags gorges snowy peaks dark ravines surrounded them spread out below them rose up above them everywhere in the utmost confusion  it was the perfection of desolationthe realisation of chaos  at their feet far down in the gorge below lay a lake so dark that it might have been ink but it was clear and so very still that every rock in the cliffs around it was faithfully portrayed  high overhead rose one of the more elevated peaks of the andes which being clothed in pure snow looked airyalmost unrealagainst the blue sky  the highest peak of the andes chimborazo is more than 21000 feet above the sea  the one before them was probably a few hundred feet lower  of living creatures besides themselves only one species was to be seenthe gigantic condorthe royal eagle of the andes which soars higher it is said than any other bird of its kind  hundreds of condors were seen hovering above them watching for their preythe wornout and forsaken mules or cattle which while being driven over the pass perished from exhaustion  the ugly brutes  is it a goat theyve got howld of there said larry pointing to a place where several of these monstrous eagles were apparently disputing about some prize  on reaching the place the object in question was found to be the skeleton of a mule from which every morsel of flesh had been carefully picked  hold my mule larry whispered will throwing the reins to his comrade and grasping a rifle with which one of his grateful patients who survived the earthquake had presented him  a condor had seated himself in fancied security on a cliff about two hundred yards off but a wellaimed bullet brought him tumbling down  he was only winged and when will came up and saw his tremendous talons and beak he paused to consider how he should lay hold of him  och what claws exclaimed larry  ah said bunco smiling more teribuble for scratch than yoos grandmoder eh  before they could decide how to proceed the arriero came up threw the noose of his lasso over the head of the magnificent bird and secured it easily  he measured eight feet seven inches from tip to tip of the expanded wings  will osten was anxious to skin this bird and carry it away with him as a trophy but the guide protested  he said that the pass was now really within a short distance of them but that the thunderstorm would soon come on and if it caught them in the pass they ran a chance of all being lost  will therefore contented himself with cutting off the head and talons of the condor and then resumed his toilsome upward journey  according to the arrieros prophecy the storm burst upon them in less than two hours while they were still some distance from the top of the pass  although they had now reached the region of snow the zigzag track by which they ascended was tolerably visible but as they proceeded dark clouds overspread the sky and snow fell heavily while peals of muttering thunder came from afar echoing among the mountain peaks and betokening the rapid approach of the storm  the arriero looked anxious and urged the mules on with whip and voice turning his eyes furtively now and then in the direction of the dark clouds  presently on turning one of the bends in the track they came upon a singular party travelling in the opposite direction  their singularity consisted chiefly in this that instead of mules they had a train of bullockwaggons which were laden with ponderous millmachinery  at their head rode a finelooking man of middle age who addressed will in spanish  buncos services as interpreter being called into requisition the traveller told them that the pass was pretty clear but advised them to make haste as the storm would soon break and might render it impassable  on the same ground he excused himself for not staying to exchange news with them  your cargo is a strange one said will as they were about to part  the traveller admitted that it was and explained that he meant to erect a flourmill in his native town towards which he was hastening  at these words the arriero seemed peculiarly affected  he advanced to the traveller and said a few words  the latter started turned pale and asked a few hurried questions  while the arriero was replying the pallor of the travellers countenance increased a wild fire seemed to shoot from his eyes and his hands clutched convulsively the poncho which covered his breast  suddenly he returned to his followers and gave them a few hurried orders then without noticing any one he put spurs to his mule and galloping down the track like a madman was out of sight in a moment  his men at once unharnessed the cattle and followed him leaving the waggons and the ponderous machinery in the snow  the first gust of the storm burst upon the travellers at this moment and will with his friends had to ride to a neighbouring cliff for shelter before he could ask the meaning of the peculiar conduct of the stranger  the guide soon cleared up the mystery by telling him through bunco that the traveller was an inhabitant of the town which had been so recently destroyed by the earthquake  i happened to know him by name continued the guide and am aware that his wife with every member of his family was buried in the ruins  you saw how deeply he took it to heart poor fellow  poor fellow indeed god help him said will sadly as he left the shelter of the cliff and continued the ascent  they never saw the unfortunate man again but it is worthy of remark that years after will osten heard of him through a friend who happened to cross the andes at the same point  the blow had been so severe that he never returned to claim his property and there it lay for many a day on the wild mountain passperchance there it lies stillfar from the abodes of men and utterly useless save as a ponderous monument and memorial of the terrible catastrophe which had robbed its owner of home kindred wealth and earthly hope  the storm had at last burst upon our travellers in all its furyand very different is the storm in these weird altitudes where earth and heaven seem to meet than in the plains below  the wind came whistling down the gorges as if through funnels driving before it not only snow but sand and pebbles so that for a time our travellers being unable to face it were compelled to seek shelter under a ledge of rock  after the first burst there was a short lull of which they availed themselves to push on  will being mounted on the best mule went considerably ahead of his companions but at last the falling snow became so thick as to render objects almost invisible  the track too which ran unpleasantly near the edge of a precipice was almost obliterated so he thought it best to wait for the others  just then another squall came howling down the gorge at his right  his mule became restive and frightened and slipping on the snow came down on its knees  the violence of the wind rendered it almost impossible to keep the saddle so this decided will  he slid off  scarcely had he done so when there came a gust which fortunately threw him flat down at the same time his mule staggered over the edge of the precipice  one moment will saw the poor animal struggling to regain its footingthe next it was rolling down into the abyss bounding from rock to rock and he knew although the swirling snow prevented him seeing it that his steed was in a few minutes dashed to pieces in the gorge a thousand feet below  for some time will did not dare to rise  the gale grew fiercer every moment and the darknessnot of night but of thick cloudsincreased  as the snow accumulated over him he feared being buried alive so he struggled out of the drift and looked around him  it was utter chaosnot a landmark was visible  having turned round once or twice he did not know how to direct his steps  while hesitating as to what he should do another gust swept by carried away his hat and poncho tore his overcoat right up the back and compelled him to lie down again in which position he remained until he felt benumbed with cold  knowing that to remain much longer in that position would insure his death our hero rose and staggered forward a few paceshe scarce knew whither  there was a lull in the gale at this time and he continued to advance when a voice behind arrested him  hooroo doctor whereabouts are ye  hallo  larry here i am all right  faix its well ye are that same said larry looming through the drifting snow like a white spectre for its all wrong with us  wan o the poor baists wi the packs has gone clane over the cliffs an bin smashed to smithereensmore be token its the wan that carried the kittle an the salt beef but the wan wi the biscuit an the fryinpan is safe an thats a comfort anyhow  will expressed his regret at this and was beginning to tell how his own mule had been killed when bunco suddenly made his appearance and seizing him by the collar dragged him with extreme violence a few paces forward  for one brief instant a flush of anger mingled with wills surprise at this unceremonious treatment but all other feelings gave way to one of gratitude to god when observing his faithful attendant point to the spot from which he had been dragged he turned round and saw that he had been standing on the extreme verge of the precipice had he advanced one step after being arrested by the voice of his comrade his mangled body would in a few seconds have been lying beside that of his poor mule  there was no time to speak of these things however just then for the storm or rather the squall burst forth again with increased violence and the pass was still before themso like the men of a forlorn hope who press up to the breach they braced themselves to renew the conflict and pushed on  the truth of the proverb that fortune favours the brave was verified on this occasion  the storm passed over almost as quickly as it had begun the sky cleared up and before night set in they had crossed the pass and were rapidly descending the eastern side of the mountains towards the fertile plains and valleys of columbia  the transition from the wintry cold of the high regions of the andes to the intense tropical heat of the plains and forests was rapidly made in a few days the travellers were obliged to throw off their ponchos and warm garments and at the end of a few weeks we find them stretched out lazily in the stern of a canoe under the guidance of four creoles floating quietly down one of the numerous tributaries of the orinoco the change was not only sudden but also agreeable  in truth our adventurers had been so long subjected by that time to excitement and exhausting toilespecially while crossing the mountainsthat the most robust among them began to long for a little rest both bodily and mental and now that they lay idly on their backs gazing at the passing scenery listening to the ripple of the water and smoking cigarettes it seemed as if the troubles of life had all passed away and nothing but peace lay around and before them  tis paradise intirely observed larry removing his cigarette for a moment and winking facetiously at a small monkey which happened to peep at him just then through the foliage overhead  him wont be long like dat said bunco  come now ye illomened spalpeen dont be causin yer dirty clouds to come over this purty vision  wots the use o cryin before yere hurt or pretendin to know the futur whin ye knows nothin about it  yere no better than a baboon bunco as ive fraiquintly had occasion to tell ye before now  bunco made no reply to this but smiled slightly as he changed his position to one of greater comfort and lit a fresh cigarette  larry said will osten did you remember to put the fresh meat in the canoe this morning  och morther cried the irishman starting up with a look of desperate annoyance on his expressive face sure ive wint an forgot it  its hangin at this minit on the branch where i putt it last night for fear o the tigersbad luck to them  ho ho ejaculated bunco paradise am gone aready  larry turned upon his friend with a look that betokened no good and appeared to meditate an assault when will osten said quietlynever mind larry i luckily observed your omission and put it into the canoe myself  ah then doctor its not right of e to trifle wid a poor mans feelins in that way especially in regard to his stummick which wid me is a tinder point  howsever its all right so ill light another o thim cigarettes  theyre not bad things after all though small an waik at the best for a man as was used to twist an a black pipe since he was two foot high  the irishman lay down and once more sought to recover his lost paradise but was interrupted by an exclamation from one of the canoemen who pointed to a part of the rivers bank where no fewer than eight crocodiles were lying basking in the sun  they were of various sizes from eight to twenty feet in length and slept with their jaws wide open and their formidable rows of teeth exposed to view  well wots to do asked larry half rising  oh hums only want you to look to de brutestink you hab never seed him fore today said bunco  tell him hes mistaken then replied larry testily weve often seed em before an dont want to be roused up by such trifles  saying this the irishman once more sank into a recumbent state of felicity but his peaceful tendency was doomed to frequent interruptions not only on that day but on many other occasions during the voyage down the orinoco  in the evening of that same day he had an adventure which induced him to suspect more strongly even than bunco that terrestrial paradise was indeed still a long way off  the party landed at a small clearing where they were hospitably received by a professional tigerhunter who although nearly halfnaked and almost black was a very dignified personage and called himself don emanuel  this don invited them up to smoke and eat at his residence which turned out to be a very large oneno less than the wild forest itself for he disdained houses and was wont to sling his hammock nightly between two trees  at his encampment they were introduced to his wife and two daughters who were as wild and as lightly clad as himself and the only evidence if evidence it was that the ladies belonged to the gentler sex was that donna isabellathe elder sisterfondled a large cat for which she appeared to entertain a strong affection  having supped and smoked the travellers slung their hammocks to the trees and went to sleep  in the middle of the night several times they were awakened by the cries of the denizens of the thickets  it was supposed that when any two of these took to fighting the others were stirred up to roar in sympathy be this as it may the mingled cries roars and shrieks of sapajous alouates jaguars cougars pacaris sloths curassows parraquas etcetera broke forth from time to time with such fury that sleep was almost unattainable then a thunderstorm came on which wet them to the skin after that a large vampirebat bit bunco on the nose causing that worthy to add his noise to the general concert and finally a soft hairy animal dropt from a branch into larry ohales hammock  the irishman received it with open arms and a yell of terror  he crushed it to his chest which drew forth a responsive yell of agony from the animal whose claws and teeth were instantly fixed in larrys chin and cheeks  he caught it by the tailthe teeth and claws were at once transferred to his hands then he seized it by the throat from which there issued a gasping shriek as he hurled it high into the air whence it descended into the embers of the expiring fire and bolting violently from that toowarm spot sent up a shower of sparks which revealed the fact that the unfortunate man had all but annihilated donna isabellas favourite cat  thus they proceeded down the orinoco and finally reached the seacoast where they opportunely found a vessel ready to sail for old england  it was not long therefore before they were once more out upon the wide sea with the happy consciousness that they were actually homeward bound  there are times in a mans career when realities appear to memory like the dim shadows of a dream just as there are periods when dreams rise up with all the bold and startling vividness of reality  our adventurers felt something of this when they had been a few days at sea and began to think of and talk about their recent career in south america  it seemed to them as though their romantic life in the woods their encounters with wild beasts their adventures and misadventures in ecuador their dangers and difficulties in crossing the andes and their tranquil descent of the orinoco were a confused yet vivid vision and often while pacing the deck together or sitting on the bulwarks of the ship in the dreamy idleness of passengerlife at sea did they comment upon the difficulty they had in regarding as indubitable facts the events of the last few months  nevertheless as larry expressed it there could be no doubt whatever that it was all true and after all according to his carefully formed estimate worse luck might have befallen them than being cast away on the shores of peroo an lost in the forest
