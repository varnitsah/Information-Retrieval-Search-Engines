62178651	cock lane and commonsense       to james payn esq   dear payn  spirits much more rare and valuable than those spoken of in this book are yours  whatever mediums may be able to do you can transfer high spirits to your readers one of whom does not hope to convert you and will be fortunate enough if by this work he can occasionally bring a smile to the lips of his favourite novelist  with more affection and admiration than can be publicly expressed  believe me  yours ever  andrew lang     preface   since the first publication of cock lane and commonsense in 1894 nothing has occurred to alter greatly the authors opinions  he has tried to make the folklore society see that such things as modern reports of wraiths ghosts firewalking corpselights crystalgazing and so on are within their province and within the province of anthropology  in this attempt he has not quite succeeded  as he understands the situation folklorists and anthropologists will hear gladly about wraiths ghosts corpse candles hauntings crystalgazing and walking unharmed through fire as long as these things are part of vague rural tradition or of savage belief  but as soon as there is firsthand evidence of honourable men and women for the apparent existence of any of the phenomena enumerated then folklore officially refuses to have anything to do with the subject  folklore will register and compare vague savage or popular beliefs but when educated living persons vouch for phenomena which if truly stated account in part for the origin of these popular or savage beliefs then folklore turns a deaf ear  the logic of this attitude does not commend itself to the author of cock lane and commonsense  on the other side the society for psychical research while anxiously examining all the modern instances which folklore rejects has hitherto neglected on the whole that evidence from history tradition savage superstition saintly legend and so forth which folklore deigns to regard with interest  the neglect is not universal and the historical aspect of these beliefs has been dealt with by mr gurney on witchcraft by mr myers on the classical oracles and by miss x on crystalgazing  still the savage and traditional evidence is nearly as much eschewed by psychical research as the living and contemporary evidence is by folklore the truth is that anthropology and folklore have a readymade theory as to the savage and illusory origin of all belief in the spiritual from ghosts to god  the reported occurrence therefore of phenomena which suggest the possible existence of causes of belief not accepted by anthropology is a distasteful thing and is avoided  on the other hand psychical research averts its gaze as a rule from tradition because the testimony of tradition is not evidential not at first hand  in cock lane and commonsense an attempt is made to reconcile these rather hostile sisters in science  anthropology ought to think humani nihil a se alienum  now the abnormal and more or less inexplicable experiences vouched for by countless living persons of honour and sanity are at all events human  as they usually coincide in character with the testimony of the lower races all over the world with historical evidence from the past and with rural folklore now and always it really seems hard to understand how anthropology can turn her back on this large human province  for example the famous affair of the disturbances at mr samuel wesleys parsonage at epworth in 1716 is reported on evidence undeniably honest and absolutely contemporary  dr salmon the learned and acute provost of trinity college dublin has twice tried to explain the phenomena as the results of deliberate imposture by hetty wesley alone and unaided 0a  the present writer examined dr salmons arguments in the contemporary review august 1895 and was able he thinks to demonstrate that scarcely one of them was based on an accurate reading of the evidence  the writer later came across the diary of mr proctor of wellington near newcastle about 1840 and found to his surprise that mr proctor registered on occasion day by day for many years precisely the same phenomena as those which had vexed the wesleys 0b  various contradictory and mutually exclusive theories of these affairs have been advanced  not one hypothesis satisfies the friends of the others  not one bears examination  the present writer has no theory except the theory that these experiences or these modern myths if any one pleases are part of the province of anthropology and folklore  he would add one obvious yet neglected truth  if a ghoststory be found to contain some slight discrepancy between the narratives of two witnesses it is at once rejected both by science and common sense as obviously and necessarily and essentially false  yet no story of the most normal incident in daily life can well be told without some discrepancies in the relations of witnesses  none the less such stories are accepted even by juries and judges  we cannot expect human testimony suddenly to become impeccable and infallible in all details just because a ghost is concerned  nor is it logical to demand here a degree of congruity in testimony which daily experience of human evidence proves to be impossible even in ordinary matters  a collection of recent reports of firewalking by unscorched ministrants in the south seas in sarawak in bulgaria and among the klings appeals to the present writer in a similar way anthropology he thinks should compare these reports of living witnesses with the older reports of similar phenomena in virgil in many books of travel in saintly legends in trials by ordeal and in iamblichus 0c  anthropology has treasured the accounts of trials by the ordeal of fire and has not neglected the tales of old travellers such as pallas and gmelin  why she should stand aloof from analogous descriptions by mr basil thomson and other living witnesses the present writer is unable to imagine  the better the more closely contemporary the evidence the more a witness of the abnormal is ready to submit to crossexamination the more his testimony is apt to be neglected by folklorists  of course the writer is not maintaining that there is anything psychical in firewalking or in firehandling  put it down as a trick  then as a trick it is so old so worldwide that we should ascertain the modus of it  mr clodd following sir b w richardson suggests the use of diluted sulphuric acid or of alum  but i am not aware that he has tried the experiment on his own person nor has he produced an example in which it was successfully tried  science demands actual experiment  the very same remarks apply to crystalgazing  folklore welcomes it in legend or in classical or savage divination  when it is asserted that a percentage of living and educated and honourable people are actually hallucinated by gazing into crystals the president of the folklore society mr clodd has attributed the fact to a deranged liver 0d  this is a theory like another and like another can be tested  but if it holds water then we have discovered the origin of the worldwide practice of crystalgazing it arises from an equally worldwide form of hepatic malady  in answer to all that has been urged here anthropologists are wont to ejaculate that blessed word survival  our savage and mediaeval and puritan ancestors were ignorant and superstitious and we or some of us inherit their beliefs as we may inherit their complexions  they have bequeathed to us a tendency to see the viewless things and hear the airy tongues which they saw and heard and they have left us the legacy of their animistic or spiritualistic explanation of these subjective experiences  well be it so what does anthropology study with so much zest as survivals  when then we find plenty of sane and honest people ready with tales of their own abnormal experiences anthropologists ought to feel fortunate  here in the persons of witnesses say to deathbed wraiths are survivals of the liveliest and most interesting kind  here are parsons solicitors soldiers actors men of letters peers honourable women not a few all as far as wraiths go in exactly the mental condition of a maori  anthropology then will seek out these witnesses these contemporary survivals these examples of the truth of its own hypothesis and listen to them as lovingly as it listens to a garrulous old village wife or to an untutored mincopi  this is what we expect but anthropology never glancing at our survivals never interrogating them goes to the aquarium to study a friendly zulu  the consistency of this method laisse a desirer one says to anthropologists  if all educated men who have had or believe they have had psychical experiences are mere survivals why dont you friends of survivals examine them and cross examine them  their psychology ought to be a most interesting proof of the correctness of your theory  but far from studying the cases of these gentlemen some of you actually denounce for doing so the society for psychical research  the real explanation of these singular scientific inconsistencies is probably this  many men of science have consciously or unconsciously adopted the belief that the whole subject of the abnormal or let us say the psychical is closed  every phenomenon admits of an already ascertained physical explanation therefore when a man however apparently free from superstitious prejudice investigates a reported abnormal phenomenon he is instantly accused of wanting to believe in a supernatural explanation  wanting ex hypothesi to believe he is unfit to investigate all his conclusions will be affirmative and all will be worthless  this scientific argument is exactly the old argument of the pulpit against the atheist who does not believe because he does not want to believe  the writer is only too well aware that even scientific minds when bent on these topics are apt to lose balance and sanity  but this tendency like any other mental bad habit is to be overcome and may be vanquished  manifestly it is as fair for a psychical researcher to say to mr clodd you wont examine my haunted house because you are afraid of being obliged to believe in spirits as it is fair for mr clodd to say to a psychical researcher you only examine a haunted house because you want to believe in spirits and therefore if you do see a spook it does not count  we have recently seen an instructive example  many continental savants some of them bred in the straitest sect of materialists examined and were puzzled by an italian female medium  effects apparently abnormal were attested  in the autumn of 1895 this woman was brought to england by the society for psychical research  they of course as they ex hypothesi wish to believe should ex hypothesi have gone on believing  but in fact they detected the medium in the act of cheating and publicly denounced her as an impostor  the argument therefore that investigation implies credulity and that credulity implies inevitable and final deception scarcely holds water  one or two slight corrections may be offered here  the author understands that mr howitt does not regard the australian conjurers described on p 41 as being actually bound by the bark cords wound about their heads bodies and limbs  of course mr howitts is the best evidence possible  to the cases of savage tableturning p 49 add dr codringtons curious examples in the melanesians p 223 oxford clarendon press 1891  to stories of firehandling or of walkinguninjured through fire p 49 add examples in the journal of the polynesian society vol ii no 2 june 1893 pp 105108  see also at the sign of the ship longmans magazine august 1894 and the quarterly review august 1895 article on the evil eye  mr j w maskelyne the eminent expert in conjuring has remarked to the author that the old historical reports of physical phenomena such as those which were said to accompany d d home do not impress him at all  for as mr maskelyne justly remarks their antiquity and worldwide diffusion see essays on comparative psychical research and on savage and classical spiritualism may be accounted for with ease  like other myths equally uniform and widely diffused they represent the natural play of human fancy inanimate objects are stationary therefore let us say that they move about  men do not float in the air  let us say that they do then we have the physical phenomena of spiritualism  this objection had already occurred to and been stated by the author but the difficulty of accounting for the large body of respectable evidence as to the real occurrence of the alleged phenomena remains consequently the author has little doubt that there is a genuine substratum of fact probably fact of conjuring and of more or less hallucinatory experience  if so the great antiquity and uniformity of the tricks make them proper subjects of anthropological inquiry like other matters of human tradition  where conditions of darkness and so on are imposed he does not think that it is worth while to waste time in examination  finally the author has often been asked  but what do you believe yourself  he believes that all these matters are legitimate subjects of anthropological inquiry  london 27th october 1895      introduction   nature of the subject  persistent survival of certain animistic beliefs  examples of the lady onkhari lucian general campbell the anthropological aspect of the study  difference between this animistic belief and other widely diffused ideas and institutions scientific admission of certain phenomena and rejection of others connection between the rejected and accepted phenomena  the attitude of science  difficulties of investigation illustrated dr carpenters theory of unconscious cerebration  illustration of this theory  the failure of the inquiry by the dialectical society professor huxley mr g h lewes  absurdity and charlatanism of spiritualism  historical aspect of the subject  universality of animistic beliefs in every stage of culture  not peculiar to savagery ignorance the dark ages or periods of religious crisis nature of the evidence  it is not without hesitation that this book is offered to the reader  very many people for very various reasons would taboo the subjects here discoursed of altogether  these subjects are a certain set of ancient beliefs for example the belief in clairvoyance in hauntings in events transcending ordinary natural laws  the peculiarity of these beliefs is that they have survived the wreck of faith in such elements of witchcraft as metamorphosis and power to cause tempest or drought  to study such themes is impious or superstitious or useless  yet to a pathologist or anthropologist the survivals of beliefs must always be curious and attractive illustrations of human nature  ages empires civilisations pass and leave some members even of educated mankind still in certain points on the level of the savage who propitiates with gifts or addresses with prayers the spirits of the dead  an example of this endurance this secular survival of belief may be more instructive and is certainly more entertaining than a world of assertions  in his etudes egyptiennes tome i fascic 2 m maspero publishes the text and translation of a papyrus fragment this papyrus was discovered still attached to a statuette in wood representing the singer of ammen kena in ceremonial dress  the document is a letter written by an ancient egyptian scribe to the instructed khou of the dame onkhari his own dead wife the khou or khu being the spirit of that lady  the scribe has been haunted since her decease his home has been disturbed he asks onkhari what he has done to deserve such treatment  what wrong have i been guilty of that i should be in this state of trouble what have i done that thou shouldst help to assail me no crime has been wrought against thee  from the hour of my marriage till this day what have i wrought against thee that i need conceal  he vows that when they meet at the tribunal of osiris he will have right on his side  this letter to the dead is deposited in the tomb of the dead and we may trust that the scribe was no longer annoyed by a khou which being instructed should have known better  to take another ancient instance in his philopseudes lucian introduces a kind of club of superstitious men telling ghost stories  one of them assures his friend that the spectre of his late wife has visited and vexed him because he had accidentally neglected to burn one of a pair of gilt shoes to which she was attached  she indicated the place where the shoe was lying hidden and she was pacified  lucian of course treats this narrative in a spirit of unfeeling mirth but if such tales were not current in his time there would have been no point in his banter  thus the belief in the haunting of a husband by the spirit of his wife the belief which drives a native australian servant from the station where his gin is buried survived old egypt and descended to greece  we now take a modern instance closely corresponding to that of the instructed khou of the dame onkhari  in the proceedings of the psychical society part xiv p 477 the late general campbell sends from gwalior house southgate n april 27 1884 a tale of personal experiences and actions which exactly reproduces the story of the egyptian scribe  the narrative is long and not interesting except as an illustration of survival in all senses of the word  general campbell says that his wife died in july 1882  he describes himself as of advanced age and cautious in forming opinions  in 1882 he had never given any consideration to the subject of ultramundane indications  yet he recounts examples of about thirty inexplicable sounds as if inviting my attention specially and two apparitions or visions apparently of a carefully calculated nature seen by a child visitor a blood relation of my late wife whom this child had never seen nor yet any likeness of her  the general then describes his house a new one and his unsuccessful endeavours to detect the cause of the knocks raps crashes and other disturbances  unable to discover any ordinary cause he read some books on spiritualism and finally addressed a note as the egyptian scribe directed a letter to the agent 4 give three raps if from my deceased wife  he was rewarded by three crashing sounds and by other peculiar phenomena  all these unlike the scribe he regarded as sent for my particular conviction and comfort  these instances prove that from the australian blacks in the bush who hear raps when the spirits come to ancient egypt and thence to greece and last in our own time and in a london suburb similar experiences real or imaginary are explained by the same hypothesis  no survival can be more odd and striking none more illustrative of the permanence in human nature of certain elements  to examine these psychological curiosities may or may not be useful but at lowest the study may rank as a branch of mythology or of folklore  it is in the spirit of these sciences themselves parts of a general historical inquiry into the past and present of our race that we would glance at the anecdotes legends and superstitions which are here collected  the writer has been chiefly interested in the question of the evidence its nature and motives rather than in the question of fact  it is desirable to know why independent witnesses practically everywhere and always tell the same tales to examine the origin of these tales is not more superstitious than to examine the origin of the religious and heroic mythologies of the world  it is of course easy to give both mythology and the science of spectres the go by  but antiquaries will be inquiring and these pursuits are more than mere antiquarian old womanries  we follow the stream of fable as we track a burn to its head and it leads us into shy and strange scenes of human life haunted by very fearful wildfowl and rarely visited save by the credulous  there may be entertainment here and to the student of his species there may be instruction  on every side we find as we try to show in all ages climates races and stages of civilisation consentient testimony to a set of extraordinary phenomena  equally diffused we find fraudulent imitations of these occurrences and on one side a credulity which has accepted everything on the other hand a scepticism which denies and laughs at all the reports  but it is a question whether human folly would everywhere and always suffer from the same delusions undergo the same hallucinations and elaborate the same frauds  the problem is one which in other matter always haunts the student of mans development  he is accustomed to find similar myths rites customs fairy tales all over the world of some he can trace the origin to early human imagination and reason working on limited knowledge about others he asks whether they have been independently evolved in several places or whether they have been diffused from a single centre  in the present case the problem is more complicated  taboos totemism myths explanatory of natural phenomena customs like what with dr murrays permission we call the couvade are either peculiar to barbarous races or among the old civilised races existed as survivals protected by conservative religion  but such things as clairvoyance levitation veridical apparitions movements of objects without physical contact rappings hauntings persist as matters of belief in full modern civilisation and are attested by many otherwise sane credible and even scientifically trained modern witnesses  in this persistence and in these testimonies the alleged abnormal phenomena differ from such matters as naturemyths customs like suttee taboo couvade and totemism the change of men into beasts the raising of storms by artmagic  these things our civilisation has dropped the belief in other wild phenomena many persons in our civilisation retain  the tendency of the anthropologist is to explain this fact by survival and revival  given the savage beliefs in magic spirit rapping clairvoyance and so forth these like marchen or nursery tales will survive obscurely among peasants and the illiterate generally  in an age of fatigued scepticism and rigid physical science the imaginative longings of men will fall back on the savage or peasant necromancy which will be revived perhaps in some obscure american village and be run after by the credulous and halfwitted  then the wishedfor phenomena will be supplied by the dexterity of charlatans  as it is easy to demonstrate the quackery of paid mediums as that at all events is a vera causa the theory of survival and revival seems adequate  yet there are two circumstances which suggest that all is not such plain sailing  the first is the constantly alleged occurrence of spontaneous and sporadic abnormal phenomena whether clairvoyance in or out of hypnotic trance of effects on the mind and the senses apparently produced by some action of a distant mind of hallucinations coincident with remote events of physical prodigies that contradict the law of gravitation or of inexplicable sounds lights and other occurrences in certain localities  these are just the things which medicine men mediums and classical diviners have always pretended to provoke and produce by certain arts or rites  secondly whether they do or do not occasionally succeed apart from fraud in these performances the spontaneous phenomena are attested by a mass and quality of evidence ancient mediaeval and modern which would compel attention in any other matter  living sane and scientifically trained men nownot to speak of ingenious and intelligent if superstitious observers in the pastand catholic gleaners of contemporary evidence for saintly miracle and witnesses judges and juries in trials for witchcraft are undeniably all in the same tale  now we can easily devise an explanation of the stories told by savages by fanatics by peasants by persons under ecclesiastical influence by witches and victims of witches  that is simple but why are sane scientific modern observers and even disgusted modern sceptics in a tale and that just the old savage tale  what makes them repeat the stories they do repeat  we do not so much ask  are these stories true as why are these stories told professor ray lankester puts the question thus and we are still at a loss for an answer  meanwhile modern science has actually accepted as real some strange psychological phenomena which both science and commonsense rejected between 1720 and 1840 roughly speaking  the accepted phenomena are always reported historically as attendant on the still more strange and still rejected occurrences  we are thus face to face with a curious question of evidence  to what extent are some educated modern observers under the same illusions as red men kaffirs eskimo samoyeds australians and maoris  to what extent does the coincidence of their testimony with that of races so differently situated and trained justify curiosity interest and perhaps suspense of judgment  the question of the value of the facts is one to be determined by physiologists physicians physicists and psychologists  it is clear that the alleged phenomena both those now accepted and those still rejected attend or are said to attend persons of singular physical constitution  it is not for nothing that iamblichus describing the constitution of his diviner or seer and the phenomena which he displays should exactly delineate such a man as st joseph of cupertino with his miracles as recounted in the acta sanctorum 9 16031663  now certain scientific and as a layman might suppose qualified persons aver that they have seen and even tested in modern instances the phenomena insisted on by iamblichus by the bollandists and by a great company of ordinary witnesses in all climes ages and degrees of culture  but these few scientific observers are scouted in this matter by the vast majority of physicists and psychologists  it is with this majority if they choose to find time and can muster inclination for the task of prolonged and patient experiment that the ultimate decision as to the portee and significance of the facts must rest  the problem cannot be solved and settled by amateurs nor by commonsense that  delivers brawling judgments all day long on all things unashamed  ignorance however respectable and however contemptuous is certainly no infallible oracle on any subject  meanwhile most representatives of physical science perhaps all official representatives hold aloofnot merely from such performances or pretences as can only be criticised by professional conjurersbut from the whole mass of reported abnormal events  as the occurrences are admitted even by believers to depend on fluctuating and unascertained personal conditions the reluctance of physicists to examine them is very natural and intelligible  whether the determination to taboo research into them and to denounce their examination as of perilous moral consequence is scientific or is obscurantist every one may decide for himself the quest for truth is usually supposed to be regardless of consequences meanwhile till science utters an opinion till roma locuta est and does not after a scrambling and hasty inquiry or no inquiry at all assert a prejudice mere literary and historical students cannot be expected to pronounce a verdict  spiritualists and even less convinced persons have frequently denounced official men of science for not making more careful and prolonged investigations in this dusky region  it is not enough they say to unmask one imposture or to sit in the dark four or five times with a medium  this affair demands the close scrutiny of years and the most patient and persevering experiment  this sounds very plausible but the few official men of science whose names the public has heardand it is astonishing how famous among his peers a scientific character may be while the public has never heard of himcan very easily answer their accusers  what they may cry are we to investigate  it is absurd to ask us to leave our special studies and sit for many hours through many years probably in the dark with an epileptic person and a few hysterical believers  we are not conjurers or judges of conjuring again is a man like professor huxley or lord kelvin to run about the country examining every cottage where there are rumours of curious noises and where stones and other missiles are thrown about by undetected hands  that is the business of the police and if the police are baffled as in a cock lane affair at port glasgow in 1864 and in paris in 1846 we cannot expect men of science to act as amateur detectives 11  again it is hardly to be expected that our chosen modern leaders of opinion will give themselves up to crossexamining ladies and gentlemen who tell ghost stories barristers and solicitors would be more useful for that purpose thus hardly anything is left which physical science can investigate except the conduct and utterances of the hysterical the epileptic the hypnotised and other subjects who are occasionally said to display an abnormal extension of the perceptive faculties for example by way of clairvoyance  to the unscientific intelligence it seems conceivable that if home for example could have been kept in some such establishment as the salpetriere for a year and could have been scrutinised and made the subject of experiment like the other hysterical patients his pretensions might have been decided on once for all  but he merely performed a few speciosa miracula under tests established by one or two english men of science and believers and disbelievers are still left to wrangle over him  they usually introduce a question of moral character  now a few men of science in england like dr gregory about 1851 and like dr carpenter and a larger number on the continent have examined and are examining these peculiarities  their reports are often sufficiently astonishing to the lay mind  no doubt when if ever a very large and imposing body of these reports is presented by a cloud of scientific witnesses of esteemed reputation then official science will give more time and study to the topic than it is at present inclined to bestow  mr wallace has asserted that whenever the scientific men of any age have denied on a priori grounds the facts of investigation they have always been wrong 12  he adds that galileo harvey jenner franklin young and arago when he wanted even to discuss the subject of the electric telegraph were vehemently opposed by their scientific contemporaries laughed at as dreamers ridiculed and so on like the early observers of palaeolithic axes and similar prehistoric remains  this is true of course but because some correct ideas were laughed at it does not follow that whatever is laughed at is correct  the squarers of the circle the discoverers of perpetual motion the inquirers into the origin of language have all been ridiculed and ruled out of court the two former classes at least justly enough  now official science apparently regards all the long and universally rumoured abnormal occurrences as in the same category with keelys motor and perpetual motion not as in the same category with the undulatory theory of light or the theory of the circulation of the blood  clairvoyance or ghosts or suspensions of the law of gravitation are things so widely contradictory of general experience and of ascertained laws that they are pronounced to be impossible like perpetual motion they are not admitted to a hearing  as for the undeniable phenomenon that in every land age and condition of culture and in every stage of belief or disbelief some observers have persistently asserted their experience of these occurrences as for the phenomenon that the testimonies of australian blacks of samoyeds of hurons of greeks of european peasants of the catholic and the covenanting clergy and of some scientifically trained modern physicians and chemists are all coincident official physical science leaves these things to anthropology and folklore  yet the coincidence of such strange testimony is a singular fact in human nature  even people of open mind can at present say no more than that there is a great deal of smoke a puzzling quantity if there be no fire and that either human nature is very easily deluded by simple conjuring tricks or that in all stages of culture minds are subject to identical hallucinations  the whole hocuspocus of spiritwriting on slates and in pellets of paper has been satisfactorily exposed and explained as a rather simple kind of legerdemain  but this was a purely modern sort of trickery the old universal class of useless miracles said to occur spontaneously still presents problems of undeniable psychological interest  for example if it be granted as apparently it was by dr carpenter that in certain circumstances certain persons wide awake can perform in various ways intelligent actions and produce intelligent expressions automatically without being conscious of what they are doing then that fact is nearly as interesting and useful as the fact that we are descended from protozoa  thus dr carpenter says that in tabletalking cases have occasionally occurred in the experience of persons above suspicion of intentional deception in which the answers given by the movements of tables were not only unknown to the questioners but were even contrary to their belief at the time and yet afterwards proved to be true  such cases afford typical examples of the doctrine of unconscious cerebration for in several of them it was capable of being distinctly shown that the answers although contrary to the belief of the questioners at the time were true to facts of which they had been formerly cognisant but which had vanished from their recollection the residua of these forgotten impressions giving rise to cerebral changes which prompted the responses without any consciousness on the part of the agents of the latent springs of their actions  it is apparently to be understood that as the existence of latent unconscious knowledge was traced in several cases therefore the explanation held good in all cases even where it could not be established as a fact  let us see how this theory works out in practice  smith jones brown and robinson are sitting with their hands on a table  all ex hypothesi are honourable men above suspicion of intentional deception  they ask the table where green is  smith jones and robinson have no idea brown firmly believes that green is in rome the table begins to move kicks and answers by aid of an alphabet and knocks that green is at machrihanish where on investigation he is proved to be  later brown is able to show let us hope by documentary evidence that he had heard green was going to machrihanish instead of to rome as he had intended but this remarkable change of plans on greens part had entirely faded from browns memory  now we are to take it ex hypothesi that brown is the soul of honour and like mr facey rumford wouldnt tell a lie if it was ever so  the practical result is that while browns consciousness informs him trumpettongued that green is at rome the residue of a forgotten impression makes him without his knowing it wag the table which he does not intend to do and forces him to say through the tilts of the table that green is at machrihanish while he believes that green is at rome  the tableturners were laughed at and many if not all of them deserved ridicule  but see how even this trivial superstition illuminates our knowledge of the human mind  a mere residuum of a forgotten impression a lost memory which brown would have sworn in a court of justice had never been in his mind at all can work his muscles while he supposes that they are not working can make a table move at which three other honourable men are sitting and can tell all of them what none of them knows  clearly the expedient of tableturning in court might be tried by conscientious witnesses who have forgotten the circumstances on which they are asked to give evidence  as dr carpenter remarks quoting mr lecky our doctrine of unconscious cerebration inculcates toleration for differences not merely of belief but of the moral standard  and why not toleration for immoral actions  if browns residuum of an impression can make browns muscles move a table to give responses of which he is ignorant why should not the residuum of a forgotten impression that it would be a pleasant thing to shoot mr gladstone or lord salisbury make brown unconsciously commit that solecism it is a question of degree  at all events if the unconscious self can do as much as dr carpenter believed we cannot tell how many other marvels it may perform we cannot know till we investigate further  if this be so it is perhaps hardly wise or scientific to taboo all investigation  if a mere trivial drawingroom amusement associated by some with an absurd animistic hypothesis can when explained by dr carpenter throw such unexpectedly blinding light on human nature who knows how much light may be obtained from a research into more serious and widely diffused superstitious practices  the research is undeniably beset with the most thorny of difficulties  yet whosoever agrees with dr carpenter must admit that after one discovery so singular as unconscious cerebration in its effect on tables some one is bound to go further in the same field and try for more  we are assuming for the sake of argument the accuracy of dr carpenters facts 17a  more than twenty years ago an attempt was made by a body called the dialectical society to investigate the phenomena styled spiritualistic  this wellmeant essay had most unsatisfactory results 17b  first a committee of inquiry was formed on the motion of dr edmunds  the committee was heterogeneous  many of the names now suggest little to the reader  mr bradlaugh we remember but he chiefly attended a committee which sat with d d home and it is admitted that nothing of interest there occurred  then we find the rev maurice davies who was wont to write books of little distinction on semireligious topics  mr h g atkinson was a person interested in mesmerism  kisch moss and quelch with dyte and isaac meyers bergheim and geary hannah hillier reed their names go naturally in blank verse were doubtless all most estimable men but scarcely boast of scientific fame  serjeant cox a believer in the phenomena if not in their spiritual cause was of the company as was mr jencken who married one of the miss foxes the first authors of modern thaumaturgy  professor huxley and mr g h lewes were asked to join but declined to march to sarras the spiritual city with the committee  this was neither surprising nor reprehensible but professor huxleys letter of refusal appears to indicate that matters of interest and perhaps logic are differently understood by men of science and men of letters 18 he gave two reasons for refusing and others may readily be imagined by the sympathetic observer  the first was that he had no time for an inquiry involving much trouble and as he justly foresaw much annoyance  next he had no interest in the subject  he had once examined a case of spiritualism and detected an imposture  but supposing the phenomena to be genuine they do not interest me  if anybody would endow me with the faculty of listening to the chatter of old women and curates in the nearest cathedral town i should decline the privilege having better things to do  thus it would not interest professor huxley if some new kind of telephone should enable him to hear all the conversation of persons in a town if a cathedral town more or less distant  he would not be interested by the genuine fact of this extension of his faculties because he would not expect to be amused or instructed by the contents of what he heard  of course he was not invited to listen to a chatter which on one hypothesis was that of the dead but to help to ascertain whether or not there were any genuine facts of an unusual nature which some persons explained by the animistic hypothesis to mere bellettristic triflers the existence of genuine abnormal and unexplained facts seems to have been the object of inquiry and we must penitently admit that if genuine communications could really be opened with the dead we would regard the circumstance with some degree of curious zest even if the dead were on the intellectual level of curates and old women  besides all old women are not imbeciles history records cases of a different kind and even some curates are as intelligent as the apes whose anatomy and customs about that time much occupied professor huxley  in balaams conversation with his ass it was not so much the fact that mon ane parle bien which interested the prophet as the circumstance that mon ane parle  science has obviously soared very high when she cannot be interested by the fact if a fact that the dead are communicating with us apart from the value of what they choose to say  however professor huxley lost nothing by not joining the committee of the dialectical society  mr g h lewes for his part hoped that with mr alfred russel wallace to aid for he joined the committee and with mr crookes who apparently did not we have a right to expect some definite result  any expectation of that kind was doomed to disappointment  in mr lewess own experience which was large the means have always been proved to be either deliberate imposture    or the wellknown effects of expectant attention  that is when lord adare the master of lindsay and a cloud of other witnesses thought they saw heavy bodies moving about of their own free will either somebody cheated or the spectators beheld what they did behold because they expected to do so even when like m alphonse karr and mr hamilton aide they expected nothing of the kind  this would be mr lewess natural explanation of the circumstances suggested by his own large experience  the results of the dialectical societys inquiry were somewhat comic  the committee reported that marvels were alleged by the experimental subcommittees to have occurred  subcommittee no 1 averred that motion may be produced in solid bodies without material contact by some hitherto unrecognised force  sub committees 2 and 3 had many communications with mysterious intelligences to vouch for and much erratic behaviour on the part of tables to record  no 4 had nothing to report at all and no 5 which sat four times with home had mere trifles of raps  home was ill and the seances were given up  so far many curious phenomena were alleged to have occurred but now dr edmunds who started the whole inquiry sent in a separate report  he complained that convinced spiritualists had captured the editing subcommittee as people say and had issued a report practically spiritualistic  he himself had met nothing more remarkable than impudent frauds or total failure  raps noises and movements of various kinds he had indeed witnessed and he heard wondrous tales from truthful people but i have never been able to see anything worthy of consideration as not being accounted for by unconscious action delusion or imposture  then the editors of the report contradicted dr edmunds on points of fact and mr a r wallace disabled his logic 21 and mr geary dissented from the report and the editors said that his statements were incorrect and that he was a rare attendant at seances and serjeant cox vouched for more miracles and a great many statements of the most astounding description were made by mr varley an electrician by d d home by the master of lindsay lord crawford and by other witnesses who had seen home grow eight inches longer and also shorter than his average height fly in the air handle burning coals unharmed cause fragrance of various sweet scents to fill a room and in short rival st joseph of cupertino in all his most characteristic performances  unluckily mr home not being in the vein did not one of these feats in presence of mr bradlaugh and subcommittee no 5  these results are clearly not of a convincing and harmonious description and thus ended the attempt of the dialectical society  nobody can do otherwise than congratulate professor huxley and mr lewes on their discreet reserve  the inquiry of the dialectical society was a failure the members of the committees remained at variance and it is natural to side with the sceptics rather than with those who believed from the first or were converted as many are said to have been during the experiments perhaps all such inquiries may end in no more than diversity of opinion  these practical researches ought not to be attempted by the majority of people if by any  on many nervous systems the mere sitting idly round a table and calling the process a seance produces evil effects  as to the idea of purposely evoking the dead it is at least as impious as absurd as odious to taste and sentiment as it is insane in the eyes of reason  this protest the writer feels obliged to make for while he regards the traditional historical and anthropological curiosities here collected as matters of some interest in various aspects he has nothing but abhorrence and contempt for modern efforts to converse with the manes and for all the profane impostures of spiritualism  on the question of the real existence of the reported phenomena hereafter chronicled and on the question of the portee of the facts if genuine the writer has been unable to reach any conclusion negative or affirmative  even the testimony of his senses if they ever bore witness to any of the speciosa miracula would fail to convince him on the affirmative side  there seems to be no good reason why one observer should set so much store by his own impressions of sense while he regards those of all other witnesses as fallible  on the other hand the writer feels unable to set wholly aside the concurrent testimony of the most diverse people in times lands and conditions of opinion the most various the reported phenomena fall into regular groups like the symptoms of a disease  is it a disease of observation  if so the topic is one of undeniable psychological interest  to urge this truth to produce such examples as his reading affords is the purpose of the author  the topic has an historical aspect  in what sorts of periods in what conditions of general thought and belief are the alleged abnormal phenomena most current  every one will answer  in ages and lands of ignorance and superstitions or again  in periods of religious or so to say of irreligious crisis  as mr lecky insists belief in all such matters from fairies to the miracles of the gospel declines as rationalism or enlightenment advances  yet it is not as mr lecky says before reason that they vanish not before learned argument and examination but just before a kind of sentiment or instinct or feeling that events contradictory of normal experience seem ridiculous and incredible  now if we set aside for the present ecclesiastical miracles and judicial witchcraft and fix our attention on such minor and useless marvels as clairvoyance ghosts unexplained noises unexplained movements of objects one doubts whether the general opinion as to the ratio of marvels and ignorance is correct  the truth is that we have often very scanty evidence  if we take athens in her lustre we are undeniably in an age of enlightenment of the aufklarung no rationalistic philosophical coolheaded contemporary of middleton of hume of voltaire could speak more contemptuously about ghosts and about the immortality of the soul than some of the athenian gentlemen who converse with socrates in the dialogues yet we find that socrates and plato men as well educated as familiar with the refined enlightenment of athens as the others take to some extent the side of the old wives with their fables and believe in earthbound spirits of the dead  again the clearheaded socrates one of the pioneers of logic credits himself with premonitions apparently with clairvoyance and assuredly with warnings which in the then existing state of psychology he could only regard as spiritual  hence we must infer that belief or disbelief does not depend on education enlightenment pure reason but on personal character and genius  the same proportionate distribution of these is likely to recur in any age  once more rome in the late republic the rome of cicero was enlightened as was the greece of lucian that is the educated classes were enlightened  yet lucretius writing only for the educated classes feels obliged to combat the belief in ghosts and the kind of calvinism which but for his poem we should not know to have been widely prevalent  lucian too mocks frequently at educated belief in just such minor and useless miracles as we are considering but then lucian lived in an age of cataclysm in religion  looking back on history we find that most of historical time has either been covered with dark ignorance among savages among the populace or in all classes or on the other hand has been marked by enlightenment which has produced or accompanied religious or irreligious crises  now religious and irreligious crises both tend to beget belief in abnormal occurrences  religion welcomes them as miracles divine or diabolical  scepticism produces a reaction and where no gods are spectres walk  thus men cannot or so far men have not been able to escape from the conditions in which marvels flourish  if we are savages then vuis and brewin beset the forest paths and knock in the lacustrine dwelling perched like a nest on reeds above the water tornaks rout in the eskimo hut in the open wood in the gunyeh in the medicine lodge  if we are european peasants we hear the brownie at work and see the fairies dance in their grassy ring  if we are devoutly catholic we behold saints floating in midair or we lay down our maladies and leave our crutches at lourdes  if we are personally religious and pass days in prayer we hear voices like bunyan see visions like the brave colonel gardiner or like pascal walk environed by an atmosphere of light like the seers in iamblichus and like a very savoury covenanting christian  we are attended by a virtuous sprite who raps and moves tables as was a pious man mentioned by bodin and a minister cited by wodrow  we work miracles and prophesy like mr blair of st andrews 16391662 we are clairvoyant like mr cameron minister of lochend or lochhead in kintyre 1679  if we are dissolute and irreligious like lord lyttelton or like middleton that enemy of covenanters we see ghosts as they did and have premonitions  if we live in a time of witty scepticism we take to the magnetism of mesmer  if we exist in a period of learned and scientific scepticism and are ourselves trained observers we may still watch the beliefs of mr wallace and the experiments witnessed by mr crookes and dr huggins  say we are protestants and sceptical like reginald scot 1584 or whigs like de foe we then exclaim with scot in his discovery of witchcraft 1584 that minor miracles moving tables have gone out with benighted popery as de foe also boasts in his history of the devil  alas of the table we must admit eppur si muove it moves or is believed by foreign savants to move for a peasant medium eusapia paladino  mr lecky declares 1865 that church miracles have followed hop o my thumb they are lost with no track of white pebbles in the forest of rationalism 26a  and then lourdes comes to contradict his expectation and church miracles are as common as blackberries  enfin mankind in the whole course of its history has never got quit of experiences which whatever their cause drive it back on the belief in the marvellous 26b  it is a noteworthy circumstance that setting apart church miracles and the epidemic of witchcraft which broke out simultaneously with the new learning of the renaissance and was fostered by the enlightened protestantism of the reformers the puritans and the covenanters in england scotland and america the minor miracles the hauntings and knockings are not more common in one age than in another  our evidence it is true does not quite permit us to judge of their frequency at certain periods  the reason is obvious we have no newspapers no miscellanies of daily life from greece rome and the middle ages  we have from greece and rome but few literary examples of psychical research few collections of books on bogles as scott called them  we possess palaephatus the life of apollonius of tyana jests in lucian argument and exposition from pliny porphyry iamblichus plutarch hints from plato plautus lucretius from st augustine and other fathers  suetonius chronicles noises and hauntings after the death of caligula but naturally the historian does not record similar disturbances in the pauperum tabernaae  classical evidence on these matters as about greek and roman folklore in general we have to sift painfully from the works of literary authors who were concerned with other topics  still in the region of the ghostly as in folklore at large we have relics enough to prove that the ancient practices and beliefs were on the ordinary level of today and of all days  and to show that the ordinary numbers of abnormal phenomena were supposed to be present in the ancient civilisations  in the middle agesthe dark ages modern opinion would expect to find an inordinate quantity of ghostly material  but modern opinion would be disappointed setting aside saintly miracles and accusations of witchcraft the minor phenomena are very sparsely recorded  in the darkest of all dark ages when on the current hypothesis such tales as we examine ought to be most plentiful even witchtrials are infrequent  mr lecky attributes to these benighted centuries extreme superstition with little terrorism and consequently little sorcery  the world was capable of believing anything but it believed in the antidote as well as in the bane in the efficacy of holy water as much as in the evil eye  when with the dawn of enlightenment in the twelfth century superstition became cruel and burned witch and heretic the charges against witches do not as a rule include the phenomena which we are studying  witches are accused of raising storms destroying crops causing deaths and blighting marriages by sympathetic magic of assuming the shapes of beasts of having intercourse with satan of attending the sabbat all these fables except the last are survivals from savage beliefs but none of these occurrences are attested by modern witnesses of all sorts like the knockings movements ghosts wraiths second sight and clairvoyance  the more part of mediaeval witchcraft therefore is not quod semper quod ubique quod ab omnibus  the facts were facts  people really died or were sterile flocks suffered ships were wrecked fields were ruined the mistake lay in attributing these things to witchcraft  on the other hand the facts of rappings ghosts clairvoyance in spite of the universally consentient evidence are very doubtful facts after all  their existence has to be established before we look about for their cause  now of records about these phenomena the middle ages produce but a very scanty supply  the miracles which were so common were seldom of this kind they were imposing visions of devils or of angels or of saints processions of happy or unhappy souls views of heaven hell or purgatory  the reason is not far to seek  ecclesiastical chroniclers like classical men of letters recorded events which interested themselves a wraith or common ghost matter of daily experience says lavaterus and later contradicts himself or knocking sprite was beneath their notice  in mediaeval sermons we meet a few edifying wraiths and ghosts returning in obedience to a compact made while in the body  here and there a chronicle as of rudolf of fulda 858 vouches for communication with a rapping bogle  grimm has collected several cases under the head of house sprites including this ancient one at capmunti near bingen 30 gervase of tilbury marie de france john major froissart mention an occasional follet brownie or knocking sprite  the prayers of the church contain a petition against the spiritus percutiens or spirit who produces percussive noises  the norsemen of the viking age were given to second sight and glam riding the roofs made disturbances worthy of a spectre peculiarly ablebodied  but not counting the evidence of the icelandic sagas mediaeval literature like classical literature needs to be carefully sifted before it yields a few grains of such facts as sane and educated witnesses even now aver to be matter of their personal experience  no doubt the beliefs were prevalent the latin prayer proves that but examples were seldom recorded  thus the dark ages do not as might have been expected provide us with most of this material  the last forty enlightened years give us more bogles than all the ages between st augustine and the restoration  when the dark ages were over when learning revived the learned turned their minds to psychical research and wier bodin le loyer georgius pictorius petrus thyraeus james vi collected many instances of the phenomena still said to survive then for want of better materials the unhappy tortured witches dragged into their confessions all the folklore which they knew second sight the fairy world ghosts wraiths astral bodies of witches whose bodies of flesh are elsewhere volatile chairs and tables all were spoken of by witches under torture and by sworn witnesses 31  resisting the scepticism of the restoration glanvil more boyle and the rest fought the sadducee with the usual ghost stories  wodrow later 17011731 compiled the marvels of his analecta  in spite of the cold commonsense of the eighteenth century sporadic outbreaks of rappings and feats of impulsive pots pans beds and chairs insisted on making themselves notorious  the wesley case would never have been celebrated if the sons of samuel wesley had not become prominent  john wesley and the methodists revelled in such narratives and so the catena of testimonies was lengthened till mesmer came and with mesmer the hypothesis of a fluidic force which in various shapes has endured and is not even now wholly extinct  finally modern spiritualism arrived and was for the most part an organised and fraudulent copy of the old popular phenomena with a few cheap and vulgar variations on the theme  in the face of these facts it does not seem easy to aver that one kind of age one sort of culture is more favourable to the occurrence of or belief in these phenomena than another accidental circumstances an increase or a decrease of knowledge and education an access of religion or of irreligion a fashion in intellectual temperament may bring these experiences more into notice at one moment than at another but they are always said to recur at uncertain intervals and are always essentially the same  to prove this by examples is our present business  in a thoroughly scientific treatise the foundation of the whole would of course be laid in a discussion of psychology physiology and the phenomena of hypnotism  but on these matters an amateur opinion is of less than no value  the various schools of psychologists neurologists alienists and employers of hypnotism for curative or experimental purposes appear to differ very widely among themselves and the layman may read but he cannot criticise their works  the essays which follow are historical anthropological antiquarian      savage spiritualism   shadow or magic of the dene hareskins  its four categories these are characteristic of all savage spiritualism  the subject somewhat neglected by anthropologists  uniformity of phenomena mr tylors theory of the origin of animism  question whether there are any phenomena not explained by mr tylors theory examples of uniformity  the savage hypnotic trance  hareskin examples  cases from british guiana  australian rapping spirits maori oracles  a maori seance  the north american indian magic lodge  modern and old jesuit descriptions  movements of the lodge insensibility of red indian medium to fire  similar case of d d home  flying table in thibet  other instances  montezumas astral body  miracles  question of diffusion by borrowing or of independent evolution  philosophers among the dene hareskins in the extreme north of america recognise four classes of shadow or magic  their categories apply sufficiently closely to all savage sorcery excluding sympathetic magic as far as it has been observed  we have among the hareskins  1  beneficent magic used for the healing of the sick  2  malevolent magic  the black art of witchcraft  3  conjuring or the working of merely sportive miracles  4  magic for ascertaining the truth about the future or the distant presentclairvoyance  this is called the young man bound and bounding from the widelyspread habit of tyingup the limbs of the medium and from his customary convulsions  to all of these forms of magic or spiritualism the presence and aid of spirits is believed to be necessary with perhaps the exception of the sportive or conjuring class  a spirit helps to cure and helps to kill  the free spirit of the clairvoyant in bondage meets other spirits in its wanderings  anthropologists taking it for granted that spirits are a mere animistic hypothesistheir appearances being counterfeited by imposture have paid little attention to the practical magic of savages as far as it is not merely sympathetic and based on the doctrine that like cures like  thus mr sproat in his excellent work scenes and studies of savage life frankly admits that in vancouver island the trickery and hocuspocus of aht sorcery were so repugnant to him that he could not occupy himself with the topic  some other travellers have been more inquisitive unlettered sojourners among the wilder peoples have shared their superstitions and consulted their oracles while one or two of the old jesuit missionaries were close and puzzled observers of their mediumship  thus enough is known to show that savage spiritualism wonderfully resembles even in minute details that of modern mediums and seances while both have the most striking parallels in the old classical thaumaturgy  this uniformity to a certain extent is not surprising for savage classical and modern spiritualism all repose on the primaeval animistic hypothesis as their metaphysical foundation  the origin of this hypothesisnamely that disembodied intelligences exist and are activeis explained by anthropologists as the result of early reasonings on life death sleep dreams trances shadows the phenomena of epilepsy and the illusions of starvation  this scientific theory is in itself unimpeachable normal phenomena psychological and physical might suggest most of the animistic beliefs 35  at the same time veridical hallucinations if there are any and clairvoyance if there is such a thing would do much to originate and confirm the animistic opinions  meanwhile the extraordinary similarity of savage and classical spiritualistic rites with the corresponding similarity of alleged modern phenomena raises problems which it is more easy to state than to solve  for example such occurrences as rappings as the movement of untouched objects as the lights of the seance room are all easily feigned but that ignorant modern knaves should feign precisely the same raps lights and movements as the most remote and unsophisticated barbarians and as the educated platonists of the fourth century after christ and that many of the other phenomena should be identical in each case is certainly noteworthy  this kind of folklore is the most persistent the most apt to revive and the most uniform  we have to decide between the theories of independent invention of transmission borrowing and secular tradition and of a substratum of actual fact  thus either the rite of binding the sorcerer was invented for no obvious reason in a given place and thence reached the australian blacks the eskimo the dene hareskins the davenport brothers and the neoplatonists or it was independently evolved in each of several remote regions or it was found to have some actual effect what we cannot guesson persons entranced  we are hampered by not knowing in our comparatively rational state of development what strange things it is natural for a savage to invent  that spirits should knock and rap seems to us about as improbable an idea as could well occur to the fancy  were we inventing a form for a spirits manifestations to take we never should invent that  but what a savage might think an appropriate invention we do not know meanwhile we have the mediaeval and later tales of rapping some of which to be frank have never been satisfactorily accounted for on any theory  but on the other hand each of us might readily invent another common manifestationthe wind which is said to accompany the spirit  the very word spiritus suggests air in motion and the very idea of abnormal power suggests the trembling and shaking of the place wherein it is present  yet on the other side the cold non natural wind of seances of swedenborg and of a hundred stories old or new is undeniably felt by some sceptical observers even on occasions where no professional charlatan is engaged  as to the trembling and shaking of the house or hut where the spirit is alleged to be we shall examine some curious evidence ancient and modern savage and civilised  so of the other phenomena  some seem to be of easy natural invention others not so and in the latter case independent evolution of an idea not obvious is a difficult hypothesis while transmission from the pole to australia though conceivable is apt to give rise to doubt  meanwhile one phenomenon which is usually said to accompany others much more startling may now be held to have won acceptance from science  this is what the dene hareskins call the sleep of the shadow that is the magical sleep the hypnotic trance  savages are well acquainted with this abnormal condition and with means of producing it and it is at the bottom of all their more mysterious nonsympathetic magic  before mesmer and even till within the last thirty years this phenomenon too would have been scouted now it is a commonplace of physiology  for such physical symptoms as introverted eyes in seers we need look no further than martins account of the secondsighted men in his book on the hebrides  the phenomenon of anaesthesia insensibility to pain in trance is not unfamiliar to science but that redhot coals should not burn a seer or medium is perhaps less easily accepted while science naturally does not recognise the clairvoyance and still less the spiritual attendants of the seer in the sleep of the shadow nevertheless classical modern and savage spiritualists are agreed in reporting these last and most startling phenomena of the magic slumber in certain cases  beginning with what may be admitted as possible we find that the dene hareskins practise a form of healing under hypnotic or mesmeric treatment 38  the physician who is to be pitied begins by a three days fast  then a magic lodge afterwards to be described is built for him in the forest  here he falls into the sleep of the shadow the patient is then brought before him  in the lodge the patient confesses his sins to his doctor and when that ghostly friend has heard all he sings and plays the tambour invoking the spirit to descend on the sick man  the singing of barbarous songs was part of classical spiritualism the norse witch in the saga of eric the red insisted on the song of warlocks being chanted which secured the attendance of many powerful spirits and modern spiritualists enliven their dark and dismal programme by songs presently the hareskin physician blows on the patient and bids the malady quit him  he also makes passes over the invalid till he produces trance the spirit is supposed to assist  then the spirit extracts the sin which caused the suffering and the illness is cured after the patient has been awakened by a loud cry  in all this affair of confession one is inclined to surmise a mixture of catholic practice imitated from the missionaries  it is also not perhaps impossible that hypnotic treatment may occasionally have been of some real service  turning to british guiana where as elsewhere hysterical and epileptic people make the best mediums or peaymen we are fortunate in finding an educated observer who submitted to be peaied  mr im thurn in the interests of science endured a savage form of cure for headache  the remedy was much worse than the disease  in a hammock in the dark attended by a peayman armed with several bunches of green boughs mr im thurn lay under a vow not to touch whatever might touch him  the peaymen kept howling questions to the kenaimas or spirits who answered  it was a clever piece of ventriloquism and acting  every now and then through the mad din there was a sound at first low and indistinct and then gathering in volume as if some big winged thing came from far towards the house passed through the roof and then settled heavily on the floor and again after an interval as if the same winged thing rose and passed away as it had come while the air was sensibly stirred  a noise of lapping up some tobaccowater set out for the kenaimas was also audible  the rustling of wings and the thud were imitated as i afterwards found by skilfully shaking the leafy boughs and then dashing them suddenly against the ground  mr im thurn bit one of the boughs which came close to his face and caught leaves in his teeth  as a rule he lay in a condition scarcely conscious  it seems to me that my spirit was as nearly separated from my body as is possible in any circumstances short of death  thus it appears that the efforts of the peayman were directed partly to the separation of his own spirit from his body and partly to the separation of the spirit from the body of his patient and that in this way spirit holds communion with spirit  but mr im thurns headache was not alleviated  the whirring noise occurs in the case of the cock lane ghost 1762 in iamblichus in some haunted houses and is reported by a modern lady spiritualist in a book which provokes sceptical comments  now had the peay tradition reached cock lane or was the peayman counterfeiting very cleverly some real phenomenon 40  we may next examine cases in which the savage medium being entranced spirits come to him and answer questions  australia is so remote and it is so unlikely that european or american spiritualists suggested their ideas to the older blacks for mediumship seems to be nearly extinct since the settling of the country that any transmission of such notions to the black fellows must be very ancient  our authorities are mr brough smyth in aborigines of victoria i 472 and messrs fison and howitt in kamilaroi and kurnai who tell just the same tale  the spirits in victoria are called mrarts and are understood to be the souls of black fellows dead and gone not demons unattached  the mediums now very scarce are birraarks  they were consulted as to things present and future  the birraark leaves the camp the fire is kept low and some one cooees at intervals  then a noise is heard the narrator here struck a book against the table several times to describe it  this of course is spiritrapping  the knocks have a home among the least cultivated savages as well as in mediaeval and modern europe  then whistles are heard a phenomenon lavishly illustrated in certain seances held at rio de janeiro 41a where children were mediums  the spiritual whistle is familiar to glanvil and to homer  mr wesley at epworth 1716 noted it among all the other phenomena  the mrarts are next heard jumping down like the kenaimas  questions are put to them and they answer they decline very naturally to approach a bright fire  the medium birraark is found entranced either on the ground where the mrarts have been talking or at the top of a tree very difficult to climb and up which there are no marks of any one having climbed  the blacks of course are peculiarly skilled in detecting such marks in maleficent magic as among the dene hareskins the australian sorcerer has his head body and limbs wound round with stringy bark cords 41b  the enchantment is believed to drag the victim in a trance towards the sorcerer  this binding is customary among the eskimo and as mr myers has noted was used in the rites described by the oracles in trance utterances which porphyry collected in the fourth century  whether the binding was thought to restrain the convulsions of the mediums or whether it was originally a test condition to prevent the medium from cheating as in modern experiments we cannot discover  it does not appear to be in use among the maoris whose speciality is trance utterance  a very picturesque description of a maori seance is given in old new zealand 42  the story loses greatly by being condensed  a popular and accomplished young chief had died in battle and his friends asked the tohunga or medium to call him back  the chief was able to read and write he had kept a journal of remarkable events and that journal though unceasingly searched for had disappeared  this was exactly a case for a test and that which was given would have been good enough for spiritualists though not for more reasonable human beings  in the village hall in flickering firelight the friends with the english observer the pakeha maori were collected  the medium by way of a cabinet selected the darkest corner  the fire burned down to a red glow  suddenly the spirit spoke salutation to my tribe and the chiefs sister a beautiful girl rushed with open arms into the darkness she was seized and held by her friends  the gloom the tears the sorrow nearly overcame the incredulity of the englishman as the voice came a strange melancholy sound like the sound of a wind blowing into a hollow vessel  it is well with me it said my place is a good place  they asked of their dead friends the hollow answers replied and the englishman felt a strange swelling of the chest the voice spoke again  give my large pig to the priest and the sceptic was disenchanted  he now thought of the test  we cannot find your book i said where have you concealed it  the answer immediately came  between the tahuhu of my house and the thatch straight over you as you go into the door  here the brother rushed out  in five minutes he came back with the book in his hand  after one or two more remarks the voice came farewell from deep beneath the ground  farewell again from high in air  farewell once more came moaning through the distant darkness of the night  the deception was perfect  a ventriloquist said i oror perhaps the devil  the seance had an ill end  the chiefs sister shot herself  this was decidedly a wellgotup affair for a colonial place  the maori oracles are precisely like those of delphi  in one case a chief was absent was inquired for and the voice came he will return yet not return  six months later the chiefs friends went to implore him to come home  they brought him back a corpse they had found him dying and carried away the body  in another case when the maori oracle was consulted as to the issue of a proposed war it said  a desolate country a desolate country a desolate country  the chiefs of course thought the other country was meant but they were deceived as croesus was by delphi when he was told that he would ruin a great empire  in yet another case the maoris were anxious for the spirits to bring back a european ship on which a girl had fled with the captain  the pakeha maori was present at this seance and heard the hollow mysterious whistling voice the ships nose i will batter out on the great sea  even the priest was puzzled this he said was clearly a deceitful spirit or atua like those of which porphyry complains like most of them in fact  but ten days later the ship came back to port she had met a gale and sprung a leak in the bow called in maori the nose ihu  it is hardly surprising that some europeans used to consult the oracle  possibly some spiritualists may take comfort in these anecdotes and allege that the maori mediums were very powerful  this is said to have been the view taken by some american believers in a very curious case reported by kohl but the tale as he tells it cannot possibly be accurate  however it illustrates and strangely coincides with some stories related by the jesuit pere lejeune in the canadian mission about 1637  the instances bear both on clairvoyance and on the force which is said to shake houses as well as to lift tables in the legends of the modern thaumaturgists  we shall take kohls tale before those of the old jesuit  kohl first describes the medicine lodge already alluded to in the account of dene hareskin magic  the lodge answers to what spiritualists call the cabinet usually a place curtained off in modern practice  behind this the medium now gets up his materialisations and other cheap mysteries  the classical performers of the fourth century also knew the advantage of a close place 45a where the power would not be scattered  this idea is very natural granting the power  the modern ojibway close place or lodge like those seen by old jesuit fathers is composed of stout posts connected with basket work and covered with birch bark  it is tall and narrow and resembles a chimney  it is very firmly built and two men even if exerting their utmost strength would be unable to move shake or bend it 45b  on this topic kohl received information from a gentleman who knew the indians well and was even related to them through his wife  he and many other white people thirty years before saw a jossakeed or medium crawl into such a lodge as kohl describes beating his tambour  the entire case began gradually trembling shaking and oscillating slowly amidst great noise    it bent back and forwards up and down like the mast of a vessel in a storm  i could not understand how those movements could be produced by a man inside as we could not have caused them from the exterior  two voices both entirely different were then heard within  some spiritualists here is the weakest part of the story who were present explained it through modern spiritualism now this was not before 1859 when kohls book appeared in english and modern spiritualism as a sect of philosophy was not born till 1848 so that thirty years before 1859 in 1829 there were no modern spiritualists  this then is absurd  however the tale goes on and kohls informant says that he knew the jossakeed or medium who had become a christian  on his deathbed the white man asked him how it was done  now is the time to confess all truthfully  the converted one admitted the premisseshe was dying a christian manbut believe me i did not deceive you at that time  i did not move the lodge  it was shaken by the power of the spirits  i could see a great distance round me and believed i could recognise the most distant objects  this with an expression of simple truth  it is interesting but the interval of thirty years is a naked impossibility  in 1829 there were queer doings in america  joe smiths mormons spoke with tongues like irvings congregation at the same time but there were no modern spiritualists  kohls informant should have said ten years ago if he wanted his anecdote to be credited and it is curious that kohl did not notice this circumstance  we now come to the certainly honest evidence of the pere lejeune the jesuit missionary  in the relations de la nouvelle france 1634 lejeune discusses the sorcerers who as rival priests gave him great trouble  he describes the medicine lodge just as kohl does  the fire is put out of course the sorcerer enters the lodge shakes voices are heard in montagnais and algonkin and the father thought it all a clumsy imposture  the sorcerer in a very sportsmanlike way asked him to go in himself and try what he could make of it  youll find that your body remains below and your soul mounts aloft  the cautious father reflecting that there were no white witnesses declined to make the experiment  this lodge was larger than those which kohl saw and would have held half a dozen men  this was in 1634 by 1637 pere lejeune began to doubt whether his theory that the lodge was shaken by the juggler would hold water  two indiansone of them a sorcerer pigarouich me descouvrant avec grande sincerite toutes ses malicesmaking a clean breast of his tricksvowed that they did not shake the lodgethat a great wind entered fort promptement et rudement and they added that the tabernacle as lejeune very injudiciously calls the medicine lodge is sometimes so strong that a single man can hardly stir it  the sorcerer was a small weak man  lejeune himself noted the strength of the structure and saw it move with a violence which he did not think a man could have communicated to it especially not for such a length of time  he was assured by many indian witnesses that the tabernacle was sometimes laid level with the ground and again that the sorcerers arm and legs might be seen projecting outside while the lodge staggered aboutnay more the lodge would rock and sway after the juggler had left it  as usual there was a savage auiskuouaskousit who had seen a juggler rise in air out of the structure while others looking in saw that he was absent  st theresa had done equal marvels but this does not occur to the good father  the savage with the long name was a christian catechumen and yet he stood to it that he had seen a sorcerer disappear before his very eyes like the secondsighted highlander in kirks secret commonwealth 1691  his neibours often perceaved this man to disappear at a certane place and about one hour after to become visible  it would be more satisfactory if the father had seen these things himself like mrs newton crosland who informs the world that when with robert chambers and other persons of sanity she felt a whole house violently shaken trembling and thrilling in the presence of a mediumnot a professional but a young lady amateur  here of course we greatly desire the evidence of robert chambers  spirits came to swedenborg with a wind but it was only strong enough to flutter papers the cause of which as he remarks with naivete i do not yet understand  if swedenborg had gone into a medicine lodge no doubt in that close place the phenomena would have been very much more remarkable  in 1853 pere arnaud visited the nasquapees and describes a seance  the conjurers shut themselves up in a little lodge and remain for a few minutes in a pensive attitude crosslegged  soon the lodge begins to move like a table turning and replies by bounds and jumps to the questions which are put to the conjurer 48  the experiment might be tried with a modern medium  father lejeune in 1637 gives a case which reminds us of home according to home and to mrs s c hall and other witnesses when in power he could not only handle live coals without being burned but he actually placed a large glowing coal about the size of a cricketball on the pate of mr s c hall where it shone redly through mr halls white locks but did him no manner of harm  now father pijart was present tesmoin oculaire when a huron medicine man heated a stone red hot put it in his mouth and ran round the cabin with it without receiving any harm  father brebeuf afterwards a most heroic martyr sent the stone to father lejeune it bore the marks of the medicinemans teeth though father pijart examining the man found that lips and tongue had no trace of burn or blister  he reasonably concluded that these things could not be done sans loperation de quelque demon  that an excited patient should not feel fire is perhaps admissible but that it should not scorch either mr hall or home or the huron is a large demand on our credulity  still the evidence in this case that of mr crookes and lord crawford is much better than usual  it would be strange if practices analogous to modern tableturning did not exist among savage and barbaric races  thus mr tylor in primitive culture ii 156 quotes a kutuchtu lama who mounted a bench and rode it as it were to a tent where the stolen goods were concealed  the bench was believed by the credulous mongols to carry the lama  among the manyanja of africa thefts are detected by young men holding sticks in their hands  after a sufficient amount of incantation dancing and convulsions the sticks became possessed the men can hardly hold them and are dragged after them in the required directions 50a  these examples are analogous to the use of the divining rod which is probably moved unconsciously by honest dowsers sometimes they believe that they can hardly hold it  these are cases of movement of objects in contact with human muscles and are therefore not at all mysterious in origin  a regular case of movement without contact was reported from thibet by m tscherepanoff in 1855  the modern epidemic of tableturning had set in when m tscherepanoff wrote thus to the abeille russe  50b the lama can find stolen objects by following a table which flies before him  but the lama after being asked to trace an object requires an interval of some days before he sets about finding it  when he is ready he sits on the ground reading a thibetan book in front of a small square table on which he rests his hands  at the end of half an hour he rises and lifts his hands from the surface of the table  presently the table also rises from the ground and follows the direction of his hand  the lama elevates his hand above his head the table reaches the level of his eyes  the lama walks the table rushes before him in the air so rapidly that he can scarcely keep up with its flight the table then spins round and falls on the earth the direction in which it falls indicates that in which the stolen object is to be sought  m tscherepanoff says that he saw the table fly about forty feet and fall  the stolen object was not immediately discovered but a russian peasant seeing the line which the table took committed suicide and the object was found in his hut  the date was 1831  m tscherepanoff could not believe his eyes and searched in vain for an iron wire or other mechanism but could find nothing of the sort  this anecdote if it does not prove a miracle illustrates a custom 51  as to clairvoyance among savages the subject is comparatively familiar  montezumas priests predicted the arrival of the spaniards long before the event  on this point in itself well vouched for acosta tells a story which illustrates the identity of the astral body or double with the ordinary body  in the witch stories of increase mather and others where the possessed sees the phantasm of the witch and strikes it the actual witch proves to be injured  story leads to story and mr thomas hardy somewhere tells one to this effect  a farmers wife a woman of some education fell asleep in the afternoon and dreamed that a neighbour of hers a woman was sitting on her chest  she caught at the figures arm in her dream and woke  later in the day she met her neighbour who complained of a pain in the arm just where the farmers wife seized it in her dream  the place mortified and the poor lady died  to return to montezuma  an honest labourer was brought before him who made this very tough statement  he had been carried by an eagle into a cave where he saw a man in splendid dress sleeping heavily beside him stood a burning stick of incense such as the aztecs used a voice announced that this sleeper was montezuma prophesied his doom and bade the labourer burn the slumberers face with the flaming incense stick  the labourer reluctantly applied the flame to the royal nose but he moved not nor showed any feeling  on this anecdote being related to montezuma he looked on his own face in a mirror and found that he was burned the which he had not felt till then 52  on the coppermine river the medicineman according to hearne prophesies of travellers like the highland secondsighted man ere they appear  the finns and lapps boast of similar powers  scheffer is copious on the clairvoyant feats of lapps in trance  the eskimo angakut when bound with their heads between their legs cause luminous apparitions just as was done by mr stainton moses and by the mediums known to porphyry and iamblichus the angakut also send their souls on voyages and behold distant lands  one of the oddest angekok stories in rinks tales and traditions of the eskimo p 324 tells how some children played at magic making a dark cabinet by hanging jackets over the door to exclude the light the slabs of the floor were lifted and rushed after them a case of movement of objects without physical contact  this phenomenon in future attended the young mediums possessions even when he was away from home  this particular kind of manifestation so very common in trials for witchcraft and in modern spiritualistic literature does not appear to prevail much among savages  persons otherwise credible and sane tell the authorities of the psychical society that with only three amateurs present things are thrown about and objects are brought from places many miles distant and tossed on the table  these are technically termed apports  the writer knows a case in which this was attested by a witness of the most unimpeachable character  but savages hardly go so far  bishop callaway has an instance in which spirits tossed objects into the midst of a zulu circle but such things are not usual  savages also set out food for the dead but they scarcely attain to the credulity or are granted the experience of a writer in the medium 53  this astonishing person knew a familiar spirit  at dinner one day an empty chair began to move and in answer to the question whether it would have some dinner said yes  it chose croquets de pomme de terre which were placed on the chair in a spoon lest the spirit whose manners were rustic should break a plate  in a few seconds i was told that it was eaten and looking found the half of it gone with the marks showing the teeth perhaps few savages would have told such a tale to a journal which ought to have a large circulationamong believers  the examples of savage spiritualism which have been adduced might probably receive many additions those are but gleanings from a large field carelessly harvested  the phenomena have been but casually studied the civilised mind is apt to see in savage seances nothing but noisy buffoonery  we have shown that there is a more serious belief involved and we have adduced cases in which white men were not unconscious of the barbarian spell  it also appears that the now recognised phenomena of hypnotism are the basis of the more serious savage magic  the production of hypnotic trances perhaps of hypnotic hallucinations is a piece of knowledge which savages possessed as they were acquainted with quinine while european physicians and philosophers ignored or laughed at it tobacco and quinine were more acceptable gifts from the barbarian his magic has now and then been examined by a competent anthropologist like mr im thurn and castren closely observed the proceedings of the bound and bounding shamans among the samoyeds but we need the evidence both of anthropologists and of adepts in conjuring  they might detect some of the tricks though mr kellar a professional conjurer and exposer of spiritualistic imposture has been fairly baffled he says by zulus and hindus while educated americans are puzzled by the pawnees  mr kellars plan of displaying a few of his own tricks was excellent  the dusky professionals were stimulated to show theirs which as described were miracles  the pakeha maori already quoted saw a maori tohunga perform a very good miracle as times go but he does not give any particulars  the late mr davey who started as a spiritualist catechumen managed by conjuring to produce answers to questions on a locked slate which is as near a miracle as anything  but mr davey is dead though we know his secret while it is improbable that mr maskelyne will enrich his repertoire by travelling among zulus hindus and pawnees  as savages cease to be savages our opportunities of learning their mystic lore must decrease  to one point in this research the notice of students in folklore may be specially directed  in the attempt to account for the diffusion of popular tales such as cinderella we are told to observe that the countries most closely adjacent to each other have the most closely similar variants of the story  this is true as a rule but it is also true that while scandinavian regions have a form of cinderella with certain peculiarities not shared by southern europe those crop up sporadically far away among kaffirs and the indian aboriginal tribe of santhals  the same phenomenon of diffusion occurs when we find savage mediums tied up in their trances all over the north among canadian hareskins among samoyed and eskimo while the practice ceases at a given point in labrador and gives place to medicine lodges  the binding then reappears if not in australia certainly in the ancient greek ceremonial  the writer is not acquainted with the bound and bounding young man in the intervening regions and it would be very interesting to find connecting cases steppingstones as it were by which the rite passed from the levant to the frozen north     ancient spiritualism   m littre on demoniac affections a subject in his opinion worthy of closer study  outbreak of modern spiritualism  its relations to greek and egyptian spiritualism recognised  popular and literary sources of modern spiritualism  neoplatonic thaumaturgy not among these  porphyry and iamblichus  the discerning of spirits  the ancient attempts to prove spirit identity  the test of spirit lights in the ancient world perplexities of porphyry  dreams  the assynt murder  eusebius on ancient spiritualism  the evidence of texts from the papyri evocations  lights levitation airy music anaesthesia of mediums ancient and modern  alternative hypotheses  conjuring suggestion and collective hallucination actual fact  strange case of the rev stainton moses  tabular statement showing historical continuity of alleged phenomena  in the revue des deux mondes for 1856 tome i m littre published an article on tableturning and rapping spirits  m littre was a savant whom nobody accused of superstition and france possessed no clearer intellect  yet his attitude towards the popular marvels of the day an attitude at once singular and natural shows how easily the greatest minds can pay themselves with words  a curious reader in that period of excitement about spiritualism would turn to the revue attracted by m littres name  he would ask  does m littre accept the alleged facts if so how does he explain them and he would find that this guide of human thought did not at least reject the facts that he did not as he well might have done offer imposture as the general explanation that he regarded the topic as very obscure and eminently worthy of studyand that he poohpoohed the whole affair  this is not very consistent or helpful counsel  like the rest of us who are so far beneath m littre in grasp and in weight of authority he was subject to the idola fori the illusions of the marketplace  it would never do for a great scientific sceptic to say here are strange and important facts of human nature let us examine them as we do all other natural phenomena it would never do for such a man to say that without qualification  so he concluded his essay in the poohpooh tone of voice  he first gives a sketch of abnormalities in mortal experience as in the case of mental epidemics of witchcraft of the socalled prophets in the cevennes of the jansenist marvels  he mentions a nunnery where in the sixteenth century there occurred among other phenomena movements of inanimate objects pottery specially distinguishing itself as in the famous stockwell mystery  unluckily he supplies no references for these adventures 57  the revue being written for men and women of the world may discuss such topics but need not offer exact citations  m littre on the strength of his historical sketch decides most correctly that there is rien de nouveau nothing new in the spiritrapping epidemic  these maladies never desert our race  but this fact hardly explains why vessels were dragged from the hands of his nuns in the sixteenth century  in search of a cause he turns to hallucinations  in certain or uncertain physical conditions the mind can project and objectify its own creations  thus gleditch saw the dead maupertuis with perfect distinctness in the salle of the academy at berlin  had he not known that maupertuis was dead he could have sworn to his presence p 866  yes  but how does that explain volatile pots and pans  well there are collective hallucinations as when the persecuted in the cevennes like the covenanters heard nonexistent psalmody  and all witches told much the same tale apparently because they were collectively hallucinated  then were the spectators of the agile crockery collectively hallucinated  m littre does not say so explicitly though this is a conceivable theory  he alleges after all his scientific statements about sensory troubles that the whole chapter a chapter most deserving of study which contains the series of demoniac affections affections demoniaques has hardly been sketched out  among accounts of demoniac affections descriptions of objects moved without contact are of frequent occurrence  as m littre says it is always the same old story  but why is it always the same old story  there were two theories before the world in 1856 first there was the animistichypothesis spirits move the objects spirits raise the medium in the air spirits are the performers of the airy music  then there was the hypothesis of a force or fluid or faculty inherent in mankind and notable in some rare examples of humanity  this force fluid agency or what you will counteracts the laws of gravitation and compels tables or pots to move untouched  to the spiritualists m littre says bah to the partisans of a force or fluid he says pooh  if your spirits are spirits why do they let the world wag on in its old way why do they confine themselves to trivial effects  the spiritualist would probably answer that he did not understand the nature and limits of spiritual powers  to the friends of a force or faculty in our nature m littre remarks in effect why dont you use your force why dont you supply a new motor for locomotives  pooh  the answer would be that it was not the volume and market value of the force but the existence of the force which interested the inquirer  when amber being rubbed attracted straws the force was as much a force as worthy of scientific study as when electricity is employed to bring bad news more rapidly from the ends of the earth  these answers are obvious  m littres satire was not the weapon of science but the familiar test of the bourgeois and the philistine still he admitted nay asserted strongly that the whole series of demoniac affections was most worthy of investigation and was hardly sketched out  in a similar manner brierre de boismont in his work on hallucinations explains a number of clairvoyant dreams by ordinary causes  but coming to a vision which he knew at first hand he breaks down  we must confess that these explanations do not satisfy us and that these events seem rather to belong to some of the deepest mysteries of our being 60  there is a point at which the explanations of commonsense arouse scepticism  much has been done since 1856 towards producing a finished picture in place of an ebauche  the accepted belief in the phenomena of hypnotism and of unconscious mental and bodily actionsautomatismshas expelled the old belief in spirits from many a dusty nook  but we still ask  do objects move untouched why do they move or if they move not at all as is most probable why is it always the same story from the arctic circle to the tales of witches and of mediums  there is little said about this particular phenomena though something is said but there is much about other marvels equally widely rumoured of in the brief and dim greek records of thaumaturgy  to examine these historically is to put a touch or two on the picture of demoniac affections which m littre desired to see executed  the greek mystics at least believed that the airy music the movements of untouched objects the triumph over gravitation and other natural laws for which they vouch were caused by demons were demoniac affections  to compare the statements of eusebius and iamblichus with those of modern men of science and other modern witnesses can therefore only be called superfluous and superstitious by those who think m littre superstitious and his desired investigation superfluous  when the epidemic of spiritualism broke out in the united states 18481852 students of classical literature perceived that spiritualism was no new thing but a recrudescence of practices familiar to the ancient world  even readers who had confined their attention to the central masterpieces of greek literature recognised some of the revived phenomena  the trance medium the inspirational speaker was a reproduction of the maiden with a spirit of divination of the delphic pythia  in the old belief the god dominated her and spoke from her lips just as the control or directing spirit dominates the medium  but there were still more striking resemblances between ancient and modern thaumaturgy which were only to be recognised by readers of the late neoplatonists such as porphyry and of the christian fathers such as eusebius who argued against the apologists of heathenism  the central classical writers from homer to tacitus are not superstitious they accept the orthodox state magic of omens of augurs of prodigies of oracles but anything like private necromancy is alien and distasteful to them  we need not doubt that sorcery and the consultation of the dead were being practised all through the classical period indeed we know that it was so  plato legislates against sorcery in a practical manner whether it does harm or not men are persuaded that it does harm it is vain to argue with them therefore the wizard and witch are to be punished for their bad intentions 62  there were regular and so to speak orthodox oracles of the dead they might be consulted by such as chose to sleep on tombs or to visit the cavern of trophonius or other chasms which were thought to communicate with the under world  but the idea of bringing a shade or a hero a demon or a god into a private room as in modern spiritualism meets us late in such works as the letter of porphyry and the reply of iamblichus written in the fourth century of our era  if we may judge by the usual fortune of folklore these private spiritualistic rites without temple or statesupported priestly order were no new things in the early centuries of christianity but they had not till then occupied the attention of philosophers and men of letters  the dawn of our faith was the late twilight of the ancient creeds the classic gods were departing belief was waning ghosts were walking even philosophers were seeking for a sign  the mysteries of the east had invaded hellas the egyptian theory and practice were of special importance  by certain sacramental formulas often found written on papyrus the gods could be constrained and made like mediaeval devils the slaves of the magician  examples will occur later  this idea was alien to the greek mind at least to the philosophic greek mind the egyptians like michael scott had books of dread and an old egyptian romance turns on the evils which arose as to william of deloraine from the possession of such a volume 63  half understood strings of hebrew syriac and other barbarous words and incantations occur in greek spells of the early christian age again old hellenic magic rose from the lower strata of folklore into that of speculation  the people the folk is the unconscious self as it were of the educated and literary classes who in a twilight of creeds are wont to listen to its promptings and return to the old ancestral superstitions long forgotten  the epoch of the rise of modern spiritualism was analogous to that when the classical and oriental spiritualism rose into the sphere of the educated consciousness in both periods the marvellous phenomena were practically the same and so were the perplexities the doubts the explanatory hypotheses of philosophical observers this aspect of the modern spiritualistic epidemic did not escape attention  dr leonard marsh of the university of vermont published in 1854 a treatise called the apocatastasis or progress backwards  he proved that the marvels of the foxes of home and the other mediums were the old marvels of neoplatonism  but he draws no conclusion except that spiritualism is retrogressive  his book is wonderfully illprinted and though he had some curious reading his style was cumbrous jocular and verbose  it may therefore be worth while in the light of anthropological research to show how very closely human nature has repeated its past performances  the new marvels were certainly not stimulated by literary knowledge of the ancient thaumaturgy  modern spiritualism is an effort to organise and exploit the traditional and popular phenomena of rapping spirits and of ghosts  belief in these had always lived an underground life in rural legend quite unharmed by enlightenment and education  so far it resembled the ordinary creeds of folklore  it is probable that in addition to oral legend there was another and more literary source of modern thaumaturgy  books like glanvils baxters those of the mathers and of sinclair were thumbed by the people after the literary class had forgotten them moreover the foxes who started spiritualism were methodists and may well have been familiar with old jeffrey who haunted the wesleys house and with some of the stories of apparitions in wesleys arminian magazine  if there were literary as well as legendary sources of nascent spiritualism the sources were these  porphyry iamblichus eusebius and the life of apollonius of tyana cannot have influenced the illiterate parents of the new thaumaturgy  this fact makes the repetition in modern spiritualism of neoplatonic theories and neoplatonic marvels all the more interesting and curious  the shortest cut to knowledge of ancient spiritualism is through the letter of porphyry to anebo and the reply attributed to iamblichus porphyry the disciple of plotinus was a seeker for truth in divine things  prejudice literary sentiment and other considerations prevented him from acquiescing in the christian verity  the ordinary paganism shocked him both by its obscene and undignified myths and by many features of its ritual  he devised nonnatural interpretations of its sacred legends he looked for a visible or tangible sign and he did not shrink from investigating the thaumaturgy of his age  his letter of inquiry is preserved in fragments by eusebius and st augustine  gale edited it and as he says offers us an absyrtus the brother of medea who scattered his mutilated remains rather than a porphyry 65a  not all of porphyrys questions interest us for our present purpose  he asks among other things  how can gods as in the evocations of gods be made subject to necessity and compelled to manifest themselves 65b  how do you discriminate between demons and gods that are manifest or not manifest  how does a demon differ from a hero or from a mere soul of a dead man  by what sign can we be sure that the manifesting agency present is that of a god an angel an archon or a soul  for to boast and to display phantasms is common to all these varieties 65c  in these perplexities porphyry resembles the anxious spiritualistic inquirer  a materialised spirit alleges himself to be washington or franklin or the lost wife or friend or child of him who seeks the mediums  how is the inquirer how was porphyry to know that the assertion is correct that it is not the mere boasting of some vulgar spirit  in the same way when messages are given through a mediums mouth or by raps or movements of a table or a planchette or by automatic writing how even discounting imposture is the source to be verified  how is the identity of the spirit to be established  this question of discerning spirits of identifying them of not taking an angel for a devil or vice versa was most important in the middle ages  on this turned the fate of joan of arc  were her voices and visions of god or of satan  they came as in the cases mentioned by iamblichus with a light a hallucination of brilliance  when jean brehal grand inquisitor of france in 14501456 held the process for rehabilitating joan condemned as a witch in 1431 he entered learnedly into the tests of spiritidentity 66a  st theresa was bidden to try to exorcise her visions by the sign of the cross  saint or sorcerer it was always a delicate inquiry  iamblichus in his reply to porphyrys doubts first enters into theology pretty deeply but in book ii chap iii he comes as it were to business  the nature of the spiritual agency present on any occasion may be ascertained from his manifestations or epiphanies  all these agencies show in a light we are reminded inevitably of the light which accompanied the visions of colonel gardiner and of pascal  joan of arc too in reply to her judges averred that a light claritas usually accompanied the voices which came to her 66b  these things if we call them hallucinations were at least hallucinations of the good and great and must be regarded not without reverence  but modern spiritualistic and ghostly literature is full of lights which accompany manifestations or attend the nocturnal invasions of apparitions examples are so common that they can readily be found by any one who studies mrs crowes night side of nature or homes life or phantasms of the living or the proceedings of the psychical society  meantime homer and theocritus in familiar passages attest this belief in light attendant on the coming of the divine while the norse sagas and the wellknown tale of sir charles lees daughter and the ghost of her mother 1662 speak for the same belief in the prechristian north and in the society of the restoration 67a  a light always comes among the eskimo when the tornak or familiar spirit visits the angekok or sorcerer  here then is harmony enough in the psychical beliefs of all time as when we learn that lights were flashed by the spirits who beset the late rev stainton moses 67b  unluckily while we have this cloud of witnesses to the belief in a spiritual light we are still uncertain as to whether the seeing of such a light is a physical symptom of hallucination  this is the opinion of m lelut as given in his amulette de pascal p 301  this globe of fire    is a common constituent of hallucinations of sight and may be regarded at once as their most elementary form and their highest degree of intensity  m lelut knew the phenomenon among mystics whom he had observed in his practice as an alienist  he also quotes a story told of himself by benvenuto cellini  if we can admit that this hallucination of brilliant light may be produced in the conditions of a seance whether modern savage or classical we obtain a partial solution of the problem presented by the worldwide diffusion of this belief  of course once accepted as an element in spiritualism a little phosphorus supplies the modern medium with a requisite of his trade 68a  returning to iamblichus he classifies his phantasmogenetic agencies by the kind of light they show greater or less more or less divided more or less pure steady or agitated ii 4  the arrival of demons is attended by disturbances 68b  heroes are usually very noisy in their manifestations  a hero is a poltergeist sounds echo around ii 8  there are also subjective moods diversely generated by diverse apparitions souls of the dead for example prompt to lust ii 9  on the whole a great deal of experience is needed by the thaumaturgist if he is to distinguish between one kind of manifestation and another  even inquisitors have differed in opinion  iamblichus next tackles the difficult question of imposition and personation by spirits  thus a soul or a spirit may give itself out for a god and exhibit the appropriate phantasmagoria  may boast and deceive ii 10  this is the result of some error or blunder in the ceremony of evocation 69  a bad or low spirit may thus enter disguised as a demon or god and may utter deceitful words  but all arts says our guide are liable to errors and the sacred art must not be judged by its occasional imperfections  we know the same kind of excuses in modern times  porphyry went on to ask questions about divination and clairvoyance we often ascertain the future he says in dreams when our bodies are lying still and peaceful  when we are in no convulsive ecstasy such as diviners use  many persons prophesy in enthusiastic and divinely seized moments awake in a sense yet not in their habitual state of consciousness  music of certain kinds the water of certain holy wells the vapours of branchidae produce such ecstatic effects  some take darkness for an ally dark seances some see visions in water others on a wall others in sun or moon as an example of ancient visions in water we may take one from the life of isidorus by damascius  isidorus and his biographer were acquainted with women who beheld in pure water in a glass vessel the phantasms of future events 70a  this form of divination is still practised though crystal balls are more commonly used than decanters of water  ancient and modern superstition as in the familiar case of dr dee attributes the phantasms to spiritual agency  is a divine being compelled porphyry asks to aid in these efforts or is it only the soul of the seer as some believe which hallucinates itself by the aid of points de repere 70b  or is there a blending of the souls operations with the divine inspiration  or are demons in some way evolved out of something abstracted from living bodies  he seems to hint at some such theory of exuvious fumes from the circle as more recent inquirers have imagined  the young appear to be peculiarly sensitive to vapours invocations and other magical methods which affect the human constitution and the young are usually engaged as seers  hence visions are probably subjective  ecstasy madness fasts and vigils seem particularly favourable to divination  or are there certain mystic correspondences in the nature of things which may be detected  thus stones and herbs are used in evocations sacred bonds are tied as in the eskimo hypnotism and in australia closed doors are opened the heavenly bodies are observed  some suppose that there is a race of false and counterfeiting spirits which indeed iamblichus admits  these act the parts of gods demons and souls of the dead  again the conjurer plays on our expectant attention  omitting some remarks no longer appropriate porphyry asks what use there is in chanting barbarous and meaningless words  he is inclined to think that the demon or guardian spirit of each man is only part of his soulin fact his subliminal self  and generally he suspects that the whole affair is a mere imaginative deceit played off on itself by the soul  replying as to divination iamblichus says that the right kind of dreams are between sleeping and waking when we hear a voice giving directions  a modern example occurred in the trial of the assynt murderer in 1831  one kenneth fraser called the dreamer said in the trial  i was at home when i had the dream  it was said to me in my sleep by a voice like a mans voice that the pack of the murdered pedlar was lying in sight of the place  i got a sight of the place just as if i had been awake  i never saw the place before but the voice said in gaelic the pack of the merchant is lying in a cairn of stones in a hollow near to their house  the voice did not name macleods house  the pack was however not found there but in a place hard by which kenneth had not seen in his dream  oddly enough the murderer had originally hidden the pack or some of its contents in a cairn of stones but later removed it  in the willing game as played by mr stuart cumberland the seeker usually goes first to the place where the hider had thought of concealing the object though later he changed his mind  macleod was hanged he confessed his guilt 71  iamblichus believed in dreams of this kind and in voices heard by men wide awake as in the case of joan of arc  when an invisible spirit is present he makes a whirring noise like the cock lane ghost 72  lights also are exhibited the medium then by some mystic sense knows what the spirit means  the soul has two lives one animal one intellectual in sleep the latter is more free and more clairvoyant  in trance or somnambulism many cannot feel pain even if they are burned the god within does not let fire harm them iii 4  this of course suggests homes experiments in handling live coals as mr crookes and lord crawford describe them  compare the berserk coalbiters in the saga of egil and the huron coal biter in the preceding essay  they do not then live an animal life  sword points do not hurt them  their actions are no longer human  inaccessible places are accessible to them when thus borne by the gods and they tread on fire unharmed they walk across rivers     they are not themselves they live a diviner life with which they are inspired and by which they are possessed some are convulsed in one way some in another some are still harmonies are heard as in homes case and that of mr stainton moses  their bodies are elongated like homes or broadened or float in midair as in a hundred tales of mediums and saints sometimes the medium sees a light when the spirit takes possession of him sometimes all present see it iii 6  thus wodrow says as we have already shown that mrs carlyles ancestor mr welsh shone in a light as he meditated and patrick walker tells the same tale about two of the fanatics called sweet singers  from all this it follows iamblichus holds that spiritual possession is a genuine objective fact and that the mediums act under real spiritual control  omitting local oracles and practices apparently analogous to the use of planchette iamblichus regards the heavenly light as the great source of and evidence for the external and spiritual character and cause of divination iii 14  iamblichus entirely rejects all porphyrys psychological theories of hallucinations of the demon or genius as subliminal self and asserts the actual objective sensible action of spirits divine or daemonic  what effect iamblichus produced on the inquiring porphyry is uncertain  in his de abstinentia ii 39 he gives in to the notion of deceitful spirits  in addition to the evidence of porphyry iamblichus eusebius and other authors of the fourth century some recently published papyri of the same period throw a little light on the late greek thaumaturgy 73  thus papyrus cxxv verso about the fifth century contains elaborate instructions for a magical process the effect of which is to evoke a goddess to transform her into the appearance of an old woman and to bind to her the service of the person using the spell     obviously we would much prefer a spell for turning an old woman into a goddess  the document is headed greek the old serving woman of apollonius of tyana and it ends grrek it is proved by practice  you take the head of an ibis and write certain characters on it in the blood of a black ram and go to a crossroad or the seashore or a riverbank at midnight  there you recite gibberish and then see a pretty lady riding a donkey and she will put off her beauty like a mask and assume the appearance of old age and will promise to obey you  and so forth  here is a constraint put on a god as porphyry complains  reginald scot in his discovery of witchcraft 1584 has a very similar spell for alluring an airy sylph and making her serve and be the mistress of the wizard  there is another papyrus xlvi of the fourth century with directions for divination by aid of a boy looking into a bowl says the editor p 64  there is a long invocation full of barbarous words like the mediaeval nonsense rhymes used in magic  there is a dubious reading grrek or greek it is suggested that the boy is put into a pit as it seems was occasionally done 74  it is clear that a spirit is supposed to show the boy his visions  a spell follows for summoning a visible deity  then we have a recipe for making a ring which will enable the owner to know the thoughts of men  the god is threatened if he does not serve the magicians  all manner of fumigations plants and stones are used in these idiotic ceremonies and to these porphyry refers  the papyri do not illustrate the phenomena described by iamblichus such as the light levitation music of unknown origin the resistance of the medium to fire and sword points and all the rest of his list of prodigies  iamblichus probably looked down on the believers in these spells written on papyri with extreme disdain  they are only interesting as folklore like the rhymes of incantation preserved in reginald scots discovery of witchcraft  there were other analogies between modern ancient and savage spiritualism  the medium was swathed or tied up like the davenport brothers like eskimo and australian conjurers like the highland seer in the bulls hide 75a  the medium was understood to be a mere instrument like a flute through which the control the god or spirit spoke 75b  this is still the spiritualistic explanation of automatic speech  eusebius goes so far as to believe that earthbound spirits do speak through the medium but a much simpler theory is obvious 75c  indeed where automatic performances of any sortby writing by the kind of ouija or table pointing to letters as described by ammianus marcellinus xxix 29or by speaking are concerned we have the aid of psychology and the theory of unconscious cerebration to help us but when we are told the old tales of whirring noises of bilocation of levitation of a mystic light we are in contact with more difficult questions  in brief the problem of spiritualism in general presents itself to us thus  in ancient modern and savage thaumaturgy there are certain automatic phenomena  the conjurer priest or medium acts or pretends to act in various ways beyond his normal consciousness savages ancient mystics and spiritualists ascribe his automatic behaviour to the control of spirits gods or demons  no such hypothesis is needed  on the other side however are phenomena not automatic spiritual lights and sounds interferences with natural laws as when bodies are lifted in the air or are elongated when fire does not fasten on them and so on  these phenomena in ancient times followed on the performance of certain mystic rites  they are now said to occur without the aid of any such rites  gods and spirits are said to cause them but they are only attained in the presence of certain exceptional persons mediums saints priests conjurers  clearly then not the rites but the peculiar constitution of these individuals is the cause setting imposture aside of the phenomena of the hallucinations of the impressions or whatever they are to be styled  that is to say witnesses in other matters credible aver that they receive these peculiar impressions in the society of certain persons and not in that of people in general  now these impressions are everywhere in every age and stage of civilisation essentially identical  is it stretching probability almost beyond what it will bear to allege that all the phenomena in the arctic circle as in australia in ancient alexandria as in modern london are always the result of an imposture modelled on savage ideas of the supernatural  if so we are reduced to the choice between actual objective facts of unknown origin frequently counterfeited of course and the theorywhich really comes to much the same thingof identical and collective hallucinations in given conditions  on either hypothesis the topic is certainly not without interest for the student of human nature  even if we could at most establish the fact that people like iamblichus mr crookes lord crawford jesuits in canada professional conjurers in zululand spaniards in early peru australian blacks maoris eskimo cardinals ambassadors are similarly hallucinated as they declare in the presence of priests diviners home zulu magicians biraarks jossakeeds angakut tohungas and saints and mr stainton moses still the identity of the false impressions is a topic for psychological study  or if we disbelieve this cloud of witnesses if they voluntarily fabled we ask why do they all fable in exactly the same fashion  even setting aside the animistic hypothesis the subject is full of curious neglected problems  once more if we admit the theory of intentional imposture by saints angakut zulu medicinemen mediums and the rest we must grant that a trick which takes in a professional conjurer like mr kellar is a trick well worthy of examination  how did his zulu learn the method of home of the egyptian diviners of st joseph of cupertino 78a  each solution has its difficulties while practical investigation is rarely possible  we have no home with us at present and the opportunity of studying his effects carefully was neglected  it was equally desirable to study them whether he caused collective hallucinations or whether his effects were merely those of ordinary though skilful conjuring  for home whatever his moral character may have been was a remarkable survival of a class of men familiar to the mystic iamblichus to the savage races of the past and present and as far as his marvels went to the biographers of the saints  i am one of those says the zulu medicineman in mr rider haggards allans wife who can make men see what they do not see  the class of persons who are said to have possessed this power appear now and then in all human history and have at least bequeathed to us a puzzle in anthropology  this problem has recently been presented in what may be called an acute form by the publication of the experiences of mr stainton moses 78b   mr moses was a clergyman and schoolmaster in both capacities he appears to have been industrious conscientious and honourable  he was not devoid of literature and had contributed it is said to periodicals as remote from mysticism as punch and the saturday review  he was a sportsman at least he was a disciple of our father izaak walton most anglers are quiet men and followers of peace so simply wise as not to sell their consciences to buy riches and with them vexation and a fear to die says izaak  in early middle age about 1874 mr moses began to read such books as dale owens and to sit attentive of his trembling table by way of experiment  he soon found that tables bounded in his presence untouched  then he developed into a regular medium inanimate objects came to him through stone walls  scent of all sorts and as in the case of st joseph of cupertino of an unknown sort was scattered on people in his company  he floated in the air  he wrote automatically  knocks resounded in his neighbourhood in the open air  lights of all varieties hovered in his vicinity  he spoke automatically being the mouthpiece of a spirit and very dull were the spirits sermons  after a struggle he believed in spirits who twanged musical notes out in his presence  he became editor of a journal named light he joined the psychical society but left it when the society pushed materialism so far as to demonstrate that certain professional mediums were convicted swindlers  the evidence for his marvels is the testimony of a family perfectly respectable named speer and of a few other witnesses whom nobody can suspect of conscious inaccuracy  there remain as documents his books his ms notes and other corroborative notes kept by his friend dr speer a sceptic and other observers  it is admitted that mr moses was not a cautious logician his inferences are problematic his generalisations hasty  as to the facts it is equally difficult to believe in them and to believe that mr moses was a conscious impostor and his friends easy dupes he cannot have been an impostor unconsciously in a hypnotic state in a trance because his effects could not have been improvised if they were done by jugglery they required elaborate preparations of all sorts which must have been made in full ordinary consciousness  if we fall back on collective hallucination then that hallucination is something of worldwide diffusion ancient and continuous for the effects are those attributed by iamblichus to his mystics by the church to her saints by witnesses to the possessed by savages to medicinemen and by mr crookes and lord crawford to d d home  of course we may be told that all lookers on from eskimo to neoplatonists and men of science know what to expect and are hallucinated by their own expectant attention  but when they expect nothing and are disappointed by having to witness prodigies the same old prodigies what is the explanation  the following tabular statement altered from that given by mr myers in his publication of mr moses and dr speers ms notes will show the historical identity of the phenomena  mr moses was

home and iamblichus add to mr mosess repertoire the alteration of the mediums height or bulk this feat still leaves mr moses one up as regards home in whose presence objects did not disappear nor did they pass through stone walls  the questions are to account for the continuity of collective hallucinations if we accept that hypothesis and to explain the procedure of mr moses if he were an impostor  he did not exhibit before more than seven or eight private friends and he gained neither money nor dazzling social success by his performances  this page in the chapter of demoniac affections is thus still in the state of ebauche  mr moses believed his experiences to be demoniac affections in the neoplatonic sense  could his phenomena have been investigated by the archbishop of canterbury dr parker messrs maskelyne and cook and professor huxley the public mind might have arrived at some conclusion on the subject but mr mosess chief spirit known in society as imperator declined to let strangers look on  he testified his indignation in a manner so bruyant he so banged on tables that mr moses and his friends thought it wiser to avoid an altercation  this exclusiveness of imperator certainly donne furieusement a penser  if spirits are spirits they may just as well take it for understood that performances done in a corner are of no scientific value  but we are still at a loss for a round and satisfactory hypothesis which will colligate all the alleged facts and explain their historical continuity  we merely state that continuity as a historical fact  marvels of savages

the wesleys  theory of imposture  conclusion  in the month of february 1665 there was assembled at ragley castle as curious a party as ever met in an english countryhouse  the hostess was the lady conway a woman of remarkable talent and character but wholly devoted to mystical speculations  in the end unrestrained by the arguments of her clerical allies she joined the society of friends by the world called quakers  lady conway at the time when her guests gathered at ragley as through all her later life was suffering from violent chronic headache  the party at ragley was invited to meet her latest medical attendant an unlicensed practitioner mr valentine greatrakes or greatorex his name is spelled in a variety of ways  mr greatrakes was called the irish stroker and the miraculous conformist by his admirers for while it was admitted that dissenters might frequently possess or might claim powers of miracle the gift or the pretension was rare among members of the established church  the person of mr greatrakes if we may believe dr henry stubbe physician at stratfordonavon diffused a pleasing fragrance as of violets lord herbert of cherbury it will be remembered tells the same story about himself in his memoirs  mr greatrakes is a man of graceful personage and presence and if my phantasy betrayed not my judgement says dr stubbe i observed in his eyes and meene a vivacitie and spritelinesse that is nothing common  this miraculous conformist was the younger son of an irish squire and a person of some property  after the restorationand not beforegreatrakes felt a strong and powerful impulse in him to essay the art of healing by touching or stroking  he resisted the impulse till one of his hands having become dead or numb he healed it by the strokes of the other hand  from that moment greatrakes practised and became celebrated he cured some diseased persons failed wholly with others and had partial and temporary success with a third class  the descriptions given by stubbe in his letter to the celebrated robert boyle and by foxcroft fellow of kings college cambridge leave little doubt that the irish stroker was most successful with hypochondriacal and hysterical patients  he used to chase the disease up and down their bodies if it did not fly out through the interstices of his fingers and if he could drive it into an outlying part and then forth into the wide world the patient recovered  so dr stubbe reports the method of greatrakes 86  he was brought over from ireland at a charge of about 155 pounds to cure lady conways headaches  in this it is confessed that he entirely failed though he wrought a few miracles of healing among rural invalids  to meet this fragrant and miraculous conformist lady conway invited men worthy of the privilege such as the rev joseph glanvill frs the author of sadducismus triumphatus his friend dr henry more the cambridge platonist and other persons interested in mystical studies  thus at ragley there was convened the nucleus of an unofficial but active society for psychical research as that study existed in the seventeenth century  the object of this chapter is to compare the motives methods and results of lady conways circle with those of the modern society for psychical research  both have investigated the reports of abnormal phenomena  both have collected and published narratives of eyewitnesses  the moderns however are much more strict on points of evidence than their predecessors  they are not content to watch but they introduce tests generally with the most disenchanting results  the old researchers were animated by the desire to establish the tottering faith of the restoration which was endangered by the reaction against puritanism  among the fruits of puritanism and of that frenzied state of mind which accompanied the civil war was a furious persecution of witches  in a rare little book select cases of conscience touching witches and witchcraft by john gaule preacher of the word at great staughton in the county of huntington london 1646 we find the author not denying the existence of witchcraft but pleading for calm learned and judicial investigation  to do this was to take his life in his hand for matthew hopkins a fanatical miscreant was ruling in a reign of terror through the country  the clergy of the church of england as hutchinson proves in his treatise of witchcraft second edition london 1720 had been comparatively cautious in their treatment of the subject  their record is far from clean but they had exposed some impostures chiefly it is fair to say where nonconformists or catholics had detected the witch  with the restoration the general laxity went so far as to scoff at witchcraft to deny its existence and even in the works of wagstaff and webster to minimise the leading case of the witch of endor  against the drollery of sadducism the psychical researchers within the english church like glanvill and henry more or beyond its pale like richard baxter and many scotch divines defended witchcraft and apparitions as outworks of faith in general the modern psychical society whatever the predisposition of some of its members may be explores abnormal phenomena not in the interests of faith but of knowledge  again the old inquirers were dominated by a belief in the devil  they saw witchcraft and demoniacal possession where the moderns see hysterics and hypnotic conditions  for us the topic is rather akin to mythology and folkpsychology as the germans call it  we are interested as will be shown in a most curious question of evidence and the value of evidence  it will again appear that the phenomena reported by glanvill more sinclair kirk telfair bovet are identical with those examined by messrs gurney myers kellar the american professional conjurer and many others  the differences though interesting are rather temporary and accidental than essential  a few moments of attention to the table talk of the party assembled at ragley will enable us to understand the aims the methods and the ideas of the old informal society  by a lucky accident fragments of the conversation may be collected from glanvills sadducismus triumphatus 88a and from the correspondence of glanvill henry more and robert boyle  mr boyle among more tangible researches devoted himself to collecting anecdotes about the second sight  these manuscripts are not published in the six huge quarto volumes of boyles works on the other hand we possess lord tarbets answer to his questions 88b  boyle as his letters show was a rather chary believer in witchcraft and possession  he referred glanvill to his kinsman lord orrery who had enjoyed an experience not very familiar he had seen a gentlemans butler float in the air  now by a great piece of good fortune mr greatrakes the fragrant and miraculous had also been an eyewitness of this miracle and was able to give lady conway and her guests the fullest information as commonly happened in the seventeenth century though not in ours the marvel of the butler was mixed up with ordinary folklore  in the records and researches of the existing society for psychical research folklore and fairies hold no place  the conformist however had this tale to tell  the butler of a gentleman unnamed who lived near lord orrerys seat in ireland fell in one day with the good people or fairies sitting at a feast  the fairies therefore endeavoured to spirit him away as later they carried off mr kirk minister of aberfoyle in 1692  lord orrery most kindly gave the butler the security of his castle where the poor man was kept under police protection and watched in a large room among the spectators were mr greatrakes himself and two bishops one of whom may have been jeremy taylor an active member of the society  late in the afternoon the butler was perceived to rise from the ground whereupon mr greatrix and another lusty man clapt their hands over his shoulders one of them before and the other behind and weighed him down with all their strength but he was forcibly taken up from them for a considerable time he was carried in the air to and fro over their heads several of the company still running under him to prevent him receiving hurt if he should fall so says glanvill  faithorne illustrates this pleasing circumstance by a picture of the company standing out ready to field the butler whose features display great concern 90a  now we know that mr greatrakes told this anecdote at ragley first to mrs foxcroft and then to the company at dinner  mr alfred wallace frs adduces lord orrery and mr greatrakes as witnesses of this event in private life  mr wallace however forgets to tell the world that the fairies or good people were or were believed to be the agents 90b  fairies still cause levitation in the highlands  campbell of islay knew a doctor one of whose patients had in vain tried to hold down a friend who was seized and carried to a distance of two miles by the sluagh the fairy folk 90c  glanvill admits that lord orrery assured lady roydon one of the party at ragley that the irish tale was true  henry more had it direct from mr greatrakes  here is a palpably absurd legend but the reader is requested to observe that the phenomenon is said to have occurred in all ages and countries  we can adduce the testimony of modern australian blacks of greek philosophers of peruvians just after the conquest by pizarro of the authors of lives of the saints of learned new england divines of living observers in england india and america the phenomenon is technically styled levitation and in england was regarded as a proof either of witchcraft or of possession in italy was a note of sanctity in modern times is a peculiarity of mediumship in australia is a token of magical power in zululand of skill in the black art and in ireland and the west highlands was attributed to the guile of the fairies  here are four or five distinct hypotheses  part of our business therefore is to examine and compare the forms of a fable current in many lands and reported to the circle at ragley by the miraculous conformist  mr greatrakes did not entertain lady conway and her friends with this marvel alone  he had been present at a trial for witchcraft in cork on september 11 1661  in this affair evidence was led to prove a story as common as that of levitationnamely the mysterious throwing or falling of stones in a haunted house or around the person of a patient bewitched  cardan is expansive about this manifestation  the patient was mary longdon the witch was florence newton of youghal  glanvill prints the trial from a document which he regards as official but he did not take the trouble to trace mr aston the recorder or clerk as glanvill surmises who signed every page of the manuscript  mr alfred wallace quotes the tale without citing his authority  the witnesses for the falling of stones round the bewitched girl were the maid herself and her master john pyne who deposed that she was much troubled with little stones that were thrown at her wherever she went and that after they had hit her would fall on the ground and then vanish so that none of them could be found this peculiarity beset mr stainton moses when he was fishing and must have put down the trout  objects in the maids presence such as bibles would fly from her and she was bewitched and carried off into odd places like the butler at lord orrerys nicholas pyne gave identical evidence  at ragley mr greatrakes declared that he was present at the trial and that an awl would not penetrate the stool on which the unlucky enchantress was made to stand  a clear proof of guilt  here then we have the second phenomenon which interested the circle at ragley the flying about of stones of bibles and other movements of bodies  though the whole affair may be called hysterical imposture by mary longdon who vomited pins and so forth as was customary we shall presently trace the reports of similar events among people of widely remote ages and countries from china to peru  among the guests at ragley as we said was dr joseph glanvill who could also tell strange tales at first hand and from his own experience  he had investigated the case of the disturbances in mr mompessons house at tedworth which began in march 1661  these events so famous among our ancestors were precisely identical with what is reported by modern newspapers when there is a medium in a family  the troubles began with rappings on the walls of the house and on a drum taken by mr mompesson from a vagrant musician  this man seems to have been as much vexed as parolles by the loss of his drum and the psychical society at ragley believed him to be a magician who had bewitched the house of his oppressor  while mrs mompesson was adding an infant to her family the noise ceased or nearly ceased just as at epworth in the house of the rev samuel wesley it never vexed mrs wesley at her devotions  later at tedworth it followed and vexed the younger children beating their bedsteads with that violence that all present expected when they would fall in pieces     it would lift the children up in their beds  objects were moved  lights flitted around and the rev joseph glanvill could assure lady conway that he had been a witness of some of these occurrences  he saw the little modest girls in the bed between seven and eight years old as i guessed  he saw their hands outside the bedclothes and heard the scratchings above their heads and felt the room and windows shake very sensibly when he tapped or scratched a certain number of times the noise answered and stopped at the same number  many more things of this kind glanvill tells  he denies the truth of a report that an imposture was discovered but admits that when charles ii sent gentlemen to stay in the house nothing unusual occurred  but these researchers stayed only for a single night  he denied that any normal cause of the trouble was ever discovered  glanvill told similar tales about a house at welton near daventry in 1658 stones were thrown and all the furniture joined in an irregular corroboree  too late for lady conways party was the similar disturbance at gasts house of little burton june 1677  here the careful student will note that they saw a hand holding a hammer which kept on knocking  this hand is as familiar to the research of the seventeenth as to that of the nineteenth century  we find it again in the celebrated scotch cases of rerrick 1695 and of glenluce while the rev james sharp later archbishop of st andrews vouched for it in 1659 in a tale told by him to lauderdale and by lauderdale to the rev richard baxter 94 glanvill also contributes a narrative of the very same description about the haunting of mr paschals house in soper lane london the evidence is that of mr andrew paschal fellow of queens college cambridge  in this case the trouble began with the arrival and coincided with the stay of a gentlewoman unnamed who seemed to be principally concerned  as a rule in these legends it is easy to find out who the medium was  the phenomena here were accompanied by a cold blast or puff of wind which blew on the hand of the fellow of queens college just as it has often blown in similar circumstances on the hands of mr crookes and of other modern amateurs  it would be tedious to analyse all glanvills tales of rappings and of volatile furniture  we shall see that before his time as after it precisely similar narratives attracted the notice of the curious  glanvill generally tries to get his stories at first hand and signed by eyewitnesses  lady conway was not behind her guests in personal experiences  her ladyship was concerned with a good oldfashioned ghost  we say oldfashioned of set purpose because while modern tales of levitation and flighty furniture of flying stones of rappings of spectral hands of cold psychical winds are exactly like the tales of old a change an observed change has come over the ghost of the nineteenth century  readers of the proceedings of the psychical society will see that the modern ghost is a purposeless creature  he appears nobody knows why he has no message to deliver no secret crime to reveal no appointment to keep no treasure to disclose no commissions to be executed and as an almost invariable rule he does not speak even if you speak to him the recent inquirers notably mr myers remark with some severity on this vague and meaningless conduct of apparitions and draw speculative conclusions to the effect that the ghost as the scotch say is not all there  but the ghosts of the seventeenth century were positively garrulous  one remarkable specimen indeed behaved at valogne more like a ghost of our time than of his own 95 but as a common rule the ghosts in whom lady conways friends were interested had a purpose  some revealed the spot where a skeleton lay some urged the payment of a debt or the performance of a neglected duty  one modern spectre reported by mr myers wandered disconsolate till a debt of three shillings and tenpence was defrayed 96  this is perhaps the lowest figure cited as a pretext for appearing  the ghost vouched for by lady conway was disturbed about a larger sum twentyeight shillings  she an elderly woman persecuted by her visits david hunter neatherd at the house of the bishop of down and connor at portmore in 1663 mr hunter did not even know the ghost when she was alive but she made herself so much at home in his dwelling that his little dog would follow her as well as his master  the ghost however was invisible to mrs hunter  when hunter had at last executed her commission she asked him to lift her up in his arms  she was not substantial like fair katie king when embraced by mr crookes but felt just like a bag of feathers so she vanished and he heard most delicate music as she went off over his head  lady conway crossexamined hunter on the spot and expressed her belief in his narrative in a letter dated lisburn april 29 1663  it is true that contemporary sceptics attributed the phenomena to potheen but as lady conway asks how could potheen tell hunter about the ghosts debt and reveal that the money to discharge it was hidden under her hearthstone  the scope of the ragley inquiries may now be understood  it must not be forgotten that witchcraft was a topic of deep interest to these students  they solemnly quote the records of trials in which it is perfectly evident that girls and boys either in a spirit of wicked mischief or suffering from hysterical illusions make grotesque charges against poor old women  the witches always prick pinch and torment their victims being present to them though invisible to the bystanders  this was called spectral evidence and the mathers during the fanatical outbreaks at salem admit that this spectral evidence unsupported is of no legal value indeed taken literally cotton mathers cautions on the subject of evidence may almost be called sane and sensible  but the protestant inquisitors always discovered evidence confirmatory  for example a girl is screaming out against an invisible witch a man to please her makes a snatch at the empty air where she points and finds in his hand a fragment of stuff which again is proved to be torn from the witchs dress  it is easy to see how this trick could be played  again a possessed girl cries that a witch is tormenting her with an iron spindle grasps at the spindle visible only to her and lo it is in her hand and is the property of the witch here is proof positive  again a girl at stoke trister in somerset is bewitched by elizabeth style of bayford widow  the rector of the parish the rev william parsons deposes that the girl in a fit pointed to different parts of her body and where she pointed he perceived a red spot to arise with a small black in the midst of it like a small thorn and other evidence was given to the same effect  the phenomenon is akin to many which according to medical and scientific testimony occur to patients in the hypnotic state  the socalled stigmata of louise lateau and of the shepherd boy put up by the archbishop of reims as a substitute for joan of arc are cases in point  but glanvill who quotes the record of the trial january 1664 holds that witchcraft is proved by the coincidence of the witchs confession that she the devil and others made an image of the girl and pierced it with thorns the confession is a piece of pure folklore  poor old elizabeth style merely copies the statements of french and scotch witches the devil appeared as a handsome man and as a black dog  glanvill denies that she was tortured or watchedthat is kept awake till her brain reeled  but his own account makes it plain that she was watched after her confession at least when the devil under the form of a butterfly appeared in her cell  this rampant and mischievous nonsense was dear to the psychical inquirers of the restoration it was circulated by glanvill a fellow of the royal society by henry more by sinclair a professor in the university of glasgow by richard baxter that glory of nonconformity who revels in the burning of an old reading parson that is a clergyman who read the homilies under the commonwealth this unlucky old parson was tortured into confession by being walked and watchedthat is kept from sleep till he was delirious  archbishop spottiswoode treated father ogilvie s j in the same abominable manner till delirium supervened  church kirk and dissent have no right to throw the first stone at each other  taking levitation haunting disturbances and apparitions and leaving telepathy or second sight out of the list for the present he who compares psychical research in the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries finds himself confronted by the problem which everywhere meets the student of institutions and of mythology  the anthropologist knows that if he takes up a new book of travels in the remotest lands he will find mention of strange customs perfectly familiar to him in other parts of the ancient and modern world  the mythologist would be surprised if he encountered in papua or central africa or sakhalin a perfectly new myth  these uniformities of myth and custom are explained by the identical workings of the uncivilised intelligence on the same materials and in some cases by borrowing transmission imitation  now some features in witchcraft admit of this explanation highland crofters even now perforate the image of an enemy with pins broken bottleends or sharp stones are put in russia and in australia in the footprints of a foe for the purpose of laming him and there are dozens of such practices all founded on the theory of sympathy  like affects like  what harms the effigy hurts the person whose effigy is burned or pricked  all this is perfectly intelligible  but when we find savage birraarks in australia fakirs in india saints in mediaeval europe a gentlemans butler in ireland boys in somerset and midlothian a young warrior in zululand miss nancy wesley at epworth in 1716 and mr daniel home in london in 185670 all triumphing over the law of gravitation all floating in the air how are we to explain the uniformity of stories palpably ridiculous  the evidence it must be observed is not merely that of savages or of persons as uneducated and as superstitious as savages  the australian birraark who flies away up the tree we may leave out of account  the saints st francis and st theresa are more puzzling but miracles were expected from saints 100a  the levitated boy was attested to in a court of justice and is designed by faithorne in an illustration of glanvills book  he flew over a garden  but witnesses in such trials were fanciful people  lord orrery and mr greatrakes may have seen the butler float in the air after dinner  the exploits of the indian fakirs almost or quite overcome the scepticism of mr max muller in his gifford lectures on psychological religion  living and honourable white men aver that they have seen the feat examined the performers and found no explanation no wires no trace of imposture  the writer is acquainted with a well vouched for case the witness an english officer  mr kellar an american professional conjurer and exposer of spiritualistic pretensions bears witness in the north american review to a zulu case of levitation which actually surpasses the tale of the gentlemans butler in strangeness  cieza de leon in his travels translated by mr markham for the hakluyt society brings a similar anecdote from early peru in 1549 100b miss nancy wesleys case is vouched for she and the bed she sat on both rose from the floor by a letter from one of her family to her brother samuel printed in southeys life of wesley  finally lord lindsay and lord adare published a statement that they saw home float out of one window and in at another in ashley place sw on december 16 1868  captain wynne who was also there wrote to the medium to say i was present as a witness 101  we need not heap up more examples drawn from classic greece as in the instances of abaris and iamblichus  we merely stand speechless in the presence of the wildest of all fables when it meets us as identical myths and customs donot among savages alone but everywhere practically speaking and in connection with barbarous sorcery with english witchcraft with the saintliest of mediaeval devotees with african warriors with hindoo fakirs with a little english girl in a quiet old country parsonage and with an enigmatic american gentleman many living witnesses of good authority sign statements about homes levitation  in one case a large table on which stood a man of twelve stone weight rose from the floor and an eyewitness a doctor felt under the castors with his hands  of all persons subject to levitation saint joseph of cupertino 16031663 was the most notable  the evidence is partly derived from testimonies collected with a view to his canonisation within two years after his death  there is a full account of his life and adventures in acta sanctorum 102  st joseph died as we saw in 1663 but the earliest biography of him in italian was not published till fifteen years later in 1678  unluckily the compiler of his legend in the acta sanctorum was unable to procure this work by nutius which might contain a comparatively slight accretion of myths  the next life is of 1722 and the author made use of the facts collected for josephs beatification  there is another life by pastrovicchi in 1753  he was canonised in that year when all the facts were remote by about a century  josephs parents were pauperes sed honesti his father was a carpenter his mother a woman of almost virulent virtue who kept her son in great order  from the age of eight he was subject to cataleptic or epileptic fits and convulsions  after his novitiate he suffered from severe attacks of melancholia  his miracles attracting attention he was brought before the inquisition at naples as an impostor  he was sent to an obscure and remote monastery and thence to assisi where he was harshly treated and fell into bunyans slough of despond having much conflict with apollyon  he was next called to rome where cardinals testify that on hearing sacred names he would give a yell and fall into ecstasy returning to assisi he was held in high honour and converted a hanoverian prince  he healed many sick people and having fallen into a river came out quite dry  he could scarcely read but was inspired with wonderful theological acuteness  he always yelled before falling into an ecstasy afterwards he was so much under the dominion of anaesthesia that hot coals if applied to his body produced no effect  then he soared in air now higher now lower a cardinal vouches for six inches and in aere pendulus haerebat like the gentlemans butler at lord orrerys  seventy separate flights indoors and out of doors are recorded in fact it was well to abstain from good words in conversation with st joseph of cupertino for he would give a shout on hearing a pious observation and fly up after which social intercourse was out of the question  he was indeed prevented by his superiors from appearing at certain sacred functions because his flights disturbed the proceedings indeed everything was done by the church to discourage him but in vain  he explained his preliminary shout by saying that guns also make a noise when they go off so the cardinal de laurea heard him remark  he was even more fragrant than the miraculous conformist or the late mr stainton moses to whose seances scent was marvellously borne by spirits  it must be remembered that contemporary witnesses attest these singular circumstances in the evidence taken two years after his death for the beatification of joseph  from assisi he was sent to various obscure convents where his miracles were as remarkable as ever one christmas eve hearing sacred music he flew up like a bird from the middle of the church to the high altar where he floated for a quarter of an hour yet upset none of the candles  an insane nobleman was brought to him to be healed  seizing the afflicted prince by the hair of the head he uttered a shout and soared up with the patient who finally came down cured  once he flew over a pulpit and once more than eighty yards to a crucifix  this is probably a record  when some men were elevating a cross for a calvary and were oppressed by the weight joseph uttered a shriek flew to them and lightly erected the cross with his own hand  the flight was of about eighty yards  he flew up into a tree once and perched on a bough which quivered no more than if he had been a bird  a rather commonplace pious remark uttered in his presence was the cause of this exhibition  once in church he flew from his knees caught a priest lifted him up and gyrated laetissimo raptu in mid air  in the presence of the spanish ambassador and many others he once flew over the heads of the congregation  once he asked a priest whether the holy elements were kept in a particular place  who knows said the priest whereon joseph soared over his head remained kneeling in mid air and came down only at the request of his ecclesiastical superior  joseph was clairvoyant and beheld apparitions but on the whole apart from his moral excellence his flights were his most notable accomplishment  on one occasion he casual remarked to a friend what an infernal smell infernails odor and then nosed out a number of witches and warlocks who were compounding drugs standing at some considerable distance standing in fact in quite another street  iamblichus in the letter to porphyry describes such persons as st joseph of cupertino  they have been known to be lifted up into the air     the subject of the afflatus has not felt the application of fire     the more ignorant and mentally imbecile a youth may be the more freely will the divine power be made manifest  joseph was ignorant and enfeebled by vigil and fasts so joseph was insensible of the application of fire and was lifted up into the air  yet the cardinals surgeons and other witnesses were not thinking of the pagan iamblichus when they attested the accomplishments of the saint  whence then comes the uniformity of evidence  the sceptical calef did not believe in these things because they are miracles that is contrary to experience  but here is experience enough to which they are not contrary  there are dozens of such depositions and here it is that the student of testimony and of belief finds himself at a deadlock believe the evidence we cannot yet we cannot doubt the good faith the veracity of the attesting witnesses  had we only savage or ancient and uneducated testimony we might say that the uniformity of myths of levitation is easily explained  the fancy wants a marvel it readily provides one by positing the infraction of the most universally obvious law that of gravitation  men dont fly let us say that a man flew like abaris on his arrow  this is rudimentary but then witnesses whose combined testimony would prove almost anything else declare that they saw the feat performed till we can find some explanation of these coincidences of testimony it is plain that a province in psychology in the relations between facts as presented to and as represented by mankind remains to be investigated  of all persons who have been levitated since st joseph a medium named eglinton was most subject to this infirmity  in a work named there is no death by florence marryat the author assures us that she has frequently observed the phenomenon  but mr eglinton after being investigated by the psychical society retired as mr myers says into private life  the tales told about him by spiritualists are of the kind usually imparted to a gallant but proverbially confiding arm of her majestys service  as for lord orrerys butler and the others there are the hypotheses that a cloud of honourable and sane witnesses lied that they were uniformly hallucinated or hypnotised by a glamour as extraordinary as the actual miracle would be or again that conjuring of an unexampled character could be done not only by home or eglinton in a room which may have been prepared but by home by a zulu by st joseph of cupertino and by naked fakirs in the open air  of all these theories that of glamour of hypnotic illusion is the most specious  thus when ibn batuta the old arabian traveller tells us that he saw the famous ropetrick performed in indiamen climbing a rope thrown into the air and cutting each other up while the bodies revive and reunite he very candidly adds that his companion standing by saw nothing out of the way and declared that nothing occurred 107a  this clearly implies that ibn batuta was hypnotised and that his companion was not  but dr carpenters attempt to prove that one witness saw nothing while lord lindsay and lord adare saw home float out of one window and in by another turns out to be erroneous  the third witness captain wynne confirmed the statement of the other gentlemen  we now approach the second class of marvels which regaled the circle at ragley namely alleged movements of objects without contact occurring not in the presence of a paid medium and with these we shall examine rappings and mysterious noises  the topic began to attract modern attention when tableturning was fashionable  but in common tableturning there was contact and faraday easily demonstrated that there was conscious or unconscious pushing and muscular exertion  in 1871 mr crookes made laboratory experiments with home using mechanical tests 107b  he demonstrated to his own satisfaction that in the presence of home even when he was not in physical contact with the object the object moved  e pur si muove  he published a reply to dr carpenters criticism and the commonsense of ordinary readers at least sees no flaw in mr crookess method and none in his argument  the experiments of the modern psychical society with paid mediums produced results in mr myerss opinion not wholly unsatisfactory but far from leading to an affirmative conclusion if by satisfactory mr myers means affirmative 108a  the investigations of mrs sidgwick were made under the mediumship of miss kate fox mrs jencken this lady began the modern spiritualism when scarcely older than mr mompessons two modest little girls and was accompanied by phenomena like those of tedworth  but in mrs sidgwicks presence the phenomena were of the most meagre and the reasoning faculties of the mind decline to accept them as other than perfectly normal the society tried mr eglinton who once was levitated in the presence of mr kellar the american conjurer who has publicly described feats like those of the gentlemans butler 108b  but after his dealings with the society mr eglinton has left the scene 108c  the late mr davey also produced results like mr eglintons by confessed conjuring  mr myers concludes that it does not seem worth while as a rule to examine the testimony to physical marvels occurring in the presence of professional mediums  he therefore collects evidence in the article quoted for physical marvels occurring where there is no paid medium  here as in the business of levitation the interest of the anthropologist and mythologist lies in the uniformity and identity of narratives from all countries climates and ages  among the earliest rappings with which we chance to be familiar are those reported by froissart in the case of the spirit orthon in the fourteenth century  the tale had become almost a fabliau but any one who reads the amusing chapter will see that it is based on a belief in disturbances like those familiar to glanvill and the misses fox  cieza de leon 1549 in the passage already quoted where he describes the levitated cacique of pirza in popyan adds that the christians saw stones falling from the air as in the greatrakes tale of the youghal witch and declares that when the chief was sitting with a glass of liquor before him the christians saw the glass raised up in the air and put down empty and a short time afterwards the wine was again poured into the cup from the air  mr home once equalled this marvel 109a and ibn batuta reports similar occurrences earlier at the court of the king of delhi  there is another case in histoire prodigieuse dune jeune fille agitee dun esprit fantastique et invisible 109b  a bourgeois of bonneval was beset by a rapping rattle of a sprite at dinner when he would lay his hand on a trencher it was carried off elsewhere and the wineglass when he was about drinking was snatched from his hand  so mr wesleys trencher was set spinning on the table when nobody touched it  in such affairs we may have the origin of the story of the harpies at the court of phineus  in china mr dennys tells how food placed on the table vanished mysteriously and many of the curious phenomena attributed to ghostly interference took place so that the householder was driven from house to house and finally into a temple in 1874 and all this after the death of a favourite but aggrieved monkey 110a throwing down crockery trampling on the floor etcsuch pranks as have attracted attention at home are not unknown     i must confess that in china as elsewhere these occurrences leave a bona fide impression of the marvellous which can neither be explained nor rejected 110b  we have now noted these alleged phenomena literally from china to peru  let us next take an old french case of a noisy sprite in the nunnery of st pierre de lyon  the account is by adrien de montalembert almoner to francis i 110c  the bibliography of this very rare tract is curious and deserves attention  when lenglet dufresnoy was compiling in 1751 his dissertations sur les apparitions he reprinted the tract from the paris quarto of 1528 in black letter  this example had been in the tellier collection and dufresnoy seems to have borrowed it from the royal convent of st genevieve  knowing that cardinal tencin had some acquaintance with the subject dufresnoy wrote to him and publishes vol i cxli his answer dated october 18 1751 lyons  the cardinal replied that besides the paris edition of 1528 there was a rouen reprint of 1529 by rolin gautier with engravings  brunet says that there are engravings in the paris edition of 1528 perhaps these were absent from the tellier example  that of rouen which cardinal tencin collated was in the abbey of st peter in lyons  some leaves had been thumbed out of existence and their place was supplied in manuscript  the only difference was in chapter xxviii where the printed rouen text may have varied  in the ms at all events it is stated that on march 21 the spirit of sister alix de telieux struck thirtythree great strokes on the refectory of her convent mighty and marvellous implying that her thirtythree years of purgatory were commuted into thirtythree days  a bright light scarcely endurable then appeared and remained for some eight minutes  the nuns then went into chapel and sang a te deum  at the end of the volume a later hand added in manuscript that the truth of the contemporary record was confirmed by the tradition of the oldest sisters who had received it from eyewitnesses of the earlier generation  the writer says that she had great difficulty in finding the printed copy but that when young in 1630 she received the tale from a nun then aged ninetyfour  this nun would be born in 1536 ten years after these events  she got the story from her aunt a nun gabrielle de beaudeduit qui etoit de ce tems la  there is no doubt that the sisters firmly and piously believed in the story which has the contemporary evidence of adrien de montalembert  dufresnoy learned that a manuscript copy of the tract was in the library of the jesuits of lyons  he was unaware of an edition in 12mo of 1580 cited by brunet  to come to the story one of our earliest examples of a medium and of communications by raps  the nunnery was reformed in 1516  a pretty sister alix de telieux fled with some of the jewels lived a gay life and died wretchedly in 1524  she it was as is believed who haunted a sister named anthoinette de grolee a girl of eighteen  the disturbance began with a confused halfdream  the girl fancied that the sign of the cross was made on her brow and a kiss impressed on her lips as she wakened one night  she thought this was mere illusion but presently when she got up she heard comme soubs ses pieds frapper aucuns petis coups rappings as if at the depth of four inches underground  this was exactly what occurred to miss hetty wesley at epworth in 1716 and at rio de janeiro to a child named c in professor alexanders narrative 112  montalembert says in 1528 i have heard these rappings many a time and in reply to my questions so many strokes as i asked for were given  montalembert received information by way of raps from the spirit about matters of importance qui ne pourroient estre cogneus de mortelle creature  certainly as he adds people have the best right to believe these things who have seen and heard them  the rites of the church were conferred in the most handsome manner on the body of sister alix which was disinterred and buried in her convent  exorcisms and interrogations of the spirit were practised it merely answered questions by rapping yes or no  on one occasion sister anthoinette was levitated  finally the spirit appeared bodily to her said farewell and disappeared after making an extraordinary fracas at matins  montalembert conducted the religious ceremonies  one case of hysteria was developed the sufferer was a novice  of course it was attributed to diabolical possession the whole story in its pleasant old french has an agreeable air of good faith but what interests us is the remarkable analogy between the lyons rappings and those at epworth tedworth and countless other cases old or of yesterday  we can now establish a catena of rappings and pour prendre date can say that communications were established through raps with a socalled spirit more than three hundred years before the rochester knockings in america  very probably wider research would discover instances prior to that of lyons indeed wierus in de praestigiis daemonum writes as if the custom was common  it is usual to explain the raps by a theory that the medium produces them through cracking his or her kneejoints  it may thus be argued that sister anthoinette discovered this trick or was taught the trick and that the tradition of her performance being widely circulated in montalemberts quarto and by oral report inspired later rappers such as miss kate fox miss c davis miss hetty wesley the gentlewoman at mr paschals mr mompessons modest little girls daniel home and miss margaret wilson of galashiels  miss wilsons uncle came one day to mr wilkie the minister and told him the devil was at his house for said he there is an odd knocking about the bed where my niece lies whereupon the minister went with him and found it so  she rising from her bed sat down to supper and from below there was such a knocking up as bred fear to all that were present  this knocking was just under her chair where it was not possible for any mortal to knock up  when miss wilson went to bed and was in a deep sleep her body was so lifted up that many strong men were not able to keep it down 114a  the explanation about cracking the knee joints hardly covers the levitations or accounts for the tremendous noise which surrounded sister anthoinette at matins or for the bright light a common spiritualistic phenomenon  margaret wilson was about twelve years of age  if it be alleged that little girls have a traditional method of imposture even that is a curious and interesting fact in human nature  as regards imposture there exists a singular record of a legal process in paris 1534 114b  it may have been observed that the lyons affair was useful to the church as against the damnable sect of lutherans because sister alix attested the existence of purgatory  no imposture was detected and no reader of montalembert can doubt his good faith nor the sincerity of his kindness and piety  but such a set of circumstances might provoke imitation  of fraudulent imitation the franciscans of orleans were accused and for this crime they were severely punished  we have the arrest des commissaires du conseil detat du roi from ms 7170 a of the bibliotheque du roi 115 we have also allusions in the franciscanus a satire in latin hexameter by george buchanan  finally we have versions in lavaterus and in wierus de curat laes maleficio amsterdam 1660 p 422  wierus born 1515 heard the story when with sleidan at orleans some years after the events  he gives the version of sleidan a notably protestant version  wierus is famous for his spirited and valuable defence of the poor women then so frequently burned as witches  he either does or pretends to believe in devils diabolical possession and exorcism but the exorcist to be respectable must be protestant  probably wierus was not so credulous as he assumes to be and a point of irony frequently peeps out  the story as told by sleidan differs from that in the official record  in this document adam fumee counsellor of the king announces that the franciscans of orleans have informed the king that they are vexed by a spirit which gives itself out by signs rappings as the wife of francois de st mesmin provost of orleans  they ask the king to take cognisance of the matter  on the other side st mesmin declares that the franciscans have counterfeited the affair in hope of blackmailing him  the king therefore appoints fumee to inquire into the case  thirteen friars are lying in prison in paris where they have long been in great wretchedness and poverty and perishing of hunger a pretty example of the laws delay  a commission is to try the case november 1534  the trouble had begun on february 22 1533 old style when father pierre darras at five am was called into the dormitory of les enfansnoviceswith holy water and everything proper knocking was going on and by a system of knocks the spirit said it wanted its body to be taken out of holy ground said it was madame st mesmin and was damned for lutheranism and extravagance  the experiment was repeated before churchmen and laymen but the lay observers rushed up to the place whence the knocks came where they found nothing  they hid some one there after which there was no knocking  on a later day the noises as in cock lane and elsewhere began by scratching  m lofficial the bishops vicar ouit gratter qui etoit le commencement de ladite accoutummee tumulte dudit esprit  but no replies were given to questions which the franciscans attributed to the disturbance of the day before and the breaking into various places by the people  one alicourt seems to have been regarded as the medium and the sounds were heard as in cock lane and at tedworth when he was in bed  later experiments gave no results and the friars were severely punished and obliged to recant their charges against madame de mesmin  the case scratches raps false accusations and all is parallel to that of the mendacious scratching fanny examined by dr johnson and douglas bishop of salisbury  in that affair the child was driven by threats to make counterfeit noises but as to the method of imposture at orleans nothing is said in the contemporary legal document  we now turn to the account by sleidan in wierus  the provosts wife had left directions for a cheap funeral in the franciscan church  this economy irritated the fathers who only got six pieces of gold having expected much greater plunder  colimannus colimant an exorcist named in the process was the ringleader they stationed a lad in the roof of the church who rapped with a piece of wood and made a great noise when they mumbled their prayers at night  st mesmin appealed to the king the fathers were imprisoned and the youth was kept in fumees house and plied with questions  he confessed the trick and the friars were punished  of all this confession and of the mode of imposture nothing is said in the legal process  from the whole affair came a popular saying cest lesprit dorleans when any fable was told buchanan talks of cauta parum pietas in fraude paranda  the evidence it may be seen is not very coherent and the franciscans may have been the deceived not the deceivers 117 wierus himself admits that he often heard a brownie in his fathers house which frightened him not a little and georgius pictorius avers that a noisy spirit haunted his uncles house for thirty years a very protracted practical joke if it was a practical joke 118  this was a stonethrowing demon  a large book might easily be filled with old stories of mysterious flights of stones and volatile chairs and tables  the ancient mystics of the levant were acquainted with the phenomena as iamblichus shows  the eskimo knew them well  glanvill is rich in examples the objects flying about in presence of a solitary spectator who has called at a haunted house and sometimes the events accompany the presence of a single individual who may or may not be a convulsionary or epileptic  sometimes they befall where no individual is suspected of constitutional electricity or of imposture  we may select a laughable example from a rare tract  an authentic candid and circumstantial narrative of the astonishing transactions at stockwell in the county of surrey on monday and tuesday the 6th and 7th of january 1772  published with the consent and approbation of the family and other parties concerned to authenticate which the original copy is signed by them  london 1772 printed for j marks bookseller in st martins lane  the dramatis personae are old mrs golding of stockwell parish a gentlewoman of unblemished honour and character mrs pain her niece a farmers wife respected in the parish mary martin her servant previously with mrs golding richard fowler a labourer living opposite mrs pain sarah fowler his wifeall these sign the documentand ann robinson mrs goldings maid just entered on her service  ann does not sign  the trouble began at ten am on january 6 when mrs golding heard a great smash of crockery an event most incident to maids  the lady went into the kitchen when plates began to fall from the dresser while she was there and nobody near them  then a clock tumbled down so did a lantern a pan of salt beef cracked and a carpenter rowlidge suggested that a recent addition of a room above had shaken the foundation of the house  mrs golding rushed into the house of mr gresham her next neighbour and fainted meanwhile ann robinson was mistress of herself though china fall and seemed in no hurry to leave the threatened dwelling  the niece of mrs golding mrs pain was sent for to mr greshams mrs golding was bled when lo the blood sprang out of the basin upon the floor and the basin broke to pieces  a bottle of rum of sympathetic character also burst  many of mrs goldings more fragile effects had been carried into mr greshams  the glasses and china first danced and then fell off the sideboard and broke mrs golding her mind one confused chaos next sought refuge at mr maylings for threequarters of an hour  here nothing unusual occurred but at mr greshams where ann robinson was packing the remains of her mistresss portable property a mahogany waiter a quadrille box a jar of pickles and a pot of raspberry jam shared the common doom  their end was pieces  mrs pain now hospitably conveyed her aunt to her house at rush common hoping all was over  this was about two in the afternoon  at eight in the evening the whole row of pewter dishes bar one fell from a shelf rolled about a little and as soon as they were quiet turned upside down they were then put upon the dresser and went through the same a second time  then of two eggs one flew off crossed the kitchen struck a cat on the head and then burst in pieces  a pestle and a mortar presently jumped six feet from the floor  the glass and crockery were now put on the floor he that is down need fear no fall but the objects began to dance and tumble about and then broke to pieces  a china bowl jumped eight feet but was not broken  however it tried again and succeeded candlesticks teakettles a tumbler of rum and water two hams and a flitch of bacon joined in the corroboree  most of the genteel families around were continually sending to inquire after them and whether all was over or not  all this while ann was walking backwards and forwards nor could they get her to sit down except for half an hour at prayers then all was quiet  she remarked with stoicism these things could not be helped  fowler came in at ten but fled in a fright at one in the morning  by five mrs golding summoned mrs pain who had gone to bed all the tables chairs drawers etc were tumbling about  they rushed across to fowlers where as soon as ann arrived the old game went on  fowler therefore like the landlord in the poem did plainly say as how he wished theyd go away at the same time asking mrs golding whether or not she had been guilty of some atrocious crime for which providence was determined to pursue her on this side the grave and to break crockery till death put an end to the stupendous nemesis  having hitherto been esteemed a most deserving person mrs golding replied with some natural warmth that her conscience was quite clear and she could as well wait the will of providence in her own house as in any other place she and the maid went to her abode and there everything that had previously escaped was broken  a ninegallon cask of beer that was in the cellar the door being open and nobody near it turned upside down a pail of water boiled like a pot  so mrs golding discharged miss ann robinson and that is all  at mrs goldings they took up three and at mrs pains two pails of the fragments that were left  the signatures follow appended on january 11  the tale has a sequel  in 1817 an old mr braidley who loved his joke told hone that he knew ann and that she confessed to having done the tricks by aid of horsehairs wires and other simple appliances  we have not mr braidleys attested statement but anns character as a medium is under a cloud  have all other mediums secret wires  everyday book i 62  ann robinson we have seen was a tranquil and philosophical maiden not so was another person who was equally active ninety years earlier  bovet in his pandaemonium 1684 gives an account of the demon of spraiton in 1682  his authorities were j g esquire a near neighbour to the place the rector of barnstaple and other witnesses  the medium was a young servant man appropriately named francis fey and employed in the household of sir philip furze  now this young man was subject to a kind of trance or extatick fit and part of his body was occasionally somewhat benumbed and seemingly deader than the other  the nature of feys case physically is clear  he was a convulsionary and his head would be found wedged into tight places whence it could hardly be extracted  from such a person the long and highly laughable tale of ghosts a male ghost and a jealous female ghost which he told does not much win our acceptance  true mrs thomasin gidley anne langdon and a little child also saw the ghost in various forms but this was probably mere fancy or the hallucinations of fey were infectious  but objects flew about in the young mans presence one of his shoestrings was observed without the assistance of any hand to come of its own accord out of his shoe and fling itself to the other side of the room the other was crawling after it  but a maid espying that with her hand drew it out and it claspd and curld about her hand like a living eel or serpent  a barrel of salt of considerable quantity hath been observed to march from room to room without any human assistance and so forth 122  it is hardly necessary to add more modern instances  the electric girl angelique cottin who was a rival of ann robinson had her powers well enough attested to arouse the curiosity of arago  but when brought from the country to paris her power or her artifice failed  it is rather curious that tales of volatile furniture are by no means very common in trials for witchcraft  the popular belief was and probably still is that a witch or warlock could throw a spell over an enemy so that his pots and pans tables and chairs would skip around  the disturbances of this variety in the presbytery at cideville in seine inferieure 1850 came under the eye of the law because a certain shepherd injudiciously boasted that he had caused them by his magic art 123a  the cure who was the victim took him at his word and the shepherd swain lost his situation  he then brought an action for defamation of character but was non suited as it was proved that he had been the fanfaron of his own vices  in froissarts amusing story of orthon that noisy sprite was hounded on by a priest  at tedworth the owner of the drum was wanted on a charge of sorcery as the cause of the phenomena  the

in that book  m patris laughed at this tale and went into the gallery when a large chair so heavy that two men could scarcely lift it shook itself and came at him  he remonstrated and the chair returned to its usual position  this made a deep impression on m patris and contributed in no slight degree to make him a converted character a le faire devenir devot 125a  tales like this with that odd uniformity of tone and detail which makes them curious might be collected from old literature to any extent  thus among the sounds usually called rappings mr crookes mentions as matter within his own experience a cracking like that heard when a frictional machine is at work  now as may be read in southeys life of wesley and in clarkes memoirs of the wesleys this was the very noise which usually heralded the arrival of jeffrey as they called the epworth spirit 125b  it has been alleged that the charming and illfated hetty wesley caused the disturbances  if so and dr salmon who supports this thesis does not even hazard a guess as to the modus operandi hetty must have been familiar with almost the whole extent of psychical literature for she scarcely left a single phenomenon unrepresented  it does not appear that she supplied visible hands  we have seen glanvill lay stress on the apparition of a hand  in the case of the devil of glenluce there appeared a naked hand and an arm from the elbow down beating upon the floor till the house did shake again 126a at rerrick in 1695 it knocked upon the chests and boards as people do at a door  and as i was at prayer says the rev alexander telfair leaning on the side of a bed i felt something thrusting my arm up and casting my eyes thitherward perceived a little white hand and an arm from the elbow down but it vanished presently 126b  the hands viewed grasped and examined by homes clientele hands which melted away in their clutch are innumerable and the phenomenon with the cold breeze is among the most common in modern narratives  our only conclusion is that the psychological conditions which begat the ancient narratives produce the new legends  these surprise us by the apparent good faith in marvel and myth

visions  he decides that the spirits who haunt places and houses may have gone to italy because masses are dear in england  scot as an ardent protestant conceived that haunted houses were a lewd invention encouraged if not originated by the priests in support of the doctrine of purgatory as a matter of fact the belief in haunting dates from times of savagery when we may say that every bush has its bogle  the church had nothing to do with the rise of the belief though early in the reformation some psychical phenomena were claimed as experimental proofs of the existence of purgatory  reginald scot decidedly made his protestant boast too soon  after 300 years of the trewth as knox called it the haunted houses are as much part of the popular creed as ever  houses stand empty and are said to be haunted here not the fact of haunting but only the existence of the superstition is attested  thus a house in berkeley square was long unoccupied for reasons perfectly commonplace and intelligible  but the fact that it had no tenants needed to be explained and was explained by a myththere were ghosts in the house  on the other hand if reginald scot asked today who heareth the noises who seeth the visions we could answer protestant clergymen officers in the army ladies landagents solicitors representatives of all classes except the haunted house committee of the psychical society  before examining the researches and the results of this learned body we may glance at some earlier industry of investigators  the common savage beliefs are too well known to need recapitulation and have been treated by mr tylor in his chapter on animism 129 and by mr herbert spencer in principles of psychology  the points of difference between these authors need not detain us here  as a rule the spirits which haunt the bush or the forest are but vaguely conceived of by the australian blacks or red men  they may be ghosts of the dead or they may be casual spirits unattached  an example analogous to european superstition is given by john tanner in his narrative of a captivity among the red indians 1830  in this case one man had slain his brother or at least a man of his own totem and was himself put to death by the kindred  the spectres of both haunted a place which the indians shunned but tanner whose totem was the same as that of the dead passed a night on the scene  his dreams if not his waking moments for his account is indistinct were disturbed by the ghosts  it is impossible to ascertain how far this particular superstition was coloured by european influences 130  over classical tales we need not linger  pliny plutarch suetonius st augustine lucian plautus in the mostellaria describe with more or less of seriousness the apparitions and noises which haunted houses public baths and other places occasionally a slain mans phantom was anxious that his body should be buried and the reported phenomena were akin to those in modern popular legends  sometimes in the middle ages and later the law took cognisance of haunted houses when the tenant wished to break his lease  a collection of authorities is given elsewhere in ghosts before the law  it is to be noticed that bouchel in his bibliotheque du droit francais chiefly cites classical not modern instances  among the most careful and exhaustive postmediaeval writers on haunted houses we must cite petrus thyraeus of the society of jesus doctor in theology  his work published at cologne in 1598 is a quarto of 352 pages entitled loca infesta that is concerning places haunted by mischievous spirits of demons and of the dead thereto is added a tract on nocturnal disturbances which are wont to bode the deaths of men  thyraeus begins that certain places are haunted by spectres and spirits is no matter of doubt wherein a modern reader cannot confidently follow him  when it comes to establishing his position thyraeus most provokingly says we omit cases which are recent and of daily occurrence such as he heard narrated during his travels in a certain haunted castle  a modern inquirer naturally prefers recent examples which may be inquired into but the old scholars reposed more confidence in what was written by respected authors the more ancient the more authoritative  however thyraeus relies on the anthropological test of evidence and thinks that his belief is confirmed by the coincident reports of hauntings variis distinctissimisque locis et temporibus in the most various times and places  there is something to be said for this view and the identity of the alleged phenomena in all lands and ages does raise a presumption in favour of some kind of abnormal occurrences or of a common species of hallucinations  like most of the old authors thyraeus quotes augustines tale of a haunted house and an exorcism in de civitate dei lib xxii ch viii  st gregory has also a story of one paschasius a deacon who haunted some baths and was seen by a bishop 131a  there is a ghost who rode horses and frightened the religious in the life of gregory by joannes diaconus iv 89  in the life of theodorus one georgius a disciple of his mentions a house haunted by stonethrowing sprites a very common phenomenon in the books of glanvill and increase mather in witch trials and in rural disturbances  omitting other examples cardan 131b is cited for a house at parma in which during a hundred years the phantom of an old woman was seen before the death of members of the family this is a rare case of an italian banshie  william of paris in bodin iii ch vi tells of a stonethrowing fiend very active in 1447  the bogey of bingen a rapping ghost of 856 is duly chronicled he also threw stones  the dormitory of some nuns was haunted by a spectre who moaned tramped noisily around dragged the sisters out of bed by the feet and even tickled them nearly to death  this annoyance lasted for three years so wierus says 132 wodrow chronicles a similar affair at mellantrae in annandale thyraeus distinguishes three kinds of haunting sprites devils damned souls and souls in purgatory  some are mites mild and sportive some are truculenti ferocious  brownies or fauni may act in either character as secutores et joculatores  they rather aim at teasing than at inflicting harm  they throw stones lift beds and make a hubbub and crash with the furniture  suicides murderers and spirits of murdered people are all apt to haunt houses  the sprites occasionally appear in their proper form but just as often in disguise  a demon too can appear in human shape if so disposed  demons being of their nature deceitful and fond of travesty as porphyry teaches us and as law 1680 illustrates whether the spirits of the dead quite know what they are about when they take to haunting is in the opinion of thyraeus a difficult question  thomas aquinas following st augustine inclines to hold that when there is an apparition of a dead man the dead man is unconscious of the circumstance  a spirit of one kind or another may be acting in his semblance  thyraeus rather fancies that the dead man is aware of what is going on  hauntings may be visual auditory or confined to the sense of touch  auditory effects are produced by flutterings of air noises are caused steps are heard laughter and moaning  lares domestici brownies mostly make a noise  apparitions may be in tactile form of men or animals or monsters  as for effects some ghosts push the living and drive them along as the bride of lammermoor in laws memorialls was harled through the house by spirits  the spirits of an amorous complexion seem no longer to be numerous but are objects of interest to thyraeus as to increase mather  thyraeus now raises the difficult question  are the sounds heard in haunted houses real or hallucinatory  omnis qui a spiritibus fit simulatus est specie sui fallit  the spirits having no vocal organs can only produce noise  in a spiritual hurlyburly some of the mortals present hear nothing as we shall note in some modern examples but may they not be prevented from hearing by the spirits  or again the sounds may be hallucinatory and only some mortals may have the power of hearing them  if there are visual there may also be auditory hallucinations 133  on the whole thyraeus thinks that the sounds may be real on some occasions when all present hear them hallucinatory on others  but the sounds need not be produced on the furniture for example when they seem to be so produced  often we think that the furniture has been all tossed about when it really has not been stirred  the classical instance of the disturbances which aroused scott at abbotsford on the death of his agent bullock is in point here  often a hammer is heard rapping when there is no hammer in the house p 82  these are curious references to phenomena however we explain them which are still frequently reported  thyraeus thinks that the air is agitated when sounds are heard but that is just the question to be solved  as for visual phantasms these thyraeus regards as hallucinations produced by spirits on the human senses not as external objective entities  he now asks why the sense of touch is affected usually as if by a cold body  beyond assuming the influence of spirits over the air and apparently their power of using dead bodies as vehicles for themselves thyraeus comes to no distinct conclusion he endeavours at great length to distinguish between haunters who are ghosts of the dead and haunters who are demons or spirits unattached  the former wail and moan the latter are facetious  he decides that to bury dead bodies below the hearth does not prevent haunting for the hearth has no such efficacy  such bodies are not very unfrequently found in old english houses the reason for this strange interment is not obvious but perhaps it is explained by the superstition which thyraeus mentions  one might imagine that to bury people up and down a house would rather secure haunting than prevent it  and indeed at passenham rectory where the rev g m capell found seven skeletons in his diningroom in 1874 mrs montague crackanthrope and her nurse were obsessed by a feeling that some one was in the room when some one was not 135 perhaps seven burials were not sufficient to prevent haunting  the conclusion of the work of thyraeus is devoted to exorcisms and orthodox methods of expelling spirits  the knockings which herald a death are attributed to the lares a kind of petty mischievous demons unattached  such is the essence of the learned jesuits work and the strange thing is that in an age of science people are still discussing his problems and stranger still that the reported phenomena remain the same  that the church in the case of thyraeus and many others that medical science in the person of wierus b 1515 that law in the book of bouchel should have gravely canvassed the topic of haunted houses was of course very natural in the dark ages before the restoration of the stuarts and the founding of the royal society commonsense and drolling sadduceeism came to their own in england with the king with charles ii  after may 29 1660 webster and wagstaffe mocked at bogles if glanvill and more took them seriously  before the restoration it was distinctly dangerous to laugh at witchcraft ghosts and hauntings  but the laughers came in with the merry monarch and less by argument than by ridicule by inveighing against the horror too of the hideous witch prosecutions the laughers gradually brought hauntings and apparitions into contempt few educated people dared to admit that their philosophy might not be wholly exhaustive  even ladies sneered at dr johnson because he having no dread of commonsense before his eyes was inclined to hold that there might be some element of truth in a worldold and worldwide belief and the romantic anna seward told without accepting it scotts tale of the tapestried chamber  that a hundred years after the highday and triumph of commonsense people of education should be found gravely investigating all that common sense had exploded is a comfortable thought to the believer in progress  the world does not stand still  a hundred years after the blue stockings looked on johnson as the last survivor the last of the mohicans of superstition the psychical society can collect some 400 cases of haunted houses in england  ten years ago in 1884 the society sifted out nineteen stories as in the first class and based on good firsthand evidence  their analysis of the reports led them to think that there is a certain genuine type of story and that when a tale differs widely from the type it proves to be incorrect or unattainable from an authentic source  this is very much the conclusion to which the writer is brought by historical examination of stories about hauntings  with exceptions to be indicated these tales all approximate to a type and that is not the type of the magazine story  it may be well in the first place to make some negative statements as to what the committee does not discover  first it has never yet hired haunted house in which the sights and sounds continued during the tenancy of the curious observers 137  the most obvious inference is that the earlier observers who saw and heard abnormal things were unscientific convivial nervous hysterical or addicted to practical joking  this however is not the only possible explanation  as a celebrated prophet by his own avowal had been known to be steady for weeks at a time so even in a regular haunted house the ghost often takes a holiday  a case is well known to the writer in which a ghost began his manoeuvres soon after a family entered the house  it made loud noises it opened doors turning the handle as the lady of the house walked about it pulled her hair when she was in bed plucked her dress produced lights and finally appeared visibly a hag dressed in grey to several persons  then as if sated the ghost struck work for years when it suddenly began again was as noisy as ever and appeared to a person who had not seen it before but who made a spirited if unsuccessful attempt to run it to earth  the truth is that magazine stories and superstitious exaggerations have spoiled us for ghosts  when we hear of a haunted house we imagine that the ghost is always on view or that he has a benefit night at certain fixed dates when you know where to have him these conceptions are erroneous and a house may be haunted though nothing desirable occurs in presence of the committee moreover the committee as far as the writer is aware have neglected to add a seer to their number  this mistake if it has been made is really wanton  it is acknowledged that not every one has a nose for a ghost as a character of george eliots says or eyes or ears for a ghost  it is thought very likely that where several people see an apparition simultaneously the spiritual or psychical or imaginative impact is addressed to one and by him or her usually her handed on to the rest of the society  now if the committee do not provide themselves with a good sensitive comrade what can they expect but what they get that is nothing a witch in an old scotch trial says of her covin or circle we could do no great thing without our maiden  the committee needs a maiden as a covin needed one and among the visionaries of the psychical society there must be some young lady who should be on the house committee  yet one writer in the societys proceedings who has a very keen scent for an impostor if not for a ghost avers that from the evidence she believes that they are examining facts and not the origin of fables  these facts as was said differ from the stories in christmas numbers  the ghost in typical reports seldom or never speaks it has no message to convey or if it has a message it does not convey it  it does not unfold some tragedy of the past  in fact it is very seldom capable of being connected with any definite known dead person  the figure seen sometimes varies with the seer 139  in other cases however different people attest having seen the same phantasm  finally a new house seems just as likely to be haunted as an old house and the committee appears to have no special knowledge of very ancient family ghosts such as pearlin jean the luminous boy of corby or the rather large company of spectres popularly supposed to make themselves at home at glamis castle  what then is the type the typical haunted house from which if narratives vary much they are apt to break down under cross examination  the phenomena are usually phenomena of sight or sound or both  as a rule the sounds are footsteps rustling of dresses knocks raps heavy bangs noises as of dragging heavy weights and of disarranging heavy furniture  these sometimes occur freely where nobody can testify to having seen anything spectral  next we have phantasms mostly of figures beheld for a moment with the tail of the eye or in going along a passage or in entering a room where nobody is found or standing beside a bed perhaps in a kind of selfluminous condition  sometimes these spectres are taken by visitors for real people but the real people cannot be found sometimes they are at once recognised as phantasms because they are semitransparent or look very malignant or because they glide and do not walk or are luminous or for some other excellent reason the combination in due proportions of pretty frequent inexplicable noises with occasional aimless apparitions makes up the type of orthodox modern haunted house story  the difficulty of getting evidence worth looking at except for its uniformity is obviously great  noises may be naturally caused in very many ways  by winds by rats by boughs of trees by water pipes by birds  the writer has known a very satisfactory series of footsteps in an historical scotch house to be dispelled by a modification of the water pipes again he has heard a person of distinction mimic the noises made by his family ghosts which he preserved from tests as carefully as don quixote did his helmet and the performance was an admirable imitation of the wind in a spout  there are noises however which cannot be thus cheaply disposed of and among them are thundering whacks on the walls of rooms which continue in spite of all efforts to detect imposture  these phenomena says kiesewetter were known to the acadians of old a circumstance for which he quotes no authority 140a  paracelsus calls the knocks pulsatio mortuorum in his fragment on souls of the dead and thinks that the sounds predict misfortune a very common belief 140b  lavaterus says that such disturbances in unfinished houses are a token of good luck  again there is the noise made apparently by violent movement of heavy furniture which on immediate examination as in scotts case at abbotsford is found not to have been moved  the writer is acquainted with a dog a collie which was once shut up alone in a room where this disturbance occurred  the dog was much alarmed and howled fearfully but it soon ceased to weigh on his spirits  when phantasms are occasionally seen by respectable witnesses where these noises and movements occur the haunted house is of a healthy orthodox modern type  but the phenomena are nothing less than modern for mather sinclair paracelsus wierus glanvill bovet baxter and other old writers are full of precisely these combinations of sounds and sights while many cases occur in old french literature old latin literature and among races of the lower barbaric and savage grades of culture  one or two curious circumstances have rather escaped the notice of philosophers though not of thyraeus  first the loudest of the unexplained sounds are occasionally not audible to all so that as when the noise seems to be caused by furniture dragged about we may conjecture with thyraeus that there is no real movement of the atmosphere that the apparent crash is an auditory hallucination  the planks and heavy objects at abbotsford had not been stirred as the loud noises overhead indicated when scott came to examine them  in a dreadfully noisy curacy vouched for by a wellknown church dignitary who occupied the place there was usually a frightful crash as of iron bars thrown down at 2 am on a sunday morning all the boxes and heavy material in a locked set of attics seemed to be dancing about but were never found to have been stirred  yet this clergyman discovered that the great sunday crash might manifest itself to some persons in the house without his wife or himself being conscious of it  knowing how overwhelming the sound always appeared to me when i did hear it i cannot but consider this one of the most wonderful things in the whole business 142  in this case in a house standing hundreds of yards apart from any neighbour and occupied only by a parson his wife and one servant these phenomena lasted for a year with great regularity  there were the usual footsteps the ordinary rappings were angry when laughed at and the clergyman when he left at the end of a year was as far as ever from having detected any cause  indeed it is not easy to do so  a friend of the writers an accomplished man of law was once actually consulted in the interests of an enraged squire as to how he could bring a suit against somebody for a series of these inexplicable disturbances  but the law contained no instrument for his remedy  from the same report of the s p r we take another typical case a lady in an old house saw in 1873 a hideous hag watching her in bed she kept the tale to herself but a fortnight later her brother a solicitor was not a whit less alarmed by a similar and similarly situated phenomenon  in this house dresses were plucked at heavy blows were struck heavy footsteps went about there were raps at doors and nobody was ever any the wiser as to the cause here it may be observed that a ghosts power of making a noise and exerting what seems to be great physical energy is often in inverse ratio to his power of making himself generally visible or at all events to his inclination so to do  thus there is a long record of a haunted house by the chief observer miss morton in p s p r pt xxii p 311  a lady had died of habits too convivial in 1878 in april 1882 miss mortons family entered but nobody saw the ghost till miss morton viewed it in june  the appearance was that of a tall lady in widows weeds hiding her face with a handkerchief  from 1882 to 1884 miss morton saw the spectre six times but did not name it to her family  her sister saw the appearance in 1882 a maid saw it in 1883 and two boys beheld it in the same year  miss morton used to follow the appearance downstairs and speak to it but it merely gave a slight gasp and seemed unable to converse  by way of testing the spectre miss morton stretched threads at night from the railing of the stair to the wall but the ghost descended without disturbing them  yet her footsteps sounded on the stairs  this is in fact a crucial difficulty about ghosts they are material enough to make a noise as they walk but not material enough to brush away a thread  this ghost whose visible form was so much en evidence could or did make no noise at all beyond light pushes at doors and very light footsteps  in the curacy already described noises were made enough to waken a parish but no form was ever seen  briefly for this ghost there is a cloud of witnesses all solemnly signing their depositions  these two examples are at the opposite poles between which ghostly manifestations vary in haunted houses  a brief precis of cases may show how these elements of noise on one side and apparitions on the other are commonly blended  in a detached villa just outside the town of c mrs w remarks a figure of a tall darkhaired man peeping round the corner of a folding door  she does not mention the circumstance  two months later she sees the same sorrowful face in the drawingroom  this time she tells her husband  later in the same month when playing cricket with her children she sees the face peeping round from the kitchen door  rather later she heard a deep voice say in a sorrowful tone i cant find it something slaps her on the back her stepdaughter who had not heard of the phantasm sees the same pale darkmoustached face peeping round the folding doors  she is then told mrs ws story  her little brother later sees the figure simultaneously with herself  she also hears the voice say i cant find it at the same moment as mrs w hears it  a year later she sees the figure at the porch in a tall hat  neither lady had enjoyed any other hallucination  nothing is known of the melancholy spectre probably the ghost of a literary person searching always searching for a manuscript poem by some total stranger who had worried him into his grave and not left him at peace even there  this is a very solemn and touching story and appeals tenderly and sadly to all persons of letters who suffer from the unasked for manuscripts of the general public  2  some ladies and servants in a house in hyde park place see at intervals a phantom housemaid  she is also seen by a mr bird there is no story about a housemaid and there are no noises  this is not an interesting tale  3  a hindoo native woman is seen to enter a locked bathroom where she is not found on inquiry  a woman had been murdered there some years before  the percipient general sir arthur becher had seen other uncanny visions  a little boy wakened out of sleep said he saw an ayah  perhaps he did  4  a mr harry in the south of europe saw a white female figure glide through his library into his bedroom  later his daughters beheld a similar phenomenon  mr harry a gentleman of sturdy commonsense dared his daughters to talk of any such nonsense as ghosts as they might be sure apparitions were only in the imagination of nervous people  he himself saw the phantasm seven or eight times in his bedroom and twice in the library  on one occasion it lifted up the mosquito curtains and stared at mr harry as in the case of meeting an avalanche a weakminded man would pray sir would pray a strongminded man would swear sir would swear  mr harry was a strongminded man and behaved in a concatenation accordingly although petrus thyraeus says that there is no use in swearing at ghosts  the phantasm seemed to be about thirtyfive her features were described as rather handsome and unromantically as oblong  a hallucination we need hardly say would not raise the mosquito curtains this ghost had more heart in it than most  5  various people see a column of light vaguely shaped like a woman moving about in a room of a house in sussex  one servant who slept in the room in hopes of a private view saw a ball of light with a sort of halo round it  again in a very pretty story the man who looked after an orphan asylum saw a column of light above the bed of one of the children  next morning the little boy declared that his mother had come to visit him probably in a dream  on this matter of lights 146 mr podmore enters into argument with mr frederick myers  mr myers on the whole believes that the phenomena of haunted houses are caused by influences of some sort from the minds of the dead  mr podmore if we understand him holds that some living person has had some empty hallucination in a house and that this is telepathically handed on perhaps to the next tenant who may know nothing about either the person or the vision  thus a miss morris much vexed by ghostly experiences left a certain house in december 1886  nearly a year later in november 1887 a mrs g came in  mrs g did not know miss morris nor had she heard of the disturbances  however sobs and moans and heavy thumps and noises of weighty objects thrown about and white faces presently drove mrs g to seek police protection this only roused the ghosts ambition and he came as a man with freckles also he walked about shook beds and exhibited lights  a figure in black with a white face now displayed itself barristers and clergymen investigated but to no purpose  they saw figures heard crashes and the divine did a little anglican exorcism  the only story about the house showed that a woman had hanged herself with a skipping rope in the top back bedroom in 1879  here are plenty of phenomena apparitions male and female but miss morris in addition to hearing noises only saw a pale woman in black  mr podmores theory comes in thus  the later experiences may have been started by thought transference from miss morris whose thoughts no doubt occasionally turned to the house in which she had suffered so much agitation and alarm  moreover real noises may have suggested the visual hallucinations to miss morris 147 mr podmore certainly cannot be accused of ordinary superstition there is a house and there is a tenant  she hears footsteps pounding up and downstairs and all through her room she says nothing and gets used to it  let it be granted that these noises are caused by rats  after conquering her dislike to the sounds three weeks after her entry to the house miss morris meets a total stranger deadly pale in deep black who vanishes  this phantasm has gathered round the nucleus which the rats provided by stamping up and downstairs and through miss morriss room  it is natural that a person who hears rats or wind or waterpipes and makes up her mind not to mind it should then see a phantasm of a pale woman in black also should hear loud knocks at the door of her chamber miss morris goes away a year later comes mrs g and mrs g her children her servants a barrister and an exorcist are all disturbed by  noises  knocks  sobs  moans  thumps  dragging of heavy weights  one dreadful white face  one little woman  lights  one white skirt hanging from the ceiling  one footfall which played two notes on the piano   one figure in brown  one man with freckles  two human faces  one shadow  one part of the dress of a supermaterial being barrister  one form exorcist  one small column of misty vapour  now all this catalogue of prodigies which drove mrs g into the cold bleak world was caused by thought transference from miss morris who had been absent for a year and whose own hallucinations were caused by noises which may have been produced by rats or what not  this ingenious theory is too much for mr myerss powers of belief the very first effect of miss morriss ponderings was a heavy thump followed by a deep sob and moan and a cry of oh do forgive me all disturbing poor mrs g who had the ill luck to find herself in a bedroom about which miss morris was possibly thinking     surely the peace of us all rests on a very uncertain tenure  meanwhile mr myers prefers to regard the whole trouble as more probably caused by the dreams of the dead woman who hanged herself with a skipping rope than by the reflections of miss morris  in any case the society seem to have occupied the house and with their usual bad luck were influenced neither by the ponderings of miss morris nor by the fredaines of the lady of the skipping rope 149  it may be worth noticing that the raps knocks lights and so forth of haunted houses the spontaneous disturbances have been punctually produced at savage classical and modern seances  if these from the days of the witch of endor to our own and from the polar regions to australia have all been impostures at least they all imitate the spontaneous phenomena reported to occur in haunted houses  the lights are essential in the seances described by porphyry eusebius iamblichus  they were also familiar to the covenanting saints  the raps are known to australian black fellows  the phantasms of animals as at the wesleys house may be beasts who play a part in the dead mans dream or they may be incidental hallucinations begotten of rats and handed on by miss morris or any one else  there remains a ghost who illustrates the story spread all over europe of the farmer who was driven from his house by a bogle  as his carts went along the road the bogle was heard exclaiming were flitting today and it faithfully stayed with the family this tale current in italy as well as in northern england might be regarded as a mere piece of folklore if the incident had not reproduced itself in west brompton  in 1870 the ts took a house here  now mark the artfulness of the ghost it did nothing for eighteen months  in autumn 1871 miss t saw a figure come out of the diningroom and the figure was often seen later by five independent witnesses  it was tall dressed in grey and was chiefly fond of haunting miss ts own room  it did not walk it glided making no noise  mr t met it in the hall once when he came in at night and from the street he saw it standing in the drawingroom window  it used to sigh and make a noise as of steps when it was not visible it knocked and moved furniture about and dropped weights but these sounds were sometimes audible only to one or a few of the observers  in 1877 the ts left for another house to which miss t did not repair till 1879  then the noises came back as badly as everthe bogle had flittedand on christmas day 1879 miss t saw her old friend the figure  several members of the family never saw it at all  one lady in another case miss nettie vatassimpson tried to flap a ghost away with a towel 150 but he was not thus to be exorcised  he presently went out through a locked door  such are the ordinary or typical phenomena of haunted houses  it is plainly of no use to take a haunted house for a month and then say it is not haunted because you see no ghosts  even where they have been seen there are breaks of years without any manifestations besides the evidence shows that it is not every one who can see a ghost when he is there  miss mortons father could not see the lady in black when she was visible to miss morton  it is difficult to write with perfect seriousness about haunted houses  the writer will frankly confess that when living in haunted houses as he has done at various times when suffering from illness and overwork he takes a very solemn view of the matter about bedtime  if expectant attention on a mind strained by the schools and a body enfeebled by bronchitis could have made a man who was the only occupant of the haunted wing of an old scotch castle see a ghost the writer would have seen whatever there was to see  to be sure he could not rationally have regarded a spectre beheld in these conditions as a wellauthenticated ghost 151  as far as his experience of firsthand tales is concerned the persons known to him who say they have seen ghosts in haunted houses were neither unhealthy nor except in one solitary case imaginative nor were they expecting a ghost  the apparition was a little pleasant surprise  the usual seer is not an invalid nor a literary person who can always be dismissed as imaginative though he is generally nothing of the kind  but it cannot be denied that ladies either see more ghosts than men or are less reluctant to impart information  the visionary lady who keeps up a regular telepathic correspondence with several friends is likely to see a ghost and should certainly be entered at fixed local ghosts but there are slight objections to such evidence as not free from suspicion of fancifulness  turning from the seers to the seen it is difficult or impossible even to suggest an hypothesis which will seem to combine the facts the most plausible fancy is that which likens the apparitions to figures in a feverish dream  could we imagine a more or less bad man or woman dead and fitfully living over again in that sleep of death old events among old scenes could we go further and believe that these dreams were capable of being made objective and visible to the living then we might find a kind of theory of the process but even if it were possible to demonstrate the existence of such a process we are as far as ever from accounting for the force which causes noises or hallucinations of noises a force of considerable vigour according to observers  still less could we explain the rare cases in which a ghost produces a material effect on the inanimate or animate world as by drawing curtains or pulling peoples hair and clothesall phenomena as well vouched for as the others  a picture projected by one mind on another cannot conceivably produce these effects  they are such as ghosts have always produced or been said to produce  since the days of ancient egypt ghosts have learned and have forgotten nothing  unless we adopt the scientific and popular system of merely saying fudge we find no end to the conundrums of the ghostly world  ghosts seem to know as little about themselves as we do so that if we are to discover anything we must make haste before we become ghosts ourselves  writers on psychology sometimes make a push at a theory of haunted houses  mr james sully for example has done so in his book styled illusions 153  mr sully appears well pleased with his hypothesis and this granting the accuracy of a tale for which he is indebted to a gentleman who need not be cited here argues an easily contented disposition  here is the statement  a lady was staying at a country house  during the night and immediately on waking up she had sic an apparition of a strange looking man in mediaeval costume a figure by no means agreeable and which seemed altogether unfamiliar to her  the next morning on rising she recognised the original of her hallucinatory image in a portrait hanging on the wall of her bedroom which must have impressed itself on her brain before the occurrence of the apparition though she had not attended to it  oddly enough she now learned for the first time that the house at which she was staying had the reputation of being haunted and by the very same somewhat repulsivelooking mediaeval personage that had troubled her intersomnolent moments  the case seems to me to be typical with respect to the genesis of ghosts and of the reputation of haunted houses  this anecdote affords much joy to the superstitious souls who deal in psychical research or ghost hunting  mr sullys manner of narrating it clearly proves the difference between science and superstition  for a ghost hunter or psychical researcher would not venture to publish a modern ghost story except for mere amusement if he had it not at first hand or at second hand with corroboration at first hand  science however can adduce a case without indicating the evidence on which it rests as whether mr sullys informant had the tale from the lady or at third fourth fifth or a hundredth hand  so much for the matter of evidence  next mr sully does not tell us whether the lady had an apparition when she supposed herself to be awake or asleep or betwixt and between  from the phrase intersomnolent he appears to prefer the intermediate condition  but he does not pretend to have interrogated the lady the percipient  again the figure wore a mediaeval costume the portrait represented a mediaeval personage  does mr sully believe that the portrait was an original portrait of a real person and how many portraits of mediaeval people does he suppose to exist in english country houses taking the middle ages as lasting till the beginning of the reign of henry viii say till holbein we can assure mr sully that they have left us very few portraits indeed  but perhaps it was a modern picture a fanciful study of a man in mediaeval costume  in that event mr sullys case is greatly strengthened but he does not tell us whether the work of art was or was not contemporary with the middle ages  neither does he tell us whether the lady was in the habit of seeing hallucinations  the weakest point in the whole anecdote and theory is in the statement oddly enough she now learned for the first time that the house at which she was staying had the reputation of being haunted by the mediaeval personage  it certainly would be very odd if one picture in a house troubled the intersomnolent moments of a succession of people who perhaps had never seen or like the lady never attended to it  such troubles are very rare  very few persons have seen a dream which in mr sullys words left behind for an appreciable interval after waking a vivid after impression and in some cases even the semblance of a sense perception  mathematicians may calculate the chances against a single unnoticed portrait producing this very rare effect in a series of cases so as to give rise to a belief in haunting by mere casual coincidence  in the records of the psychical society one observer speaks of seeing a face and figure at night which he recognises next morning in a miniature on his chimneypiece  but in this case there was no story of haunting there had been no series of similar impressions on successive occupants of the room that is the circumstance which mr sully finds odd enough a sentiment in which we may all agree with him  this is exactly the oddity which his explanation does not explain  while psychological science in this example seems to treat matters of evidence rather laxly psychical conjecture on the other hand leaves much unexplained  thus mr myers puts forward a theory which is in origin due to st augustine  the saint had observed that any one of us may be seen in a dream by another person while our intelligence is absolutely unconscious of any communication  apply this to ghosts in haunted houses  we may be affected by a hallucination of the presence of a dead man or woman but he or she granting their continued existence after death may know nothing of the matter  in the same way there are stories of people who have consciously tried to make others at a distance think of them the subjects of these experiments have it is said had a hallucination of the presence of the experimenter  but he is unaware of his success and has no control over the actions of what old writers and some new theosophists call his astral body suppose then that something conscious endures after death suppose that some one thinks he sees the dead  it does not follow that the surviving consciousness ex hypothesi of the dead person who seems to be seen is aware that he is manifesting himself  as mr myers puts it ghosts must therefore as a rule representnot conscious or central currents of intelligencebut mere automatic projections from consciousnesses which have their centres elsewhere greek  as homer makes achilles say there is no heart in them 156  all this is not inconceivable  but all this does not explain the facts namely the noises often very loud and the movements of objects and the lights which are the common or infrequent accompaniments of apparitions in haunted houses  now we have always on much the same level of evidence accounts of similar noises and movements of untouched objects occurring where living persons of peculiar constitution are present or in haunted houses these things we discuss in an essay on the logic of tableturning by parity of reasoning or at least by an obvious analogy we are led to infer that more than an automatic projection from the consciousness of a dead man is present where he is not only seen but heard making noises and perhaps moving objects  if this be admitted then psychical conjecture is pushed back on something very like the old theory of haunted houses namely that a ghost or spiritual entity is present and active there  long ago in a little tale called castle perilous published in a volume named the wrong paradise the author made an affable sprite explain all these phenomena  we suffer we ghosts he said in effect from a malady akin to aphasia in the living  we know what we want to say and how we wish to appear but just as a patient in aphasia uses the wrong word we use the wrong manifestation  this he illustrated by a series of apparitions on his own part which he declared were involuntary and unconscious  when they were described to him by the percipient he admitted that they were vulgar and distressing though as far as he was concerned merely automatic  these remarks of the ghost were at least explicit and intelligible  the theory which he stated with an honourable candour and in language perfectly lucid appears to have been adopted by mr frederick myers but he puts it in a different style i argue that the phantasmogenetic agency at workwhatever that may bemay be able to produce effects of light more easily than definite figures     a similar argument will hold good in the case of the vague hallucinatory noises which frequently accompany definite veridical phantasms and frequently also occur apart from any definite phantasm in houses reputed haunted 158a  now where mr myers says phantasmogenetic agency we say ghost  jappelle un chat un chat et rollet un fripon  we urge that the ghost cannot as it were express himself as plainly as he would like to do that he suffers from aphasia  now he shows as a black dog now as a green lady now as an old man and often he can only rap and knock or display a light or tug the bedclothes  thus the rev f g lee tells us that a ghost first sat on his breast invisibly then glided about his room like a man in grey and finally took to thumping on the walls the bed and in the chimney  dr lee kindly recited certain psalms and was greeted with applause a very tornado of knocks    was the distinct and intelligible response 158b  now on our theory the ghost if he could would have said thank you very much or the like but he could not so his sentiments translated themselves into thumps  on another occasion he might have merely shown a light or he might have sat on dr lees chest pressed unduly on my chest says the learned divine or pulled his blankets off as is not unusual  such are the peculiarities of spectral aphasia or rather asemia  the ghost can make signs but not the right signs  very fortunately for science we have similar examples of imperfect expression in the living  thus dr gibotteau formerly interne at a hospital in paris published in annales des sciences psychiques oct and dec 1892 his experiments on a hospital nurse and her experiments on him  she used to try to send him hallucinations once at 8 pm in summer as he stood on a balcony he saw a curious reflet blanc a shining shadow like that in the strange story  it resembled the reflection of the sun from a window but there was neither sun nor moon nor lighted lamps  this white shadow was the partial failure of berthe the nurse to show herself to me on the balcony  in precisely the same way lights in haunted houses are partial failures of ghosts to appear in form as for the knocks dr binns in his anatomy of sleep mentions a gentleman who could push a door at a distanceif he could push he could knock perhaps a rather larger collection of such instances is desirable still these cases illustrate our theory  that theory certainly does drive the cold calm psychical researcher back upon the primitive explanation  a ghaists a ghaist for a that  we must come to this we must relapse into savage and superstitious psychology if once we admit a phantasmogenetic agency  but science is in quest of truth regardless of consequences     cock lane and commonsense   cock lane ghost discredited  popular theory of imposture  dr johnson  story of the ghost  the deceased wifes sister beginning of the phenomena  death of fanny  recurrence of phenomena  scratchings  parallel cases  ignorance and malevolence of the ghost  possible literary sources  investigation  imitative scratchings  a failure  trial of the parsonses  professor barretts irish parallel  cause undetected  the theories of commonsense  the st maur affair  the amiens case  the sportive highland fox  the brightling case  if one phantom is more discredited than another it is the cock lane ghost  the ghost has been a proverb for impudent trickery and stern exposure yet its history remains a puzzle and is a good if vulgar type of all similar marvels  the very people who exposed the ghost were well aware that their explanation was worthless and frankly admitted the fact  yet they no more than we were prepared to believe that the phenomena were produced by the spiritual part of miss fanny lknown after her decease as scratching fanny  we still wander in cock lane with a sense of amused antiquarian curiosity and the same feeling accompanies us in all our explorations of this branch of mythology  it may be easy for some people of commonsense to believe that all london was turned upside down that walpole the duke of york lady mary coke and two other ladies were drawn to cock lane five in a hackney coach that dr johnson gave up his leisure and incurred ridicule merely because a naughty child was scratching on a little wooden board  the matter cannot have been so simple as that but from the true solution of the problem we are as remote as ever  we can indeed study even the cock lane ghost in the light of the comparative or anthropological method  we can ascertain that the occurrences which puzzled london in 1762 were puzzling heathen philosophers and fathers of the church 1400 years earlier  we can trace a chain of scratching fannies through the ages and among races in every grade of civilisation  and then the veil drops or we run our heads against a blank wall in a dark alley  chaldeans egyptians greeks eskimo red men dyaks fellows of the royal society inquisitors saints have perlustrated cock lane and have come away nothing the wiser  some of course have thought they had the secret have recognised the work of god daemons spirits ghosts devils fairies and of ordinary impostors  others have made a push at a theory of disengaged nervous force or animal magnetism we prefer to leave theory alone not even accepting with enthusiasm the hypothesis of dr johnson  he expressed great indignation at the imposture of the cock lane ghost and related with much satisfaction how he had assisted in detecting the cheat and had published an account of it in the newspapers  upon this subject i incautiously offended him by pressing him with too many questions says boswellquestions which the good doctor was obviously unable to answer  it is in january 1762 that the london newspapers begin to be full of a popular mystery the cock lane ghost  reports articles letters appeared and the ghost made what is now called a sensation  perhaps the most clear if the most prejudiced account is that given in a pamphlet entitled the mystery revealed published by bristow in st pauls churchyard 1762  comparing this treatise which goldsmith is said to have written for three guineas with the newspapers the gentlemans magazine and the annual register we get a more or less distinct view of the subject but the various newspapers repeat each others versions with slight alterations the gentlemans magazine and annual register follow suit the narratives are synoptic while goldsmiths tract if it be goldsmiths is obviously written in defence of the unlucky mr k falsely accused of murder by the ghost  mr ks version is the version given by goldsmith and thus leads up to the phenomena through a romance of middleclass life  in 1756 this mr k a person of some means married miss e l of l in norfolk  in eleven months the young wife died in childbed and her sister miss fanny came to keep house for mr k  the usual passionate desire to marry his deceased wifes sister assailed mr k and fanny shared his flame  according to goldsmith the canon law would have permitted the nuptials if the wife had not born a child which lived though only for a few minutes  however this may be mr k honourably fled from fanny who unhappily pursued him with letters and followed him to town  here they took lodgings together but when mr k left the rooms being unable to recover some money which he had lent his landlord the pair looked out for new apartments  these they found in cock lane in the house of mr parsons clerk of st sepulchres  it chanced here we turn to the annual register for 1762 that mr k left fanny alone in cock lane while he went to a wedding in the country  she asked little elizabeth parsons her landlords daughter to share her bed and both of them were disturbed by strange scratchings and rappings  these were attributed by mrs parsons to the industry of a neighbouring cobbler but when they occurred on a sunday this theory was abandoned  poor fanny according to the newspapers thought the noises were a warning of her own death  others after the event imagined that they were caused by the jealous or admonishing spirit of her dead sister fanny and mr k having sued mr parsons for money lent left his rooms in dudgeon and went to bartlet court clerkenwell  here fanny died on february 2 1760 of a disease which her physician and apothecary certified to be smallpox and her coffin was laid in the vault of st johns church  now the noises in cock lane had ceased for a year and a half after fanny left the house but they returned in force in 176162  mr parsons in vain took down the wainscotting to see whether some mischievous neighbour produced the sounds 165  the raps and scratches seemed to come on the bed of little elizabeth parsons just as in the case of the tedworth drummer investigated by glanvill a hundred years earlier and in the case at orleans 230 years earlier  the orleans case is published with full legal documents from ms 40 7170 4 bibliotheque du roi in recueil de dissertations anciennes et nouvelles sur les apparitions ii 90 a avignon 1751 scratching was usually the first manifestation in this affair and the scratches were heard in the bedroom occupied by certain children  the cock lane child was always affected with tremblings and shiverings at the coming and going of the ghost  it was stated that the child had seen a shrouded figure without hands two other witnesses one of them a publican had seen a luminous apparition with hands  this brilliant being lit up the figures on the dial of a clock  the noises followed the child to other houses and multitudes of people clergy nobles and princes also followed the child  a certain mr brown was an early investigator and published his report  like adrien de montalembert in 1526 like the franciscans about 1530 he asked the ghost to reply affirmatively or negatively to questions by one knock for yes two for no this method was suggested it seems by a certain mary frazer in attendance on the child  thus it was elicited that fanny had been poisoned by mr k with red arsenic in a draught of purl to which she was partial  she added that she wished to see mr k hanged  she would answer other questions now right and now wrong  she called her father john while his real name was thomas  in fact she was what porphyry the neoplatonist would have called a deceitful demon  her chief effects were raps scratchings and a sound as of whirring wings which filled the room  this phenomenon occurs in a haunted house mentioned in the journal of the psychical society it is infinitely more curious to recall that when mr im thurn in british guiana submitted to the doctoring of a peayman see p 39 he heard a sound at first low and indistinct and then gathering in volume as if some big winged thing came from far toward the house passed through the roof and then settled heavily on the floor and again after an interval as if the same winged thing rose and passed away as it had come  mr im thurn thinks the impression was caused by the waving of boughs  these cock lane occurrences were attributed to ventriloquism but after a surgeon had held his hand on the childs stomach and chest while the noises were being produced this probable explanation was abandoned  the girl was said to be constantly attended by the usual noises though bound and muffled hand and foot and that without any motion of her lips and when she appeared to be asleep 166  this binding is practised by eskimo angakut or sorcerers as of old by mediums greek in ancient greece and egypt so we gather from iamblichus and some lines quoted from porphyry by eusebius 167  a kind of cabinet as modern spiritualists call a curtain seems to have been used  in fact the phenomena luminous apparition tumultuous sounds and all were familiar to the ancients  nobody seems to have noted this but one unusually sensible correspondent of a newspaper quoted cases of knockings from baxters certainty of the worlds of spirits and thought that baxters popular book might have suggested the imposture  though the educated classes had buried superstition it lived of course among the people who probably thumbed baxter and glanvill  thus things went on crowds gathering to amuse themselves with the ghost  on february 1 mr aldrich a clergyman of clerkenwell assembled in his house a number of gentlemen and ladies having persuaded parsons to let his child be carried thither and tested dr johnson was there and dr macaulay suggested the admission of a mrs oakes  dr johnson supplied the newspapers with an account of what happened  the child was put to bed by several ladies about ten oclock and the company sat for rather more than an hour during which nothing occurred  the men then went downstairs and talked to parsons when they were interrupted by some of the ladies who said that scratching and knocking had set in  the company returned and made the child hold her hands outside the bedclothes no phenomena followed  now the sprite had promised to rap on its own coffin in the vault of st johns so thither they adjourned without the medium but there was never a scratch  it is therefore the opinion of the whole assembly that the child has some art of making or counterfeiting particular noises and that there is no agency of any higher cause  in precisely the same way the judges in the franciscan case of 1533 visited the bed of the child where the spirit had been used to scratch and rap heard nothing and decided that the affair was a hoax  the nature of the fraud was not discovered but the franciscans were severely punished  at lyons the bishop and some other clerics could get no response from the rapping spirit which was so familiar with the kings chaplain adrien de montalembert 15267  thus the ghost in some measure remains undetected says goldsmith and indeed walpole visited cock lane but could not get in apparently after the detection  but writing on february 2 he may speak of an earlier date  meanwhile matters were very uncomfortable for mr k  accused by a ghost he had no legal remedy  goldsmith like most writers assumes that parsons undertook the imposture in revenge for having been sued for money lent by mr k  he adds that mr k was engaged in a chancery suit by his relations and seems to suspect their agency  meanwhile elizabeth was being tested in various ways finally the unlucky child was swung up in a kind of hammock her hands and feet extended wide and for two nights no noises were heard  next day she was told that if there were no noises she and her father would be committed to newgate  she accordingly concealed a little board on which a kettle usually stood a piece of wood six inches by four  she managed this with so little art that the maids saw her place the wood in her dress and informed the investigators of the circumstances  scratches were now produced but the child herself said that they were not like the former sounds and the concurrent opinion of the whole assembly was that the child had been frightened by threats into this attempt     the master of the house and his friend both declared that the noises the girl had made this morning had not the least likeness to the former noises  in the same way the wesleys at epworth in 1716 found that they could not imitate the perplexing sounds produced in the parsonage  the end of the affair was that parsons mary frazer a clergyman a tradesman and others were tried at the guildhall and convicted of a conspiracy on july 10 1762  parsons was pilloried and a handsome collection was made for him by the spectators  his later fortunes or misfortunes and those of the miserable little elizabeth are unknown  one thing is certain the noises did not begin in an attempt at imposture on parsonss part he was on good terms with his lodgers when fanny was first disturbed  again the child could not counterfeit the sounds successfully when she was driven by threats to make the effort  the seance of rather more than an hour in which johnson took part was certainly inadequate the phenomena were such as had been familiar to law and divinity at least since 856 ad 170a  the agencies always made accusations usually false  the knocking spirit at kembden near bingen in 856 charged a priest with a scandalous intrigue  the raps on the bed of the children examined by the franciscans about 1530 assailed the reputation of a dead lady  when the foxes at rochester in 1848 49 set up alphabetic communication with the knocks they told a silly tale of a murder  the cock lane ghost lied in the same way the fox girls started modern spiritualism on its wild and mischievous career as elizabeth parsons might have done in a more favourable environment  there was never anything new in all these cases  the lowest savages have their seances levitations bindings of the medium trancespeakers peruvians indians have their objects moved without contact  simon magus or st paul under that offensive pseudonym was said to make the furniture move at will 170b  there is a curious recent cock lane case in ireland where the ghost brought no accusations against anybody  the affair was investigated by mr barrett a professor in the royal college of science dublin who published the results in the dublin university magazine for december 1877  the scene was a small lonely farm house at derrygonnelly near enniskillen  the farmers wife had died a few weeks before easter 1877 leaving him with four girls and one boy of various ages the eldest maggie being twenty  the noises were chiefly heard in her neighbourhood  when the children had been put to bed maggie lay down without undressing in the bedroom off the kitchen  a soft pattering noise was soon heard then raps from all parts of the room then scratchings as in cock lane  when mr barrett his friend and the farmer entered with a candle the sounds ceased but began again as if growing accustomed to the presence of the light  the hands and feet of the young people were watched but nothing was detected while the raps were going on everywhere around on the chairs on the quilt and on the big fourpost wooden bedsteads where they were lying  mr barrett now played moro with the raps that is he extended so many fingers keeping his hand in the pocket of a loose greatcoat and the sounds always responded the right number  four trials were made  then came a noise like the beating of a drum with violent scratching and tearing sounds  the trouble began three weeks after the wifes death  once a number of small stones were found on maggies bed  all the family suffered from sleeplessness and their candles even when concealed were constantly stolen  it took a boot from a locked drawer and the boot was found in a great chest of feathers in a loft  a bible was spirited about and a methodist teacher the family were methodists made no impression on the agency  they tried to get some communication by an alphabet but said the farmer it tells lies as often as truth and oftener i think  mr barrett and a friend on two occasions could detect no method of imposture and as the farmer did not believe that his children sorely distressed by the loss of their mother would play such tricks at such a time even if they could the mystery remains unsolved  the family found that the less attention they paid to the disturbances the less they were vexed  mr barrett examining some other cases found that dr carpenters and other theories did not account for them  but it is certain that the children as methodists had read wesleys account of the spirit at epworth in 1716  mr barrett was aware of this circumstance but was unable to discover how the thing was managed on the hypothesis of fraudulent imitation  the irish household seems to have reaped no profit by the affair but rather trouble annoyance and the expense of hospitality to strange visitors  the agency was mendacious as usual for porphyry complains that the spirits were always as deceitful as the cock lane ghost feigning to be gods heroes or the souls of the dead  it is very interesting to note how in greece as christianity waxed and paganism waned such inquiring minds as that of porphyry fell back on seances and spiritualism or superstitions unmentioned by homer and almost unheard of in the later classical literature  religion which began in shamanism in the trances of angakut and birraark returned to these again and everywhere found marvel mystery imposture conscious or unconscious  the phenomena have never ceased imposture has always been detected or asserted but that hypothesis rarely covers the whole field and so if we walk in cock lane at all we wander darkling in good and bad company among diviners philosophers saints witches charlatans hypnotists many a heart has been broken like that of mr dale owen by the late discovery of lifelong delusion for we meet in cock lane as porphyry says greek  yet this deceptive race has had its stroke in the making of creeds and has played its part in human history while it contributes not a little to human amusement meanwhile of all wanderers in cock lane none is more beguiled than sturdy commonsense if an explanation is to be provided  when once we ask for more than all stuff and nonsense we speedily receive a very mixed theory in which rats indigestion dreams and of late hypnotism are mingled much at random for commonsense shows more valour than discretion when she pronounces on matters or spirits which she has never studied  beautiful instances of commonsense explanations occur in two stories of the last century the st maur affair 1706 and the haunted house of amiens 1746  the author of ce quon doit penser de laventure arrivee a saint maur was m poupart canon of st maur near paris  the good canon of course admits biblical apparitions which are miraculous and admits hallucination caused by the state of the visual organs and by fever while he believes in something like the lucretian idea that bodies dead bodies at least shell off a kind of peel which may on occasion be visible common ghosts he dismisses on grounds of commonsense if spirits in purgatory could appear they would appear more frequently and would not draw the curtains of beds drag at coverlets turn tables upside down and make terrible noises all of which feats are traditional among ghosts  m poupart then comes to the adventure at st maur  the percipient m de s was a man of twentyfive  his mother seems to have been a visionary and his constitution is described as melancholic  he was living alone however and his mother has no part in the business  the trouble began with loud knocks at his door and the servant when she went to open it found nobody there  the curtains of his bed were drawn when he was alone in the room and here of course we have only his evidence  one evening about eleven he and his servants heard the papers on a table being turned over and though they suspected the cat no cat could be found  when s went to bed the same noise persisted in his sittingroom where the cat no doubt could easily conceal herself for it is not easy to find a cat who has motives for not being found  s again hunted for the animal but only heard a great rap on the wall  no sooner had s gone back to bed than the bed gave a violent leap and dashed itself against the wall  the jump covered four feet  he called his servants who replaced the bed but the curtains in their sight were drawn and the bed made a wild rush at the fireplace  this happened again twice though the servants held on gallantly to the bed  monsieur s had no sleep his bed continued to bound and run and he sent on the following day for a friend  in that gentlemans presence the leaps made by the bed ended in its breaking its left foot on which the visitor observed that he had seen quite enough he is said later to have expressed sorrow that he spoke but he may have had various motives for this repentance  on the following night s slept well and if his bed did rise and fall gently the movement rather cradled him to repose  in the afternoon the bolts of his parlour door closed of their own accord and the door of a large armoire opened  a voice then bade s do certain things which he was to keep secret go to a certain place and find people who would give him further orders  s then fainted hurt himself and with difficulty unbolted his door  a fortnight later s his mother and a friend heard more rapping and a heavy knock on the windows  m poupart now gives the explanations of commonsense  the early noises might have had physical causes  master servants and neighbours all heard them but that proves nothing  as to the papers a wind or a mouse may have interfered with them  the movements of the bed are more serious as there are several witnesses  but suppose the bed was on castors  the inquirer does not ask whether it really was on castors or not he supposes the case  then suppose s that melancholy man wants a lark a envie de se rejouir he therefore tosses about in bed and the bed rushes consequently round the room  this experiment may be attempted by any philosopher  let him lie in a bed with castors and try how far he can make it run while he kicks about in it this explanation dear to commonsense is based on a physical impossibility as any one may ascertain for himself  then the servants tried in vain to hold back the excited couch well these servants may have lied and at most could not examine les ressorts secrets qui causaient ce mouvement  now m poupart deserts the theory that we can make a bed run about by lying kicking on it and he falls back on hidden machinery  the independent witness is said to have said that he was sorry he spoke but this evidence proves nothing  what happened in the room when the door was bolted is not evidence of course and we may imagine that s himself made the noises on walls and windows when his friend and mother were present  thus m s was both melancholy and anxious se donner un divertissement by frightening his servants to which end he supplied his bed with machinery that made it jump and drew the curtains  what kind of secret springs would perform these feats m poupart does not explain  it would have been wiser in him to say that he did not believe a word of it than to give such silly reasons for a disbelief that made no exact inquiry into the circumstances  the frivolities of the bed are reported in the case of home and others nor can we do much more than remark the conservatism of the phenomena the knocks and the animated furniture  the amiens case 1746 is reported and attested by father charles louis richard professor in theology a dominican friar  the haunted house was in the rue de laventure parish of st jacques the tenant was a m leleu aged thirtysix  the troubles had lasted for fourteen years and there was evidence for their occurrence earlier before leleu occupied the house  the disturbances were of the usual kind a sound of heavy planks being tossed about as in the experience of scott at abbotsford raps the fastening of doors so that they could not be opened for long and then suddenly gave way this also is frequent in modern tales a sound of sweeping the floor as in the epworth case in the wesleys parsonage heavy knocks and thumps the dragging of heavy bodies steps on the stairs lights the dancing of all the furniture in the room of mlle marie de latre rattling of crockery a noise of whirring in the air a jingling as of coins familiar at epworth and briefly all the usually reported tintamarre  twenty persons priests women girls men of all sorts attest those phenomena which are simply the ordinary occurrences still alleged to be prevalent  the narrator believes in diabolical agency but he gives the explanations of commonsense  1  m leleu is a visionary  but as no one says that all the other witnesses are visionaries this helps us little  2  m leleu makes all the noise himself  that is he climbs to the roof with a heavy sack of grain on his shoulder and lets it fall he runs up and down the chimneys with his heavy sack on his shoulder he frolics with weighty planks all over the house thumps the walls makes furniture dance and how  what is his motive  his tenants leave him he is called a fool a devil a possessed person  his business is threatened they talk of putting him in jail and that is all he has got by his partiality for making a racket  3  the neighbours make the noises and again the narrator asks how and why  4  some priests slept in the house once and heard nothing  but nobody pretends that there is always something to hear  the bishop of amiens licenses the publication with the more confidence as we have ourselves received the depositions of ten witnesses a number more than sufficient to attest a fact which nobody has any interest in feigning  in a tale like this which is only one out of a vast number exactly analogous commonsense is illadvised in simply alleging imposture so long maintained so motiveless and on the whole so very difficult to execute  m leleu brought in the church with its exorcisms but our dominican authority does not say whether or not the noises ceased after the rites had been performed  dufresnoy in whose dissertations 178 these documents are republished mentions that bouchel in his bibliotheque du droit francois d v louage treats of the legal aspect of haunted houses  thus the profession has not wholly disdained the inquiry  of all common sensible explanations the most sporting and good humoured is that given by the stepdaughter of alexander dingwall a tenant in inverinsh in 1761  poor dingwall in his cornyard heard very grievous lamentations which continued as he imagined all the way to the seashore  these he regarded as a warning of his end but his stepdaughter sensibly suggested that as the morning was cold the voice must be that of a fox to cause dogs run after him to give him heat  dingwall took to bed and died but the suggestion that the fox not only likes being hunted but provokes it as a form of healthy exercise is invaluable  the tale is in theophilus insulanus on the second sight  there is no conclusion to be drawn from this mass of cock lane stories  occasionally an impostor is caught as at brightling in 1659  mr joseph bennet a minister in that town wrote an account of the affair published in increase mathers remarkable providences  several things were thrown by an invisible hand including crabs  yet there was a seeming blur cast though not on the whole yet upon some part of it for their servant girl was at last found throwing some things  she averred that an old woman had bidden her do so saying that her master and dame were bewitched and that they should hear a great fluttering about their house for the space of two days  this cock lane phenomenon however is not reported to have occurred  the most credulous will admit that the maid is enough to account for the brightling manifestations some of the others are more puzzling and remain in the region of the unexplained     apparitions ghosts and hallucinations   apparitions appear  apparitions are not

contradictory cases  perplexities of the anxious inquirer  only one thing is certain about apparitions namely this that they do appear  they really are perceived  now as popular language confuses apparitions with ghosts this statement sounds like an expression of the belief that ghosts appear  it has of course no such meaning  when le loyer in 1586 boldly set out to found a science of spectres he carefully distinguished between his method and the want of method observable in the telling of ghost stories  he began by drawing up long lists of apparitions which are not spectres or ghosts but the results of madness malady drink fanaticism illusions and so forth  it is true that le loyer with all his deductions left plenty of genuine spectres for the amusement of his readers  like him we must be careful not to confound apparitions with ghosts  when a fist applied to the eye makes us see stars when a liver not in good working order makes us see muscae volitantes or spiders when alcohol produces the horrorsvisions of threatening persons or animalswhen a lesion of the brain or delirium or a disease of the organs of sense causes visions or when they occur to starved and enthusiastic ascetics all these false perceptions are just as much apparitions as the view of a friend at a distance beheld at the moment of his death or as the unrecognised spectre seen in a haunted house  in popular phrase however the two last kinds of apparitions are called ghosts or wraiths and the popular tendency is to think of these and of these alone when apparitions are mentioned  on the other hand the tendency of commonsense is to rank the two last sorts of apparition the wraith and ghost with all the other kinds which are undeniably caused by accident by malady mental or bodily or by mere confusion and misapprehension as when one seeing a post in the moonlight takes it for a ghost  science following a third path would class all perceptions which have not the basis in fact that they seem to have as hallucinations  the stars seen after a blow on the eye are hallucinationsthere are no real stars in viewand the friend whose body seems to fill space before our sight when his body is really on a deathbed far away and again the appearance of the living friend whom we see in the drawingroom while he is really in the smokingroom or in timbuctooare hallucinations also  the commonsense of the matter is stated by aristotle  the reason of the hallucinations is that appearances present themselves not only when the object of sense is itself in motion but also when the sense is stirred as it would be by the presence of the object de insomn ii 460 b 23 26  the ghost in a haunted house is taken for a figure say of a monk or of a monthly nurse or what not but no monthly nurse or monk is in the establishment  the percept is a percept for those who perceive it the apparition is an apparition for them but the perception is hallucinatory  so far everybody is agreed  the differences begin when we ask what causes hallucinations and what different classes of hallucinations exist  taking the second question first we find hallucinations divided into those which the percipient or percipients believes at the moment and perhaps later to be real and those which his judgment pronounces to be false  famous cases of the latter class are the idola which beset nicolai who studied them and wrote an account of them  after a period of trouble and trial and neglect of bloodletting nicolai saw first a dead man whom he had known and later crowds of people dead living known or unknown  the malady yielded to leeches 183  examples of the first sort of apparitions taken by the judgment to be real are common in madness in the intemperate and in ghost stories  the maniac believes in his visionary attendant or enemy the drunkard in his rats and snakes the ghostseer often supposes that he has actually seen an acquaintance where no mistaken identity is possible and only learns later that the persondead or alive and wellwas at a distance  thus the writer is acquainted with the story of a gentleman who when at work in his study at a distance from england saw a colleague in his profession enter the room  just wait till i finish this business he said but when he had hastily concluded his letter or whatever he was engaged on his friend had disappeared  that was the day of his friends death in england here then the hallucination was taken for a reality indeed there was nothing to suggest that it was anything else  mr gurney has defined a hallucination as a percept which lacks but which can only by distinct reflection be recognised as lacking the objective basis which it suggestsand by objective basis he means the possibility of being shared by all persons with normal senses nobody but the percipient was present on the occasion just described so we cannot say whether other people would have seen the visitor or not  but reflection could not recognise the unreality of this percept till it was found that in fact the visitor had vanished and had never been in the neighbourhood at all  here then are two classes of hallucinations those which reflection shows us to be false as if a sane man were to have the hallucination of a crocodile or of a dead friend entering the room and those which reflection does not at the moment show to be false as if a friend were to enter who could be proved to have been absent  in either case what causes the hallucination or are there various possible sorts of causes  now defects in the eye or in the optic nerve to speak roughly may cause hallucinations from without an injured external organ conveys a false and distorted message to the brain and to the intelligence  a nascent malady of the ear may produce buzzings and these may develop into hallucinatory voices here be hallucinations from without  but when a patient begins with a hallucination of the intellect as that inquisitors are plotting to catch him or witches to enchant him and when he later comes to see inquisitors and witches where there are none we have apparently a hallucination from within  again some persons like blake the painter voluntarily start a hallucination  draw me edward i a friend would say blake would voluntarily establish a hallucination of the monarch on a chair in a good light and sketch him if nobody came between his eye and the royal sitter  here then are examples of hallucinations begotten from within either voluntarily by a singular exercise of fancy or involuntarily as the suggestion of madness of cerebral disease or abnormal cerebral activity  again a certain amount of intensity of activity at a sensory centre in the brain will start a percept  activity of the necessary force at the right place may be normally caused by the organ of sense say the eye when fixed on a real object say a candlestick  1  or the necessary activity at the sensory centre may be produced abnormally by irritation of the eye or along the line of nerve from the eye to the sensory centre  2  or thirdly there may be a morbid but spontaneous activity in the sensory centre itself  3  in case one we have a natural sensation converted into a perception of a real object  in case two we have an abnormal origin of a perception of something unreal a hallucination begotten from without that is by a vice in an external organ the eye  in case three we have the origin of an abnormal perception of something unreal a hallucination begotten by a vicious activity within in the sensory centre  but while all these three sets of stimuli set the machinery in motion it is the highest parts of the brain that in response to the stimuli create the full perception real or hallucinatory  but there remains a fourth way of setting the machinery in motion the first way in normal sensation and perception was the natural action of the organ of sense stimulated by a material object  the second way was by the stimulus of a vice in the organ of sense  the third way was a vicious activity in a sensory centre  all three stimuli reach the central terminus of the brain and are there created into perceptions the first real and normal the second a hallucination from an organ of sense from without the third a hallucination from a sensory centre from within  the fourth way is illustrated when the machinery is set agoing from the central terminus itself from the higher parts of the brain from the seats of ideation and memory  now as long as these parts only produce and retain ideas or memories in the usual way we think or we remember but we have no hallucination  but when the activity starting from the central terminus escapes downwards in sufficient force it reaches the lower centre and the organ of sense and then the idea or memory stands visibly before us as a hallucination  this omitting many technical details and much that is matter of more dispute than common is a statement rough and as popular as possible of the ideas expressed in mr gurneys remarkable essay on hallucinations 186  here then we have a rude working notion of various ways in which hallucinations may be produced  but there are many degrees in being hallucinated or enphantosme as the old french has it  if we are interested in the most popular kind of hallucinations ghosts and wraiths we first discard like le loyer the evidence of many kinds of witnesses diversely but undeniably hallucinated  a man whose eyes are so vicious as habitually to give him false information is not accepted as a witness nor a man whose brain is drugged with alcohol nor a man whose central terminus is abandoned to religious excitement to remorse to grief to anxiety to an apprehension of secret enemies nor even to a habit of being hallucinated though like nicolai he knows that his visionary friends are unreal  thus we would not listen credulously to a ghost story out of his own experience from a man whose eyes were untrustworthy nor from a shortsighted man who had recognised a dead or dying friend on the street nor from a drunkard  a tale of a vision of a religious character from pascal or from a red indian boy during his medicine fast or even from a colonel of dragoons who fell at prestonpans might be interesting but would not be evidence for our special purpose  the ghosts beheld by consciencestricken murderers by sorrowing widowers by spiritualists in dark rooms haunted by humbugs or those seen by lunatics or by children or by timid people in lonely old houses or by people who though sane at the time go mad twenty years later or by sane people habitually visionary these and many other ghosts we must begin like le loyer by rejecting  these witnesses have too much cerebral activity at the wrong time and place  they start their hallucinations from the external terminus the unhealthy organ of sense from the morbid central terminus or from some dilapidated cerebral station along the line  but when we have in a sane mans experience say one hallucination whether that hallucination does or does not coincide with a crisis in the life or perhaps with the death of the person who seems to be seen what are we to think  or again when several witnesses simultaneously have the same hallucinationnot to be explained as a common misinterpretation of a real objectwhat are we to think  this is the true question of ghosts and wraiths  that apparitions so named by the world do appear is certain just as it is certain that visionary rats appear to drunkards in delirium tremens  but as we are only to take the evidence of sane and healthy witnesses who were neither in anxiety grief or other excitement when they perceived their one hallucination there seems to be a difference between their hallucinations and those of alcoholism fanaticism sorrow or anxiety  now the common mistakes in dealing with this topic have been to make too much or to make too little of the coincidences between the hallucinatory appearance of an absent person and his death or some other grave crisis affecting him  too little is made of such coincidences by dr hibbert in his philosophy of apparitions p 231  he attempts a physical explanation of many ghost stories which may be considered most authentic  so he says but he only touches on three the apparition of claverhouse on the night of killiecrankie to lord balcarres in an edinburgh prison the apparition of her dead mother to miss lee in 1662 and the apparition of his wife who had born a dead child on that day in england to dr donne in paris early in the seventeenth century  dr hibbert dedicated his book in 1825 to sir walter scott of abbotsford bart president of the royal society of edinburgh  sir walter at heart as great a ghosthunter as ever lived was conceived to have a scientific interest in the mental principles to which certain popular illusions may be referred  thus dr hibberts business if he would satisfy the president of the royal society of edinburgh was to provide a physical explanation of many ghost stories which may be considered most authentic  in our prosaic age he would have begun with those most recent such as the tall man in brown viewed by sir walter on the moor near ashestiel and other still remembered contemporary hallucinations  far from that dr hibbert deliberately goes back two centuries for all the three stories which represent the many of his promise  the wynyard ghost was near him mrs rickettss haunted house was near him plenty of other cases were lying ready to his hand 189  but he went back two centuries and thencomplained of lack of evidence about interesting particulars  dr hibbert represents the science and commonsense of seventy years ago and his criticism probably represents the contemporary ideas about evidence  the balcarres tale as told by him is that the earl was in prison in edinburgh castle on the suspicion of jacobitism  suspicion is good he was the kings agent for civil as dundee was for military affairs in scotland  he and dundee and ailesbury stood by the king in london to the last  lord balcarres himself in his memoirs tells james ii how he was confined in close prison in edinburgh till the castle was surrendered to the prince of orange in dr hibberts tale the spectre of dundee enters balcarress room at night draws his curtain looks at him for some time and walks out of the room lord balcarres believing it to be dundee himself  dr hibbert never even asks for the authority on which this legend reposes certainly balcarres does not tell the tale in his own report or memoirs for james ii bannatyne club 1841  the doctor then grumbles that he does not know a syllable of the state of lord balcarress health at the time  the friend of bayle and of marlborough an honourable politician a man at once loyal and plainspoken in dealings with his master lord balcarress word would go for much if he gave it 190  but dr hibbert asks for no authority cites none  he only argues that agreeably to the well known doctrine of chances balcarres might as well have this hallucination at the time of dundees death as at any other p 232  now that is a question which we cannot settle without knowing whether lord balcarres was subject to hallucinations  if he was cadit quaestio if he was not then the case is different it is manifestly a problem in statistics and only by statistics of wide scope can it be solved 191  but dr hibbert was content to produce his easy solution without working out the problem  his second case is of 1662 and was taken down he says by the bishop of gloucester from the lips of the father of miss lee  this young lady in bed saw a light then a hallucination which called itself her mother  the figure prophesied the daughters death at noon next day and at noon next day the daughter died  a physician when she announced her vision attended her bled her and could find nothing wrong in her health  dr hibbert conjectures that her medical attendant did not know his business  the coincidence was a fortunate one that is all his criticism  where there is no coincidence the stories he says are forgotten  for that very reason he should have collected contemporary stories capable of being investigated but that did not occur to dr hibbert  his last case is the apparition of mrs donne with a dead child to dr donne in paris as recorded by walton  as donne was a poet very fond of his wife and very anxious about her health this case is not evidential and may be dismissed for a fortuitous coincidence p 332  certainly dr hibbert could come to no conclusion save his own on the evidence he adduces  but it was by his own fault that he chose only evidence very remote incapable of being crossexamined and scanty while we know that plenty of contemporary evidence was within his reach  possibly the possessors of these experiences would not have put them at his disposal but if he could get no materials he was in no position to form a theory  all this would have been recognised in any other matter but in this obscure branch of psychology beset as it is by superstition science was content to be casual  the error which lies at the opposite pole from dr hibberts mistake in not collecting instances is the error of collecting only affirmative instances  we hear constantly about hallucinations of sight sound or touch which suggest the presence of an absent person and which occur simultaneously with some exceptional crisis in that persons life or most frequently of all with his death 192  now mr gurney himself was much too fair a reasoner to avoid the collection of instantiae contradictoraes examples in which the hallucination occurs but does not coincide with any crisis whatever in the life of the absent person who seems to be present  of these cases dr hibbert could find only one on record in the mercure gallant january 1690  the writer tells us how he dreamed that a dead relation of his came to his bedside and announced that he must die that day  unlike miss lee he went on living  yet the dream impressed him so much that he noted it down in writing as soon as he awoke  dr johnson also mentions an instantia contradictoria  a friend of boswells near kilmarnock heard his brothers voice call him by name  now his brother was dead or dying in america johnson capped this by his tale of having when at oxford heard his name pronounced by his mother  she was then at lichfield but nothing ensued  in dr hibberts opinion this proves that coincidences when they do occur are purely matters of chance 193a  there are many hallucinations a death may correspond with one of them that case is noted the others are forgotten  yet the coincidences are so many or so striking that when a maori woman has a hallucination representing her absent husband she may marry without giving him recognised ground for resentment if he happens to be alive  this curious fact proves that the coincidence between death and hallucinatory presence has been marked enough to suggest a belief which can modify savage jealousy 193b  by comparing coincidental with noncoincidental hallucinations known to him mr gurney is said to have decided that the chances against a death coinciding with a hallucination were forty to onelong odds 194a  but it is clear that only a very large collection of facts would give us any materials for a decision  suppose that some 20000 people answer such questions as  1  have you ever had any hallucination  2  was there any coincidence between the hallucination and facts at the time unknown to you  the majority of sane people will be able to answer the first question in the negative  of those who answer both questions in the affirmative several things are to be said  first we must allow for jokes then for illusions of memory  corroborative contemporary evidence must be produced  again of the 20000 many are likely to be selected instances  the inquirer is tempted to go to a person who as he or she already knows has a story to tell  again the inquirers are likely to be persons who take an interest in the subject on the affirmative side and their acquaintances may have been partly chosen because they were of the same intellectual complexion 194b  all these drawbacks are acknowledged to exist and are allowed for and as far as possible provided against by the very fairminded people who have conducted this inquisition  thus mr henry sidgwick in 1889 said i do not think we can be satisfied with less than 50000 answers 195  but these 50000 answers have not been received  when we reflect that to our knowledge out of twentyfive questions asked among our acquaintances in one place none would be answered in the affirmative  while by selecting we could get twentyfive affirmative replies the delicacy and difficulty of the inquisition becomes painfully evident  mr sidgwick after making deductions on all sides of the most sportsmanlike character still holds that the coincidences are more numerous by far than the calculus of probabilities admits  this is a question for the advanced mathematician  m richet once made some experiments which illustrate the problem  one man in a room thought of a series of names which ex hypothesi he kept to himself  three persons sat at a table which as tables will do tilted and each tilt rang an electric bell  two other persons concealed from the view of the table tilters ran through an alphabet with a pencil marking each letter at which the bell rang  these letters were compared with the names secretly thought of by the person at neither table  he thought of        the answers were  1  jean racine      1  igard  2  legros           2  neghn  3  esther           3  foqdem  4  henrietta        4  higiegmsd  5  cheuvreux        5  dievoreq  6  doremond         6  epjerod  7  chevalon         7  cheval  8  allouand         8  iko  here the nonmathematical reader will exclaim  total failure except in case 7  and about that case he will have his private doubts  but arguing mathematically m richet proves that the table was right beyond the limits of mere chance by fourteen to two  he concludes on the whole of his experiments that probably intellectual force in one brain may be echoed in another brain  but mm binet and fere who report this decide that the calculation of chances is for the most part incapable of affording a peremptory proof it produces uncertainty disquietude and doubt 196  yet something is gained by substituting doubt for systematic denial richet has obtained this important result that henceforth the possibility of mental suggestion cannot be met with contemptuous rejection  mental suggestion on this limited scale is a phenomenon much less startling to belief than the reality and causal nature of coincidental hallucinations of wraiths  but it is plain that as far as general opinion goes the doctrine of chances applied to such statistics of hallucinations as have been collected can at most only produce uncertainty disquietude and doubt  yet if even these are produced a step has been made beyond the blank negation of hibbert  the general reader even if credulously inclined is more staggered by a few examples of noncoincidental hallucinations than confirmed by a pile of coincidental examples  now it seems to be a defect in the method of the friends of wraiths that they do not publish with full and impressive details as many examples of noncoincidental as of coincidental hallucinations  it is the story that takes the public  if we are to be fair we must give the noncoincidental story in all its features as is done in the matter of wraiths with a kind of message or meaning  let us set a good example by adducing wraiths which in slang phrase were sells  those which we have at first hand are marked a those at secondhand b  but the world will accept the story of a ghost that failed on very poor evidence indeed  1  a  a young lady in the dubious state between awake and asleep unable in fact to feel certain whether she was awake or asleep beheld her late grandmother  the old lady wept as she sat by the bedside  why do you weep grandmamma are you not happy where you are asked the girl  yes i am happy but i am weeping for your mother  is she going to die  no but she is going to lose you  am i going to die grandmamma  yes my dear  soon  yes my dear very soon  the young lady with great courage concealed her dream from her mother but confided it to a brother  she did her best to be good while she was on earth where she is still after an interval of many years  except for the conclusion and the absence of a mystic bright light in the bedroom this case exactly answers to that of miss lee in 1662  dr hibbert would have liked this example  2  b  a lady staying with a friend observed that one morning she was much depressed  the friend confided to her that in the past night she had seen her brother dripping wet  he told her that he had been drowned by the upsetting of a boat which was attached by a rope to a ship  at this time he was on his way home from australia  the dream or vision was recorded in writing when next the first lady met her friend she was entertaining her brother at luncheon  he had never even been in a boat dragged behind a ship and was perfectly safe  3  b  a lady residing at a distance from oxford wrote to tell her son who was at merton college that he had just entered her room and vanished  was he well  yes he was perfectly well and bowling for the college eleven  4  b  a lady in bed saw her absent husband  he announced his death by cholera and gave her his blessing she of course was very anxious and miserable but the vision was a lying vision  the husband was perfectly well  in all these four cases anxiety was caused by the vision and in three at least action was taken the vision was recorded orally or in writing  in the following set the visions were waking hallucinations of sane persons never in any other instance hallucinated  5  a  a person of distinction walking in a certain cambridge quadrangle met a very wellknown clergyman  the former held out his hand but there was before him only open space  no feeling of excitement or anxiety followed  6  a  the writer standing before dinner at a table in a large and brilliantly lit hall saw the door of the drawingroom open and a little girl related to himself come out and run across the hall into another room  he spoke to her but she did not answer  he instantly entered the drawingroom where the child was sitting in a white eveningdress  when she ran across the hall the moment before she was dressed in dark blue serge  no explanation of the puzzle could be discovered but it is fair to add that no anxiety was excited  7  a  a young lady had a cold and was wearing a brown shawl after lunch she went to her room  a few minutes later her sister came out saw her in the hall and went upstairs after her telling her an anecdote  at the top of the stairs the brownshawled sister vanished  the elder sister was in her room in a white shawl  she was visible when absent on another occasion to another spectator  in two other cases a ladies in their usual health saw their husbands in their rooms when in fact they were in the drawing room or study  here then are eight cases of noncoincidental hallucination some of people awake some of people probably on the verge of sleep which are wholly without coincidence wholly unveridical  none of the percipients was addicted to seeing visions about 199  on the other side though the writer knows several people who have seen ghosts in haunted houses and other odd phenomena he knows nobody at first hand who has seen a veridical hallucination or rather knows only one a very young one indeed  thus between these personally collected statistics of spectral sells on one part and the worldwide diffusion of belief in coincidental hallucination on the other the human mind is left in a balance which mathematics and the calculus of probabilities especially if one does not understand it fail to affect  meanwhile we still do not know what causes these solitary hallucinations of the sane  they can hardly come from diseased organs of sense for these would not confine themselves to a single mistaken message of great vivacity  and why should either the sensory centre or the central terminus just once in a lifetime develop this uncanny activity and represent to us a person to whom we may be wholly indifferent  the explanation is less difficult when the person represented is a husband or child but even then why does the activity occur once and only once and not in a moment of anxiety  the coincidental hallucinations are laid to the door of telepathy to a telepathic impact from the mind of an absent agent who is dying or in some other state of rare or exciting experience perhaps being married as in col meadows taylors case  this is a theory as old as lavaterus and was proclaimed by mayo in the middle of the century while substituting angels for human agents frazer of tiree used it in 1700 to explain second sight  nay it is the norse theory of a sending by a sorcerer as we read in the icelandic sagas  but admitting that telepathy may be a cause of hallucinations we often find the effect where the cause is not alleged to exist  nobody perhaps will explain our nine empty hallucinations by telepathy yet from the supposed effects of telepathy they were indistinguishable  are all such cases of casual hallucination in the sane to be explained by telepathy by an impact of force from a distant brain on the central terminus of our own brains  at all events a casual hallucination of the presence of an absent friend need obviously cause us very little anxiety  we need not adopt the hypothesis of the maoris  the telepathic theory has the advantage of cutting down the marvellous to the minimum  it also accounts for that old puzzle the clothes worn by the ghosts  these are reproduced by the agents theory of himself perhaps with some unconscious assistance from the percipient  for lack of this light on the matter m dassier a positivist who believed in spectres had to suggest that the ghosts wear the ghosts of garments  thus positivism in this disciple returned to the artless metaphysics of savages  telepathy saves the believer from such a humiliating relapse and perhaps telepathy also may be made to explain collective hallucinations when several people see the same apparition  if a distant mind can thus demoralise the central terminus of one brain it may do as much for two or more brains or they may demoralise each other  all this is very promising but telepathy breaks down when the apparition causes some change in the relations of material objects if there be a physical effect which endures after the phantasm has vanished then there was an actual agent a real being a ghost on the scene  for instance the lady in scotts ballad the eve of st john might see and might hear the ghost of her lover by a telepathic hallucination of two senses  but if  the sable score of fingers four remained on the board impressed  by the spectre then there was no telepathic hallucination but an actual being of an awful kind was in smailholm tower  again the cases in which dogs and horses as paracelsus avers display terror when men and women behold a phantasm are not easily accounted for by telepathy especially when the beast is alarmed before the man or woman suspects the presence of anything unusual  there is of course the notion that the horse shies or the dog turns craven in sympathy with its masters exhibition of fear  owners of dogs and horses may counterfeit horror and see whether their favourites do sympathise  cats dont  in one of three cases known to us where a cat showed consciousness of a spectral presence the apparition took the form of a cat  the evidence is only that of richard bovet in his pandemonium or the devils cloyster 1684  in mr j g woods man and beast a lady tells a story of being alone in firelight playing with a favourite cat lady catherine  suddenly puss bristled all over her back rose in an arch and the lady looking up saw a hideously malignant female watching her  lady catherine now rushed wildly round the room leaped at the upper panels of the door and seemed to have gone mad  this new terror recalled the lady to herself  she shrieked and the phantasm vanished  she saw it on a later day  in a third case a cat merely kept a watchful eye on the ghost and adopted a dignified attitude of calm expectancy  if beasts can be telepathically affected then beasts have more of a psychical element in their composition than they usually receive credit for whereas if a ghost is actually in view there is no reason why beasts should not see it  the best and most valid proof that an abnormal being is actually present was that devised by the ghost of sir richard of coldinghame in the ballad and by the beresford ghost who threw a heavy curtain over the bedpole  unluckily sir richard is a poetical figment and the beresford ghost is a myth like william tell  he may be traced back through various mediaeval authorities almost to the date of the norman conquest  we have examined the story in a little book of folklore etudes traditionistes  always there is a compact to appear always the ghost burns or injures the hand or wrist of the spectator  a version occurs in william of malmesbury  what we need to prove a ghost and disprove an exclusively telepathic theory is a ghost who is not only seen heard or even touched but a ghost who produces some change in physical objects most provokingly there are agencies at every successful seance and in every affair of the poltergeist who do lift tables chairs beds bookcases candles and so forth while others play accordions  but then nobody or not everybody sees these agencies at work while the spontaneous phantasms which are seen do not so much as lift a lootable generally speaking  in the spiritualistic cases we have the effect with no visible cause in ghost stories we have the visible presence but he very seldom indeed causes any physical change in any object  no ghost who does not do this has any strict legal claim to be regarded as other than a telepathic hallucination at best though as we shall see some presumptions exist in favour of some ghosts being real entities  these rare facts have not escaped a ghosthunter so intelligent as mrs henry sidgwick  this lady is almost too sportsmanlike for a psychical researcher in her habit of giving an apparition the benefit of every imaginable doubt which may absolve him from the charge of being a real genuine ghost  it is true she says that ghosts are alleged sometimes to produce a physical effect on the external world but to admit this is to come into prima facie collision with the physical sciences an awful risk to run so mrs sidgwick in a rather cavalier manner leaves ghosts who produce physical effects to be dealt with among the phenomena alleged to occur at seances  now this is hardly fair to the spontaneous apparition who is doing his very best to demonstrate his existence in the only convincing way  the phenomena of seances are looked on with deserved distrust and generally may be regarded as an outworn mode of swindling  yet it is to this society that mrs sidgwick relegates the most meritorious and conscientious class of apparitions  let us examine a few instances of the ghost who visibly moves material objects  we take one already cited from mrs sidgwicks own article 205  in this case a gentleman named john d harry scolded his daughters for saying that they had seen a ghost with which he himself was perfectly familiar  the figure a fair woman draped in white on seven or eight occasions appeared in my bedroom and twice in the library and on one occasion it lifted up the mosquitocurtains and looked closely into my face  now could a hallucination lift a mosquitocurtain or even produce the impression that it did so while the curtain was really unmoved clearly a hallucination however artful and well got up could do no such thing  therefore a beinga ghost with very little maidenly reservehaunted the bedroom of mr harry if he tells a true tale again p 115 a lady on whose veracity i am ready to pledge my all had doors opened for her frequently as if a hand had turned the handle  and once she not only saw the door open but a grey woman came in  another witness years afterwards beheld the same figure and the same performance  once more miss a ms mother followed a ghost who opened a door and entered a room where she could not be found when she was wanted p 121  again 206 a lady saw a ghost which with one hand the left drew back the curtain  there are many other cases in which apparitions are seen in houses where mysterious thumps and raps occur especially in general campbells experience p 483  if the apparition gave the thumps then he or in this instance she was material and could produce effects on matter  indeed this ghost was seen to take up and lay down some books and to tuck in the bedclothes hallucinations which are all in ones eye or sensory centre or cerebral central terminus cannot draw curtains or open doors or pick up books or tuck in bedclothes or cause thumpsnot real thumps hallucinatory thumps are different  consequently if the stories are true some apparitions are ghosts real objective entities filling space  the senses of a hallucinated person may be deceived as to touch and as to feeling the breath of a phantasm a likely story as well as in sight and hearing  but a visible ghost which produces changes in the visible world cannot be a hallucination  on the other hand dr binns in his anatomy of sleep tells us of a gentleman who in a dream pushed against a door in a distant house so that those in the room were scarcely able to resist the pressure 207a  now if this rather staggering anecdote be true the spirit of a living man being able to affect matter is also so to speak material and is an actual entity an astral body  moreover mrs frederica hauffe when in the magnetic sleep could rap at a distance  these arguments then make in favour of the oldfashioned theory of ghosts and wraiths as things objectively existing which is very comforting to a conservative philosopher  unluckily just as many or more anecdotes look quite the other way  for instance general barter sees hears and recognises the dead lieutenant b wearing a beard which he had grown since the general saw him in life  he also sees the hillpony ridden by mr b and killed by hima steed with which in its mortal days the general had no acquaintance  this is all very well  a dead pony may have a ghost like miss a bs dog which was heard by one miss b and seen by the other some time after its decease  on mature reflection as both ladies were well known persons of letters we suppress their names which would carry the weight of excellent character and distinguished sense  but lieutenant b was also accompanied by two grooms  now it is too much to ask us to believe that he had killed two grooms as he killed the pony 207b  consequently they at least were hallucinations so what was lieutenant b  when mr k on board the racoon saw his dead father lying in his coffin p 461 there was no real coffin there at all events and hence probably no real dead fathers ghostonly a telepathic hallucination  miss rose morton could never touch the female ghost which she often chased about the house nor did this ghost break or displace the threads stretched by miss morton across the stairs down which the apparition walked  yet its footsteps did make a noise and the family often heard the ghost walking downstairs followed by miss morton  thus this ghost was both material and immaterial for surely only matter can make a noise when in contact with matter on the whole if the evidence is worth anything there are real objective ghosts and there are also telepathic hallucinations  so that the scientific attitude is to believe in both if in either and this was the view of petrus thyraeus sj in his loca infesta 1598  the alternative is to believe in neither  we have thus according to the advice of socrates permitted the argument to lead us whither it would  and whither has it led us the old savage natural theory of ghosts and wraiths is that they are spirits yet not so immaterial but that they can fill space be seen heard touched and affect material objects  mediaeval and other theologians preferred to regard them as angelic or diabolic manifestations made out of compressed air or by aid of bodies of the dead or begotten by the action of angel or devil on the substance of the brain  modern science looks on them as hallucinations sometimes morbid as in madness or delirium or in a vicious condition of the organ of sense sometimes abnormal but not necessarily a proof of chronic disease of any description  the psychical theory then explains a sifted remnant of apparitions the coincidental veridical hallucinations of the sane by telepathy there is a wide chasm however to be bridged over between that hypothesis and its general acceptance either by science or by reflective yet unscientific inquirers  the existence of thought transference especially among people wide awake has to be demonstrated more unimpeachably and then either the telepathic explanation must be shown to fit all the cases collected or many interesting cases must be thrown overboard or these must be referred to some other cause  that cause will be something very like the oldfashioned ghosts  perhaps the most remarkable collective hallucination in history is that vouched for by patrick walker the covenanter in his biographia presbyteriana 209  in 1686 says walker about two miles below lanark on the water of clyde many people gathered together for several afternoons where there were showers of bonnets hats guns and swords which covered the trees and ground companies of men in arms marching in order upon the waterside companies meeting companies    and then all falling to the ground and disappearing and other companies immediately appearing in the same way  this occurred in june and july in the afternoons  now the westland whigs were then as usual in a very excitable frame of mind and filled with fears inspired both by events and by the prophecies of peden and other saints  patrick walker himself was a highflying covenanter he was present  i went there three afternoons togetherand he saw nothing unusual occur  about twothirds of the crowd did see the phenomena he reckons the others like himself saw nothing strange there was a fright and trembling upon them that did see and at least in one case the hallucination was contagious  a gentleman standing next walker exclaimed  a pack of damned witches and warlocks that have the second sight the deil hat do i see  and immediately there was a discernable change in his countenance with as much fear and trembling as any woman i saw there who cried out o all ye that do not see say nothing for i perswade you it is matter of fact and discernable to all that is not stoneblind those who did see minutely described what handles the swords had whether small or threebarred or highland guards and the closing knots of the bonnets black or blue     i have been at a loss ever since what to make of this last says patrick walker and who is not at a loss  the contagion of the hallucination so to speak did not affect him fanatic as he was and did affect a cursing and swearing cavalier whose prejudices whose dominant idea were all on the other side  the psychical society has published an account of a similar collective hallucination of crowds of people appearing and disappearing shared by two young ladies and their maid on a walk home from church  but this occurred in a fog and no one was present who was not hallucinated  patrick walkers account is triumphantly honest and is perhaps as odd a piece of psychology as any on record thanks to his escape from the prevalent illusion which no doubt he would gladly have shared  wodrow it should be said in his history of the sufferings of the kirk mentions visions of bonnets which he thinks indicated a future muster of militia  but he gives the date as 1684      scrying or crystalgazing   revival of crystalgazing  antiquity of the practice  its general harmlessness

antiquity and diffusion of practice  based on actual experience  anecdotes of dr gregory  children as visionaries  not to be encouraged  the practice of scrying peeping or crystalgazing has been revived in recent years and is perhaps the only occult diversion which may be free from psychological or physical risk and which it is easy not to mix with superstition  the antiquity and worldwide diffusion of scrying in one form or other interests the student of human nature  meanwhile the comparatively few persons who can see pictures in a clear depth may be as innocently employed while so doing as if they were watching the clouds or the embers may be one must say for crystalseers are very apt to fall back on our old friend the animistic hypothesis and to explain what they see or fancy they see by the theory that spirits are at the bottom of it all  in mrs de morgans work from matter to spirit suggestions of this kind are not absent  as an explanation of crystalseeing a spiritual drawing was once made representing a spirit directing on the crystal a stream of influence and so forth  mrs de morgan herself seemed rather to hold that the act of staring at a crystal mesmerises the observer  the person who looks at it often becomes sleepy  sometimes the eyes close at other times tears flow  people who become sleepy or cry or get hypnotised will probably consult their own health and comfort by leaving crystal balls alone  there are others however who are no more hypnotised by crystal gazing than teadrinking or gardening or reading a book and who can still enjoy visions as beautiful as those of the opium eater without any of the reaction  their condition remains perfectly normal that is they are wide awake to all that is going on  in some way their fancy is enlivened and they can behold in the glass just such vivid pictures as many persons habitually see between sleeping and waking illusions hypnagogiques  these hypnagogic illusions pontus de tyard described in a pretty sonnet more than three hundred years ago  maury in his book on dreams has recorded and analysed them  they represent faces places a page of print a flame of fire and so forth and it is one of their peculiarities that the faces rapidly shift and alter generally from beautiful to ugly  a crystalseer seems to be a person who can see in a glass while awake and with open eyes visions akin to those which perhaps the majority of people see with shut eyes between sleeping and waking 214  it seems probable that people who when they think see a mental picture of the subject of their thoughts people who are good visualisers are likely to succeed best with the crystal some of them can visualise purposely in the crystal while others cannot  many who are very bad visualisers like the writer who think in words not in pictures see bright and distinct hypnagogic illusions yet see nothing in the crystal however long they stare at it  and there are crystalseers who are not subject to hypnagogic illusions  these facts like the analogous facts of the visualisation of arithmetical figures analysed by mr galton show interesting varieties in the conduct of mental operations thus we speak of vision in a poet or novelist and it seems likely that men of genius see their fictitious characters and landscapes while people of critical temperament if they attempt creative work are conscious that they do not create but construct on the other hand many incompetent novelists are convinced that they have vision that they see and hear their characters but they do not as genius does transfer the vision to their readers  this is a digression from the topic of hallucinations caused by gazing into a clear depth  forms of crystalgazing it is well known are found among savages  the new zealanders according to taylor gaze in a drop of blood as the egyptians do in a drop of ink  in north america the pere le jeune found that a kind of thought reading was practised thus  it was believed that a sick person had certain desires if these could be gratified he would recover  the sorcerers therefore gazed into water in a bowl expecting to see there visions of the desired objects  the egyptian process with the boy and the ink is too familiar to need description  in scotts journal ii 419 we read of the excitement which the reports of lord prudhoe 215 and colonel felix caused among the curious  a boy selected by these english gentlemen saw and described shakspeare and colonel felixs brother who had lost an arm  the ceremonies of fumigation and the preliminary visions of flags and a sultan are not necessary in modern crystalgazing scott made inquiries at malta and wished to visit alexandria  he was attracted doubtless by the resemblance to dr dees tales of his magic ball and to the legends of his own aunt margarets mirror  the quarterly review no 117 pp 196208 offers an explanation which explains nothing  the experiments of mr lane were tolerably successful those of mr kinglake in eothen were amusingly the reverse  dr keate the flogging headmaster of eton was described by the seer as a beautiful girl with golden hair and blue eyes  the modern explanation of successes would apparently be that the boy does occasionally see the reflection of his interrogators thoughts  in a paper in the proceedings of the society for psychical research part xiv an anonymous writer gives the results of some historical investigation into the antiquities of crystalgazing the stories of cups wherein my lord divines like joseph need not necessarily indicate gazing into the deeps of the cup  there were other modes of using cups and drops of wine not connected with visions  at patrae in greece pausanias describes the dropping of a mirror on to the surface of a well the burning of incense and the vision of the patient who consults the oracle in the deeps of the mirror 216a  a christian father asserts that in some cases a basin with a glass bottom was used through which the gazer saw persons concealed in a room below and took them for real visions 216b  in mirrormagic catoptromancy the child seers eyes were bandaged and he saw with the top of his head  the specularii continued the tradition through the middle ages and in the sixteenth century dr dee ruined himself by his infatuation for showstones in which kelly saw or pretended to see visions which dr dee interpreted  dee kept voluminous diaries of his experiments part of which is published in a folio by meric casaubon  the work is flighty indeed crazy dee thought that the hallucinations were spirits and believed that his showstones were occasionally spirited away by the demons  kelly pretended to hear noises in the stones and to receive messages  in our own time while many can see pictures few know what the pictures represent  some explain them by interpreting the accompanying raps or by automatic writing  the intelligence thus conveyed is then found to exist in county histories newspapers and elsewhere a circumstance which lends itself to interpretation of more sorts than one  without these very dubious modes of getting at the meaning of the crystal pictures they remain of course mere picturesque hallucinations  the author of the paper referred to is herself a crystalseer and in borderland no 2 mentions one very interesting vision  she and a friend stared into one of dr dees showstones at the stuart exhibition and both beheld the same scene not a scene they could have guessed at which was going on at the seers own house  as this writer though versed in hallucinations entirely rejects any spiritual theory and conceives that she is dealing with purely psychological curiosities her evidence is the better worth notice and may be compared with that of a crystalseer for whose evidence the present writer can vouch as far as one mortal may vouch for that of another  miss x the writer in the psychical proceedings has been able to see pictures in crystals and other polished surfaces or indeed independently of these since childhood  she thinks that the visions are  1  afterimages or recrudescent memories often memories of things not consciously noted  2  objectivations of ideas or images consciously or unconsciously present to the mind  3  visions possibly telepathic or clairvoyant implying acquirement of knowledge by supernormal means  the first class is much the most frequent in this ladys experience  she can occasionally refresh her memory by looking into the crystal  the other seer known to the writer cannot do this and her pictures as far as she knows are purely fanciful  perhaps an automatic writer might interpret them in the rather dubious manner of that art  as far as the scryer knows however her pictures of places and people are not revivals of memory  for example she sees an ancient ship with a birds beak for prow come into harbour and behind it a man carrying a crown  this is a mere fancy picture  on one occasion she saw a man like an oriental priest with a white caftan contemplating the rise and fall of a fountain of fire  suddenly at the summit of the fire appeared a human hand pointing downwards to which the old priest looked up this was in august 1893  later in the month the author happened to take up at loch sheil lady burtons life of sir richard burton on the back of the cover is a singular design in gold  a woman in widows weeds is bowing beneath rays of light over which appears a human hand marked r f b on the wrist  the author at once wrote asking his friend the crystalgazer if she had seen this work of art which might have unconsciously suggested the picture  the lady however was certain that she had not seen the life of sir richard burton though her eye of course may have fallen on it in a booksellers shop while her mind did not consciously take it in if this was a revival of a subconscious memory in the crystal it was the only case of that process in her experience  on the other hand miss x can trace many of her visions to memories as maury could in his illusions hypnagogiques  thus miss x saw in the crystal the printed announcement of a friends death  she had not consciously read the times but remembered that she had held it up before her face as a firescreen  this kind of revival as she says corresponds to the writing with planchette of scraps from the chanson de roland by a person who had never consciously read a line of it and who did not even know what stratum of old french was represented by the fragments  miss x seems not to know either for she calls it provencal  similar instances of memory revived are not very uncommon in dreams  miss x can consciously put a group of fanciful characters into the crystal while this is beyond the power of the seer known to the writer who has attempted to perceive what a friend is doing at a distance but with no success thus she tried to discover what the writer might be about and secured a view of two large sunny rooms with a shadowy figure therein  now it is very probable that the writer was in just such a room at  castle but the seer saw on the library table a singular mirror which did not exist there and a model of a castle also nonexistent  the knowledge that the person sought for was staying at a castle may have unconsciously suggested this model in the picture  a pretty case of revived memory is given by miss x  she wanted the date of ptolemy philadelphus  later in the crystal she saw a conventional old jew writing in a book with massive clasps  using a magnifying glass she found that he was writing greek but the lines faded and she only saw the roman numerals lxx  these suggested the seventy hebrews who wrote the septuagint with the date 277 bc which served for ptolemy philadelphus  miss x later remembered a memoria technica which she had once learned with the clue now jewish elders indite a greek copy  it is obvious that these queer symbolical reawakenings of memory explain much of the apparently unknown information given by ghosts and in dreams  a lady who had long been in very bad health was one evening seized by a violent recrudescence of memory and for hours poured out the minutest details of the most trivial occurrences the attack was followed by a cerebral malady from which she fortunately recovered  the same phenomenon of awakened memory has occasionally been reported by people who were with difficulty restored after being seveneighths drowned  the crystal ball in the proper hands merely illustrates the possibility of artificially reviving memory while the fanciful visions akin to illusions hypnagogiques have in all ages been interpreted by superstition as revelations of the distant or the future  of course if there is such a thing as occasional transference of thought so that the idea in the inquirers mind is reflected in the crystalgazers vision the hypothesis of the superstitious will fix on this as a miracle still more will that hypothesis be strengthened if future or distant events not consciously known are beheld  such things must occasionally occur by chance in the myriad confusions of dreams and to the same extent in crystal visions  miss xs three cases of possible telepathy in her own experience are trivial and do not seem to rise beyond the possibility of fortuitous coincidence  and her possible clairvoyant visions she leaves to the judgment of the reader to interpret as clairvoyance or coincidence or prevision or whatever else he will  the crystalgazer known to the author once managed to see the person unknown to her who was in the mind of the other party in the experiment  but she has made scarcely any experiments of this description  the inferences to be drawn from crystalgazing are not unimportant first we note that the practice is very ancient and widely diffused among civilised and uncivilised people  in this diffusion it answers to the other practices the magical rites of australian blacks greeks eskimo to the stories of deathbed wraiths of rappings and so forth  now this uniformity as far as regards the latter phenomena may be explained by transmission of ideas or by the uniformity of human nature while the phenomena themselves may be mere inventions like other myths  in the case of crystalgazing however we can scarcely push scepticism so far as to deny that the facts exist that hallucinations are actually provoked  the inference is that a presumption is raised in favour of the actuality of the other phenomena universally reported  they too may conceivably be hallucinatory the rappings and haunting noises may be auditory as the crystal visions are ocular hallucinations  the sounds so widely attested may not cause vibrations in the air just as the visions are not really in the crystal ball  as the unconscious self suggests the pictures in the ball so it may suggest the unexplained noises  but while as a rule only one gazer sees the visions the sounds usually but not invariably are heard by all present  on the whole the one case wherein we find facts if only facts of hallucination at the bottom of the belief in a worldwide and worldold practice rather tends in the direction of belief in the other facts not less universally alleged  we know too much about mythology to agree with dr johnson in holding that a belief which prevails as far as human nature is diffused could become universal only by its truth that those who never heard of one another would not have agreed in a tale which nothing but experience could make credible  but on the other hand a belief is not necessarily untrue because it is universally diffused  in the second place crystalgazing shows how a substratum of fact may be so overlaid with mystic mummeries incantations fumigations pentacles  and so overwhelmed in superstitious interpretations introducing fairies and spirits that the facts run the risk of being swept away in the litter and dust of nonsense  science has hardly thought crystalgazing worthy even of contempt yet it appears to deserve the notice of psychologists  to persons who can scry and who do not see hideous illusions or become hypnotised or superstitious or incur headaches scrying is a harmless gateway into les paradis artificiels  and the rest they may live and learn 223  a very few experiments will show people whether they are scryers or not  the phenomena it seems are usually preceded by a mistiness or milkiness of the glass  this clears off and pictures appear even the best scryers often fail to see anything in the crystal which maintains its natural diaphaneity as dr dee says  thus the conditions under which the scryer can scry are as yet unascertained  the phenomena of scrying were not unknown to dr gregory professor of chemistry in the university of edinburgh  dr gregory believed in odylic fluid on the evidence of reichenbachs experiments which nobody seems to have repeated successfully under strict tests clairvoyance also was part of dr gregorys faith and to be fair phenomena were exhibited at his house in the presence of a learned and distinguished witness known to the writer which could only be accounted for either by thought transference or by an almost or quite incredible combination of astuteness and imposture on the side of dr gregory himself  in presence of the clairvoyants the nobleman of whom we speak thought not of his own house but of a room in the house of a friend  it possessed a very singular feature which it is needless to describe here but which was entirely out of the experience of the clairvoyante  she described it however expressing astonishment at what she saw  this unless dr gregory guessed what was likely to be thought of and was guilty of collusion can only be explained by thought transference  in other cases the doctor was convinced that he had evidence of actual clairvoyance and it is difficult to estimate the amount of evidence which will clear such a belief of the charge of credulity  as to scrying the doctor thought it could be done in mesmerised water water bewitched  there is no reason to imagine that mesmerised is different from ordinary water 224  he knew that folklore retained the belief in scrying in crystal balls and added some superfluous magical incantations  the doctor himself was lucky enough to buy an old magical crystal in which some boys after long staring saw persons unknown to themselves but known to the professor and also persons known to neither  a little girl casually picking up a crystal ball cried theres a ship in it with its cloth all in rags  now it tumbles down and a woman is working at it and holds her head in her hand  this is a very fair example of a crystal fancy picture  the childs mother not having heard what the child said saw the same vision p 165  but this is a story at third hand  the doctor has a number of cases and held that crystal possesses an odylic quality  but a ball of glass serves just as well as a ball of crystal and is much less expensive  children are naturally visionaries and as such are good subjects for experiment  but it may be a cruel and is a most injudicious thing to set children ascrying  superstition may be excited or the halfconscious tendency to deceive may be put in motion  socrates and joan of arc were visionaries as children  had joans ears been soundly boxed as robert de baudricourt advised france might now be an english province  but they were not boxed happily for mankind  certainly much that is curious may be learned by any one who having the confidence of a child will listen to his or her accounts of spontaneous visions  the writer as a boy knew a child who used to lie prone on the grass watching fairies at play in the miniature forest of blades and leaves  this child had a favourite familiar whom he described freely but as his remarks were received with goodhumoured scepticism no harm came to him  he would have made a splendid scryer still i speak of him but brotherly his revelations would have been taken with the largest allowances  if scrying on examination proves to be of real psychological interest science will owe another debt to folklore to the folk who kept alive a practice which commonsense would not deign even to examine      the second sight   the gillie and the fireraising  survival of belief in second sight

conclusion  some years ago the author was fishing in a river of inverness shire  he drove to the stream picked up an old gillie named campbell and then went on towards the spot where he meant to begin angling  a sheep that lay on the road jumped up suddenly almost under the horses feet the horse shied and knocked the dogcart against a wall  on the homeward way we observed a house burning opposite the place where the horse shied and found that a farmer had been evicted and his cottage set on fire  this unhappy person it seems was in debt to all his tradesmen not to his landlord only  the fireraising however was an excessively barbaric method of getting him to leave the parish and the view justified the indignation of the gillie  the old gillie much excited declared that the horse had foreseen this event in the morning and had consequently shied  in a more sceptical spirit the author reminded campbell of the sheep which started up  that sheep was the devil campbell explained nor could this rational belief of his be shaken the affair led to a conversation on the second sight and campbell said he had it not but his sister or sisterinlaw had it  campbell was a very agreeable companion interested in old events and a sympathiser as he said in spite of his name with the great montrose  his remarks led the author to infer that contrary to what some inquirers wrote in the last and graham dalyell in the present century the belief in the second sight is still quite common in the highlands  as will be shown later this inference was correct  we must not from this survival only draw the conclusion that the highlanders are more superstitious than many educated people south of the highland line  second sight is only a scotch name which covers many cases called telepathy and clairvoyance by psychical students and casual or morbid hallucinations by other people  in second sight the percipient beholds events occurring at a distance sees people whom he never saw with the bodily eye and who afterwards arrive in his neighbourhood or foresees events approaching but still remote in time  the chief peculiarity of second sight is that the visions often though not always are of a symbolical character  a shroud is observed around the living man who is doomed boding animals mostly black dogs vex the seer funerals are witnessed before they occur and corpsecandles some sort of light are watched flitting above the road whereby a burial procession is to take its way 228  though we most frequently hear the term second sight applied as a phrase of scotch superstition the belief in this kind of ominous illusion is obviously universal theoclymenus in the odyssey a prophet by descent and of the same clan as the soothsayer melampus beholds the bodies and faces of the doomed wooers shrouded in night  the pythia at delphi announced a similar symbolic vision of blooddripping walls to the athenians during the persian war  again symbolic visions especially of blooddripping walls are so common in the icelandic sagas that the reader need only be referred to the prodigies before the burning of njal in the saga of burnt njal  second sight was as popular a belief among the vikings as among the highlanders who retain a large share of their blood  it may be argued by students who believe in the borrowing rather than in the independent evolution of ideas that the gaelic second sight is a direct inheritance from the northmen who have left so many scandinavian local names in the isles and along the coasts  however this may be the highland second sight is different in many points from the clairvoyance and magic of the lapps those famous sorcerers  on this matter the history of lapland by scheffer professor of law in upsala is generally cited oxford 1674 when the devil takes a liking to any person in his infancy says scheffer he presently seizes on him by a disease in which he haunts him with several apparitions  this answers in magical education to smalls or little go  some lapps advance to a kind of mystic moderations and the great sorcerers attain to final schools and are bachelors in black arts they become so knowing that without the drum they can see things at the greatest distances and are so possessed by the devil that they see things even against their will  the drum is a piece of hollow wood covered with a skin on which rude pictures are drawn an index is laid on the skin the drum is tapped and omens are taken from the picture on which the index happens to rest  but this practice has nothing to do with clairvoyance  in scheffers account of lapp seers we recognise the usual hysterical or epileptic lads who in various societies become saints mediums warlocks or conjurers  but scheffer shows that the lapp experts try voluntarily to see sights whereas except when wrapped in a bulls hide of old or cowering in a boiler at the present day the highland secondsighted man lets his visions come to him spontaneously and uninvoked  scheffer wished to take a magical drum from a lapp who confessed with tears that drum or no drum he would still see visions as he proved by giving scheffer a minute relation of whatever particulars had happened to me in my journey to lapland  and he further complained that he knew not how to make use of his eyes since things altogether distant were presented to them  when a wizard is consulted he dances round till he falls lies on the ground as if dead and finally rises and declares the result of his clairvoyance  his body is guarded by his friends and no living thing is allowed to touch it  tornaeus was told many details of his journey by a lapp which although it was true tornaeus dissembled to him lest he might glory too much in his devilish practices  olaus magnus gives a similar account  the whole performance except that the seer is not bound resembles the eskimo sleep of the shadow more than ordinary highland second sight  the soul of the seer is understood to be wandering away released from his body  the belief in clairvoyance in the power of seeing what is distant and foreseeing what is in the future obviously and undeniably occurs everywhere in ancient israel as in mexico before the spanish conquest and among the red indian tribes as among the zulus  it is more probable that similar hallucinatory experiences morbid or feigned or natural have produced the same beliefs everywhere than that the beliefs were evolved only by aryans greeks or scandinaviansand by them diffused all over the world to zulus lapps indians of guiana maoris  one of the earliest references to scotch second sight is quoted by graham dalyell from higdens polychronicon i lxiv 231a there oft by daye tyme men of that islonde seen men that bey dede to fore honde byheded like argyll in 1661 or hole and what dethe they deyde  alyens setten theyr feet upon feet of the men of that londe for to see such syghtes as the men of that londe doon this method of communicating the hallucination by touch is described in the later books such as kirks secret commonwealth 1691 and mr napier in his folklore mentions the practice as surviving in the present century  from some records of the orkneys mr dalyell produces a trial for witchcraft on oct 2 1616 231b  this case included second sight  the husband of jonka dyneis being in a fishingboat at walls six miles from her residence at aith and in peril she was fund and sein standing at hir awin hous wall in ane trans that same hour he was in danger and being trappit she could not give answer bot stude as bereft of hir senssis  and quhen she was speirit at quhy she wes so movit she answerit gif our boit be not tynt she is in great hazardand wes tryit so to be  elspeth reoch in 1616 was tried as a witch for a simple piece of clairvoyance or of charlatanism as we may choose to believe  the offence is styled secund sicht in the official report  again issobell sinclair in 1633 was accused almost in modern spiritualistic phrase of bein controlled with the phairie and that be thame shoe hath the second sight 232a  here then we find it officially recorded that the secondsighted person is entranced and more or less unconscious of the outer world at the moment of the vision  something like le petit mal in epilepsy seems to be intended the patient stude as bereft of hir senssis 232b  again we have the official explanation of the second sight and that is the spiritualistic explanation  the seer has a fairy control  this mode of accounting for what gentle king jamie calls a sooth dreame since they see it walking inspires the whole theory of kirk 1691 but he sees no harm either in the phairie or in the persons whom the fairies control  in kirks own time we shall find another minister frazer of tiree explaining the visions as revived impressions of sense 1705 and rejecting various superstitious hypotheses  the detestable cruelty of the ministers who urged magistrates to burn secondsighted people and the discomfort and horror of the hallucinations themselves combined to make patients try to free themselves from the involuntary experience  as a correspondent of aubreys says towards the end of the sixteenth century  it is a thing very troublesome to them that have it and would gladly be rid of it    they are seen to sweat and tremble and shreek at the apparition 232c  they are troubled for having it judging it a sin and they used to apply to the presbytery for public prayers and sermons  others protested that it was a harmless accident tried to teach it and endeavoured to communicate the visions by touch  as usual among the presbyterians a minister might have abnormal accomplishments work miracles of healing see and converse with the devil shine in a refulgence of odic light or be secondsighted but if a layman encroached on these privileges he was in danger of the tarbarrel and was prosecuted  on the day of the battle of bothwell brig mr cameron minister of lochend in remote kintyre had a clairvoyant view of the fight  i see them the whigs flying as clearly as i see the wall and as near as could be calculated the covenanters ran at that very moment 233a  how mr cameron came to be thought a saint while jonka dyneis was burned as a sinner for precisely similar experiences is a question hard to answer  but joan of arc the saviour of france was burned for hearing voices while st joseph of cupertino in spite of his flights in the air was canonised  minister or medium saint or sorcerer it was all a question of the point of view  as to camerons and jonkas visions of distant contemporary events they correspond to what is told of apollonius of tyana that at ephesus he saw and applauded the murder of domitian at rome that one cornelius in padua saw caesar triumph at pharsalia that a maniac in gascony beheld coligny murdered in paris 233b  in the whole belief there is nothing peculiarly scotch or celtic and wodrow gives examples among the dutch  second sight in the days of james vi had been a burning matter after the restoration a habit of jesting at everything of the kind came in on one hand on the other a desire to investigate and probe the stories of scotch clairvoyance  many fellows of the royal society and learned men like robert boyle henry more glanvill pepys aubrey and others wrote eagerly to correspondents in the highlands while sacheverell and waldron discussed the topic as regarded the isle of man  then came special writers on the theme as aubrey kirk frazer martin de foe who compiled a catchpenny treatise on duncan campbell a highland fortuneteller in london theophilus insulanus who was urged to his task by sir richard steele wodrow a great ghosthunter  and so we reach dr johnson who was willing to be convinced but was not under conviction  in answer to queries circulated for aubrey he learned that the godly have not the faculty but the virtuous may have it  but wodrows saint who saw bothwell brig and another very savoury christian who saw dundee slain at killiecrankie may surely be counted among the godly  there was difference of opinion as to the hereditary character of the complaint  a correspondent of aubreys vouches for a secondsighted man who babbled too much about the phairie and was suddenly removed to the farther end of the house and was there almost strangled 234  this implies that spirits or phairies lifted him as they did to a seer spoken of by kirk and do to the tribal medicinemen of the australians and of course to mediums  contemporary with aubrey was the rev robert kirk of aberfoyle a celtic scholar who translated the bible into gaelic  in 1691 he finished his secret commonwealth of elves faunes and fairies whereof only a fragment has reached us  it has been maintained that the book was printed in 1691 but no mortal eye has seen a copy  in 1815 sir walter scott printed a hundred copies from a manuscript in the advocates library in edinburgh  he did not put his name on the book but charles kirkpatrick sharpe in a note on his own copy affirms that sir walter was the editor 235  another edition was edited for mr nutt by the present writer in 1893  in the year following the completion of his book mr kirk died or as local tradition avers was carried away to fairyland  mr kirk has none of the presbyterian abhorrence of fairies and fauns though like the accusers of the orkney witches he believes that phairie control inspires the secondsighted men who see them eat at funerals  the seers were wont to observe doubles of living people and these doubles are explained as cowalkers from the fairy world  this cowalker wes also often seen of old to enter a hous by which the people knew that the person of that liknes wes to visite them within a few days  now this belief is probably founded on actual hallucinatory experience of which we may give a modern example  in the early spring of 1890 a lady known to the author saw the copy echo or living picture of a stranger who intended unknown to her to visit her house but who did not carry out his intention  the author can vouch for her perfect integrity and freedom both from superstition and from illusions except in this case  miss h lives in edinburgh and takes in young men as boarders  at the time of this event she had four such inmates  two as she believed were in their study on the second floor two were in the drawing room on the first floor where she herself was sitting  the hour was seven oclock in the evening and the lamp on the stair was lit miss h left the drawingroom and went into a cupboard on the landing immediately above the lamp  she saw a young gentleman of fair complexion in a suit of dark blue coming down the staircase from the second floor  supposing him to be a friend of her boarders whose study was on that floor she came out of the cupboard closed the door to let him pass and made him a slight bow  she did not hear him go out nor did the maid who was standing near the street door  she did not see her two friends of the upstairs study till nine oclock  they had been at a lecture  when they met she said did you take your friend with you  what friend  the fair young man who left your rooms at seven  we were out before seven we dont know whom you mean  the mystery of the young man who could not have entered the house without ringing was unsolved  next day a lady living exactly opposite miss hs house asked that lady if she could give hospitality to a young man who was coming to edinburgh from the country  miss h assented and prepared a room but the visitor she was informed went to stay with a relation of his own  two days later miss h was looking out of her diningroom window after luncheon  why theres my ghost she exclaimed and her friends running to the window allowed that he answered to the description  the ghost went into the house of miss hs friend on the other side of the street and miss h with natural curiosity sallied out and asked who he was  he was the young man for whom she had prepared a room  during his absence in the country his cowalker had visited the house at which he intended to stay  coincidences of this kind then gave rise to the belief in this branch of second sight  though fairies are the phantasmogenetic agencies in second sight a man may acquire the art by magic  a hair rope which has bound a corpse to a bier is wound about him and then he looks backward through his legs till he sees a funeral  the vision of a seer can be communicated to any one who puts his left foot under the wizards right foot  this is still practised in some parts of the highlands as we shall see but near inverness the custom only survives in the memory of some old people 237  mr kirks wizards defended the lawfulness of their clairvoyance by the example of elisha seeing gehazi at a distance 238  the second sight was hereditary in some families this is no longer thought to be the case  kirk gives some examples of clairvoyance and prescience  he then quotes and criticises lord tarbatts letters to robert boyle  second sight is a trouble to most of them and they would be rid of it at any rate if they could  one of our own informants says that the modern seers are anxious when they feel the vision beginning  they do not however regard the power as unholy or disreputable  another informant mentions a belief that children born between midnight and one oclock will be secondsighted  people attempt to hasten or delay the birth so as to avoid the witching hour clearly then they regard the second sight as an unenviable accomplishment  it is certane says kirk he sie more fatall and fearfull things than he do gladsome  for the physical condition of the seer kirk describes it as a rapture transport and sort of death  our contemporary informants deny that in their experience any kind of convulsion or fit accompanies the visions as in scotts account of allan macaulay in the legend of montrose  strangely unlike mr kirk in style and mode of thought is his contemporary the rev mr frazer of tiree and coll dean of the isles  we cannot call a clergyman superstitious because 200 years ago he believed in good and bad angels  save for this element in his creed mr frazer may be called strictly and unexpectedly scientific  he was born in mull in 1647 being the son of the rev farquhard frazer a cadet of the house of lovat  the father was one of the first masters of arts who ever held the living of coll and tiree  in his time only three landed gentlemen of the mcleans could read and write  the son john was educated at glasgow university and succeeded to his fathers charge converting the lairds and others to the true protestant faith 1680  at the revolution or later being an episcopalian and jacobite he was deprived of his stipend but was not superseded and continued the exercise of his ministry till his death in 1702  being in edinburgh in 1700 he met andrew symson a relation of his wife  they fell into discourse on the second sight and he sent his little manuscript to symson who published it in 1707  there is an edinburgh reprint by webster in 1820  the work is dedicated to lord cromartie the lord tarbatt of kirks book and the correspondent of pepys  symson adds a preface apologising for mr frazers lack of books and learned society and giving an example of transference of second sight  the seer placed his foot on that of the person interested who then saw a ship labouring in a storm  the tale was not at first hand  mr frazer in his tractate first deals with the question of fact of the hallucinations called second sight  that such representations are made to the eyes of men and women is to me out of all doubt and that affects follow answerable thereto as little questionable  but many doubt as to the question of fact wherefore so little has been written about it  four or five instances he thinks will suffice 1  a servant of his left a barn where he slept because nightly he had seen a dead corps in his winding sheet straighted beside him  in about half a year a young man died and was buried in the barn 2  mr frazer went to stay in mull with sir william sacheverell who wrote on second sight in the isle of man and was then engaged in trying to recover treasures from the vessel of the armada sunk in tobermory bay  the duke of argyll has a cannon taken from francis i at pavia which was raised from this vessel and lately the fluke of a ships anchor brought up a doubloon  but the treasure still lies in tobermory bay  mr frazers tale merely is that a woman told a sailor to bid him leave a certain boy behind  the sailor did not give the message the boy died and the woman said that she had seen the lad walking with me in his winding sheets sewed up from top to toe that this portent never deceived her 3  a funeral was seen by duncan campbell in kintyre he soon found himself at the real funeral  4  john macdonald saw a seacaptain all wet who was drowned about a year thereafter  the seer was none of the strictest life 5  a man in eigg foretold an invasion and calamities  the vision was fulfilled by a landing of english forces in 1689 when mr frazer himself was a prisoner of captain pottingers in eigg he next mentions an old woman who in a syncope or catalepsy believed she had been in heaven  she had a charm of barbarous words whereby she could see the answers to questions in live images before her eyes or upon the wall but the images were not tractable tangible which she found by putting to her hand but could find nothing  in place of burning this poor crone mr frazer reasoned with her taught her the danger and vanity of her practice and saw her die peacefully in extreme old age  seeking for an explanation mr frazer gives a thoroughly modern doctrine of visual and auditory hallucinations as revived impressions of sense  the impressions laid up in the brain will be reversed back to the retiform coat and crystalline humour hence a lively seeing as if de novo the object had been placed before the eye  he illustrates this by experiments in afterimages  he will not deny however that angels good or bad may intentionally cause the revival of impressions and so for their own purposes produce the hallucinations from within  the coincidence of the hallucination with future events may arise from the foreknowledge of the said angels who if evil are deceptive like ahabs false prophets  the angel then who through one channel or another foreknows or anticipates an event has no more to do than to reverse the species of these things from a mans brain to the organ of the eye  substitute telepathy the effect produced by a distant mind for angels and we have here the very theory of some modern inquirers  mr frazer thinks it unlikely that bad angels delude several men that i have known to be of considerable sense and pious and good conversation  he will not hear of angels making bodies of compressed air an old mystic idea which they place before mens eyes  his own hypothesis is more economical of marvel he has not observed second sight to be hereditary  if asked why it is confined to ignorant islanders he denies the fact  it is as common elsewhere but is concealed for fear of ridicule and odium he admits that credulity and ignorance give opportunities to evil spirits to juggle more frequently than otherwise they would have done  so he humbly submits himself to the judgment of his betters  setting aside the hypothesis of angels mr frazer makes only one mistake he does not give instantiae contradictoriae where the hallucination existed without the fulfilment  he shows a good deal of reading and a liking for sir thomas browne  the difference between him and his contemporary mr kirk is as great as that between herodotus and thucydides  contemporary with frazer is martin martin whose description of the western isles 1703 second edition 1716 was a favourite book of dr johnsons and the cause of his voyage to the hebrides  martin took his ma degree at edinburgh university in 1681  he was a curious observer political and social and an antiquarian  he offers no theory of the second sight and merely recounts the current beliefs in the islands  the habit is not in his opinion hereditary nor does he think that the vision can be communicated by touch except by one to another seer  where several seers are present all do not necessarily see the vision  at the sight of a vision the eyelids of the person are erected and the eyes continue staring until the object vanish as martin knew by observing seers at the moment of the experience  sometimes it was necessary to draw down the eyelids with the fingers  sickness and swooning occasionally accompanied the hallucination  the visions were usually symbolical shrouds coffins funerals  visitors were seen before their arrival  i have been seen thus myself by seers of both sexes at some 100 miles distance some that saw me in this manner had never seen me personally and it happened according to their visions without any previous design of mine to go to those places my coming there being purely accidental  children are subject to the vision the horse of a seer or the cow a second sighted woman is milking receives the infection at the moment of a vision sweats and trembles  horses are very nervous animals cows not so much so  as to objections the people are very temperate and madness is unknown hence they are not usually visionary  that the learned are not able to oblige the world with a satisfying account of those visions is no argument against the fact of their occurrence  the seers are not malevolent impostors and there are cases of second sighted folk of birth and education nor can a reasonable man believe that children horses and cows could be preengaged in a combination to persuade the world of the reality of the second sight  the gift is not confined to the western islands and martin gives a dutch example with others from the isle of man  his instances are of the usual sort the fulfilment was sometimes long deferred  he mentions a case but not that given by mr frazer in the isle of eigg  the natives had been at killiecrankie and one of them murdered an english soldier in skye hence the english invasion of 1689 in which a pretty girl as had been prophesied by a seer was brutally illtreated  the most interesting cases are those in which strangers are seen and peculiarities in their dress observed before their arrival  in the pirate scott shows how norna of the fitful head managed to utter such predictions by aid of early information and so as cleveland said prophesied on velvet there are a few cases of a brownie being seen once by a second sighted butler who observed brownie directing a mans game at chess  martins book was certainly not calculated to convince dr johnson his personal evidence only proves that a kind of hallucinatory trance existed or was feigned  later than martin we have the long work of theophilus insulanus which contains many cases of more or less interest or absurdity but theophilus is of no service to the framer of philosophical or physiological theories of the second sight  the presbyterian clergy generally made war on the belief but one of them as mrs grant reports in her essays 244 had an experience of his own  this good old pastors daidling bit or lounge was his churchyard  in an october twilight he saw two small lights rise from a spot unmarked by any stone or memorial  these corpsecandles crossed the river stopped at a hamlet and returned attended by a larger light  all three sank into the earth on the spot whence the two lights had risen  the minister threw a few stones on the spot and next day asked the sexton who lay there  the man remembered having buried there two children of a blacksmith who lived at the hamlet on the opposite side of the water  the blacksmith died next day  this did more for second sight probably than all the ministers sermons could do against the belief  as we began by stating it is a popular superstition among the learned that the belief in second sight has died out among the highlanders  fifty years ago dr mcculloch in his description of the western islands wrote thus  second sight has undergone the fate of witchcraft ceasing to be believed it has ceased to exist 245   now as to whether second sight exists or not we may think as we please but the belief in second sight is still vivacious in the highlands and has not altered in a single feature  a well known highland minister has been kind enough to answer a few questions on the belief as it is in his parish he first met a secondsighted man in his own beadle a most respectable person of entirely blameless life  after citing a few examples of the beadles successful hits our informant says  he told me that he felt the thing coming on and that it was always preceded by a sense of discomfort and anxiety     there was no epilepsy and no convulsion of any kind  he felt a sense of great relief when the vision had passed away and he assured me repeatedly that the gift was an annoyance rather than a pleasure to him as the lapp also confessed to scheffer  others who had the same gift have told me the same thing  out of seven or eight people liable to this malady or whatever we are to call it only one we learn was other than robust healthy and steady  in two instances the seers were examined by a physician of experience and got clean bills of mental and bodily health  an instance is mentioned in which the beadle alone in a boat with a friend on a saltwater loch at night saw a vision of a man drowning in a certain pool of a certain river  a shepherds plaid lay on the bank  the beadle told his companion what he saw and set his foot on his friends who then shared his experience  this proves the continuity of the belief that the hallucination can be communicated by contact 246  as a matter of evidence it would have been better if the beadle had not first told his friend what he saw  both men told our informant next day and the vision was fulfilled scarcely a week afterwards  this vision granting the honesty of the seers was a case of clairvoyance but symbolical hallucinations frequently occur  in our informants experience the gift is not hereditary  on the whole subject dr stewart of nether lochaber wrote several articles in the inverness courier during the autumn of 1893  the highland clergy have doubtless some difficulty in dealing with the belief among their parishioners  but as the possession of the accomplishment is no longer regarded as criminal and as the old theories of diabolical possession or fairy inspiration are not entertained at least by the educated the seers are probably to be regarded as merely harmless visionaries  at most we may say with the poet  lo the sublime telepathist is here  the belief in witchcraft is also as lively in the highlands as in devonshire but while the law takes no cognisance of it no great harm is done  the witchcraft mainly relies on sympathetic magic on perforating a clay image of an enemy with needles and so forth there is a very recent specimen in the pitt rivers collection at the museum in oxford  it was presented in a scientific spirit by the victim who was not a penny the worse unlike sir george maxwell of pollok two centuries ago  though second sight is so firmly rooted in celtic opinion the tourist or angler who has no gaelic is not likely to hear much of it  but when trout refuse to rise and time hangs heavy in a boat on a loch it is a good plan to tell the boatman some ghostly sassenach tales  then perhaps he will cap them from his own store but pointblank questions from an inquiring southron are of very little use  nobody likes to be crossexamined on such matters unluckily the evidence for facts not for folklore is worthless till it has stood the severest crossexamination     ghosts before the law   sir walter scott on rarity of ghostly evidence  his pamphlet for the bannatyne club  his other examples  case of mirabel  the spectre the treasure the deposit repudiated  trials of auguier and mirabel  the case of clenches murder  the murder of sergeant davies  acquittal of the prisoners  an example from aubrey  the murder of anne walker  the case of mr booty  an example from maryland the story of briggs and harris  the valogne phantasm trials in the matter of haunted houses  cases from le loyer modern instances of haunted houses before the law  unsatisfactory results of legal investigations  what i do not know is not knowledge sir walter scott might have said with regard to bogles and barghaists  his collection at abbotsford of such works as the ephesian converts burned is extensive and peculiar while his memory was rich in tradition and legend  but as his major bellenden sings  was never wight so starkly made but time and years will overthrow  when sir walter in 1831 wrote a brief essay on ghosts before the law his memory was no longer the extraordinary engine wax to receive and marble to retain that it had been  it is an example of his dauntless energy that even in 1831 he was not only toiling at novels and histories and reviews to wipe out his debts but that as a pure labour of love he edited for the bannatyne club the trial of duncan terig alias clerk and alexander bane macdonald for the murder of arthur davis sergeant in general guises regiment of foot june 1754  the trial as sir walter says in his dedication to the bannatyne club involves a curious point of evidence a piece of spectral evidence as cotton mather calls it  in another dedication for there are two scott addresses sir samuel shepherd remarking that the tract deals with perhaps the only subject of legal inquiry which has escaped being investigated by his skill and illustrated by his genius  that point is the amount of credit due to the evidence of a ghost  in his preface sir walter cites the familiar objection of a learned judge that the ghost must be sworn in usual form but in case he does not come forward he cannot be heard as now proposed through the medium medium indeed of a third party  it seems to be a rule of evidence that what a dead man said may be received on the report of the person with whom he communicated  a ghost is a dead man and yet he is deprived according to the learned judges ruling of his privilege  scott does not cite the similar legend in hibernian tales the chap book quoted by thackeray in his irish sketchbook  in that affair when the judge asked the ghost to give his own evidence  instantly there came a dreadful rumbling noise into the courthere am i that was murdered by the prisoner at the bar  the hibernian tales are of no legal authority nor can we give chapter and verse for another wellknown anecdote  a prisoner on a charge of murder was about to escape when the court observed him looking suspiciously over his shoulder  is there no one present the learned judge asked in general who can give better testimony  my lord exclaimed the prisoner that wound he shows in his chest is twice as big as the one i gave him  in this anecdote however the prisoner was clearly suffering from a hallucination as the judge detected and we do not propose to consider cases in which phantasms bred of remorse drove a guilty man to make confession  to return to scott he remarks that believers in ghosts must be surprised to find how seldom in any country an allusion hath been made to such evidence in a court of justice  scott himself has only detected one or two cases of such apparition evidence which he gives  now it is certain as we shall see that he must have been acquainted with several other examples which did not recur to his memory  the memory of 1831 was no longer that of better years again there were instances of which he had probably never possessed any knowledge while others have occurred since his death  we shall first consider the cases of spectral evidence evidence that is of a dead mans ghost not of a mere wraith recorded by sir walter and deal later with those beyond his memory or knowledge 250  sir walters first instance is from causes celebres vol xii la haye 1749 amsterdam 1775 p 247  unluckily the narrator in this collection is an esprit fort and is assiduous in attempts to display his wit  we have not a plain unvarnished tale but something more like a facetious leading article based on a trial  honore mirabel was a labouring lad under age near marseilles  his story was that in may year not given about eleven at night he was lying under an almond tree near the farm of a lady named gay in the moonlight he saw a man at an upper window of a building distant five or six paces the house belonged to a madame placasse mirabel asked the person what he was doing there got no answer entered and could see nobody  rather alarmed he went to a well drew some water drank and then heard a weak voice bidding him dig there for treasure and asking that masses might be said for the soul of the informant  a stone then fell on a certain spot stone throwing is a favourite exercise with ghosts everywhere  with another labourer one bernard mirabel dug found a packet of dirty linen and fearing that it might hold the infection of plague dipped it in wine for lack of vinegar  the parcel contained more than a thousand portuguese gold coins  bernard and his mistress were present at the opening of the parcel but mirabel managed to conceal from them the place where he hid it not a very likely story  he was grateful enough to pay for the desired masses and he had himself bled four times to relieve his agitation mirabel now consulted a merchant in marseilles one auguier who advised him to keep his old coins a mystery as to put them into circulation would lead to inquiry and inconvenience  he lent mirabel some ready money and finally induced mirabel to entrust the portuguese hoard to his care  the money was in two bags one fastened with goldcoloured ribbon the other with linen thread auguier gave a receipt and now we get a date marseilles september 27 1726  later auguier it seems tried to murder mirabel and refused to return the deposit  mirabel went to law with him auguier admitted that mirabel had spoken to him about having found a treasure which he would entrust to auguier but denied the rest  in his house was found a ribbon of a golden hue such as mirabel used to tie up his bag and a little basket which has no obvious connection with the matter  the case was allowed to come on there were sixteen witnesses  a woman named caillot swore to mirabels having told her about the ghost  she saw the treasure excavated saw the bags and recognised the ribbon  a man had seen mirabel on his way to give auguier his bags and indeed saw him do so and receive a piece of paper  he also found next day a gold coin on the scene of the interview  a third witness a woman was shown the treasure by mirabel  the narrator here makes the important reflection that providence could not allow a ghost to appear merely to enrich a foolish peasant  but granting ghosts as the narrator does we can only say that in ordinary life providence permits a number of undesirable events to occur  why should the behaviour of ghosts be an exception  other witnesses swore to corroborating circumstances  auguier denied everything experts admitted that the receipt was like his writing but declared it to be forged the ribbon was explained as part of his little daughters dress  the judge decidedno one will guess whatthat auguier should be put to the torture  auguier appealed  his advocate urged the absurdity of a ghoststory on a priori grounds  if there was no ghost then there was no treasure  if there was a treasure would not the other digger have secured his share  that digger bernard was not called  then auguier pled an alibi he was eight leagues away when he was said to have received the treasure  why he did not urge this earlier does not appear  mirabels advocate first defended from the bible and the fathers the existence of ghosts  the faculty of theology in paris had vouched for them only two years before this case in 1724  the sorbonne had been as explicit in 1518  the parliament of paris often permitted the tenant of a haunted house to break his contract 253  ghosts or no ghosts mirabels counsel said there was a treasure  in his receipt auguier to deceive a simple peasant partially disguised his hand  auguiers alibi is worthless he might easily have been at marseilles and at pertuis on the same day  the distance is eight leagues  bernard was now at last called in he admitted that mirabel told him of the ghost that they dug and found some linen but that he never saw any gold  he had carried the money from mirabel to pay for the masses due to the ghost  mirabel had shown him a document for which he said he had paid a crown and bernard who probably could not read believed it to be like auguiers receipt  bernard of course having been denied his share was not a friendly witness  a legal document was put in showing that madame placasse on whose land the treasure lay summoned mirabel to refund it to her  the document was a summons to him  but this document was forged and mirabel according to a barrister whom he had consulted about it said it was handed to him by a man unknown  why the barrister should have betrayed his client is not clear  mirabel and marguerite caillot his first witness who had deposed to his telling her about the ghost and to seeing the excavation of the packet were now arrested while auguier remained in prison marguerite now denied her original deposition she had only spoken to oblige mirabel  one etienne barthelemy was next arrested  he admitted that he had financed mirabel during the trial but denied that he had suborned any witnesses  two experts differed as usual about auguiers receipt a third was called in and then they unanimously decided that it was not in his hand  on february 18 1729 auguier was acquitted mirabel was condemned to the torture and to the galley for life  marguerite caillot was fined ten francs  under torture mirabel accused barthelemy of having made him bring his charge against auguier supplying him with the forged receipt and with the sham document the summons to restore the gold to madame placasse  oddly enough he still said that he had handed sacks of coin to auguier and that one of them was tied up with the goldcoloured ribbon  two of his witnesses under torture stuck to their original statements  they were sentenced to be hung up by the armpits and barthelemy was condemned to the galleys for life  it is a singular tale and shows strange ideas of justice  once condemned to the galleys mirabel might as well have made a clean breast of it but this he did not do  he stuck to his bags and goldcoloured ribbon  manifestly mirabel would have had a better chance of being believed in court if he had dropped the ghost altogether  it is notable that sir walter probably gave his version of this affair from memory  he says that mirabel was nonsuited upon the ground that if his own story was true the treasure by the ancient laws of france belonged to the crown  scotts next case is very uninteresting at least as far as it is given in howells state trials vol xii 1692 p 875  a gentleman named harrison had been accused of beguiling a dr clenche into a hackney coach on pretence of taking him to see a patient  there were two men in the coach besides the doctor  they sent the coachman on an errand and when he came back he found the men fled and clenche murdered  he had been strangled with a handkerchief  on evidence which was chiefly circumstantial harrison was found guilty and died protesting his innocence  later a mrs milward declared that her husband before his death confessed to her that he and a man named cole were the murderers of dr clenche  the ghost of her husband persecuted her she said till cole was arrested  mr justice dolben asked her in court for the story but feared that the jury would laugh at her  she asserted the truth of her story but if she gave any details they are not reported  cole was acquitted and the motives of mrs milward remain obscure  coming to the tract which he reprints sir walter says that his notice was first drawn to it in 1792 by robert mcintosh esq one of the counsel in the case which was heard in edinburgh june 10 1754  grant of prestongrange the lord advocate well known to readers of mr stevensons catriona prosecuted duncan terig or clerk and alexander bain macdonald for the murder of sergeant arthur davies on september 28 1749  they shot him on christie hill at the head of glenconie  there his body remained concealed for some time and was later found with a hat marked with his initials a r d  they are also charged with taking his watch two gold rings and a purse of gold whereby clerk previously penniless was enabled to take and stock two farms  donald farquharson in glendee deposes that in june 1750 alexander macpherson sent for him and said that he was much troubled by the ghost of the serjeant who insisted that he should bury his bones and should consult farquharson  donald did not believe this quite but trembled lest the ghost should vex him  he went with macpherson who showed the body in a peatmoss  the body was much decayed the dress all in tatters  donald asked macpherson whether the apparition denounced the murderers  he replied that the ghost said it would have done so had macpherson not asked the question  they buried the body on the spot donald attested that he had seen the serjeants rings on the hand of clerks wife  for three years the prisoners had been suspected by the country side  macpherson declared that he had seen an apparition of a man in blue who said i am serjeant davies that he at first took this man for a brother of donald farquharsons that he followed the man or phantasm to the door where the spectre repeated its assertions and pointed out the spot where the bones lay  he found them and then went as already shown to donald farquharson  between the first vision and the burying the ghost came to him naked and this led him to inter the remains  on the second appearance the ghost denounced the prisoners  macpherson gave other evidence not spectral which implicated clerk  but when asked what language the ghost spoke in he answered as good gaelic as he had ever heard in lochaber  pretty well said his counsel scotts informant mcintosh for the ghost of an english serjeant  this was probably conclusive with the jury for they acquitted the prisoners in the face of the other incriminating evidence  this was illogical modern students of ghosts of course would not have been staggered by the ghosts command of gaelic  they would explain it as a convenient hallucinatory impression made by the ghost on the mind of the percipient  the old theologians would have declared that a good spirit took daviess form and talked in the tongue best known to macpherson  scotts remark is that mcintoshs was no sound jest for there was nothing more ridiculous in a ghost speaking a language which he did not understand when in the body than there was in his appearing at all  but jurymen are not logicians macpherson added that he told his tale to none of the people with him in the sheiling but that isobel mchardie assured him she saw such a vision  isobel in whose service macpherson had been deponed that while she lay at one end of the sheiling and macpherson at the other she saw something naked come in at the door which frighted her so much that she drew the clothes over her head  next day she asked macpherson what it was and he replied she might be easy for that it would not trouble them any more  the rest of the evidence went very strongly against the accused but the jury unanimously found them not guilty  scott conjectures that macpherson knew of the murder as indeed he had good reason if his nonspectral evidence is true but that he invented the ghost whose commands must be obeyed that he might escape the prejudice entertained by the celtic race against citizens who do their duty  davies poor fellow was a civil goodhumoured man and dealt leniently as evidence showed with highlanders who wore the tartan  their national costume was abolished as we all know by english law after the plaid had liberally displayed itself six miles south of derby in 1745  so far it is plain that what the ghost said is not evidence and may even ruin a very fair case for there can be little doubt as to who killed serjeant davies  but examples which scott forgot for of course he knew them prove that in earlier times a ghosts testimony was not contemned by english law  cases are given with extracts from documents in a book so familiar to sir walter as aubreys miscellanies  aubrey b 1626 d 1697 was a frs and like several other contemporary fellows of the royal society was a keen ghost hunter  he published 259 a full and true relation of the examination and confession of william barwick and edward mangall of two horrid murders  barwick killed his wife who was about to bear a child near cawood in yorkshire on april 14 1690  barwick had intrigued with his wife before marriage and perhaps was passing weary of her love on april 14 palm monday he went to his brotherinlaw thomas lofthouse near york who had married mrs barwicks sister  he informed lofthouse that he had taken mrs barwick for her confinement to the house of his uncle harrison in selby  on september 17 at york assizes lofthouse swore that on easter tuesday eight days after palm monday namely april 22 he was watering a quickset hedge at midday when he saw the apparition in the shape of a woman walking before him  she sat down opposite the pool whence he drew water he passed her as he went and returning with his pail filled saw her again  she was dandling on her lap some white object which he had not observed before  he emptied his pail and standing in his yard looked for her again she was no longer present  she wore a brown dress and a white hood such as his wifes sister usually wore and her face looked extream pale her teeth in sight no gums appearing her visage being like his wifes sister  it certainly seems as if this resemblance was an afterthought of lofthouses for he dismissed the matter from his mind till prayers when it discomposed his devotions  he then mentioned the affair to his wife who inferred that her sister had met with foul play on april 23 that is the day after the vision he went to selby where harrison denied all knowledge of mrs barwick  on april 24 lofthouse made a deposition to this effect before the mayor of york but in his published statement of that date he only avers that hearing nothing of the said barwicks wife he imagined barwick had done her some mischief  there is not a word hereof the phantasm sworn to by lofthouse at the assizes on september 17  nevertheless on april 24 barwick confessed to the mayor of york that on monday was seventh night there seems to be an error here he found the conveniency of a pond as aubrey puts it adjoining to a quickwood hedge and there drowned the woman and buried her hard by  at the assizes barwick withdrew his confession and pleaded not guilty lofthouse his wife and a third person swore however that the dead woman was found buried in her clothes by the pond side and on the prisoners confession being read he was found guilty and hanged in chains  probably he was guilty but aubreys dates are confused and we are not even sure whether there were two ponds and two quickset hedges or only one of each  lofthouse may have seen a stranger dressed like his sisterinlaw this may have made him reflect on barwicks tale about taking her to selby he visited that town detected barwicks falsehood and the terror of that discovery made barwick confess  surtees in his history of durham published another tale which scotts memory did not retain  in 1630 a girl named anne walker was about to have a child by a kinsman also a walker for whom she kept house  walker took her to dame care in chester le street whence he and mark sharp removed her one evening late in november fourteen days afterwards late at night graime a fuller who lived six miles from walkers village lumley saw a woman dishevelled bloodstained and with five wounds in her head standing in a room in his mill  she said she was anne walker that mark sharp had slain her with a colliers pick and thrown her body into a coal pit hiding the pick under the bank  after several visitations graime went with his legend to a magistrate the body and pickaxe were discovered walker and sharp were arrested and tried at durham in august 1631  sharps boots all bloody were found where the ghost said he had concealed them in a stream how they remained bloody if in water is hard to explain  against walker there was no direct evidence  the prisoners the judge summing up against them were found guilty and hanged protesting their innocence  it is suggested that graime himself was the murderer else how did he know so much about it  but walker and sharp were seen last with the woman and the respectable walker was not without a motive while at this distance we can conjecture no motive in the case of graime 262  cockburns voyage up the mediterranean is the authority ii 35 for a very odd trial in the court of kings bench london  the logs of three ships under captains barnaby bristow and brown were put in to prove that on friday 15th may 1687 these men with many others were shooting rabbits on stromboli  that when beaters and all were collected about a quarter to four they all saw a man in grey and a man in black run towards them the one in grey leading that barnaby exclaimed the foremost is old booty my next door neighbour that the figures vanished into the flames of the volcano  this occurrence by barnabys desire they noted in their journals  they were all making merry on october 6 1687 at gravesend when mrs barnaby remarked to her husband  my dear old booty is dead  the captain replied  we all saw him run into hell  mrs booty hearing of this remark sued barnaby for libel putting her damages at 1000 pounds  the case came on the clothes of old booty were shown in court  the date and hour of his death were stated and corresponded within two minutes to the moment when the mariners beheld the apparition in stromboli so the widow lost her cause a mediaeval legend has been revived in this example  all these curious legal cases were no doubt familiar to sir walter scott  he probably had no access to an american example which was reprinted four years after his death by a member of the club which he founded the bannatyne club 263 in 1836  the evidence of the ghostseer was republished by mrs crowe in her night side of nature  but mrs crowe neither gives the facts of the trial correctly nor indicates the sources of the narrative  the source was a periodical the opera glass february 3 1827 thirty years after the date of the trial  the document however had existed for many years in the possession of the anonymous contributor to the opera glass  he received it from one of the counsel in the case mr nicholson afterwards a judge in maryland who compiled it from attested notes made by himself in court  the suit was that of james fanny robert and thomas harris devisees of thomas harris v mary harris relict and administratrix of james harris brother of thomas aforesaid 179899  thomas harris had four illegitimate children  he held as he supposed a piece of land in fee but in fact he was only seized in tail thus he could not sell or devise it and his brother james was heir in tail the children being bastards  these legal facts were unknown both to james and thomas  thomas made a will leaving james his executor and directing that the land should be sold and the money divided among his own children  james when thomas died sold the land and in drawing the conveyance it was discovered that he had no right to do so for thomas as it was held by thomas in tail james then conveyed his right to the purchaser and kept the money as legal heir  why james could sell if thomas could not the present writer is unable to explain  in two years james died intestate and the children of thomas brought a suit against jamess widow  before jamess death the ghost of thomas had appeared frequently to one briggs an old soldier in the colonial revolt bidding james return the proceeds of the sale to the orphans court and when james heard of this from briggs he did go to the orphans court and returned himself to the estate of his brother to the amount of the purchase money of the land  now before the jury were sworn the counsel wright and nicholson for the plaintiffs scott and earle for the defendant privately agreed that the money could not be recovered for excellent legal reasons  but they kept this to themselves and let the suit go on merely for the pleasure of hearing briggs a man of character of firm undaunted spirit swear to his ghost in a court of law  he had been intimate with thomas harris from boyhood  it may be said that he invented the ghost in the interest of his friends children  he certainly mentioned it however some time before he had any conversation with it  briggss evidence may be condensed very much as the learned mrs crowe quotes it correctly in her night side of nature  in march 1791 about nine am briggs was riding a horse that had belonged to harris  in a lane adjoining the field where harris was buried the horse shied looked into the field where the tomb was and neighed very loud  briggs now saw harris coming through the field in his usual dress a blue coat  harris vanished and the horse went on  as briggs was ploughing in june harris walked by him for two hundred yards  a lad named bailey who came up made no remark nor did harris tell him about the hallucination  in august after dark harris came and laid his arms on briggss shoulder briggs had already spoken to james harris brither to the corp about these and other related phenomena a groan a smack on the nose from a viewless hand and so forth  in october briggs saw harris about twilight in the morning  later at eight oclock in the morning he was busy in the field with bailey aforesaid when harris passed and vanished  bailey saw nothing  at halfpast nine the spectre returned and leaned on a railing  briggs vainly tried to make bailey see him  briggs now crossed the fence and walked some hundreds of yards with harris telling him that his will was disputed  harris bade briggs go to his aforesaid brother james and remind him of a conversation they had held on the east side of the wheatstacks on the day when harriss fatal illness began  james remembered the conversation and said he would fulfil his brothers desire which he actually did  there was a later interview between briggs and harris the matter then discussed briggs declined to impart to the court and the court overruled the question  he had never related to any person the last conversation and never would  bailey was sworn and deposed that briggs had called his attention to harris whom he could not see had climbed the fence and walked for some distance apparently in deep conversation with some person  witness saw no one  it is plain that the ghost never really understood the legal question at issue  the dates are difficult to reconcile  thomas harris died in 1790  his ghost appeared in 1791  why was there no trial of the case till about 1798 or 1799  perhaps research in the maryland records would elucidate these and other questions we do but give the tale with such authority as it possesses  possibly it is an elaborate hoax played off by nicholson the plaintiffs counsel on the correspondent of the opera glass or by him on the editor of that periodical  the hallucinations of briggs which were fortunate enough it is said to get into a court of justice singularly resemble those of m bezuel in july and august 1697 though these were not matter of a sworn deposition  the evidence is in histoire dune apparition arrivee a valogne 267  the narrator of 1708 having heard much talk of the affair was invited to meet bezuel a priest at dinner january 7 1708  he told his one story with much simplicity  in 1695 when about fifteen bezuel was a friend of a younger boy one of two brothers desfontaines  in 1696 when desfontaines minor was going to study at caen he worried bezuel into signing in his blood a covenant that the first who died should appear to the survivor  the lads corresponded frequently every six weeks  on july 31 1697 at halfpast two bezuel who was haymaking had a fainting fit  on august 1 at the same hour he felt faint on a road and rested under a shady tree  on august 2 at halfpast two he fainted in a hayloft and vaguely remembered seeing a halfnaked body  he came down the ladder and seated himself on a block in the place des capucins  here he lost sight of his companions but did see desfontaines who came up took his left arm and led him into an alley  the servant followed and told bezuels tutor that he was talking to himself  the tutor went to him and heard him asking and answering questions  bezuel for threequarters of an hour conversed as he believed with desfontaines who said that he had been drowned while bathing at caen about halfpast two on july 31  the appearance was naked to the waist his head bare showing his beautiful yellow locks  he asked bezuel to learn a school task that had been set him as a penalty the seven penitential psalms  he described a tree at caen where he had cut some words two years later bezuel visited it and them he gave other pieces of information which were verified but not a word would he say of heaven hell or purgatory he seemed not to hear my questions  there were two or three later interviews till bezuel carried out the wishes of the phantasm  when the spectral desfontaines went away on the first occasion bezuel told another boy that desfontaines was drowned  the lad ran to the parents of desfontaines who had just received a letter to that effect  by some error the boy thought that the elder desfontaines had perished and said so to bezuel who denied it and on a second inquiry bezuel was found to be right  the explanation that bezuel was ill as he certainly was that he had heard of the death of his friend just before his hallucination and had forgotten an impressive piece of news which however caused the apparition is given by the narrator of 1708 the kind of illusion in which a man is seen and heard to converse with empty air is common to the cases of bezuel and of briggs and the writer is acquainted at first hand with a modern example  mrs crowe cites on the authority of the late mr maurice lothian solicitor for the plaintiff a suit which arose out of hauntings and was heard in the sheriffs court at edinburgh in 183537  but we are unable to discover the official records or extracts of evidence from them  this is to be regretted but by way of consolation we have the pleadings on both sides in an ancient french case of a haunted house  these are preserved in his discours des spectres a closely printed quarto of nearly 1000 pages by pierre le loyer conseiller du roy au siege presidial dangers 269  le loyer says de gayete de coeur semble mestre voulu engager au combat contre ceux qui impugnent les spectres  as le loyer observes ghosts seldom come into court in civil cases except when indicted as nuisances namely when they make a hired house uninhabitable by their frolics  then the tenant often wants to quit the house and to have his contract annulled  the landlord resists an action is brought and is generally settled in accordance with the suggestion of alphenus in his digests book ii  alphenus says in brief that the fear must be a genuine fear and that reason for no ordinary dread must be proved  hence arnault ferton in his customal of burgundy advises that legitimate dread of phantasms which trouble mens rest and make night hideous is reason good for leaving a house and declining to pay rent after the day of departure  covarruvias a spanish legist already quoted agrees with arnault ferton  the parliament of grenada in one or two cases decided in favour of the tenant and against the landlord of houses where spectres racketed  le loyer now reports the pleadings in a famous case of which he does not give the date  incidentally however we learn that it can hardly have been earlier than 1550 the cause was heard on appeal before the parlement de paris  pierre piquet guardian of nicolas macquereau a minor let to giles bolacre a house in the suburbs of tours  poor bolacre was promptly disturbed by a noise and routing of invisible spirits which suffered neither himself nor his family to sleep o nights he then cited piquet also daniel macquereau who was concerned in the letting of the house before the local seat of themis  the case was heard and the judge at tours broke the lease the hauntings being insupportable nuisances  but this he did without letters royal  the lessors then appealed and the case came before the cour de parlement in paris  maitre chopin was for the lessors nau appeared for the tenant  chopin first took the formal point the tours judge was formally wrong in breaking a covenant without letters royal a thing particularly bad in the case of a minor nicolas macquereau  so much for the point of form as to the matter maitre chopin laughed at the bare idea of noisy spirits  this is notable because in an age when witches were burned frequently the idea of a haunted house could be treated by the learned counsel as a mere waggery yet the belief in haunted houses has survived the legal prosecution of witches  the judge in tours has merely and mischievously encouraged superstition  all ghosts brownies lutins are mere bugbears of children here maitre chopin quotes plato and philo judaeus in the original also empedocles marcus aurelius tertullian quintilian dioscorides  perhaps bolacre and his family suffer from nightmare  if so a physician not a solicitor is their man  or again granting that their house is haunted they should appeal to the clergy not to the law  manifestly this is a point to be argued  do the expenses of exorcism fall on landlord or tenant  this we think can hardly be decided by a quotation from epictetus  alexis comnenus bids us seek a bishop in the case of psychical phenomena greek  so maitre chopin argues but he evades the point  is it not the business of the owner of the house to whustle on his ain parten to have his own bogie exorcised  of course piquet and macquereau may argue that the bogie is bolacres bogie that it flitted to the house with bolacre but that is a question of fact and evidence  chopin concludes that a lease is only voidable in case of material defect or nuisance as of pestilential air not in a case which after all is a mere vice desprit  here maitre chopin sits down with a wink at the court and nau pleads for the tenant  first why abuse the judge at tours  the lessors argued the case before him and cannot blame him for credulity  the romans far from rejecting such ideas as chopin had maintained used a ritual service for ejecting spooks so ovid testifies  greek and roman hauntings are cited from pliny plutarch suetonius in the last case ghost of caligula the house had to be destroyed like the house at wolflee where the ghost resenting presbyterian exorcism killed the rev mr thomson of southdean father of the author of the castle of indolence  as to plato cited by my learned brother plato believed in hauntings as we read in the phaedo nau has him here in brief the defendants have let a house as habitable well knowing the same to be infested by spirits  the fathers are then cited as witnesses for ghosts  the learned counsels argument about a vice desprit is a pitiable pun  the decision of the court unluckily is not preserved by le loyer the counsel for bolacre told le loyer that the case was adjourned on the formal point but that having obtained letters royal for his client he succeeded in getting the remainder of the lease declared void  comparing however bouchel s v louage in his bibliotheque du droit francois one finds that the higher court reversed the decision of the judge at tours  in the edinburgh case 1835 the tenant captain molesworth did not try to have his lease quashed but he did tear up floors pull down wainscots and bore a hole into the next house that of his landlord mr webster in search of the cause of the noises  mr webster therefore brought an action to restrain him from these experiments  le loyer gives two cases of ghosts appearing to denounce murderers in criminal cases  he possessed the speech of the president brisson at that time an advocate in which he cited the testimony of the spectre of madame de colommiers mysteriously murdered in full day with her children and their nurse  her ghost appeared to her husband when wide awake and denounced her own cousins  as there was no other evidence beyond the existence of motive the accused were discharged  in another wellknown case before the parlement de bretagne the ghost of a man who had mysteriously vanished guided his brother to the spot where his wife and her paramour had buried him after murdering him  le loyer does not give the date of this trial  the wife was strangled and her body was burned  modern times have known dreamevidence in cases of murder as in the assynt murder and the famous red barns affair  but thomas harriss is probably the last ghost cited in a court of law  on the whole the ghosts have gained little by these legally attested appearances but the trials do throw a curious light on the juridical procedure of our ancestors  the famous action against the ghosts in the eyrbyggja saga was not before a christian court and is too well known for quotation 273      a modern trial for witchcraft   thorel v tinel  action for libel in 1851  mr dale owens incomplete version of this affair  the suit really a trial for witchcraft  spectral obsession  movements of objects  rappings incidental folklore  old g  thorel and the cure  the wizards revenge  the haunted parlour boarder  examples of magical tripping up and provoked hallucinations  case of dr gibotteau and berthe the hospital nurse  similar case in the salem affair 1692 evidence of witnesses to abnormal phenomena  mr robert de saint victor  m de mirville  thorel nonsuited  other modern french examples of witchcraft  perhaps the last trial for witchcraft was the case of thorel v tinel heard before the juge de paix of yerville on january 28 and february 3 and 4 1851  the trial was in form the converse of those with which old jurisprudence was familiar  tinel the cure of cideville did not accuse the shepherd thorel of sorcery but thorel accused tinel of defaming his character by the charge of being a warlock  just as when a man prosecutes another for saying that he cheated at cards or when a woman prosecutes another for saying that the plaintiff stole diamonds it is really the guilt or innocence of the plaintiff that is in question so the issue before the court at yerville was  is thorel a warlock or not  the court decided that he himself had been the chief agent in spreading the slander against himself he was nonsuited and had to pay costs but as to the real cause of the events which were attributed to the magic of thorel the court was unable to pronounce an opinion  this curious case has often been cited as by mr robert dale owen in his footfalls on the boundary of another world 275 but mr owen by accident or design omitted almost all the essential particulars everything which connects the affair with such transactions as the witch epidemic at salem and the trials for sorcery before and during the restoration  yet in the events at cideville and the depositions of witnesses we have all the characteristics of witchcraft  first we have men by habit and repute sorcerers  then we have cause of offence given to these then we have their threats malum minatum then we have evil following the threats damnum secutum  just as of old that damnum that damage declares itself in the possession of young people who become more or less subject to trances and convulsions  one of them is haunted as in the old witchcraft cases by the phantasm of the sorcerer  the phantasm as in cotton mathers examples is wounded a parallel wound is found on the suspected warlock finally the house where the obsessed victims live is disturbed by knocks raps flight of objects and inexplicable movements of heavy furniture  thus all the notes of a bad affair of witchcraft are attested in a modern trial under the third empire  finally some curious folklore is laid bare light is cast on rural life and superstition and a singular corroboration of a singular statement much more recent than the occurrences at cideville is obtained  a more astonishing example of survival cannot be imagined of survival or of disconnected and spontaneous revival and recrudescence 276  there was at auzebosc near famous yvetot an old shepherd named g he was the recognised wise man or white witch of the district and some less noted rural adepts gave themselves out as his pupils  in march 1849 m tinel cure of cideville visited a sick peasant and advised him to discard old g the shepherd magical and send for a physician  g was present though concealed heard the cures criticisms and said  why does he meddle in my business i shall meddle in his he has pupils in his house well see how long he keeps them  in a few days g was arrested as practising medicine unauthorised was imprisoned for some months and fancied that the cure had a share in this persecution  all this of course we must take as the clash of the country side intent as there was certainly damnum secutum on establishing malum minatum  on a farm near the cures house in cideville was another shepherd named thorel a man of forty described as dull illiterate and given to boasting about his powers as a disciple of the venerable g popular opinion decided that g employed thorel to procure his vengeance it was necessary that a sorcerer should touch his intended victim and g had not the same conveniency for doing so as thorel  in old witch trials we sometimes find the witch kissing her destined prey 277  thorel so it was said succeeded in touching on nov 25 1850 m tinels two pupils in a crowd at a sale of wood  the lads of fifteen and twelve were named lemonier and bunel  for what had gone before we have so far only public chatter for what followed we have the sworn evidence in court of the cures pupils in january and february 1851  according to lemonier on nov 26 while studying he heard light blows of a hammer these recurred daily about 5 pm  when m tinel his tutor said plus fort the noises were louder  to condense evidence which becomes tedious by its eternal uniformity popular airs were beaten on demand the noise grew unbearable tables moved untouched a breviary a knife a spit a shoe flew wildly about  lemonier was buffeted by a black hand attached to nobody  a kind of human phantasm clad in a blouse haunted me for fifteen days wherever i went none but myself could see it  he was dragged by the leg by a mysterious force  on a certain day when thorel found a pretext for visiting the house m tinel made him beg lemoniers pardon clearly on the ground that the swain had bewitched the boy  as soon as i saw him i recognised the phantasm which had haunted me for a fortnight and i said to m tinel  there is the man who follows me  thorel knelt to the boy asked his pardon and pulled violently at his clothes  as defendant perhaps the cure could not be asked to corroborate these statements  the evidence of the other boy bunel was that on nov 26 he heard first a rush of wind then tappings on the wall  he corroborated lemoniers testimony to the musical airs knocked out the volatile furniture and the recognition in thorel of the phantom  in the evening said bunel lemonier en eut une crise de nerfs dans laquelle il avait perdu connaissance  leaving the boys sworn evidence and returning to the narrative with its gossip we learn that thorel boasted of his success and said that if he could but touch one of the lads again the furniture would dance and the windows would be broken  meanwhile we are told nails were driven into points in the floor where lemonier saw the spectral figure standing  one nail became red hot and the wood round it smoked  lemonier said that this nail had hit the man in the blouse on the cheek  now when thorel was made to ask the boys pardon and was recognised by him as the phantom after the experiment with the nail thorel bore on his cheek the mark of the wound  this is in accordance with good precedents in witchcraft  a witch hare is wounded the witch in her natural form has the same wound at the trial of bridget bishop in the court of oyer and terminer held at salem june 2 1692 there was testimony brought in that a man striking once at the place where a bewitched person said the shape of mrs bishop stood the bewitched cried out that he had tore her coat in the place then particularly specified and bishops coat was found to be torn in that very place 279a  next day after thorel touched the boy the windows broke as he had prophesied  then followed a curious scene in which thorel tried in presence of the maire to touch the cure who retreated to the end of the room and struck the shepherd with his cane  thereupon thorel brought his action for libel and assault against the cure fortytwo witnesses were heard it was proved that thorel had in fact frequently accused himself and he was nonsuited  his counsel spoke of appealing but unluckily the case was not carried to a higher court  in a few weeks the boys were sent to their homes when according to the narrative there were disturbances at the home of the younger lad  thus the cure lost his pupils  a curious piece of traditional folklore came out but only as hearsay in court  m cheval maire of cideville deposed that a m savoye told him that thorel had once been shepherd to a m tricot at that time thorel said to one of two persons in his company every time i strike my cabin a shelter on wheels used by shepherds you will fall and at each stroke the victim felt something seize his throat and fell 279b  this anecdote is curious because in the proceedings of the society for psychical research is a long paper by dr gibotteau on his experiments with a hospital nurse called berthe  this woman according to the doctor had the power of making him see hallucinations of a nature more or less horrible from a distance  she had been taught some traditional feats of rural sorcery among others that of making a man stumble or fall as he walked  the doctor does not make any allusion to the cideville affair and it seems probable that this trick is part of the peasants magical repertoire or rather that the peasant warlocks boast of being able to perform the trick  but if we can accept the physicians evidence as true for him at least then a person like berthe really might affect from a distance a boy like lemonier with a haunting hallucination  to do this is witchcraft and for crimes of this kind or on false charges of this kind poor mrs bishop was burned at salem in 1692  at the lowest we have all the notes of sorcery as our rude ancestors knew it in this modern affair  two hundred years earlier thorel would have been burned and g too probably for the maire of cideville swore that before the disturbances and three weeks after g was let out of prison thorel had warned him of the trouble which g would bring on the cure  meanwhile the evidence shows no conscious malignity on the part of the two boys  they at first took very little notice of the raps attributing the noises to mice  not till the sounds increased and showed intelligence as by drumming tunes did the lads concern themselves much about the matter  at no time it seems did they ask to be sent home and of course to be relieved from their lessons and sent home would be their motive if they practised a fraud  we may admit that from rural tradition the boys might have learned what the customary phenomena are knocks raps moving tables heavy objects sailing tranquilly about a room  it would be less easy for them to produce these phenomena nor did the people of all classes who flocked to cideville detect any imposture  a land surveyor swore that the raps went on when he had placed the boy in an attitude which made fraud in his opinion impossible  a gentleman m de b took all possible precautions but nevertheless was entertained by a noise which performed the tunes demanded  he could discover no cause of the noise  m huet touching a table with his finger received responsive raps which answered questions at the very place where i struck and beneath my finger  i cannot explain the fact which i am convinced was not caused by the child nor by any one in the house  m cheval saw things fly about he slept in the boys room and his pillow flew from under his head  he lay down between the children holding their hands and placing his feet on theirs when the coverlet of the bed arose and floated away  the marquis de mirville had a number of answers by raps which staggered him very much but the force was quite feeble when he asked for portions of italian music madame de st victor felt herself pushed and her clothes pulled in the cures house when no one was near her  she also saw furniture behave in a fantastic manner and m raoul robert de st victor had many such experiences  m paul de st victor was not present  a desk sailed along  paused in air and fell  i had never seen a movement of this kind and i admit that i was alarmed  le seigneur a farmer saw a variety of objects arise and sail about he was certain that the boys did not throw them and when in their company in the open air between cideville and anzooville i saw stones come to us without striking us hurled by some invisible force  there was other confirmatory evidence from men of physic and of the law  the juge de paix as we have seen pronounced that the clearest point in the case was the absence of known cause for the effects and he nonsuited thorel the plaintiff  the cause of the phenomena is of course as obscure for us as for the worthy magistrate  we can only say that when precisely similar evidence was brought before judges and juries in england and new england at a period when medicine law and religion all recognised the existence of witchcraft magic and diabolical possession they had scarcely any choice but to condemn the accused  causa patet they said  the devil is at the bottom of it all and the witch is his minister  the affair of cideville by no means stands alone in modern france in 1853 two doctors and other witnesses signed a deposition as to precisely similar phenomena attending adelaide francoise millet a girl of twelve at songhien in champagne  the trouble as at cock lane began by a sound of scratching on the wood of her bed  the clerk of the juge de la paix the master of the douane two doctors and others visited her and tied her hands and feet  the noise continued  mysterious missiles pursued a girl in martinique in 1854  the house which was stormed by showers of stone in paris 1846 entirely baffled the police 283a  there is a more singular parallel to the cideville affair the account was printed from the letter of a correspondent in the abeille of chartres march 11 1849 283b  at gaubert near guillonville a man was imprisoned for thefts of hay the property of a m dolleans  two days after his arrest namely on december 31 1848 the servant of m dolleans had things of all sorts thrown at her from all directions  she fell ill and went into hospital for five days where she was untroubled  on her return in the middle of a conversation ribbons and bits of string would fly at her and twist themselves round her neck as in the case of francis fey of spraiton given by aubrey and bovet  mademoiselle dolleans carefully watched the girl for a fortnight and never let her out of her sight but could not discover any fraud  after about a month the maid was sent home where she was not molested  naturally we see in her the halfinsane cunning of hysteria but that explanation does not apply to little master dolleans a baby of three months old  the curse fell on him  however closely his parents watched him pots and pans showered into his cradle the narrator himself saw a miscellaneous collection of household furniture mysteriously amassed there  the abeille of chartres held this letter over till two of its reporters had visited the scene of action and interviewed doctors priests and farmers who all attested the facts  happily in this case an exorcism by a priest proved efficacious  at cideville holy water and consecrated medals were laughed at by the sprite who by the way answered to the name of robert

appearing to a jacobite  ghost of a country tradesman  case of telepathy known to wodrow  avenging spectres  lack of evidence  tale of cotton mather  in spite of a very general opinion to the opposite effect it is not really easy to determine in what kind of age and in what conditions of thought and civilisation ghosts will most frequently appear and ghostly phenomena will chiefly abound  we are all ready to aver that ghaists and eldritch fantasies will be most common in the dark ages in periods of ignorance or superstition  but research in mediaeval chronicles and in lives of the saints makes it apparent that while marvels on a large and imposing scale were frequent simple ordinary apparitions and haunted houses occur comparatively seldom  perhaps they were too common to be thought worth noticing yet they are noticed occasionally and even in these periods of superstition were apparently regarded as not quite everyday phenomena  one thing in this matter is tolerably certain namely that intense religious excitement produces a tendency to believe in marvels of all sorts and also begets a capacity for being hallucinated for beholding spectres strange lights dubious miracles  thus every one has heard of the temptation of st anthony and of other early christian fathers  they were wont to be surrounded by threatening aspects of wild beasts which had no real existence  in the same way the early zulu converts of bishop callaway when they retired to lonely places to pray were haunted by visionary lions and phantasms of enemies with assegais  they probably had never heard of st anthonys similar experiences nor again of the diabolical attacks on the converts of catholic missionaries in cochin china and in peru  probably the most recent period of general religious excitement in our country was that of the covenant in scotland  not a mere scattered congregation or two as in the rise of irvingism but a vast proportion of a whole people lived lives of prolonged ecstatic prayer and often neglected food for days  consequently devout covenanters retired in lonely places to pray were apt to be infested by spectral animals black dogs as a rule and they doubted not at all that the black dog was the accuser of the brethren  we have catholic evidence in father piattis life of father elphinstone s j to black dogs haunting thomas smeaton the friend of andrew melville 1580  but father piatti thinks that the dogs were avenging devils smeaton being an apostate ms life of elphinstone  again covenanters would see mysterious floods of light as the heathen also used but like the heathen they were not certain as to whether the light was produced by good or bad spirits  like poor bewildered porphyry many centuries earlier they found the spirits very deceitful  you never can depend on them  this is well illustrated by the rev mr robert law a covenanting minister but not a friend of fanaticism and sedition  in his memorialls a work not published till long after his death he gives this instance of the deceitfulness of sprites  the rev mr john shaw in ireland was much troubled by witches and by cats coming into his chamber and bed  he died so did his wife and as was supposed witched  before mr shaws death his groom in the stable saw a great heap of hay rolling toward him and then appeared the hay not the groom in the shape and lykness of a bair  he charges it to appear in human shape which it did  the appearance made a tryst to meet the groom but mr shaw forbade this tampering with evil in the lykness of a bair  however a stone was thrown at the groom which he took for a fresh invitation from the bair so he went to the place appointed  the divill appears in human shape with his heid running down with blood and explains that he is the spirit of a murdered man who lay under his bed and buried in the ground and who was murdered by such a man naming him by name  the groom very naturally dug in the spot pointed out by this versatile phantom but finds nothing of bones or anything lyke a grave and shortly after this man dyes having failed to discover that the person accused of murder had ever existed at all  many ghosts have a perfect craze for announcing that bodies or treasures are buried where there is nothing of the sort  glanvill has a tale of a ghost who accused himself of a murder and led a man to a place in a wood where the corpse of the slain was to be found there was no corpse the ghost was mad  the psychical society have published the narratives of a housemaid and a butler who saw a lady ghost  she later communicated through a table her intention to appear at eleven pm  the butler and two ladies saw her the gentlemen present did not  the ghost insisted that jewels were buried in the cellar the butler dug but found none  the writer is acquainted with another ghost not published who labours under morbid delusions  for reasons wholly unfounded on fact she gave a great deal of trouble to a positive stranger  now there was literally no sense in these proceedings  such is ghostly evidence ever deceitful  its not good says mr law to come in communing terms with satan there is a snare in the end of it yet people have actually been hanged in england on the evidence of a ghost  on the evidence of the devil some other persons were accused of theft in 1682  this is a remarkable instance we often hear of raising the ghostly foe but we are seldom told how it can be done  this is how it was done in february 1682 at the house of the hon robert montgomery in irvine  some objects of silver plate were stolen a maid was suspected she said she would raise the devil but she would know who the thief was  taking therefore a bible she went into a cellar where she drew a circle round her and turned a sieve on end twice from right to left  in her hand she held nine feathers from the tail of a black cock  she next read psalm li forwards and then backwards revelations ix 19  he then appeared dressed as a sailor with a blue cap  at each question she threw three feathers at him  finally he showed as a black man with a long tail  meanwhile all the dogs in irvine were barking as in greece when hecate stood by the crossways  the maid now came and told mrs montgomery on information received that the stolen plate was in the box of a certain servant where of course she had probably placed it herself  however the raiser of the devil was imprisoned for the spiritual offence  she had learned the rite at dr colvins house in ireland who used to practise this  the experiment may easily be repeated by the scientific  though mr law is strong in witches and magic he has very few ghost stories indeed according to his philosophy even a common wraith of a living person is really the devil in that disguise  the learned mr wodrow too for all his extreme pains cannot be called a very successful amateur of spectres  a mighty ghost hunter was the rev robert wodrow of eastwood in renfrewshire the learned historian of the sufferings of the kirk of scotland 16791734 mr wodrow was an industrious antiquarian a student of geology as it was then beginning to exist a correspondent for twenty years of cotton mather and a goodhearted kind man that would hurt nobody but a witch or a papist  he had no opportunity to injure members of either class but it is plain from his four large quarto volumes called analecta that he did not lack the will  in his analecta mr wodrow noted down all the news that reached him scandals about the pretender court gossip heresies of ministers remarkable providences woful apparitions and strange steps of providence ghosts second sight dreams omens premonitions visions did greatly delight him but it is fair to note that he does not vouch for all his marvels but merely jots them down as matters of hearsay  thus his pages are valuable to the student of superstition because they contain the clash of the country for about forty years and illustrate the rural or ecclesiastical aberglaube of our ancestors at the moment when witchcraft was ceasing to be a recognised criminal offence  a diary of wodrows exists dating from april 3 1697 when he was but nineteen years of age  on june 10 1697 he announces the execution of some witches at paisley  seven were burned among them one margaret lang who accused herself of horrible crimes  the victim of the witches burned in 1697 was a child of eleven daughter of john shaw of bargarran  this family was unlucky in its spiritual accidents  the previous laird as we learn from the contemporary law in his memorialls rode his horse into a river at night and did not arrive at the opposite bank  every effort was made to find his body in the stream which was searched as far as the sea  the corpse was at last discovered in a ditch two miles away shamefully mutilated  the money of the laird and other objects of value were still in his pockets  this was regarded as the work of fiends but there is a more plausible explanation  nobody but his groom saw the laird ride into the river the chances are that he was murdered in revengecertain circumstances point to thisand that the servant was obliged to keep the secret and invent the story about riding the ford  the daughter of bargarrans successor and heir was probably a hysterical child who was led by the prevailing superstition to believe that witches caused her malady  how keen the apprehensions were among children we learn from a document preserved by wodrow an eminent christian of his acquaintance thought in boyhood that an old woman looked crossly at him and he went in dread of being bewitched for a whole summer  the mere terror might have caused fits he would then have denounced the old woman and she would probably have been burned  charles kirkpatrick sharpe in his preface to laws memorialls p xcii says that miss shaw was antient in wickedness and thus accounts for her pretending to be bewitched by way of revenging herself on one of the maidservants twenty people were finally implicated several were executed and one killed himself  the child probably hysterical and certainly subject to convulsions was really less to blame than the absurd credulity of various otherwise worthy ministers and some topping professors in and about glasgow as sharpe quotes the ms treatise on witchcraft of the rev mr bell  strangely enough the great thread manufactories of renfrewshire owed their origin to this miss shaw aided by a friend who had acquired some technical secrets in holland  she married a minister in 1718 and probably her share in an abominable crime lay light on her conscience  her fellow sufferer from witchcraft a young sandilands son of lord torphichen 1720 became a naval officer of distinguished gallantry  wodrow does not appear to have witnessed the execution at paisley one of the last in scotland but he had no doubt that witches should be put to death  in 1720 when the son of lord torphichen exhibited some curious phenomena exaggerated by report into clairvoyance and flying in the air nobody was punished  in spite of his superstition in regard to witches wodrow september 20 1697 sensibly explains a deathwraith by the anxiety of the lady who beheld it  he also still in the diary records a case of second sight but that occurred in argyleshire  it will be found in fact that all the secondsighted people except some ministers during the sufferings and they reckoned as prophets were highlanders considering his avidity for ghoststories it is remarkable that he scarcely ever receives them at even second hand and that most of them are remote in point of time  on the other side he secures a few religious visions as of shining lights comforting devout ladies from the person concerned  his narratives fall into regular categories haunted houses ghosts wraiths second sight consolatory divine visions  thus mr stewarts uncle harry ane eminent christian and very joviall at a drinking party saw himself in bed and his coffin at his bedfoot  this may be explained as a case of the horrors a malady incident to the jovial  he died in a week in vino veritas  lord middletons ghoststory wodrow got from the son of a man who as lauderdales chaplain heard middleton tell it at dinner  he had made a covenant with the laird of babigni that the first who died should appear to the survivor  babigni was slain in battle middleton was put in the tower where babigni appeared to him sat with him for an hour by the clock and predicted the restoration his hand was hote and soft but middleton brave in the field was much alarmed  he had probably drunk a good deal in the tower  this anecdote was very widely rumoured  aubrey publishes a version of it in his miscellanies and law gives another in his memorialls p 162  he calls babignibarbigno and balbegno  according to law it was not the lairds ghost that appeared but the devil in his lykness  law and aubrey make the spirit depart after uttering a couplet which they quote variously  for a haunted house wodrow provides us with that of johnstone of mellantae in annandale 1707  the authority is mr cowan who had it from mr murray minister of st mungos who got it from mellantae himself the worthy gentleman weeping as he described his misfortunes  his daughter miss johnstone was milking a cow in the byre by daylight when she saw a tall man almost naked probably a tramp who frightened her into a swoon  the house was then troubled and disturbed by flights of stones and disappearance of objects  young dornock after a visit to mellantae came back with a story that loud knockings were heard on the beds and sounds of pewter vessels being thrown about though in the morning all were found in their places  the ghost used also to pull the medium miss johnstone by the foot and toss her bedclothes about  next at first hand from mr short we have a deathwraith beheld by him of his friend mr scrimgeour  the hour was five am on a summer morning and mr scrimgeour expired at that time in edinburgh  again we have the affair of mr blair of st andrews the probationer and the devil who in return for a written compact presented the probationer with an excellent sermon  on the petition of mr blair the compact fell from the roof of the church the tale is told by increase mather about a french protestant minister and as increase wrote twenty years before wodrow we may regard wodrows anecdote as a myth for the incident is of an unusual character and not likely to repeat itself  we may also set aside though vouched for by lord tullibardines butler ane litle old man with a fearful ougly face who appeared to the rev mr lesly  being asked whence he came he said from hell and being further interrogated as to why he came he observed  to warn the nation to repent  this struck mr lesly as improbable on the face of it however he was a good deal alarmed  lord orrery is well known in ghostly circles as the evidence for a gentlemans butler being levitated and floating about a room in his house  it may be less familiar that his lordships own ghost appeared to his sister  she consulted robert boyle frs who advised her if orrery appeared again to ask him some metaphysical questions  she did so and i know these questions come from my brother said the appearance  he is too curious  he admitted however that his body was an aerial body but declined to be explicit on other matters  this anecdote was told by mr smith who had it from mr wallace who had it from an english gentleman mr menzies minister of erskine once beheld the wraith of a friend smoking a pipe but the owner of the wraith did not die or do anything remarkable  to see a friendly wraith smoking a pipe even if he take the liberty of doing so in ones bedroom is not very illboding  to be sure mr menzies own father died not long after but the attempt to connect the wraith of a third person with that event is somewhat desperate  wodrow has a tame commonplace account of the bride of lammermoors affair  on the other hand he tells us concerning a daughter of lord stair the countess of dumfries that she was under a very odd kind of distemper and did frequently fly from one end of the room to the other and from the one side of the garden to the other     the matter of fact is certain  at a garden party this accomplishment would have been invaluable  we now for a change have a religious marvel  mrs zuil a very judiciouse christian had a friend of devout character  this lady being in bed and in a ravishing frame observed a pleasant light and one of the pleasantest forms like a young child standing on her shoulder  not being certain that she was not delirious she bade her nurse draw her curtains and bring her some posset  thrice the nurse came in with posset and thrice drew back in dread  the appearance then vanished and for the fourth time the nurse drew the curtains but on this occasion she presented the invalid with the posset  being asked why she had always withdrawn before she said she had seen like a boyn halo above her mistresss head and added it was her wraith and a signe she would dye  from this the lady was convinced that she was in no reverie  a similar halo shone round pious mr welsh when in meditation and also according to patrick walker round two of the sweet singers followers of meikle john gibb before they burned a bible  gibb a raving fanatic went to america where he was greatly admired by the red indians because of his much converse with the devil  the pious of wodrows date distrusted these luminous appearances as they might be angelical but might also be diabolical temptations to spiritual pride  thus the blasphemous followers of gibb were surrounded by a bright light no less than pious mr welsh a very distinguished presbyterian minister indeed this was taken advantage of by mr welshs enemies who says his biographer kirkton were so bold as to call him no less than a wizard  when mr shields and mr john dickson were imprisoned on the bass rock and mr shields was singing psalms in his cell mr dickson peeping in saw a figure all in white of whose presence mr shields was unconscious  he had only felt in a heavenly and elevated frame  a clairvoyant dream is recorded on the authority of dr clerk at london who writes on the trinity and may be depended on in such accounts  the doctors father was mayor of norwich or some other town and a lady came to him bidding him arrest a tailor for murdering his wife  the mayor was not unnaturally annoyed by this appeal but the lady persisted  she had dreamed twice  first she saw the beginning of the murder then the end of it  as she was talking to the mayor the tailor came in demanding a warrant to arrest his wifes murderers  he was promptly arrested tried and acquitted but later confessed and he was execut for the fact this is a highly improbable story and is capped by another from wodrows motherinlaw  a man was poisoned  later his nephew slept in his room and heard a voice cry avenge the blood of your uncle  this happened twice and led to an inquiry and the detection of the guilty  the nephew who received the warning was sir john clerk of penicuik ancestor of sir walter scotts friend  we next have a mahatmalike tale about cotton mather from mr stirling who had it from a person who had it from the doctors own mouth  briefly cotton lost his sermon as he was riding to a place where he had to preach  he prayed for better luck and no sooner was his prayer over but his papers wer conveyed to him flying in the air upon him when riding which was very surprizing  it was indeed  wodrow adds  mind to write to the doctor about this this letter if he ever wrote it is not in the three portly volumes of his correspondence  the occurrence is more remarkable than the mysterious dispensation which enabled another minister to compose a sermon in his sleep mr james guthrie at stirling had his house haunted by the devil which was a great exercise to worthy mr guthrie and indeed would have been a great exercise to almost any gentleman  details are wanting and as mr guthrie had now been hanged for sixty years 1723 the facts are remote  mr guthrie it seems was unpopular at stirling and was once mobbed there  the devil may have been his political opponent in disguise  mr john anderson is responsible for the story of a great light seen and a melodious sound heard over the house of a most singular christian of the old sort at the moment of her death  her name unluckily is uncertain  a case of telepathy we have at first hand from mrs luke  when in bed a horror of darknes came upon her about her daughter martha who was in edinburgh  sometimes she began to think that her daughter was dead or had run away with some person  she remained in this anxiety till six in the morning when the cloud lifted  it turned out that martha had been in some peril at sea but got safe into leith roads at six in the morning  a clairvoyant dream was also vouchsafed to dr pitcairn though a jacobite and a person of considerable sense as wodrow quaintly remarks about another individual  the doctor was at paris when a friend of his david surname unknown died in edinburgh  the doctor dreamed for several nights running that david came to him and that they tried to enter several taverns which were shut  david then went away in a ship  as the doctor was in the habit of frequenting taverns with david the dreams do not appear to deserve our serious consideration  to be sure david said he was dead  strange vouchsafments of providence to a person of the doctors temper and sense moralises wodrow  curiously enough a different version of dr pitcairns dream is in existence  several anecdotes about the doctor are prefixed in manuscript to a volume of his latin poems which was shown to dr hibbert by mr david laing the wellknown historian and antiquarian  dr hibbert says  the anecdotes are from some one obviously on terms of intimacy with pitcairn  according to this note robert lindsay a descendant of sir david lindsay of the mount was at college with the doctor  they made the covenant that whoever dyed first should give account of his condition if possible  this was in 1671 in 1675 lindsay died while pitcairn was in paris  on the night of lindsays death pitcairn dreamed that he was in edinburgh where lindsay met him and said archie perhaps ye heard im dead  no roben  the vision said he was to be buried in the grey friars and offered to carry pitcairn to a happy spiritual country in a well sailing small ship like odysseus  pitcairn said he must first see his parents  lindsay promised to call again  since which time a p never slept a night without dreaming that lindsay told him he was alive  and having a dangerous sickness anno 1694 he was told by roben that he was delayed for a time and that it was properly his task to carry him off but was discharged to tell when 300  dr hibbert thinks that pitcairn himself dictated this account much more marvellous than the form in which wodrow received the story  leaving a solitary jacobite vision for a true blue presbyterian experience we learn that wodrows own wedded wife had a pious vision a glorious inexpressible brightness  the thought which came presently was this perhaps may be satan transforming himself into an angel of light  it mout or it moutnt  in 1729 wodrow heard of the ghost of the laird of coul which used to ride one of his late tenants transformed into a spectral horse  a chapbook containing couls discourse with mr ogilby a minister was very popular in the last century  mr ogilby left an account in manuscript on which the chapbook was said to be based  another ghost of a very moral turn appeared and gave ministers information about a case of lawless love  this is said to be recorded in the registers of the presbytery of fordoun but wodrow is vague about the whole affair  we next come to a very good ghost of the old and now rather unfashionable sort  the authority is mr william brown who had it from the rev mr mercer of aberdalgie as what was generally belived as to dr rule principal at edinburgh  such is wodrows way his ideas of evidence are quite rudimentary  give him a ghost and he does not care for contemporary record or corroborative testimony  to come to the story  dr rule finding no room at an inn near carnie mount had a fire lit in a chamber of a large deserted house hard by  he went to bed leaving a bright fire burning when the room dore is opened and an apparition in shape of a country tradsman came in and opened the courtains without speaking a word  the doctor determined not to begin a conversation so the apparition lighted the candles brought them to the bedside and backed to the door  dr rule like old brer rabbit kept on asaying nothing  then the apparition took an effectuall way to raise the doctor  he caryed back the candles to the table and with the tongs took doun the kindled coals and laid them on the deal chamber floor  dr rule now thought it was time to rise and followed the appearance who carried the candles downstairs set them on the lowest step and vanished  dr rule then lifted the candles and went back to bed  next morning he went to the sheriff and told him there was murder in it  the sheriff said it might be so but even if so the crime was not recent as the house for thirty years had stood empty  the step was taken up and a dead body was found and bones to the conviction of all  the doctor then preached on these unusual events and an old man of eighty fell aweeping confessing that as a mason lad he had killed a companion and buried him in that spot while the house was being built  consequently the house though a new one was haunted from the first and was soon deserted  the narrator mr mercer had himself seen two ghosts of murdered boys frequently in dundee  he did not speak nor did they and as the rooms were comfortable he did not leave them  to have talked about the incident would only have been injurious to his landlady  the longer i live the more unexpected things i meet with and even among my own relations says mr wodrow with much simplicity  but he never met with a ghost nor even with any one who had met with a ghost except mr mercer  in the same age or earlier increase mather represents apparitions as uncommonly scarce in new england though diabolical possession and witchcraft were as familiar as influenza  it has been shown that in nearly forty years of earnest collecting mr wodrow did not find a single supernatural occurrence which was worth investigating by the curious  every tale was old or some simple natural cause was at the bottom of the mystery or the narrative rested on vague gossip or was a myth  today at any dinner party you may hear of bogles and wraiths at first or at second hand in an abundance which would have rejoiced wodrow  charles kirkpatrick sharpe vainly brags in laws memorialls that good sense and widely diffused information have driven our ghosts to a few remote castles in the north of scotland 1819  but however we are to explain it the ghosts have come forth again and like golf have crossed the tweed  now this is a queer result of science common sense cheap newspapers popular education and progress in general we may all confess to a belief in ghosts because we call them phantasmogenetic agencies and in as much of witchcraft as we style hypnotic suggestion  so great it seems is the force of language 303      the logic of tableturning   bias in

the existence of a new law which after all can apparently do little for the benefit of mankind and may conceivably do something by no means beneficial  again science is accustomed to deal with constant phenomena which given the conditions will always result  the phenomena of the marvellous are not constant or rather the conditions cannot be definitely ascertained  when mr crookes made certain experiments on homes power of causing a balance to move without contact he succeeded in the presence of some russian savants a similar experiment failed granting that mr crookess tests were accurate and the lay mind at least can see no flaw in them we must suppose that the personal conditions in the russian case were not the same  now an electric current will inevitably do its work if known and ascertained conditions are present a personal current so to speak depends on personal conditions which are unascertainable  it is inevitable that science accustomed to the invariable should turn away from phenomena which if they do occur seem so far to have a will of their own  that they have a will of their own is precisely their attraction for another class of minds which recognises in them the action of unknown intelligences  there are also people who so dislike our detention in the prison house of old unvarying laws that their bias is in favour of anything which may tend to prove that science in her contemporary mood is not infallible  as the frenchman did not care what sort of scheme he invested money in provided that it annoys the english so many persons do not care what they invest belief in provided that it irritates men of science  just as rationally some men of science denounce all investigation of the abnormal phenomena of which history and rumour are so full because the research may bring back distasteful beliefs and revive the ancestral tendency to superstition  yet the question is not whether the results of research may be dangerous but whether the phenomena occur  the speculations of copernicus of galileo of the geologists of mr darwin were dangerous and it does not appear that they have added to the sum of human delight  but men of science are still happiest when denouncing the obscurantism of those who opposed copernicus mr darwin and the rest in dread of the moral results  we owe the strugforlifeur of m daudet to mr darwin and mr alfred wallace and the strugforlifeur is as dangerous and disagreeable as the half crazy spiritualist  science is only concerned with truth not with the mischievous inferences which people may draw from truth  and yet certain friends of science quite naturally and normally fall back on the attitude of the opponents of copernicus  these things they say should not even be examined  such are the hostile and distracting influences the contending currents in the midst of which reason has to operate as well as she can  meanwhile every one of us probably supposes himself to be a model of pure reason and if people would only listen to him the measure of the universe  this happy and universal frame of mind is agreeably illustrated in a work by the late comte agenor de gasparin les tables tournantes deuxieme edition  levy paris 1888  the first edition is of 1854 and was published at a time of general excitement about tableturning and spiritrapping an excitement which only old people remember and which it is amazing to read about  modern spiritrapping of which tableturning is a branch began as we know in 184748  a family of methodists named fox entered in 1847 on the tenancy of a house in hydesville in the state of new york  the previous occupants had been disturbed by knocking this continued in the fox regime one of the little girls found that the raps would answer a discovery often made before a system of alphabetic communication was opened and spiritualism was launched 307  in march 1853 a packet of american newspapers reached bremen and as dr andree wrote to the gazette daugsbourg march 30 1853 all bremen took to experiments in turning tables  the practice spread like a new disease even men of science and academicians were puzzled it is a fact that at a breakfast party in macaulays rooms in the albany a long and heavy table became vivacious to macaulays disgust when the usual experiment was tried  men of science were in some cases puzzled in others believed that a new force must be recognised in others talked of unconscious pushing or of imposture  m babinet a member of the institute writing in the revue des deux mondes may 1854 explained the raps or percussive noises as the result of ventriloquism  a similar explanation was urged and withdrawn in the case of the cock lane ghost and it does not appear that m babinet produced a ventriloquist who could do the trick  raps may be counterfeited in many ways but hardly by ventriloquism  the raps were in europe a later phenomenon than the tableturning and aroused far more interest  the higher clergy investigated the matter and the bishop of mans in a charge set down the phenomena to the agency of some kind of spirits with whom christian men should have no commerce  granting the facts the bishop was undeniably right  there was published at that time a journal called la table parlante which contained recitals of phenomena correspondence and so forth among the narratives that of a m benezet was typical and is curious  in recent years about 187280 the rev mr stainton moses a clergyman and scholar of the best moral reputation believed himself to be the centre of extraordinary and practically incredible occurrences a belief shared by observers among his friends  m benezets narrative is full of precisely parallel details  m benezet lived at toulouse in 1853 and his experiences had for their scene his own house and that of his relations m and mme l  the affair began in tableturning and tabletilting  the tilts indicated the presence of spirits which answered questions right or wrong  under the hands of the ls the table became vivacious and chased a butterfly  then the spirit said it could appear as an old lady who was viewed by one of the children  the ls being alarmed gave up making experiments but one day at dinner thumps were struck on the table  m benezet was called in and heard the noises with awe  he went away but the knocks sounded under the chair of mme l she threw some holy water under the chair when her thumb was bitten and marks of teeth were left on it  presently her shoulder was bitten whether on a place which she could reach with her teeth or not we are not informed  raps went on the ls fled to m benezets house which was instantly disturbed in the same fashion  objects were spirited away and reappeared as oddly as they had vanished  packets of bonbons turned up unbeknown sailed about the room and suddenly fell on the table at dinner  the ls went back to their own house where their hats and boots contracted a habit of floating dreamily about in the air things were hurled at them practical jokes were played and in september these monstrous annoyances gradually ceased  the most obvious explanation is that mme l demoralised by turning tables took consciously or unconsciously to imitating the tricks of which history and legend are full  her modus operandi in some phenomena is difficult to conjecture  while opinion was agitated by these violent events and contending hypotheses while la table parlante took a catholic view and science a negative view m agenor de gasparin a protestant chose a via media  m de gasparin the husband of the wellknown author of the near and the heavenly horizons was a tableturner without being a spiritualist  his experiments were made in switzerland in 1853 he published a book on them as we said m figuier attacked it in les mysteres de la science after m de gasparins death and the widow of the author replied by republishing part of the original work  m de gasparin in the early empire was a liberal an antiradical an opponent of negro slavery a christian an energetic honest man absolu et ardent as he confesses  his purpose was to demonstrate that tables turn that the phenomenon is purely physical that it cannot be explained by the mechanical action of the muscles nor by that of spirits  his allies were his personal friends and it is pretty clear that two ladies were the chief agents  the process was conducted thus  a chain of eight or ten people surrounded a table lightly resting their fingers all in contact on its surface  it revolved and by request would raise one of its legs and tap the floor  all this of course can be explained either by cheating or by the unconscious pushes administered  if any one will place his hands on a light table he will find that the mere come and go of pulse and breath have a tendency to agitate the object  it moves a little accompanying it you unconsciously move it more  the experiment is curious because on some days the table will not budge on others it instantly sets up a peculiar gliding movement in which it almost seems to escape from the superimposed hands while the most wakeful attention cannot detect any conscious action of the muscles  if you try the opposite experiment namely conscious pushing of the most gradual kind you find that the exertion is very distinctly sensible  the author has made the following simple experiment  two persons for whom the table would not move laid their hands on it firmly and flatly  two others for whom it danced just touched the hands of the former pair  any pressure or push from the upper hands would be felt of course by the under hands  no such pressure was felt yet the table began to rotate  in another experiment with another subject the pressure was felt indeed the owner of the upper hands was conscious of pressing yet the table did not move  these experiments are physiologically curious but of course they demonstrate nothing  muscles can move the table muscles can apparently act without the consciousness of their owner therefore the movement is caused or may be irrefutably said to be caused by unconscious muscular action  m de gasparin of course was aware of all this he therefore aimed at producing movement without contact  in his early experiments the table was first set agoing by contact all hands were then lifted at a signal to half an inch above the table and still the table revolved  of course it will not do this if it is set agoing by conscious muscular action as any one may prove by trying  as it was possible that some one might still be touching the table and escaping in the crowd the notice of the observers outside the circle two ladies tried alone  the observer mr thury saw the daylight between their hands and the table which revolved four or five times  to make assurance doubly sure a thin coating of flour was scattered over the whole table and still it moved while the flour was unmarked  m de gasparin was therefore convinced that the phenomena of movement without mechanical agency were real  his experiments got rid of mr faradays theory of unconscious pressure and pushing because you cannot push with your muscles what you do not touch with any portion of your body and de gasparin had assured himself that there was no physical contact between his friends and this table  m de gasparin now turned upon dr carpenter to whom an article in the quarterly review dealing with the whole topic of abnormal occurrences was attributed  dr carpenter at this time had admitted the existence of the hypnotic state and the amenability of the hypnotised person to the wildest suggestions  he had also begun to develop his doctrine of unconscious cerebration that is the existence of mental processes beneath or apart from our consciousness 312  an ideational change may take place in the cerebrum  the sensorium is unreceptive so the idea does not reach consciousness  sometimes however the idea oozes out from the fingers through muscular action also unconscious  this moves the table to the appropriate tilts  these two ideas are capable if we admit them of explaining many singular psychological facts but they certainly do not explain the movements of tables which nobody is touching  in face of m de gasparins evidence which probably was not before him dr carpenter could only have denied the facts or alleged that the witnesses including observers outside the chaine or circle were all selfhypnotised all under the influence of selfsuggestion and all honestly asserting the occurrence of events which did not occur  his essay touched but lightly on this particular marvel  he remarked that the turning of tables and the supposed communications of spirits through their agency are due to the mental state of the performers themselves  now m de gasparin in his via media repudiated spirits energetically  dr carpenter then explained witchcraft and the vagaries of campmeetings by the dominant idea  but m de gasparin could reply that persons whose dominant idea was incredulity attested many singular occurrences  at the end of his article dr carpenter decides that tableturners push unconsciously as they assuredly do but they cannot push when not in contact with the object  the doctor did not allege that tableturners are biologised as he calls it and under a glamour  but m de gasparin averred that no single example of trance rigidity loss of ordinary consciousness or other morbid symptoms had ever occurred in his experiments  there is thus as it were no common ground on which he and dr carpenter can meet and fight  he dissected the doctors rather inconsequent argument with a good deal of acuteness and wit  m de gasparin then exhibited some of the besetting sins of all who indulge in argument  he accepted all his own private phenomena but none of those such as raps and so forth for which other people were vouching  things must occur as he had seen them and not otherwise  what he had seen was a chaine of people surrounding a table all in contact with the table and with each other  the table had moved and had answered questions by knocking the floor with its foot  it had also moved when the hands were held close to it but not in contact with it  nothing beyond that was orthodox as nothing beyond hypnotism and unconscious cerebration was orthodox with dr carpenter  moreover m de gasparin had his own physical explanation of the phenomena  there is in mans constitution a fluid which can be concentrated by his will and which then given a table and a chaine will produce m de gasparins phenomena  but no more  he knows that fluids are going out of fashion in science and he is ready to call the fluid the force or agency or condition of matter or what you please  substances forces vibrations let it be what you choose as long as it is something  the objection that the phenomena are of no use was made and is still very common but of course is in no case scientifically valid  electricity was of no use once and the most useless phenomenon is none the less worthy of examination  m de gasparin now examines another class of objections  first the phenomena were denied next they were said to be as old as history and familiar to the greeks  we elsewhere show that this is quite true that the movement of objects without contact was as familiar to the greeks as to the peruvians the thibetans the eskimo and in modern stories of haunted houses  but as will presently appear these wilder facts would by no means coalesce with the hypothesis of m de gasparin  to his mind tables turn but they turn by virtue of the will of a circle consciously exerted through the means of some physical force fluid or what not produced by the imposition of hands  now these processes do not characterise the phenomena among greeks thibetans eskimo peruvians in haunted houses or in presence of the late mr homegranting the facts as alleged  in these instances nobody is circling round a chair a bed or what not yet the chair or bed moves as in the story of monsieur s at st maur 1706 and in countless other examples  all this would not as we shall see be convenient for the theory of m de gasparin  his line of argument is that the greek and latin texts are misunderstood but that if the greeks did turn tables that is no proof that tables do not turn but rather the reverse  a favourite text is taken from ammianus marcellinus lib xxix ch i  m de gasparin does not appear to have read the passage carefully  about 371 ad one hilarius was tortured on a charge of magical operations against the emperor valens  he confessed  a little table made of delphic laurel was produced in court  we made it he said that confounded little table under strange rites and imprecations and we set it in movement thus  it was placed in a room charged with perfumes above a round plate fashioned of various metals  the edge of the plate was marked with the letters of the alphabet separated by certain spaces  a priest linen clad bowed himself over the table balancing a ring tied to a thin thread  the ring bounding from letter to letter picks out letters forming hexameters like those of delphi  this is confusing  probably the movements of the table communicated to the thread caused the bounds of the ring otherwise there was no use in the table moving  at all events the ring touched theo which is not a word that could begin a hexameter when they asked who was to succeed valens  some one called out theodore and they pursued the experiment no farther  a number of theodores and theophiles were put to death but when theodosius was joined with gratian in the empire the believers held that the table had been well inspired  here there was no chaine or circle the table is not said to lever le pied legerement as the song advises therefore m de gasparin rules the case out of court  the object however really was analogous to planchette ouija and other modern modes of automatic divination  the experiment of hilarius with the confounded little table led to a massacre of neoplatonists martyrs of psychical research  in hilariuss confession we omit a set of ritual invocations as unessential as the mystic rites used by savages in making curari  the spiritus percutiens rapping spirit  conjured away by old catholic formulae at the benediction of churches was brought forward by some of m de gasparins critics  as his tables did not rap he had nothing to do with the spiritus percutiens who proves however that the church was acquainted with raps and explained them by the spiritualistic hypothesis 317  a text in tertullians apologetic was also cited  here tabulae and capae tables and shegoats are said to divine  what have she goats to do in the matter  de morgan wished to read tabulae et crepae which he construes tables and raps but he only finds crepae in festus who says that goats are called crepae quod cruribus crepent because they rattle with their legs  de morgans guess is ingenious but lacks confirmation  we are not so far aware of communication with spirits by raps before 856 ad  finally m de gasparin denies that his researches are superstitious  will can move my limbs if it also moves my table what is there superstitious in that  it is a new fact that is all tout est si materiel si physique dans les experiences des tables it was not so at toulouse  meanwhile m de gasparin firm in his trewththe need of a chaine of persons the physical origin of the phenomena the entire absence of spiritswas so unlucky when he dealt with spirits as to drop into the very line of argument which he had been denouncing  spirits are superstitiouswell his adversaries had found superstition in his own experiments and beliefs  to believe that spirits are engaged is to reduce our relations with the invisible world to the grossest definition  but why not as we know nothing about our relations with the invisible world  the theology of the spirits is contrary to scripture very well your tales of tables moved without contact are contrary to science  no spiritualistic story has ever been told which is not to be classed among the phenomena of animal magnetism      this of course is a mere example of a statement made without examination a sin alleged by m de gasparin against his opponents  vast numbers of such stories not explicable by the now rejected theory of animal magnetism have certainly been told  in another volume m de gasparin demolished the tales but he was only at the beginning of his subject  the historical and anthropological evidence for the movement of objects without contact not under his conditions is very vast in bulk  the modern experiments are sometimes more scientific than his own and the evidence for the most startling events of all kinds is quite as good as that on which he relies for his prodigies themselves sufficiently startling  his hypothesis at all events of will directing a force or fluid by no means explains phenomena quite as well provided with evidence as his own  so m de gasparin disposes of the rival miracles as the result of chance imposture or hallucination the very weapons of his scientific adversaries  his own prodigies he has seen and is satisfied  his opponents say you cannot register your force sur linclinaison dune aiguille he could not but home could do so to the satisfaction of a scientific expert and probably m de gasparin would have believed it if he had seen it  m de gasparin is horrified at the idea of trespassing on the territory of acts beyond our power  but if it were possible to do the miracles of home it would be possible because it is not beyond our power  the spiritualistic opinion is opposed to the doctrine of the resurrection  it merely announces the immortality of the soul  but that has nothing to do with the matter in hand  the theology of spirits of course is neither here nor there  a spirit will say anything or everything  but mr c c massey when he saw a chair move at a word and even without one in the presence of such a doubledyed impostor as slade had as much right to believe his own eyes as m de gasparin and what he saw does not square with m de gasparins private trewth  the chair in mr masseys experience was unattached to a piece of string it fell and at request jumped up again and approached mr massey just as if some one had picked it up in order to take a seat beside me 319a  such were the idola specus the private personal prepossessions of m de gasparin undeniably an honourable man  now in 1877 his old adversary dr carpenter cb md lld frs fgs vpls corresponding member of the institute of france tout ce quil y a de plus officiel de plus decore returned to the charge he published a work on mesmerism spiritualism etc 319b  perhaps the unscientific reader supposes that dr carpenter replied to the arguments of m de gasparin  this would have been sportsmanlike but no dr carpenter firmly ignored them  he devoted three pages to tableturning pp 96 97 98  he exhibited mr faradays little machine for detecting muscular pressure a machine which would also detect pressure which is not muscular  he explained answers given by tilts answers not consciously known to the operators as the results of unconscious cerebration  people may thus get answers which they do expect or answers which they do not expect as may happen  but not one word did dr carpenter say to a popular audience at the london institution about m de gasparins assertion and the assertion of m de gasparins witnesses that motion had been observed without any contact at all  he might if he pleased have alleged that m de gasparin and the others fabled or that they were selfhypnotised or were cheated but he absolutely ignored the evidence altogether  now this behaviour if scientific was hardly quite sportsmanlike to use a simple british phrase which does credit to our language and national character  mr alfred wallace stated a similar conclusion as to dr carpenters method of argument in language of some strength  dr carpenter he said habitually gives only one side of the question and completely ignores all facts which tell against his theory 320  without going so far as mr wallace and alleging that what dr carpenter did in the case of m de gasparin he did habitually we may briefly examine some portions of his book which perhaps leave something to be desired  it is written with much acuteness with considerable fairness and is certainly calculated to convince any reader who has not been perplexed by circumstances on which dr carpenter throws little light  our own chief perplexity is the continuity and uniformity of the historical and anthropological evidence for certain marvels  we have already shown the difficulty of attributing this harmony of evidence first to savage modes of thought and then to their survival and revival  the evidence in full civilisation ancient and modern of educated and even sceptical witnesses to phenomena which are usually grotesque but are always the same everywhere in every age and land and the constant attendance of these phenomena on persons of a peculiar temperament are our stumblingblocks on the path to absolute negation  epilepsy convulsions hysterical diseases are startling affairs we admit  it was natural that savages and the ignorant should attribute them to diabolical possession and then look out for and invent manifestations of the diabolical energy outside the body of the patient say in movements of objects knocks and so forth  as in these maladies the patient may be subject to hallucinations it was natural that savages or ignorant men or polytheists or ardent catholics or excitable covenanters should regard these hallucinations as lucid or clairvoyant  a few lucky coincidences would establish this opinion among such observers as we have indicated while failures of lucidity would not be counted  the professional epileptic medicine man moreover would strengthen his case by prophesying on velvet like norna of the fitful head on private and early information imposture would imitate the spiritual feats of raps physical movements of objects and luminous forms  all this would continue after savagery after paganism after popery among the peasants who were for so long and in superstition are even now a conservative class  all that expectancy hysterics the dominant idea and rude hypnotism the sleep of the shadow could do would be done as witch trials show  all these elements in folklore magic and belief would endure in the peasant class under the veneer of civilisation  now and again these elements of superstition would break through the veneer would come to the surface among the educated classes and would carry silly women captive and silly men  they too though born in the educated class would attest impossible occurrences  in all this we might only see survival wonderfully vivacious and revival astonishingly close to the ancient savage lines  we are unable to state the case for survival and revival more strenuously and the hypothesis is most attractive  this hypothesis appears to be dr carpenters though he does not in the limits of popular lectures unfold it at any length  after stating p 1 that a continuous belief in occult agencies has existed he adds  while this very continuity is maintained by some to be an evidence of the real existence of such occult agencies it will be my purpose to show you that it proves nothing more than the widespread diffusion alike amongst minds of the highest and lowest culture of certain tendencies to thought which have either created ideal marvels possessing no foundation whatever in fact or have by exaggeration and distortion invested with a preternatural character occurrences which are perfectly capable of a natural explanation  here dr carpenter does not attempt to show cause why the manifestations are always the same for example why spirits rap in the australian bush among blacks not influenced by modern spiritualism  why tables moved untouched in thibet and india long before tableturning was heard of in modern europe  we have filled up the lacuna in the doctors argument by suggesting that the phenomena which are not such as a civilised taste would desire were invented by savages and handed on in an unbroken catena a chain of tradition  but in following dr carpenter we are brought up short at one of our old obstacles we trip on one of our old stumblingblocks granting that an epileptic patient made strange bounds and springs we can conceive savages going farther in fancy and averring that he flew or was levitated or miraculously transported through space let this become matter of traditional belief as a thing possible in epilepsy ie in diabolical or angelical possession  add the honest but hallucinatory persuasion of the patient that he was so levitated and let him be a person of honour and of sanctity say st theresa st francis or st joseph of cupertino  granting the survival of a savage exaggeration granting the hallucinated saint we may perhaps explain the innumerable anecdotes about miraculous levitation of which a few are repeated in our paper on comparative psychical research  the witnesses in witch trials and in ecclesiastical inquiries and lord orrery and mr greatrakes and the cromwellian soldiery in scotland the spanish in peru cotton mather in new england saw what they expected to see what tradition taught them to look for in the case of a convulsionary or a saint or a catechumen  the consensus in illusion was wonderful but let us grant for the sake of argument that it was possible  let us add another example from cochin china  the witness and narrator is delacourt a french missionary  the source is a letter of his of november 25 1738 to winslow the anatomist membre de lacademie des sciences a paris  it is printed in the institutiones theologicae of collet who attests the probity of the missionary 324  in may or june 1733 delacourt was asked to view a young native christian said by his friends to be possessed  rather incredulous as he says delacourt went to the lad who had communicated as he believed unworthily and was therefore a prey to religious excitement which as bishop callaway found among his zulu converts and as wodrow attests among savoury christians begets precisely such hallucinations as annoyed the early hermits like st anthony  delacourt addressed the youth in latin  he replied ego nescio loqui latine a tag which he might easily have picked up let us say  delacourt led him into church where the patient was violently convulsed  delacourt then remembering the example set by the bishop of tilopolis ordered the demon in latin to carry the boy to the ceiling  his body became stiff he was dragged from the middle of the church to a pillar and there his feet joined his back fixed colle against the pillar he was transported in the twinkling of an eye to the ceiling like a weight rapidly drawn up without any apparent action on his part  i kept him in the air for half an hour and then bade him drop without hurting himself when he fell like a packet of dirty linen while he was up aloft delacourt preached at him in latin and he became perhaps the best christian in cochin china  dr carpenters explanation must either be that delacourt lied or that a tradition surviving from savagery and enforced by the example of the bishop of tilopolis made a missionary un peu incredule as he says believe that he saw and watched for half an hour a phenomenon which he never saw at all  but then dr carpenter also dismisses with none but the general theory already quoted the experience of a nobleman of high scientific attainments who seriously assures us that he saw home sail in the air by moonlight out of one window and in at another at the height of seventy feet from the ground 326  here is the stumblingblock  a nobleman of high scientific attainment in company with another nobleman and a captain in the army all vouched for this performance of home  now could the savage tradition which attributes flight to convulsive and entranced persons exercise such an influence on these three educated modern witnesses could an old piece of folklore in company with expectancy so wildly delude them  can high scientific attainments leave their possessor with such humble powers of observation  but to be sure dr carpenter does not tell his readers that there were three witnesses  dr carpenter says that if we believe lord crawford and his friends we can have no reason for refusing credit to the historical evidence of the demoniacal elevation of simon magus  let us point out that we have no contemporary evidence at all about simons feat while for homes we have the evidence of three living and honourable men whom dr carpenter might have crossexamined  the doings of home and of simon were parallel but nothing can be more different than the nature of the evidence for what they are said to have done this perhaps might have been patent to a man like dr carpenter of early scientific training  but he illustrated his own doctrine of the dominant idea he did not see that he was guilty of a fallacy because his idea dominated him  stumbling into as deep a gulf dr carpenter put lord crawfords evidence he omitted that of his friends on a level with or below the depositions of witnesses as to the aerial transport of witches to attend their demoniacal festivities  but who ever swore that he saw witches so transported  the evidence was not to witnessed facts but only to a current belief backed by confessions under torture  no testimony could be less on a par with that of a living nobleman of high scientific attainments to his own experience  in three pages dr carpenter has shown that early scientific training in physiology and pathology does not necessarily enable its possessor to state a case fully  nor does it prompt him to discriminate between rumours coming a hundred and fifty years after the date of the alleged occurrences from a remote credulous and unscientific age  and the statements of witnesses all living all honourable and in one case of high scientific attainments 327  it is this solemn belief in his own infallibility as a judge of evidence combined with his almost incredible ignorance of what evidence is that makes dr carpenter such an amusing controversialist  if any piece of fact is to be proved it is plain that the concurrent testimony of three living and honourable men is worth more than a bit of gossip which after filtering through a century or two is reported by an early christian father  in matters wholly marvellous like homes flight in the air the evidence of three living and honourable men need not of course convince us of the fact  but this evidence is in itself a fact to be consideredwhy do these gentlemen tell this tale we ask but dr carpenter puts the testimony on the level of patristic tattle many centuries old written down on no authority long after the event  yet the worthy doctor calmly talks about want of scientific culture preventing people from appreciating the force of scientific reasoning and that after giving such examples of scientific reasoning as we have examined 328  it is in this way that science makes herself disliked  by aid of ordinary intelligence and of an ordinary classical education every one however uncultivated in science can satisfy himself that dr carpenter argued at random  yet we do not assert that early scientific training prevents people from understanding the nature of evidence  dr carpenter had the training but he was impetuous and under a dominant idea so he blundered along  dr carpenter frequently invoked for the explanation of marvels a cause which is vera causa expectancy  the expectation of a certain result is often enough to produce it p 12  this he proves by cases of hypnotised patients who did or suffered what they expected to be ordered to suffer or do though no such order was really given to them  again p 40 he urges that imaginative people who sit for a couple of hours especially if in the dark believing or hoping to see a human body or a table rise in the air probably pass into a state which is neither sleeping nor waking but between the two in which they see hear or feel by touch anything they have been led to expect will present itself  this is indeed highly probable  but we must suppose that all present fall into this ambiguous state described of old by porphyry  one waking spectator who sees nothing would make the statements of the others even more worthless than usual  and it is certain that it is not even pretended that all always see the same phenomena  one saw an arm and one a hand and one the waving of a gown in that seance at branxholme where only william of deloraine beheld all  and knew but how it mattered not it was the wizard michael scott 329  granting the ambiguous state granting darkness and expectancy anything may seem to happen  but dr carpenter wholly omits such cases as that of mr hamilton aide and of m alphonse karr  both were absolutely sceptical  both disliked home very much and thought him an underbred yankee quack and charlatan  both were in the expectancy of seeing no marvels were under the dominant idea that nothing unusual would occur  both in a brilliantly lighted room of a villa near nice saw a chair make a rush from the wall into the middle of the room and saw a very large and heavy table untouched rise majestically in the air  m karr at once got under the table and hunted vainly for mechanical appliances then he and mr aide went home disconcerted and in very bad humour  how do expectancy and the dominant idea explain this experience which mr aide has published in the nineteenth century the expectancy and dominant ideas of these gentlemen should have made them see the table and chair sit tight while believers observed them in active motion  again how could mr crookess lack of a special training in the bodily and mental constitution abnormal as well as normal of mediums affect his power of observing whether a plank of wood did or did not move to a certain extent untouched or slightly touched and whether the difference of position was or was not registered mechanically p 70  it was a pure matter of skilled and trained observation in mechanics  dr huggins was also present at this experiment in a mode of motion him dr carpenter gracefully discredited as an amateur without a broad basis of general scientific culture  he had devoted himself to a branch of research which tasks the keenest powers of observation  now it was precisely powers of observation that were required  there are moral sources of error of which a mere observer like dr huggins would be unaware  and one of the most potent of these is a proclivity to believe in the reality of spiritual communications particularly dangerous in a case where spiritual communications were not in question  the question was did an indicator move or not under a certain amount of pressure indiscreetly enough to be sure the pressure was attributed to psychic force and perhaps that was what dr carpenter had in his mind when he warned dr huggins against the proclivity to believe in the reality of spiritual communications  about a wilderness of other phenomena attested by scores of sane people from lord crawford to mr s c hall dr carpenter left himself no time to speak p 105  this was convenient but the lack of time prevented dr carpenter from removing our stumbling block the one obstacle which keeps us from adopting with no shadow of doubt the theory that explains all the marvels by the survival and revival of savage delusions  dr carpenters hypothesis of expectancy of a dominant idea acting on believers in an ambiguous state and in the dark can do much but it cannot account for the experience of wideawake sceptics under the opposite dominant idea in a brilliant light  dr carpenter exposed and exploded a quantity of mesmeric spiritualistic myths narrated by dr gregory by miss martineau and by less respectable if equally gullible authorities  but speaking merely as perplexed and unconvinced students of argument and evidence we cannot say that he removed the difficulties which have been illustrated and described  tableturning after what is called a boom in 185360 is now an abandoned amusement  it is deserted like croquet and it is even less to be regretted  but its existence enabled disputants to illustrate the ordinary processes of reasoning each making assertions up to the limit of his personal experience each attacking as superstitious all who had seen or fancied they had seen more than himself and each fighting gallantly for his own explanatory hypothesis which never did explain any phenomena beyond those attested by his own senses  the others were declared not to exist or to be the result of imposture and malobservationand perhaps they were  the truly diverting thing is that home did not believe in the other mediums nor in anything in the way of a marvel such as matter passing through matter which he had not seen with his own eyes whether homes incredulity should be reckoned as a proof of his belief in his own powers might be argued either way     the ghost theory of the origin of religion   evolutionary theory of the origin of religion  facts misunderstood suggest ghosts which develop into gods  this process lies behind history and experience  difficulties of the theory  the theory of lucretius  objections mr tylers theory  the question of abnormal facts not discussed by mr tylor  possibility that such psychical facts are real and are elements in development of savage religion the evidence for psychical phenomena compared with that which in other matters satisfies anthropologists  examples  conclusion  among the many hypotheses as to the origin of religion that which we may call the evolutionary or anthropological is most congenial to modern habits of thought  the old belief in a sudden miraculous revelation is commonly rejected though in one sense religion was none the less revealed even if man was obliged to work his way to the conception of deity by degrees  to attain that conception was the necessary result of mans reflection on the sum of his relations to the universe  the attainment however of the monotheistic idea is not now generally regarded as immediate and instinctive  a slow advance a prolonged evolution was required whether we accept mr max mullers theory of the sense of the infinite or whether we prefer the anthropological hypothesis  the latter scheme with various modifications is the scheme of epicurus lucretius hume mr tylor and mr herbert spencer  man half consciously transferred his implicit sense that he was a living and rational being to nature in general and recognised that earth sky wind clouds trees the lower animals and so on were persons like himself persons perhaps more powerful and awful than himself  this transference of personality can scarcely be called the result of a conscious process of reasoning  man might recognise personality everywhere without much more thought or argument than a kitten exerts when it takes a cork or a ball for a living playmate   but consciousness must have reached a more explicit stage when man began to ask himself what a person is what life is and when he arrived at the conclusion that life is a spirit  to advance from that conclusion to explain all life as the manifestation of indwelling spirits then to withdraw the conception of life and personality from inanimate things to select from among spirits one more powerful than the rest to recognise that one as disembodied as superior then as supreme then as unique and so to attain the monotheistic conception has been according to the evolutionary hypothesis the tendency of human thought  unluckily we cannot study the process in its course of action perhaps there is no savage race so lowly endowed that it does not possess in addition to a world of spirits something that answers to the conception of god  whether that is so or not is a question of evidence  we have often been told that this or the other people has no religious ideas at all  but later we hear that they do possess a belief in spirits and very often better information proves that in one stage or other of advance or degradation the theistic conception of a maker and judge of the world is also present  meanwhile even civilised and monotheistic peoples also admit the existence of a world of spirits of the dead of demons as in platonism of saints as in catholicism of devils of angels or of subordinate deities  thus the elements of religion are universally distributed in all degrees of culture though one element is more conspicuous in one place or mood another more conspicuous in another  in one mood the savage or the civilised man may be called monotheistic in another mood atheistic in a third practically polytheistic  only a few men anywhere and they only when consciously engaged in speculation assume a really definite and exclusive mental attitude on the subject  the orthodox monotheistic mussulman has his afreets and djinns the jew or the christian has his angels the catholic has his saints the platonist has his demons superstition has its ghosts  the question is whether all these spiritual beings are only ghosts raised to higher powers  or in the case of deity to the highest conceivable power while even when this last process has been accomplished we ask whether other ghosts on lower grades continue to be recognised  meanwhile the whole anthropological hypothesis whether valid or invalid lies behind history behind the experience of even the most backward races at present extant  if it be urged as by hume that the conception of a supreme deity is only a reflection of kingship in human society we must observe that some monarchical races like the aztecs seem to have possessed no recognised monarchical zeus while something very like the monotheistic conception is found among races so remote from the monarchical state of society as to have no obvious distinctions of rank like the australian blacks  moreover the evidence on such difficult points is obscure and fluctuating and capable of various interpretation  even among the most backward peoples the traceable shadow of a monotheistic idea often seems to bear marks of degradation and disuse rather than of nascent development  there is a god but he is neglected and tribal spirits receive prayer and sacrifice  just as in art there is a point where we find it difficult to decide whether an object is decadent or archaic so it is in the study of religious conceptions  these are a few among the inevitable difficulties and obscurities which haunt the anthropological or evolutionary theory of the origin of religion  other difficulties meet us at the very beginning  the theory regards gods as merely ghosts or spirits raised to a higher or to the highest power  mankind according to the system was inevitably led by the action of reason upon apparent facts to endow all things from humanity itself to earth sky rain sea fire with conscious personality life spirit and these attributes were as gradually withdrawn again under stress of better knowledge till only man was left with a soul and only the universe was left with a god  the last scientific step then it may be inferred is to deprive the universe of a god and mankind of souls  this step may be naturally taken by those who conceive that the whole process of ghost and godmaking is based on a mere set of natural and inevitable fallacies and who decline to recognise that these progressive fallacies if fallacies they are may be steps on a divinely appointed road towards truth that he led us by a way that we knew not and a path we did not understand  yet of course it is plain that a conclusion may be correct although it was reached by erroneous processes  all scientific verities have been attained in this manner by a gradual modification and improvement of inadequate working hypotheses by the slow substitution of correctness for error  thus monotheism and the doctrine of the soul may be in no worse case than the copernican theory or the theory of the circulation of the blood or the darwinian theory itself the successor of innumerable savage guesses conjectures of empedocles ideas of cuvier of the elder darwin of lamarck and of chambers  at present of course the theistic hypothesis and the hypothesis of a soul do not admit of scientific verification  the difficulty is to demonstrate that mind may exist and work apart from matter  but it may conceivably become verifiable that the relations of mind and matter are at all events less obviously and immediately interdependent that will and judgment are less closely and exclusively attached to physical organisms than modern science has believed  now according to the anthropological theory of the origin of religion it was precisely from the opposite of the scientific beliefit was from the belief that consciousness and will may be exerted apart from at a distance from the physical organismthat the savage fallacies began which ended ex hypothesi in monotheism and in the doctrine of the soul  the savage it is said started from normal facts which he misinterpreted  but suppose he started not from normal facts alone but also from abnormal factsfrom facts which science does not yet recognise at allthen it is possible that the conclusions of the savage though far too sweeping and in parts undeniably erroneous are yet to a certain extent not mistaken  he may have had a sane spot in his mind and a sane impulse may have led him into the right direction  man may have faculties which savages recognise and which physical science does not recognise  man may be surrounded by agencies which savages exaggerate and which science disregards altogether and these faculties and agencies may point to an element of truth which is often cast aside as a survival of superstition as the afterimage of an illusion  the lowest known stage and according to the evolutionary hypothesis the earliest stage in religion is the belief in the ghosts of the dead and in no other spiritual entities  whether this belief anywhere exists alone and untempered by higher creeds is another question  these ghosts are fed propitiated receive worship and to put it briefly the fittest ghosts survive and become gods  meanwhile the conception of ghosts of the dead is more or less consciously extended so that spirits who never were incarnate as men become credible beings  they may inform inanimate objects trees rivers fire clouds earth sky the great natural departments and thence polytheism results  there are political processes the consolidation of a state for example which help to blend these gods of various different origins into a divine consistory  one of these gods it may be of sky or air becomes king and reflection may gradually come to recognise him not only as supreme but as theoretically unique and thus zeus from a very limited monarchy may rise to solitary allfatherhood  yet zeus may originally have been only the ghost of a dead medicineman who was called sky or he may have been the departmental spirit who presided over the sky or he may have been sky conceived of as a personality or these different elements may have been mingled in zeus  but the whole conception of spirit in any case was derived it is argued from the conception of ghosts and that conception may be traced to erroneous savage interpretations of natural and normal facts  if all this be valid the idea of god is derived from a savage fallacy though of course it does not follow that an idea is erroneous because it was attained by mistaken processes and from false premises  that however is the inference which many minds are inclined to draw from the evolutionary hypothesis  but if the facts on which the savage reasoned are some of them rare abnormal and not scientifically accepted if in short they are facts demonstrative of unrecognised human faculties if these faculties raise a presumption that will mind and organism are less closely interdependent than science supposes then the savage reasoning may contain an important element of rejected truth  it may even seem at least conceivable that certain factors in the conception of spirit were not necessarily evolved as the anthropological hypothesis conceives them to have been  science had scarcely begun her secular conflict with religion when she discovered that the battle must be fought on haunted ground on the field of the ghosts of the dead  there are no gods or only dei otiosi careless indolent deities  there is nothing conscious that survives death no soul that can exist apart from the fleshly body  such were the doctrines of epicurus and lucretius but to these human nature opposed facts we see people said men long dead in our dreams or even when awake  the homeric achilles beholding patroclus in a dream instantly infers that there verily is a shadow an eidolon a shadowy consciousness shadowy presence which outlasts the death of the body  to this epicurus and lucretius reply that the belief is caused by fallacious inferences from facts these facts appearances beheld in sleep or vision these spectral faces of the long dead are caused by films peeled off from the surface of objects which fly to and fro through the air and do likewise frighten our minds when they present themselves to us awake as well as in sleep what time we behold strange shapes and idols of the lightbereaved lucretius expressly advances this doctrine of films an application of the democritean theory of perception that we may not believe that souls break loose from acheron or that shades fly about among the living or that any part of us is left behind after death 341a believers in ghosts must have replied that they do not see in sleep or awake films representing a mouldering corpse as they ought to do on the lucretian hypothesis but the image or idolon of a living face  plutarch says that if philosophers may laugh these long enduring films from a body perhaps many ages deep in dust are laughable 341b  however lucretius is so wedded to his films that he explains a purely fanciful being like a centaur by a fortuitous combination of the film of a man with the film of a horse  a ghost then is to the mind of lucretius merely a casual persistent film of a dead man composed of atoms very light which can fly at inconceivable speed and are not arrested by material obstacles  by parity of reasoning no doubt if pythagoras is seen at the same moment in thurii and metapontum only a film of him is beheld at one of these two places  the democritean theory of ordinary perception thus becomes the lucretian theory of dreams and ghosts  not that lucretius denies the existence of a rational soul in living men 341c a portion of it may even leave the body during sleep and only a spark may be left in the embers of the physical organism  if even that spark withdraws death follows and the soul no longer warmly housed in the body ceases to exist  for the film ghost is not the soul and the soul is not the film whereas savage philosophy identifies the soul with the ghost  even lucretius retains the savage conception of the soul as a thing of rarer matter a thing partly separable from the body but that thing is resolved for ever into its elements on the death of the body his imaginary film on the other hand may apparently endure for ages  the lucretian theory had for lucretius the advantages of being physical and of dealing a blow at the hated doctrine of a future life  for the public it had the disadvantages of being incapable of proof of not explaining the facts as conceived to exist and of being highly ridiculous as plutarch observed  much later philosophers explained all apparitions as impressions of sense recorded on the brain and so actively revived that they seemed to have an objective existence  one or two stock cases nicolais and mrs as in which people in a morbid condition saw hallucinations which they knew to be hallucinations did and do a great deal of duty  mr sully has them as hibbert and brewster have them engaged as protagonists  collective hallucinations and the hallucinations of the sane which coincide with the death or other crisis in the experience of the person who seemed to be seen were set down to imagination expectant attention imposture mistaken identity and so forth  without dwelling on the causes physical or psychological which have been said by frazer of tiree 1707 ferrier hibbert scott and others to account for the hallucinations of the sane for ghosts mr tylor has ably erected his theory of animism or the belief in spirits  thinking savages he says were deeply impressed by two groups of biological phenomena by the facts of living dying sleep trance waking and disease  they asked what is the difference between a living body and a dead one  they wanted to know the causes of sleep trance and death  they were also concerned to explain the appearances of dead or absent human beings in dreams and waking visions  now it was plain that life could go away as it does in death or seems to do in dreamless sleep  again a phantasm of a living man can go away and appear to waking or sleeping people at a distance  the conclusion was reached by savages that the phantasm which thus appears is identical with the life which goes away in sleep or trance  sometimes it returns when the man wakes or escapes from his trance  sometimes it stays away he dies his body corrupts but the phantasm endures and is occasionally seen in sleeping or waking vision  the general result of savage thought is that mans life must be conceived as a personal and rational entity called his soul while it remains in his body his wraith when it is beheld at a distance during his life his ghost when it is observed after his death  many circumstances confirmed or illustrated this savage hypothesis breath remains with the body during life deserts it at death  hence the words spiritus spirit greek anima and when the separable nature of the shadow is noticed hence come shade umbra greek with analogues in many languages  the hypothesis was also strengthened by the great difficulty which savages feel in discriminating between what occurs in dreams and what occurs to men awake  many civilised persons feel the same difficulty with regard to hallucinations beheld by them when in bed asleep or awake they know not on the dim border of existence  reflection on all these experiences ended in the belief in spirits in souls of the living in wraiths of the living in ghosts of the dead and finally in god  this theory is most cogently presented by mr tylor and is confirmed by examples chosen from his wide range of reading  but among these normal and natural facts as of sleep dream breath life dying mr tylor includes not as facts but as examples of applied animistic theory cases of clairvoyance apparitions of the dying seen by the living at a distance second sight ghostly disturbances of knocking and rapping movements of objects and so forth  it is not a question for mr tylor whether clairvoyance ever occurs  whether deathbed wraiths have been seen to an extent not explicable by the laws of chance whether disturbances and movements of objects not to be accounted for by human agency are matters of universal and often wellattested report  into the question of fact mr tylor explicitly declines to enter these things only concern him because they have been commonly explained by the animistic hypothesis that is by the fancied action of spirits the animistic hypothesis again is the result naturally fallacious of savage mans reasonings on life death sleep dreams trance breath shadow and the other kindred biological phenomena  thus clairvoyance on the animistic hypothesis is the flight of the conscious spirit of a living man across space or time the deathbed wraith is the visible apparition of the newly emancipated spirit and spirits cause the unexplained disturbances and movements of objects  in fact it is certain that the animistic hypothesis though a mere fallacy does colligate a great number of facts very neatly and has persisted from times of low savagery to the present age of reason  so here is a case of the savage origin and persistent survival of a hypothesisthe most potent hypothesis in the history of humanity  from mr tylors point of view his concern with the subject ceases here it is not his business to ascertain whether the abnormal facts are facts or fancies  yet to other students this question is very important  first if clairvoyance wraiths and the other alleged phenomena really do occur or have occurred then savage man had much better grounds for the animistic hypothesis than if no such phenomena ever existed  for instance if a medicineman not only went into trances but brought back from these expeditions knowledge otherwise inaccessible then there were better grounds for believing in a consciousness exerted apart from the body than if there were no evidence but that of nonveridical dreams  if merely the dream coincidences which the laws of chance permit were observed the belief in the souls dreamflight would win less favourable and general acceptance than it would if clairvoyance the sleep of the shadow were a real if rare experience  the very name given by the eskimos to the hypnotic state the sleep of the shadow proves that savages do make distinctions between normal and abnormal conditions of slumber  in the same way a few genuine wraiths or ghosts or veridical hallucinations would be enough to start the animistic hypothesis or to confirm it notably if it was already started  as to disturbances and movements of objects unexplained these in his own experience suggested even to de morgan the hypothesis of a conscious active and purposeful will not that of any human being present  now such a will is hardly to be defined otherwise than as spiritual  this order of phenomena like those of clairvoyance and wraiths might either give rise to the savage animistic hypothesis or at least might confirm it greatly  in fact if the sets of abnormal phenomena existed or were held to exist savage man scarcely needed the normal phenomena for the basis of his spiritual belief  the normal phenomena lent him such terms as spirit shadow but much of his theory might have been built on the foundation of the abnormal phenomena alone  a veridical hallucination of the dying would give him a wraith a recognised hallucination of the dead would give him a ghost  the often reported and unexplained movements and disturbances would give him a vui house spirit brownie domovoy follet lar or lutin or these occurrences might suggest to the thinking savage that some discontented influence survived from the recently dead  four thousand years have passed since houses were haunted in egypt and have left some sane educated and methodical men to meet the same annoyances as the ancient egyptians did by the same measures we do not pretend to discover without examination the causes of the sounds and sights which baffle trained and not superstitious investigators  but we do say that similar occurrences in a kraal or an eskimo hut in a wigwam in a cave or under a gunyeh would greatly confirm the animistic hypothesis of savages  the theory of imposture in some cases does undeniably break down for the people who hold it cannot even suggest a modus operandi within the reach of the human beings concerned as in the case of the wesleys  the theory of contagious hallucination of all the senses is the property of coleridge alone  the hypothesis of a nervous force which sets up centres of conscious action is confined to hartmann and to certain highland philosophers cavalierly dismissed by the rev robert kirk as men illiterate  instead of making these guesses the savage thinkers merely applied the animistic hypothesis which they had found to work very well already and as de morgan says to colligate the phenomena better than any other theory  we cannot easily conceive men who know neither sleep nor dreams but if the normal phenomena of sleep and dreams had not existed the abnormal phenomena already described if they occurred as they are universally said to do could have given rise when speculated upon to the belief in spirits  but it may reasonably be urged the natural familiar facts of life death sleep waking dreams breath and shadows are all versae causae do undeniably exist and without the aid of any of your abnormal facts afford basis enough for the animistic hypothesis  moreover after countless thousands of years during which superstition has muttered about your abnormal facts official science still declines to hear a word on the topic of clairvoyance or telepathy  you dont find the royal society investigating second sight or attending to legends about tables which rebel against the law of gravitation  these are cogent remarks  normal facts perhaps may have suggested the belief in spirits the animistic hypothesis  but we do not find the hypothesis among the backward races where abnormal facts are not alleged to be matters of comparatively frequent experience consequently we do not know that the normal facts alone suggested the existence of spirits to early thinkers we can only make the statement on a priori grounds  like george eliots rural sage we think it sounds a deal likelier  but that after all though a taking is not a powerful and conclusive syllogism  again we certainly do not expect to see the royal society inquiring into second sight or clairvoyance or thought transference  when the royal society was first founded several of its members pepys frs mr robert boyle frs the rev joseph glanvill frs went into these things a good deal  but in spite of their title they were only amateurs  they had no professional dignity to keep up  they were well aware that they unlike the late mr faraday did not know by inspiration or by commonsense the limits of the possible  they tried all things it was such a superstitious age now men of science or the majority of them for there are some exceptions know what is and what is not possible  they know that germs of life may possibly come down on meteorites from somewhere else and they produced an argument for the existence of a bathybius  but they also know that a man is not a bird to be in two places at once like pythagoras and that nobody can see through a stone wall  these and similar allegations they reckon impossible and if the facts happen so much the worse for the facts  they can only be due to imposture or malobservation and there is an end of the matter  this is the view of official science  unluckily not many years ago official science was equally certain that the ordinary phenomena of hypnotism were based on imposture and on mal observation  these phenomena too were tabooed  but so many people could testify to them and they could be so easily explained by the suggestive force of suggestion that they were reluctantly admitted within the sacred citadel  many people sane not superstitious healthy and even renowned as scientific specialists attest the existence of the still rarer phenomena which are said in certain cases to accompany the now more familiar incidents of hypnotism  but these phenomena have never yet been explained by any theory which science recognises as she does recognise that suggestion is suggestive  therefore these rarer phenomena manifestly do not exist and cannot be the subject of legitimate inquiry  these are unanswerable observations and it is only the antiquarian who can venture in his humble way to reply to them  his answer has a certain force ad hominem that is as addressed to anthropologists  they too have but recently been admitted within the scientific fold time was when their facts were regarded as mere travellers tales  mr max muller is now perhaps almost alone in his very low estimate of anthropological evidence and possibly even that sturdy champion is beginning to yield ground  defending the validity of the testimony on which anthropologists reason about the evolution of religion custom manners mythology law mr tylor writes  it is a matter worthy of consideration that the accounts of similar phenomena of culture recurring in different parts of the world actually supply incidental proof of their own authenticity    the test of recurrence comes in     the possibility of intentional or unintentional mystification is often barred by such a state of things as that a similar statement is made in two remote lands by two witnesses of whom a lived a century before b and b appears never to have heard of a  if for similar phenomena of culture here we substitute similar abnormal phenomena such as clairvoyance wraiths unexplained disturbances mr tylors argument in favour of his evidence for institutions applies equally well to our evidence for mysterious facts  how distant are the countries he goes on how wide apart are the dates how different the creeds and characters in the catalogue of the facts of civilisation needs no further showing to the student of mr tylors erudite footnotes  in place of facts of civilisation read psychical phenomena and mr tylors argument applies to the evidence for these rejected and scouted beliefs  the countries from which ghosts and wraiths and clairvoyance are reported are distant the dates are wide apart the creeds and characters of the observers are different yet the evidence is as uniform and as recurrent as it is in the case of institutions manners customs  indeed the evidence for the rejected and abnormal phenomena is even more recurrent than the evidence for customs and institutions  polyandry totemism human sacrifice the taboo are only reported as existing in remote and semicivilised countries  clairvoyance wraiths ghosts mysterious disturbances and movements of objects are reported as existing not only in distant ages but today not only among savages or barbarians but in london paris milan  no ages can be more wide apart few countries much more distant than ancient egypt and modern england  no characters look more different than that of an old scribe under pharaoh and that of a distinguished soldier under queen victoria  yet the scribe of khemi and general campbell suffer from the same inexplicable annoyance attribute it to the same very abnormal agency and attempt not unsuccessfully to communicate with that agency in precisely the same way  this though a striking is an isolated and perhaps a casual example of recurrence and uniformity in evidence  mr tylors primitive culture is itself a storehouse of other examples to which more may easily be added  for example there is the old and savage belief in a sending  the medicineman or medium or witch can despatch a conscious visible and intelligent agent nonnormal to do his bidding at a distance  this belief is often illustrated in the scandinavian sagas  rink testifies to it among the eskimo grinnell among the pawnees  porphyry alleges that by some such telepathic impact plotinus from a distance made a hostile magician named alexander double up like an empty bag and saw and reported this agreeable circumstance 352  hardly any abnormal phenomenon or faculty sounds less plausible and the spectral evidence for the presence of a witchs sending when the poor woman could establish an alibi for her visible self appeared dubious even to cotton mather  but in their phantasms of the living messrs gurney and myers give cases in which a visible sending was intentionally emitted by baron schrenck notzing by a stockbroker by a young student of engineering and by a french hospital nurse to take no other instances  the person visited frequently by the sendings in the last cases was a french physician engaged in the hospital who reports and attests the facts  all the cases are given at first hand on the testimony of the senders and of the recipients of the sendings  bulwer lytton was familiar with the belief and uses the shining shadow in a strange story  now here is uniform recurrent evidence from widely severed ages from distant countries from the polar north the american prairie neoplatonic egypt and greece england and new england of the seventeenth century and england and germany of today  the creeds and characters of the observers are as different as neoplatonism shamanism christianity of divers sects and probably agnosticism or indifference  all these conditions of unvarying testimony constitute good evidence for institutions and customs anthropologists who eagerly accept such testimony in their own studies may decide as to whether they deserve total neglect when adduced in another field of anthropology  turning from sendings or telepathy voluntarily brought to bear on one living person by another we might examine deathbed wraiths or the telepathic impactif that hypothesis of theirs be soundproduced by a dying on a living human being  a savage example in which a fuegian native on board an english ship saw his father who was expiring in tierra del fuego has the respectable authority of mr darwins cruise of the beagle  instances on the other hand in which australian blacks or fijians see the phantasms of dead kinsmen warning them of their decease which follows punctually may be found in messrs fison and howitts kamilaroi and kurnai  from new zealand mr tylor cites with his authorities the following example  353 a party of maoris one of whom told the story were seated round a fire in the open air when there appeared seen only by two of them the figure of a relative left ill at home  they exclaimed the figure vanished and on the return of the party it appeared that the sick man had died about the time of the vision  a traveller in new zealand illustrates the native belief in the deathwraith by an amusing anecdote  a rangatira or native gentleman had gone on the warpath  one day he walked into his wifes house but after a few moments could not be found  the military expedition did not return so the lady taking it for granted that her husband the owner of the wraith was dead married an admirer  the hallucination however was not veridical the warrior came home but he admitted that he had no remedy and no feud against his successor  the owner of a wraith which has been seen may be assumed to be dead  such is maori belief  the modern civilised examples of deathwraiths attested and recorded in phantasms of the living are numerous but statistics prove that a lady who marries again on the strength of a wraith may commit an error of judgment and become liable to the penalty of bigamy  the maoris no statisticians take a more liberal and tolerant view  these are comparatively scanty examples from savage life but then they are corroborated by the wealth of recurrent and coincident evidence from civilised races ancient and modern  on the point of clairvoyance it is unnecessary to dwell  the secondsighted man the seer of events remote in space or not yet accomplished in time is familiar everywhere from the hebrides to the coppermine river from the samoyed and eskimo to the zulu from the euphrates to the hague  the noises heard in haunted houses the knocking routing dragging of heavy bodies is recorded mr tylor says by dayaks singhalese siamese and esths dennys in his folklore of china notes the occurrences in the celestial empire grimm in his german mythology gives examples starting from the communicative knocks of a spirit near bingen in the chronicle of rudolf 856 and suetonius tells a similar tale from imperial rome  the physician of catherine de medicis ambroise pare describes every one of the noises heard by the wesleys long after his day as familiar and as caused by devils  recurrence and conformity of evidence cannot be found in greater force  the anthropological test of evidence for faith in the rejected phenomena is thus amply satisfied  unless we say that these phenomena are impossible whereas totemism the couvade cannibalism are possible the testimony to belief in clairvoyance and the other peculiar occurrences is as good in its way as the evidence for the practice of wild customs and institutions  there remains a last and notable circumstance  all the abnormal phenomena in the modern and mediaeval tales occur most frequently in the presence of convulsionaries like the socalled victims of witches like the hon master sandilands lord torphichens son 1720 like the grandson of william morse in new england 1680 and like bovets case of the demon of spraiton 355  the mediums of modern spiritualism like francis fey are or pretend to be subject to fits anaesthesia jerks convulsive movements and trance  as mr tylor says about his savage jossakeeds powwows birraarks peaimen everywhere these people suffer from hysterical convulsive and epileptic affections  thus the physical condition all the world over of persons who exhibit most freely the accepted phenomena is identical  all the world over too the same persons are credited with the rejected phenomena clairvoyance discerning of spirits powers of voluntary telepathic and telekinetic impact  thus we find that uniform and recurrent evidence vouches for a mass of phenomena which science scouts  science has now accepted a portion of the mass but still rejects the stranger occurrences  our argument is that their invariably alleged presence in attendance on the minor occurrences is at least a point worthy of examination  the undesigned coincidences of testimony represent a great deal of smoke and proverbial wisdom suggests a presumption in favour of a few sparks of fire  now if there are such sparks the animistic hypothesis may not of course be validspirits may not existbut the universal belief in their existence may have had its origin not in normal facts only but in abnormal facts  and these facts at the lowest estimate must suggest that man may have faculties and be surrounded by agencies which physical science does not take into account in its theory of the universe and of human nature  we have already argued that the doctrines of theism and of the soul need not to be false even if they were arrived at slowly after a succession of grosser opinions  but if the doctrines were reached by a process which started from real facts of human nature observed by savages but not yet recognised by physical science then there may have been grains of truth even in the cruder and earlier ideas and these grains of gold may have been disengaged and fashioned not without divine aid into the sacred things of spiritual religion  the stories which we have been considering are often trivial sometimes comic but they are universally diffused and as well established as universally coincident testimony can establish anything  now if there be but one spark of real fire to all this smoke then the purely materialistic theories of life and of the world must be reconsidered  they seem very well established but so have many other theories seemed that are long gone the way of all things human      footnotes   0a  fortnightly review february 1866 and in a lecture 1895  0b  this diary was edited for private circulation by a son
