reginalds drama  reginald on tariffs  reginalds christmas revel  reginalds rubaiyat  the innocence of reginald     reginald   i did iti who should have known better  i persuaded reginald to go to the mckillops gardenparty against his will  we all make mistakes occasionally  they know youre here and theyll think it so funny if you dont go and i want particularly to be in with mrs mckillop just now  i know you want one of her smoke persian kittens as a prospective wife for wumplesor a husband is it  reginald has a magnificent scorn for details other than sartorial  and i am expected to undergo social martyrdom to suit the connubial exigencies  reginald  its nothing of the kind only im sure mrs mckillop would be pleased if i brought you  young men of your brilliant attractions are rather at a premium at her gardenparties  should be at a premium in heaven remarked reginald complacently  there will be very few of you there if that is what you mean  but seriously there wont be any great strain upon your powers of endurance i promise you that you shant have to play croquet or talk to the archdeacons wife or do anything that is likely to bring on physical prostration  you can just wear your sweetest clothes and moderately amiable expression and eat chocolatecreams with the appetite of a blase parrot  nothing more is demanded of you  reginald shut his eyes  there will be the exhaustingly uptodate young women who will ask me if i have seen san toy a less progressive grade who will yearn to hear about the diamond jubileethe historic event not the horse  with a little encouragement they will inquire if i saw the allies march into paris  why are women so fond of raking up the past theyre as bad as tailors who invariably remember what you owe them for a suit long after youve ceased to wear it  ill order lunch for one oclock that will give you two and a half hours to dress in  reginald puckered his brow into a tortured frown and i knew that my point was gained  he was debating what tie would go with which waistcoat  even then i had my misgivings        during the drive to the mckillops reginald was possessed with a great peace which was not wholly to be accounted for by the fact that he had inveigled his feet into shoes a size too small for them  i misgave more than ever and having once launched reginald on to the mckillops lawn i established him near a seductive dish of marrons glaces and as far from the archdeacons wife as possible as i drifted away to a diplomatic distance i heard with painful distinctness the eldest mawkby girl asking him if he had seen san toy  it must have been ten minutes later not more and i had been having quite an enjoyable chat with my hostess and had promised to lend her the eternal city and my recipe for rabbit mayonnaise and was just about to offer a kind home for her third persian kitten when i perceived out of the corner of my eye that reginald was not where i had left him and that the marrons glaces were untasted  at the same moment i became aware that old colonel mendoza was essaying to tell his classic story of how he introduced golf into india and that reginald was in dangerous proximity  there are occasions when reginald is caviare to the colonel  when i was at poona in 76  my dear colonel purred reginald fancy admitting such a thing  such a giveaway for ones age  i wouldnt admit being on this planet in 76  reginald in his wildest lapses into veracity never admits to being more than twentytwo  the colonel went to the colour of a fig that has attained great ripeness and reginald ignoring my efforts to intercept him glided away to another part of the lawn  i found him a few minutes later happily engaged in teaching the youngest rampage boy the approved theory of mixing absinthe within full earshot of his mother  mrs rampage occupies a prominent place in local temperance movements  as soon as i had broken up this unpromising teteatete and settled reginald where he could watch the croquet players losing their tempers i wandered off to find my hostess and renew the kitten negotiations at the point where they had been interrupted  i did not succeed in running her down at once and eventually it was mrs mckillop who sought me out and her conversation was not of kittens  your cousin is discussing zaza with the archdeacons wife at least he is discussing she is ordering her carriage  she spoke in the dry staccato tone of one who repeats a french exercise and i knew that as far as millie mckillop was concerned wumples was devoted to a lifelong celibacy  if you dont mind i said hurriedly i think wed like our carriage ordered too and i made a forced march in the direction of the croquet ground  i found everyone talking nervously and feverishly of the weather and the war in south africa except reginald who was reclining in a comfortable chair with the dreamy faraway look that a volcano might wear just after it had desolated entire villages  the archdeacons wife was buttoning up her gloves with a concentrated deliberation that was fearful to behold  i shall have to treble my subscription to her cheerful sunday evenings fund before i dare set foot in her house again  at that particular moment the croquet players finished their game which had been going on without a symptom of finality during the whole afternoon  why i ask should it have stopped precisely when a counter attraction was so necessary  everyone seemed to drift towards the area of disturbance of which the chairs of the archdeacons wife and reginald formed the stormcentre  conversation flagged and there settled upon the company that expectant hush that precedes the dawnwhen your neighbours dont happen to keep poultry  what did the caspian sea asked reginald with appalling suddenness  there were symptoms of a stampede  the archdeacons wife looked at me kipling or someone has described somewhere the look a foundered camel gives when the caravan moves on and leaves it to its fate  the peptonised reproach in the good ladys eyes brought the passage vividly to my mind  i played my last card  reginald its getting late and a seamist is coming on  i knew that the elaborate curl over his right eyebrow was not guaranteed to survive a seamist        never never again will i take you to a gardenparty  never    you behaved abominably    what did the caspian see  a shade of genuine regret for misused opportunities passed over reginalds face  after all he said i believe an apricot tie would have gone better with the lilac waistcoat     reginald on christmas presents   i wish it to be distinctly understood said reginald that i dont want a george prince of wales prayerbook as a christmas present  the fact cannot be too widely known  there ought he continued to be technical education classes on the science of presentgiving  no one seems to have the faintest notion of what anyone else wants and the prevalent ideas on the subject are not creditable to a civilised community  there is for instance the female relative in the country who knows a tie is always useful and sends you some spotted horror that you could only wear in secret or in tottenham court road  it might have been useful had she kept it to tie up currant bushes with when it would have served the double purpose of supporting the branches and frightening away the birdsfor it is an admitted fact that the ordinary tomtit of commerce has a sounder aesthetic taste than the average female relative in the country  then there are aunts  they are always a difficult class to deal with in the matter of presents  the trouble is that one never catches them really young enough  by the time one has educated them to an appreciation of the fact that one does not wear red woollen mittens in the west end they die or quarrel with the family or do something equally inconsiderate  that is why the supply of trained aunts is always so precarious  there is my aunt agatha par exemple who sent me a pair of gloves last christmas and even got so far as to choose a kind that was being worn and had the correct number of buttons  butthey were nines  i sent them to a boy whom i hated intimately he didnt wear them of course but he could havethat was where the bitterness of death came in  it was nearly as consoling as sending white flowers to his funeral  of course i wrote and told my aunt that they were the one thing that had been wanting to make existence blossom like a rose i am afraid she thought me frivolousshe comes from the north where they live in the fear of heaven and the earl of durham  reginald affects an exhaustive knowledge of things political which furnishes an excellent excuse for not discussing them  aunts with a dash of foreign extraction in them are the most satisfactory in the way of understanding these things but if you cant choose your aunt it is wisest in the longrun to choose the present and send her the bill  even friends of ones own set who might be expected to know better have curious delusions on the subject  i am not collecting copies of the cheaper editions of omar khayyam  i gave the last four that i received to the liftboy and i like to think of him reading them with fitzgeralds notes to his aged mother  liftboys always have aged mothers shows such nice feeling on their part i think  personally i cant see where the difficulty in choosing suitable presents lies  no boy who had brought himself up properly could fail to appreciate one of those decorative bottles of liqueurs that are so reverently staged in morels windowand it wouldnt in the least matter if one did get duplicates  and there would always be the supreme moment of dreadful uncertainty whether it was creme de menthe or chartreuselike the expectant thrill on seeing your partners hand turned up at bridge  people may say what they like about the decay of christianity the religious system that produced green chartreuse can never really die  and then of course there are liqueur glasses and crystallised fruits and tapestry curtains and heaps of other necessaries of life that make really sensible presentsnot to speak of luxuries such as having ones bills paid or getting something quite sweet in the way of jewellery unlike the alleged good woman of the bible im not above rubies  when found by the way she must have been rather a problem at christmastime nothing short of a blank cheque would have fitted the situation  perhaps its as well that shes died out  the great charm about me concluded reginald is that i am so easily pleased  but i draw the line at a prince of wales prayerbook     reginald on the academy   one goes to the academy in selfdefence said reginald  it is the one topic one has in common with the country cousins  it is almost a religious observance with them said the other  a kind of artistic mecca and when the good ones die they go  to the chantrey bequest  the mystery is what they find to talk about in the country  there are two subjects of conversation in the country servants and can fowls be made to pay  the first i believe is compulsory the second optional  as a function resumed reginald the academy is a failure  you think it would be tolerable without the pictures  the pictures are all right in their way after all one can always look at them if one is bored with ones surroundings or wants to avoid an imminent acquaintance  even that doesnt always save one  there is the inevitable female whom you met once in devonshire or the matoppo hills or somewhere who charges up to you with the remark that its funny how one always meets people one knows at the academy  personally i dont think it funny  i suffered in that way just now said reginald plaintively from a woman whose word i had to take that she had met me last summer in brittany  i hope you were not too brutal  i merely told her with engaging simplicity that the art of life was the avoidance of the unattainable  did she try and work it out on the back of her catalogue  not there and then  she murmured something about being so clever fancy coming to the academy to be clever  to be clever in the afternoon argues that one is dining nowhere in the evening  which reminds me that i cant remember whether i accepted an invitation from you to dine at kettners tonight  on the other hand i can remember with startling distinctness not having asked you to  so much certainty is unbecoming in the young so well consider that settled  what were you talking about  oh pictures  personally i rather like them they are so refreshingly real and probable they take one away from the unrealities of life  one likes to escape from oneself occasionally  that is the disadvantage of a portrait as a rule ones bitterest friends can find nothing more to ask than the faithful unlikeness that goes down to posterity as oneself  i hate posterityits so fond of having the last word  of course as regards portraits there are exceptions  for instance  to die before being painted by sargent is to go to heaven prematurely  with the necessary care and impatience you may avoid that catastrophe  if youre going to be rude said reginald i shall dine with you to morrow night as well  the chief vice of the academy he continued is its nomenclature  why for instance should an obvious troutstream with a palpable rabbit sitting in the foreground be called an evening dream of unbeclouded peace or something of that sort  you think said the other that a name should economise description rather than stimulate imagination  properly chosen it should do both  there is my lady kitten at home for instance ive called it derry  suggests nothing to my imagination but protracted sieges and religious animosities  of course i dont know your kitten  oh youre silly  its a sweet name and it answers to itwhen it wants to  then if there are any unseemly noises in the night they can be explained succinctly derry and toms  you might almost charge for the advertisement  but as applied to pictures dont you think your system would be too subtle say for the country cousins  every reformation must have its victims  you cant expect the fatted calf to share the enthusiasm of the angels over the prodigals return another darling weakness of the academy is that none of its luminaries must arrive in a hurry  you can see them coming for years like a balkan trouble or a street improvement and by the time they have painted a thousand or so square yards of canvas their work begins to be recognised  someone who must not be contradicted said that a man must be a success by the time hes thirty or never  to have reached thirty said reginald is to have failed in life     reginald at the theatre   after all said the duchess vaguely there are certain things you cant get away from  right and wrong good conduct and moral rectitude have certain welldefined limits  so for the matter of that replied reginald has the russian empire the trouble is that the limits are not always in the same place  reginald and the duchess regarded each other with mutual distrust tempered by a scientific interest  reginald considered that the duchess had much to learn in particular not to hurry out of the carlton as though afraid of losing ones last bus  a woman he said who is careless of disappearances is capable of leaving town before goodwood and dying at the wrong moment of an unfashionable disease  the duchess thought that reginald did not exceed the ethical standard which circumstances demanded  of course she resumed combatively its the prevailing fashion to believe in perpetual change and mutability and all that sort of thing and to say we are all merely an improved form of primeval apeof course you subscribe to that doctrine  i think it decidedly premature in most people i know the process is far from complete  and equally of course you are quite irreligious  oh by no means  the fashion just now is a roman catholic frame of mind with an agnostic conscience you get the mediaeval picturesqueness of the one with the modern conveniences of the other  the duchess suppressed a sniff  she was one of those people who regard the church of england with patronising affection as if it were something that had grown up in their kitchen garden  but there are other things she continued which i suppose are to a certain extent sacred even to you  patriotism for instance and empire and imperial responsibility and bloodisthickerthanwater and all that sort of thing  reginald waited for a couple of minutes before replying while the lord of rimini temporarily monopolised the acoustic possibilities of the theatre  that is the worst of a tragedy he observed one cant always hear oneself talk  of course i accept the imperial idea and the responsibility  after all i would just as soon think in continents as anywhere else  and some day when the season is over and we have the time you shall explain to me the exact bloodbrotherhood and all that sort of thing that exists between a french canadian and a mild hindoo and a yorkshireman for instance  oh well dominion over palm and pine you know quoted the duchess hopefully of course we mustnt forget that were all part of the great anglosaxon empire  which for its part is rapidly becoming a suburb of jerusalem  a very pleasant suburb i admit and quite a charming jerusalem  but still a suburb  really to be told ones living in a suburb when one is conscious of spreading the benefits of civilisation all over the world  philanthropyi suppose you will say that is a comfortable delusion and yet even you must admit that whenever want or misery or starvation is known to exist however distant or difficult of access we instantly organise relief on the most generous scale and distribute it if need be to the uttermost ends of the earth  the duchess paused with a sense of ultimate triumph  she had made the same observation at a drawingroom meeting and it had been extremely well received  i wonder said reginald if you have ever walked down the embankment on a winter night  gracious no child  why do you ask  i didnt i only wondered  and even your philanthropy practised in a world where everything is based on competition must have a debit as well as a credit account  the young ravens cry for food  and are fed  exactly  which presupposes that something else is fed upon  oh youre simply exasperating  youve been reading nietzsche till you havent got any sense of moral proportion left  may i ask if you are governed by any laws of conduct whatever  there are certain fixed rules that one observes for ones own comfort for instance never be flippantly rude to any inoffensive greybearded stranger that you may meet in pine forests or hotel smokingrooms on the continent  it always turns out to be the king of sweden  the restraint must be dreadfully irksome to you  when i was younger boys of your age used to be nice and innocent  now we are only nice  one must specialise in these days  which reminds me of the man i read of in some sacred book who was given a choice of what he most desired  and because he didnt ask for titles and honours and dignities but only for immense wealth these other things came to him also  i am sure you didnt read about him in any sacred book  yes i fancy you will find him in debrett     reginalds peace poem   im writing a poem on peace said reginald emerging from a sweeping operation through a tin of mixed biscuits in whose depths a macaroon or two might yet be lurking  something of the kind seems to have been attempted already said the other  oh i know but i may never have the chance again  besides ive got a new fountain pen  i dont pretend to have gone on any very original lines in writing about peace the thing is to say what everybody else is saying only to say it better  it begins with the usual ornithological emotion     when the widgeon westward winging    heard the folk vereeniginging    heard the shouting and the singing  vereeniginging is good but why widgeon  why not  anything that winged westward would naturally begin with a w  need it wing westward  the bird must go somewhere  you wouldnt have it hang around and look foolish  then ive brought in something about the heedless hartebeest galloping over the deserted veldt  of course you know its practically extinct in those regions  i cant help that it gallops so nicely  i make it have all sorts of unexpected yearnings     mother may i go and maffick    tear around and hinder traffic  of course youll say there would be no traffic worth bothering about on the bare and sunscorched veldt but theres no other word that rhymes with maffick  seraphic  reginald considered  it might do but ive got a lot about angels later on  you must have angels in a peace poem i know dreadfully little about their habits  they can do unexpected things like the hartebeest  of course  then i turn on london the city of dreadful nocturnes resonant with hymns of joy and thanksgiving     and the sleeper eye unlidding    heard a voice for ever bidding    much farewell to dolly gray    turning weary on his truckle    bed he heard the honeysuckle    lauded in apiarian lay  longfellow at his best wrote nothing like that  i agree with you  i wish you wouldnt  ive a sweet temper but i cant stand being agreed with  and im so worried about the aasvogel  reginald stared dismally at the biscuittin which now presented an unattractive array of rejected cracknels  i believe he murmured if i could find a woman with an unsatisfied craving for cracknels i should marry her  what is the tragedy of the aasvogel asked the other sympathetically  oh simply that theres no rhyme for it  i thought about it all the time i was dressingits dreadfully bad for one to think whilst ones dressingand all lunchtime and im still hung up over it  i feel like those unfortunate automobilists who achieve an unenviable motoriety by coming to a hopeless stop with their cars in the most crowded thoroughfares  im afraid i shall have to drop the aasvogel and it did give such lovely local colour to the thing  still youve got the heedless hartebeest  and quite a decorative bit of moral admonitionwhen youve worried the meaning out     cease war thy bubbling madness that the wine shares    and bid thy legions turn their swords to mine shares  mine shares seems to fit the case better than ploughshares  theres lots more about the blessings of peace shall i go on reading it  if i must make a choice i think i would rather they went on with the war     reginalds choir treat   never wrote reginald to his most darling friend be a pioneer  its the early christian that gets the fattest lion  reginald in his way was a pioneer  none of the rest of his family had anything approaching titian hair or a sense of humour and they used primroses as a table decoration  it follows that they never understood reginald who came down late to breakfast and nibbled toast and said disrespectful things about the universe  the family ate porridge and believed in everything even the weather forecast  therefore the family was relieved when the vicars daughter undertook the reformation of reginald  her name was amabel it was the vicars one extravagance  amabel was accounted a beauty and intellectually gifted she never played tennis and was reputed to have read maeterlincks life of the bee  if you abstain from tennis and read maeterlinck in a small country village you are of necessity intellectual  also she had been twice to fecamp to pick up a good french accent from the americans staying there consequently she had a knowledge of the world which might be considered useful in dealings with a worldling  hence the congratulations in the family when amabel undertook the reformation of its wayward member  amabel commenced operations by asking her unsuspecting pupil to tea in the vicarage garden she believed in the healthy influence of natural surroundings never having been in sicily where things are different  and like every woman who has ever preached repentance to unregenerate youth she dwelt on the sin of an empty life which always seems so much more scandalous in the country where people rise early to see if a new strawberry has happened during the night  reginald recalled the lilies of the field which simply sat and looked beautiful and defied competition  but that is not an example for us to follow gasped amabel  unfortunately we cant afford to  you dont know what a world of trouble i take in trying to rival the lilies in their artistic simplicity  you are really indecently vain of your appearance  a good life is infinitely preferable to good looks  you agree with me that the two are incompatible  i always say beauty is only sin deep  amabel began to realise that the battle is not always to the strongminded  with the immemorial resource of her sex she abandoned the frontal attack and laid stress on her unassisted labours in parish work her mental loneliness her discouragementsand at the right moment she produced strawberries and cream  reginald was obviously affected by the latter and when his preceptress suggested that he might begin the strenuous life by helping her to supervise the annual outing of the bucolic infants who composed the local choir his eyes shone with the dangerous enthusiasm of a convert  reginald entered on the strenuous life alone as far as amabel was concerned  the most virtuous women are not proof against damp grass and amabel kept her bed with a cold  reginald called it a dispensation it had been the dream of his life to stagemanage a choir outing  with strategic insight he led his shy bulletheaded charges to the nearest woodland stream and allowed them to bathe then he seated himself on their discarded garments and discoursed on their immediate future which he decreed was to embrace a bacchanalian procession through the village forethought had provided the occasion with a supply of tin whistles but the introduction of a hegoat from a neighbouring orchard was a brilliant afterthought  properly reginald explained there should have been an outfit of panther skins as it was those who had spotted handkerchiefs were allowed to wear them which they did with thankfulness  reginald recognised the impossibility in the time at his disposal of teaching his shivering neophytes a chant in honour of bacchus so he started them off with a more familiar if less appropriate temperance hymn  after all he said it is the spirit of the thing that counts  following the etiquette of dramatic authors on first nights he remained discreetly in the background while the procession with extreme diffidence and the goat wound its way lugubriously towards the village  the singing had died down long before the main street was reached but the miserable wailing of pipes brought the inhabitants to their doors  reginald said he had seen something like it in pictures the villagers had seen nothing like it in their lives and remarked as much freely  reginalds family never forgave him  they had no sense of humour     reginald on worries   i have said reginald an aunt who worries  shes not really an aunta sort of amateur one and they arent really worries  she is a social success and has no domestic tragedies worth speaking of so she adopts any decorative sorrows that are going myself included  in that way shes the antithesis or whatever you call it to those sweet uncomplaining women one knows who have seen trouble and worn blinkers ever since  of course one just loves them for it but i must confess they make me uncomfy they remind one so of a duck that goes flapping about with forced cheerfulness long after its heads been cut off  ducks have no repose  now my aunt has a shade of hair that suits her and a cook who quarrels with the other servants which is always a hopeful sign and a conscience thats absentee for about eleven months of the year and only turns up at lent to annoy her husbands people who are considerably lower than the angels so to speak with all these natural advantagesshe says her particular tint of bronze is a natural advantage and there can be no two opinions as to the advantageof course she has to send out for her afflictions like those restaurants where they havent got a licence  the system has this advantage that you can fit your unhappinesses in with your other engagements whereas real worries have a way of arriving at mealtimes and when youre dressing or other solemn moments  i knew a canary once that had been trying for months and years to hatch out a family and everyone looked upon it as a blameless infatuation like the sale of delagoa bay which would be an annual loss to the press agencies if it ever came to pass and one day the bird really did bring it off in the middle of family prayers  i say the middle but it was also the end you cant go on being thankful for daily bread when you are wondering what on earth very new canaries expect to be fed on  at present shes rather in a balkan state of mind about the treatment of the jews in roumania  personally i think the jews have estimable qualities theyre so kind to their poorand to our rich  i daresay in roumania the cost of living beyond ones income isnt so great  over here the trouble is that so many people who have money to throw about seem to have such vague ideas where to throw it  that fund for instance to relieve the victims of sudden disasterswhat is a sudden disaster  theres marion mulciber who would think she could play bridge just as she would think she could ride down a hill on a bicycle on that occasion she went to a hospital now shes gone into a sisterhoodlost all she had you know and gave the rest to heaven still you cant call it a sudden calamity that occurred when poor dear marion was born  the doctors said at the time that she couldnt live more than a fortnight and shes been trying ever since to see if she could  women are so opinionated  and then theres the education questionnot that i can see that theres anything to worry about in that direction  to my mind education is an absurdly overrated affair  at least one never took it very seriously at school where everything was done to bring it prominently under ones notice  anything that is worth knowing one practically teaches oneself and the rest obtrudes itself sooner or later  the reason ones elders know so comparatively little is because they have to unlearn so much that they acquired by way of education before we were born  of course im a believer in naturestudy as i said to lady beauwhistle if you want a lesson in elaborate artificiality just watch the studied unconcern of a persian cat entering a crowded salon and then go and practise it for a fortnight  the beauwhistles werent born in the purple you know but theyre getting there on the instalment systemso much down and the rest when you feel like it  they have kind hearts and they never forget birthdays  i forget what he was something in the city where the patriotism comes from and sheoh well her frocks are built in paris but she wears them with a strong english accent  so publicspirited of her  i think she must have been very strictly brought up shes so desperately anxious to do the wrong thing correctly  not that it really matters nowadays as i told her i know some perfectly virtuous people who are received everywhere     reginald on houseparties   the drawback is one never really knows ones hosts and hostesses  one gets to know their foxterriers and their chrysanthemums and whether the story about the gocart can be turned loose in the drawingroom or must be told privately to each member of the party for fear of shocking public opinion but ones host and hostess are a sort of human hinterland that one never has the time to explore  there was a fellow i stayed with once in warwickshire who farmed his own land but was otherwise quite steady  should never have suspected him of having a soul yet not very long afterwards he eloped with a liontamers widow and set up as a golfinstructor somewhere on the persian gulf dreadfully immoral of course because he was only an indifferent player but still it showed imagination  his wife was really to be pitied because he had been the only person in the house who understood how to manage the cooks temper and now she has to put dv on her dinner invitations  still thats better than a domestic scandal a woman who leaves her cook never wholly recovers her position in society  i suppose the same thing holds good with the hosts they seldom have more than a superficial acquaintance with their guests and so often just when they do get to know you a bit better they leave off knowing you altogether  there was rather a breath of winter in the air when i left those dorsetshire people  you see they had asked me down to shoot and im not particularly immense at that sort of thing  theres such a deadly sameness about partridges when youve missed one youve missed the lotat least thats been my experience  and they tried to rag me in the smokingroom about not being able to hit a bird at five yards a sort of bovine ragging that suggested cows buzzing round a gadfly and thinking they were teasing it  so i got up the next morning at early dawni know it was dawn because there were larknoises in the sky and the grass looked as if it had been left out all nightand hunted up the most conspicuous thing in the bird line that i could find and measured the distance as nearly as it would let me and shot away all i knew they said afterwards that it was a tame bird thats simply silly because it was awfully wild at the first few shots  afterwards it quieted down a bit and when its legs had stopped waving farewells to the landscape i got a gardenerboy to drag it into the hall where everybody must see it on their way to the breakfastroom  i breakfasted upstairs myself  i gathered afterwards that the meal was tinged with a very unchristian spirit  i suppose its unlucky to bring peacocks feathers into a house anyway there was a bluepencilly look in my hostesss eye when i took my departure  some hostesses of course will forgive anything even unto pavonicide is there such a word as long as one is nicelooking and sufficiently unusual to counterbalance some of the others and there are othersthe girl for instance who reads meredith and appears at meals with unnatural punctuality in a frock thats made at home and repented at leisure  she eventually finds her way to india and gets married and comes home to admire the royal academy and to imagine that an indifferent prawn curry is for ever an effective substitute for all that we have been taught to believe is luncheon  its then that she is really dangerous but at her worst she is never quite so bad as the woman who fires exchange and mart questions at you without the least provocation imagine the other day just when i was doing my best to understand half the things i was saying being asked by one of those seekers after country home truths how many fowls she could keep in a run ten feet by six or whatever it was  i told her whole crowds as long as she kept the door shut and the idea didnt seem to have struck her before at least she brooded over it for the rest of dinner  of course as i say one never really knows ones ground and one may make mistakes occasionally  but then ones mistakes sometimes turn out assets in the longrun if we had never bungled away our american colonies we might never have had the boy from the states to teach us how to wear our hair and cut our clothes and we must get our ideas from somewhere i suppose  even the hooligan was probably invented in china centuries before we thought of him  england must wake up as the duke of devonshire said the other day wasnt it  oh well it was someone else not that i ever indulge in despair about the future there always have been men who have gone about despairing of the future and when the future arrives it says nice superior things about their having acted according to their lights  it is dreadful to think that other peoples grandchildren may one day rise up and call one amiable  there are moments when one sympathises with herod     reginald at the carlton   a most variable climate said the duchess and how unfortunate that we should have had that very cold weather at a time when coal was so dear so distressing for the poor  someone has observed that providence is always on the side of the big dividends remarked reginald  the duchess ate an anchovy in a shocked manner she was sufficiently old fashioned to dislike irreverence towards dividends  reginald had left the selection of a feedingground to her womanly intuition but he chose the wine himself knowing that womanly intuition stops short at claret  a woman will cheerfully choose husbands for her less attractive friends or take sides in a political controversy without the least knowledge of the issues involvedbut no woman ever cheerfully chose a claret  hors doeuvres have always a pathetic interest for me said reginald they remind me of ones childhood that one goes through wondering what the next course is going to be likeand during the rest of the menu one wishes one had eaten more of the hors doeuvres  dont you love watching the different ways people have of entering a restaurant  there is the woman who races in as though her whole scheme of life were held together by a onepin despotism which might abdicate its functions at any moment its really a relief to see her reach her chair in safety  then there are the people who troop in with anunpleasantdutytoperform air as if they were angels of death entering a plague city  you see that type of briton very much in hotels abroad  and nowadays there are always the johannesbourgeois who bring a capetocairo atmosphere with themwhat may be called the rand manner i suppose  talking about hotels abroad said the duchess i am preparing notes for a lecture at the club on the educational effects of modern travel dealing chiefly with the moral side of the question  i was talking to lady beauwhistles aunt the other dayshes just come back from paris you know  such a sweet woman  and so silly  in these days of the overeducation of women shes quite refreshing  they say some people went through the siege of paris without knowing that france and germany were at war but the beauwhistle aunt is credited with having passed the whole winter in paris under the impression that the humberts were a kind of bicycle    isnt there a bishop or somebody who believes we shall meet all the animals we have known on earth in another world  how frightfully embarrassing to meet a whole shoal of whitebait you had last known at princes  im sure in my nervousness i should talk of nothing but lemons  still i daresay they would be quite as offended if one hadnt eaten them  i know if i were served up at a cannibal feast i should be dreadfully annoyed if anyone found fault with me for not being tender enough or having been kept too long  my idea about the lecture resumed the duchess hurriedly is to inquire whether promiscuous continental travel doesnt tend to weaken the moral fibre of the social conscience  there are people one knows quite nice people when they are in england who are so different when they are anywhere the other side of the channel  the people with what i call tauchnitz morals observed reginald  on the whole i think they get the best of two very desirable worlds  and after all they charge so much for excess luggage on some of those foreign lines that its really an economy to leave ones reputation behind one occasionally  a scandal my dear reginald is as much to be avoided at monaco or any of those places as at exeter let us say  scandal my dear irenei may call you irene maynt i  i dont know that you have known me long enough for that  ive known you longer than your godparents had when they took the liberty of calling you that name  scandal is merely the compassionate allowance which the gay make to the humdrum  think how many blameless lives are brightened by the blazing indiscretions of other people  tell me who is the woman with the old lace at the table on our left  oh that doesnt matter its quite the thing nowadays to stare at people as if they were yearlings at tattersalls  mrs spelvexit  quite a charming woman separated from her husband  incompatibility of income  oh nothing of that sort  by miles of frozen ocean i was going to say he explores icefloes and studies the movements of herrings and has written a most interesting book on the homelife of the esquimaux but naturally he has very little homelife of his own  a husband who comes home with the gulf stream would be rather a tied up asset  his wife is exceedingly sensible about it  she collects postagestamps such a resource  those people with her are the whimples very old acquaintances of mine theyre always having trouble poor things  trouble is not one of those fancies you can take up and drop at any moment its like a grousemoor or the opiumhabitonce you start it youve got to keep it up  their eldest son was such a disappointment to them they wanted him to be a linguist and spent no end of money on having him taught to speakoh dozens of languagesand then he became a trappist monk  and the youngest who was intended for the american marriage market has developed political tendencies and writes pamphlets about the housing of the poor  of course its a most important question and i devote a good deal of time to it myself in the mornings but as laura whimple says its as well to have an establishment of ones own before agitating about other peoples  she feels it very keenly but she always maintains a cheerful appetite which i think is so unselfish of her  there are different ways of taking disappointment  there was a girl i knew who nursed a wealthy uncle through a long illness borne by her with christian fortitude and then he died and left his money to a swinefever hospital  she found shed about cleared stock in fortitude by that time and now she gives drawingroom recitations  thats what i call being vindictive  life is full of its disappointments observed the duchess and i suppose the art of being happy is to disguise them as illusions  but that my dear reginald becomes more difficult as one grows older  i think its more generally practised than you imagine  the young have aspirations that never come to pass the old have reminiscences of what never happened  its only the middleaged who are really conscious of their limitationsthat is why one should be so patient with them  but one never is  after all said the duchess the disillusions of life may depend on our way of assessing it  in the minds of those who come after us we may be remembered for qualities and successes which we quite left out of the reckoning  its not always safe to depend on the commemorative tendencies of those who come after us  there may have been disillusionments in the lives of the mediaeval saints but they would scarcely have been better pleased if they could have foreseen that their names would be associated nowadays chiefly with racehorses and the cheaper clarets  and now if you can tear yourself away from the salted almonds well go and have coffee under the palms that are so necessary for our discomfort     reginald on besetting sins the woman who told the truth   there was once said reginald a woman who told the truth  not all at once of course but the habit grew upon her gradually like lichen on an apparently healthy tree  she had no childrenotherwise it might have been different  it began with little things for no particular reason except that her life was a rather empty one and it is so easy to slip into the habit of telling the truth in little matters  and then it became difficult to draw the line at more important things until at last she took to telling the truth about her age she said she was fortytwo and five monthsby that time you see she was veracious even to months it may have been pleasing to the angels but her elder sister was not gratified  on the womans birthday instead of the operatickets which she had hoped for her sister gave her a view of jerusalem from the mount of olives which is not quite the same thing  the revenge of an elder sister may be long in coming but like a southeastern express it arrives in its own good time  the friends of the woman tried to dissuade her from overindulgence in the practice but she said she was wedded to the truth whereupon it was remarked that it was scarcely logical to be so much together in public no really provident woman lunches regularly with her husband if she wishes to burst upon him as a revelation at dinner  he must have time to forget an afternoon is not enough  and after a while her friends began to thin out in patches  her passion for the truth was not compatible with a large visitinglist  for instance she told miriam klopstock exactly how she looked at the ilexes ball  certainly miriam had asked for her candid opinion but the woman prayed in church every sunday for peace in our time and it was not consistent  it was unfortunate everyone agreed that she had no family with a child or two in the house there is an unconscious check upon too free an indulgence in the truth  children are given us to discourage our better emotions  that is why the stage with all its efforts can never be as artificial as life even in an ibsen drama one must reveal to the audience things that one would suppress before the children or servants  fate may have ordained the truthtelling from the commencement and should justly bear some of the blame but in having no children the woman was guilty at least of contributory negligence  little by little she felt she was becoming a slave to what had once been merely an idle propensity and one day she knew  every woman tells ninety per cent of the truth to her dressmaker the other ten per cent is the irreducible minimum of deception beyond which no selfrespecting client trespasses  madame dragas establishment was a meetingground for naked truths and overdressed fictions and it was here the woman felt that she might make a final effort to recall the artless mendacity of past days  madame herself was in an inspiring mood with the air of a sphinx who knew all things and preferred to forget most of them  as a war minister she might have been celebrated but she was content to be merely rich  if i take it in here andmiss howard one moment if you pleaseand there and round like thissoi really think you will find it quite easy  the woman hesitated it seemed to require such a small effort to simply acquiesce in madames views  but habit had become too strong  im afraid she faltered its just the least little bit in the world too  and by that least little bit she measured the deeps and eternities of her thraldom to fact  madame was not best pleased at being contradicted on a professional matter and when madame lost her temper you usually found it afterwards in the bill  and at last the dreadful thing came as the woman had foreseen all along that it must it was one of those paltry little truths with which she harried her waking hours  on a raw wednesday morning in a few illchosen words she told the cook that she drank  she remembered the scene afterwards as vividly as though it had been painted in her mind by abbey  the cook was a good cook as cooks go and as cooks go she went  miriam klopstock came to lunch the next day  women and elephants never forget an injury     reginalds drama   reginald closed his eyes with the elaborate weariness of one who has rather nice eyelashes and thinks it useless to conceal the fact  one of these days he said i shall write a really great drama  no one will understand the drift of it but everyone will go back to their homes with a vague feeling of dissatisfaction with their lives and surroundings  then they will put up new wallpapers and forget  but how about those that have oak panelling all over the house said the other  they can always put down new staircarpets pursued reginald and anyhow im not responsible for the audience having a happy ending  the play would be quite sufficient strain on ones energies  i should get a bishop to say it was immoral and beautifulno dramatist has thought of that before and everyone would come to condemn the bishop and they would stay on out of sheer nervousness  after all it requires a great deal of moral courage to leave in a marked manner in the middle of the second act when your carriage isnt ordered till twelve  and it would commence with wolves worrying something on a lonely wasteyou wouldnt see them of course but you would hear them snarling and scrunching and i should arrange to have a wolfy fragrance suggested across the footlights  it would look so well on the programmes wolves in the first act by jamrach  and old lady whortleberry who never misses a first night would scream  shes always been nervous since she lost her first husband  he died quite abruptly while watching a county cricket match two and a half inches of rain had fallen for seven runs and it was supposed that the excitement killed him  anyhow it gave her quite a shock it was the first husband shed lost you know and now she always screams if anything thrilling happens too soon after dinner  and after the audience had heard the whortleberry scream the thing would be fairly launched  and the plot  the plot said reginald would be one of those little everyday tragedies that one sees going on all round one  in my minds eye there is the case of the mudgejervises which in an unpretentious way has quite an enoch arden intensity underlying it  theyd only been married some eighteen months or so and circumstances had prevented their seeing much of each other  with him there was always a foursome or something that had to be played and replayed in different parts of the country and she went in for slumming quite as seriously as if it was a sport  with her i suppose it was  she belonged to the guild of the poor dear souls and they hold the record for having nearly reformed a washerwoman no one has ever really reformed a washerwoman and that is why the competition is so keen  you can rescue charwomen by fifties with a little tea and personal magnetism but with washerwomen its different wages are too high  this particular laundress who came from bermondsey or some such place was really rather a hopeful venture and they thought at last that she might be safely put in the window as a specimen of successful work  so they had her paraded at a drawingroom at home at agatha camelfords it was sheer bad luck that some liqueur chocolates had been turned loose by mistake among the refreshmentsreally liqueur chocolates with very little chocolate  and of course the old soul found them out and cornered the entire stock  it was like finding a whelk stall in a desert as she afterwards partially expressed herself  when the liqueurs began to take effect she started to give them imitations of farmyard animals as they know them in bermondsey  she began with a dancing bear and you know agatha doesnt approve of dancing except at buckingham palace under proper supervision  and then she got up on the piano and gave them an organ monkey i gather she went in for realism rather than a maeterlinckian treatment of the subject  finally she fell into the piano and said she was a parrot in a cage and for an impromptu performance i believe she was very wordperfect no one had heard anything like it except baroness boobelstein who has attended sittings of the austrian reichsrath  agatha is trying the restcure at buxton  but the tragedy  oh the mudgejervises  well they were getting along quite happily and their married life was one continuous exchange of picturepostcards and then one day they were thrown together on some neutral ground where foursomes and washerwomen overlapped and discovered that they were hopelessly divided on the fiscal question  they have thought it best to separate and she is to have the custody of the persian kittens for nine months in the yearthey go back to him for the winter when she is abroad  there you have the material for a tragedy drawn straight from lifeand the piece could be called the price they paid for empire  and of course one would have to work in studies of the struggle of hereditary tendency against environment and all that sort of thing  the womans father could have been an envoy to some of the smaller german courts thats where shed get her passion for visiting the poor in spite of the most careful upbringing  cest le premier pa qui compte as the cuckoo said when it swallowed its fosterparent  that i think is quite clever  and the wolves  oh the wolves would be a sort of elusive undercurrent in the background that would never be satisfactorily explained  after all life teems with things that have no earthly reason  and whenever the characters could think of nothing brilliant to say about marriage or the war office they could open a window and listen to the howling of the wolves  but that would be very seldom     reginald on tariffs   im not going to discuss the fiscal question said reginald i wish to be original  at the same time i think one suffers more than one realises from the system of free imports  i should like for instance a really prohibitive duty put upon the partner who declares on a weak red suit and hopes for the best  even a free outlet for compressed verbiage doesnt balance matters  and i think there should be a sort of bounty fed export is that the right expression of the people who impress on you that you ought to take life seriously  there are only two classes that really cant help taking life seriouslyschoolgirls of thirteen and hohenzollerns they might be exempt  albanians come under another heading they take life whenever they get the opportunity  the one albanian that i was ever on speaking terms with was rather a decadent example  he was a christian and a grocer and i dont fancy he had ever killed anybody  i didnt like to question him on the subjectthat showed my delicacy  mrs nicorax says i have no delicacy she hasnt forgiven me about the mice  you see when i was staying down there a mouse used to cakewalk about my room half the night and none of their silly patent traps seemed to take its fancy as a bijou residence so i determined to appeal to the better side of itwhich with mice is the inside  so i called it percy and put little delicacies down near its hole every night and that kept it quiet while i read max nordaus degeneration and other reproving literature and went to sleep  and now she says there is a whole colony of mice in that room  that isnt where the indelicacy comes in  she went out riding with me which was entirely her own suggestion and as we were coming home through some meadows she made a quite unnecessary attempt to see if her pony would jump a rather messy sort of brook that was there  it wouldnt  it went with her as far as the waters edge and from that point mrs nicorax went on alone  of course i had to fish her out from the bank and my ridingbreeches are not cut with a view to salmonfishingits rather an art even to ride in them  her habitskirt was one of those open questions that need not be adhered to in emergencies and on this occasion it remained behind in some waterweeds  she wanted me to fish about for that too but i felt i had done enough pharaohs daughter business for an october afternoon and i was beginning to want my tea  so i bundled her up on to her pony and gave her a lead towards home as fast as i cared to go  what with the wet and the unusual responsibility her abridged costume did not stand the pace particularly well and she got quite querulous when i shouted back that i had no pins with meand no string  some women expect so much from a fellow  when we got into the drive she wanted to go up the back way to the stables but the ponies know they always get sugar at the front door and i never attempt to hold a pulling pony as for mrs nicorax it took her all she knew to keep a firm hand on her seceding garments which as her maid remarked afterwards were more tout than ensemble  of course nearly the whole houseparty were out on the lawn watching the sunsetthe only day this month that its occurred to the sun to show itself as mrs nic viciously observedand i shall never forget the expression on her husbands face as we pulled up  my darling this is too much was his first spoken comment taking into consideration the state of her toilet it was the most brilliant thing i had ever heard him say and i went into the library to be alone and scream  mrs nicorax says i have no delicacy  talking about tariffs the liftboy who reads extensively between the landings says it wont do to tax raw commodities  what exactly is a raw commodity  mrs van challaby says men are raw commodities till you marry them after theyve struck mrs van c i can fancy they pretty soon become a finished article  certainly shes had a good deal of experience to support her opinion  she lost one husband in a railway accident and mislaid another in the divorce court and the current one has just got himself squeezed in a beef trust  what was he doing in a beef trust anyway she asked tearfully and i suggested that perhaps he had an unhappy home  i only said it for the sake of making conversation which it did  mrs van challaby said things about me which in her calmer moments she would have hesitated to spell  its a pity people cant discuss fiscal matters without getting wild  however she wrote next day to ask if i could get her a yorkshire terrier of the size and shade thats being worn now and thats as near as a woman can be expected to get to owning herself in the wrong  and she will tie a salmonpink bow to its collar and call it reggie and take it with her everywherelike poor miriam klopstock who would take her chow with her to the bathroom and while she was bathing it was playing at shebears with her garments  miriam is always late for breakfast and she wasnt really missed till the middle of lunch  however im not going any further into the fiscal question  only i should like to be protected from the partner with a weak red tendency     reginalds christmas revel   they say said reginald that theres nothing sadder than victory except defeat  if youve ever stayed with dull people during what is alleged to be the festive season you can probably revise that saying  i shall never forget putting in a christmas at the babwolds  mrs babwold is some relation of my fathersa sort of tobelefttillcalledfor cousinand that was considered sufficient reason for my having to accept her invitation at about the sixth time of asking though why the sins of the father should be visited by the childrenyou wont find any notepaper in that drawer thats where i keep old menus and firstnight programmes  mrs babwold wears a rather solemn personality and has never been known to smile even when saying disagreeable things to her friends or making out the stores list  she takes her pleasures sadly  a state elephant at a durbar gives one a very similar impression  her husband gardens in all weathers  when a man goes out in the pouring rain to brush caterpillars off rosetrees i generally imagine his life indoors leaves something to be desired anyway it must be very unsettling for the caterpillars  of course there were other people there  there was a major somebody who had shot things in lapland or somewhere of that sort i forget what they were but it wasnt for want of reminding  we had them cold with every meal almost and he was continually giving us details of what they measured from tip to tip as though he thought we were going to make them warm underthings for the winter  i used to listen to him with a rapt attention that i thought rather suited me and then one day i quite modestly gave the dimensions of an okapi i had shot in the lincolnshire fens  the major turned a beautiful tyrian scarlet i remember thinking at the time that i should like my bathroom hung in that colour and i think that at that moment he almost found it in his heart to dislike me mrs babwold put on a firstaidtotheinjured expression and asked him why he didnt publish a book of his sporting reminiscences it would be so interesting  she didnt remember till afterwards that he had given her two fat volumes on the subject with his portrait and autograph as a frontispiece and an appendix on the habits of the arctic mussel  it was in the evening that we cast aside the cares and distractions of the day and really lived  cards were thought to be too frivolous and empty a way of passing the time so most of them played what they called a book game  you went out into the hallto get an inspiration i supposethen you came in again with a muffler tied round your neck and looked silly and the others were supposed to guess that you were wee macgreegor  i held out against the inanity as long as i decently could but at last in a lapse of goodnature i consented to masquerade as a book only i warned them that it would take some time to carry out  they waited for the best part of forty minutes while i went and played wineglass skittles with the pageboy in the pantry you play it with a champagne cork you know and the one who knocks down the most glasses without breaking them wins  i won with four unbroken out of seven i think william suffered from overanxiousness  they were rather mad in the drawingroom at my not having come back and they werent a bit pacified when i told them afterwards that i was at the end of the passage  i never did like kipling was mrs babwolds comment when the situation dawned upon her  i couldnt see anything clever in earthworms out of tuscanyor is that by darwin  of course these games are very educational but personally i prefer bridge  on christmas evening we were supposed to be specially festive in the old english fashion  the hall was horribly draughty but it seemed to be the proper place to revel in and it was decorated with japanese fans and chinese lanterns which gave it a very old english effect  a young lady with a confidential voice favoured us with a long recitation about a little girl who died or did something equally hackneyed and then the major gave us a graphic account of a struggle he had with a wounded bear i privately wished that the bears would win sometimes on these occasions at least they wouldnt go vapouring about it afterwards  before we had time to recover our spirits we were indulged with some thoughtreading by a young man whom one knew instinctively had a good mother and an indifferent tailorthe sort of young man who talks unflaggingly through the thickest soup and smooths his hair dubiously as though he thought it might hit back  the thoughtreading was rather a success he announced that the hostess was thinking about poetry and she admitted that her mind was dwelling on one of austins odes  which was near enough  i fancy she had been really wondering whether a scragend of mutton and some cold plumpudding would do for the kitchen dinner next day  as a crowning dissipation they all sat down to play progressive halma with milkchocolate for prizes  ive been carefully brought up and i dont like to play games of skill for milkchocolate so i invented a headache and retired from the scene  i had been preceded a few minutes earlier by miss langshansmith a rather formidable lady who always got up at some uncomfortable hour in the morning and gave you the impression that she had been in communication with most of the european governments before breakfast  there was a paper pinned on her door with a signed request that she might be called particularly early on the morrow  such an opportunity does not come twice in a lifetime  i covered up everything except the signature with another notice to the effect that before these words should meet the eye she would have ended a misspent life was sorry for the trouble she was giving and would like a military funeral  a few minutes later i violently exploded an airfilled paper bag on the landing and gave a stage moan that could have been heard in the cellars then i pursued my original intention and went to bed  the noise those people made in forcing open the good ladys door was positively indecorous she resisted gallantly but i believe they searched her for bullets for about a quarter of an hour as if she had been an historic battlefield  i hate travelling on boxing day but one must occasionally do things that one dislikes     reginalds rubaiyat   the other day confided reginald when i was killing time in the bathroom and making bad resolutions for the new year it occurred to me that i would like to be a poet  the chief qualification i understand is that you must be born  well i hunted up my birth certificate and found that i was all right on that score and then i got to work on a hymn to the new year which struck me as having possibilities  it suggested extremely unusual things to absolutely unlikely people which i believe is the art of firstclass catering in any department  quite the best verse in it went something like this     have you heard the groan of a gravelled grouse    or the snarl of a snaffled snail    husband or mother like me or spouse    have you lain acreep in the darkened house    where the wounded wombats wail  it was quite improbable that anyone had you know and thats where it stimulated the imagination and took people out of their narrow humdrum selves  no one has ever called me narrow or humdrum but even i felt worked up now and then at the thought of that house with the stricken wombats in it  it simply wasnt nice  but the editors were unanimous in leaving it alone they said the thing had been done before and done worse and that the market for that sort of work was extremely limited  it was just on the top of that discouragement that the duchess wanted me to write something in her albumsomething persian you know and just a little bit decadentand i thought a quatrain on an unwholesome egg would meet the requirements of the case  so i started in with     cackle cackle little hen    how i wonder if and when    once you laid the egg that i    met alas too late  amen  the duchess objected to the amen which i thought gave an air of forgiveness and chose jugee to the whole thing also she said it wasnt persian enough as though i were trying to sell her a kitten whose mother had married for love rather than pedigree  so i recast it entirely and the new version read     the hen that laid thee moons ago who knows    in what dead yesterday her shades repose    to some election turn thy waning span    and rain thy rottenness on fiscal foes  i thought there was enough suggestion of decay in that to satisfy a jackal and to me there was something infinitely pathetic and appealing in the idea of the egg having a sort of st lukes summer of commercial usefulness  but the duchess begged me to leave out any political allusions shes the president of a womens something or other and she said it might be taken as an endorsement of deplorable methods  i never can remember which party irene discourages with her support but i shant forget an occasion when i was staying at her place and she gave me a pamphlet to leave at the house of a doubtful voter and some grapes and things for a woman who was suffering from a chill on the top of a patent medicine  i thought it much cleverer to give the grapes to the former and the political literature to the sick woman and the duchess was quite absurdly annoyed about it afterwards  it seems the leaflet was addressed to those about to wobblei wasnt responsible for the silly title of the thingand the woman never recovered anyway the voter was completely won over by the grapes and jellies and i think that should have balanced matters  the duchess called it bribery and said it might have compromised the candidate she was supporting he was expected to subscribe to church funds and chapel funds and football and cricket clubs and regattas and bazaars and beanfeasts and bellringers and poultry shows and ploughing matches and readingrooms and choir outings and shooting trophies and testimonials and anything of that sort but bribery would not have been tolerated  i fancy i have perhaps more talent for electioneering than for poetry and i was really getting extended over this quatrain business  the egg began to be unmanageable and the duchess suggested something with a french literary ring about it  i hunted back in my mind for the most familiar french classic that i could take liberties with and after a little exercise of memory i turned out the following     hast thou the pen that once the gardener had    i have it not and know these pears are bad    oh larger than the horses of the prince    are those the general drives in kaikobad  even that didnt altogether satisfy irene i fancy the geography of it puzzled her  she probably thought kaikobad was an unfashionable german spa where youd meet matrimonial bargainhunters and emergency servian kings  my temper was beginning to slip its moorings by that time  i look rather nice when i lose my temper  i hoped you would say i lose it very often  i mustnt monopolise the conversation  of course if you want something really persian and passionate with red wine and bulbuls in it i went on to suggest but she grabbed the book away from me  not for worlds  nothing with red wine or passion in it  dear agatha gave me the album and she would be mortified to the quick  i said i didnt believe agatha had a quick and we got quite heated in arguing the matter  finally the duchess declared i shouldnt write anything nasty in her book and i said i wouldnt write anything in her nasty book so there wasnt a very wide point of difference between us for the rest of the afternoon i pretended to be sulking but i was really working back to that quatrain like a foxterrier thats buried a deferred lunch in a private flowerbed  when i got an opportunity i hunted up agathas autograph which had the front page all to itself and copying her prim handwriting as well as i could i inserted above it the following thibetan fragment     with thee oh my beloved to do a dak    a dak i believe is a sort of uncomfortable postjourney    on the packsaddle of a grunting yak    with never room for chilling chaperone    twere better than a panhard in the park  that agatha would get on to a yak in company with a lover even in the comparative seclusion of thibet is unthinkable  i very much doubt if shed do it with her own husband in the privacy of the simplon tunnel but poetry as ive remarked before should always stimulate the imagination  by the way when you asked me the other day to dine with you on the 14th i said i was dining with the duchess  well im not  im dining with you     the innocence of reginald   reginald slid a carnation of the newest shade into the buttonhole of his latest lounge coat and surveyed the result with approval  i am just in the mood he observed to have my portrait painted by someone with an unmistakable future  so comforting to go down to posterity as youth with a pink carnation in cataloguecompany with child with bunch of primroses and all that crowd  youth said the other should suggest innocence  but never act on the suggestion  i dont believe the two ever really go together  people talk vaguely about the innocence of a little child but they take mighty good care not to let it out of their sight for twenty minutes  the watched pot never boils over  i knew a boy once who really was innocent his parents were in society but they never gave him a moments anxiety from his infancy  he believed in company prospectuses and in the purity of elections and in women marrying for love and even in a system for winning at roulette  he never quite lost his faith in it but he dropped more money than his employers could afford to lose when last i heard of him he was believing in his innocence the jury werent  all the same i really am innocent just now of something everyone accuses me of having done and so far as i can see their accusations will remain unfounded  rather an unexpected attitude for you  i love people who do unexpected things  didnt you always adore the man who slew a lion in a pit on a snowy day  but about this unfortunate innocence  well quite long ago when id been quarrelling with more people than usual you among the numberit must have been in november i never quarrel with you too near christmasi had an idea that id like to write a book  it was to be a book of personal reminiscences and was to leave out nothing  reginald  exactly what the duchess said when i mentioned it to her  i was provoking and said nothing and the next thing of course was that everyone heard that id written the book and got it in the press  after that i might have been a goldfish in a glass bowl for all the privacy i got  people attacked me about it in the most unexpected places and implored or commanded me to leave out things that id forgotten had ever happened  i sat behind miriam klopstock one night in the dress circle at his majestys and she began at once about the incident of the chow dog in the bathroom which she insisted must be struck out  we had to argue it in a disjointed fashion because some of the people wanted to listen to the play and miriam takes nines in voices  they had to stop her playing in the macaws hockey club because you could hear what she thought when her shins got mixed up in a scrimmage for half a mile on a still day  they are called the macaws because of their blueandyellow costumes but i understand there was nothing yellow about miriams language  i agreed to make one alteration as i pretended i had got it a spitz instead of a chow but beyond that i was firm  she megaphoned back two minutes later you promised you would never mention it dont you ever keep a promise  when people had stopped glaring in our direction i replied that id as soon think of keeping white mice  i saw her tearing little bits out of her programme for a minute or two and then she leaned back and snorted youre not the boy i took you for as though she were an eagle arriving at olympus with the wrong ganymede that was her last audible remark but she went on tearing up her programme and scattering the pieces around her till one of her neighbours asked with immense dignity whether she should send for a wastepaper basket  i didnt stay for the last act  then there is mrsoh i never can remember her name she lives in a street that the cabmen have never heard of and is at home on wednesdays she frightened me horribly once at a private view by saying mysteriously i oughtnt to be here you know this is one of my days  i thought she meant that she was subject to periodical outbreaks and was expecting an attack at any moment  so embarrassing if she had suddenly taken it into her head that she was cesar borgia or st elizabeth of hungary  that sort of thing would make one unpleasantly conspicuous even at a private view  however she merely meant to say that it was wednesday which at the moment was incontrovertible  well shes on quite a different tack to the klopstock  she doesnt visit anywhere very extensively and of course shes awfully keen for me to drag in an incident that occurred at one of the beauwhistle gardenparties when she says she accidentally hit the shins of a serene somebody or other with a croquet mallet and that he swore at her in german  as a matter of fact he went on discoursing on the gordonbennett affair in french  i never can remember if its a new submarine or a divorce  of course how stupid of me  to be disagreeably exact i fancy she missed him by about two inchesoveranxiousness probablybut she likes to think she hit him ive felt that way with a partridge which i always imagine keeps on flying strong out of false pride till its the other side of the hedge she said she could tell me everything she was wearing on the occasion  i said i didnt want my book to read like a laundry list but she explained that she didnt mean those sort of things  and theres the chilworth boy who can be charming as long as hes content to be stupid and wear what hes told to but he gets the idea now and then that hed like to be epigrammatic and the result is like watching a rook trying to build a nest in a gale  since he got wind of the book hes been persecuting me to work in something of his about the russians and the yalu peril and is quite sulky because i wont do it  altogether i think it would be rather a brilliant inspiration if you were to suggest a fortnight in paris
