9644879	the path of duty  by henry james  1885   i am glad i said to you the other night at doubleton inquiringtoo inquiringcompatriot that i wouldnt undertake to tell you the story about ambrose tester but would write it out for you inasmuch as thinking it over since i came back to town i see that it may really be made interesting it is a story with a regular development and for telling it i have the advantage that i happened to know about it from the first and was more or less in the confidence of every one concerned then it will amuse me to write it and i shall do so as carefully and as cleverly as possible the first winter days in london are not madly gay so that i have plenty of time and if the fog is brown outside the fire is red within i like the quiet of this season the glowing chimneycorner in the midst of the december mirk makes me think as i sit by it of all sorts of things the idea that is almost always uppermost is the bigness and strangeness of this london world long as i have lived herethe sixteenth anniversary of my marriage is only ten days offthere is still a kind of novelty and excitement in it it is a great pull as they say here to have remained sensitiveto have kept ones own point of view i mean its more entertainingit makes you see a thousand things not that they are all very charming but the pleasure of observation does not in the least depend on the beauty of what one observes you see innumerable little dramas in fact almost everything has acts and scenes like a comedy very often it is a comedy with tears there have been a good many of them i am afraid in the case i am speaking of it is because this history of sir ambrose tester and lady vandeleur struck me when you asked me about the relations of the parties as having that kind of progression that when i was on the point of responding i checked myself thinking it a pity to tell you a little when i might tell you all i scarcely know what made you ask inasmuch as i had said nothing to excite your curiosity whatever you suspected you suspected on your own hook as they say you had simply noticed the pair together that evening at doubleton if you suspected anything in particular it is a proof that you are rather sharp because they are very careful about the way they behave in public at least they think they are the result perhaps doesnt necessarily follow if i have been in their confidence you may say that i make a strange use of my privilege in serving them up to feed the prejudices of an opinionated american you think english society very wicked and my little story will probably not correct the impression though after all i dont see why it should minister to it for what i said to you it was all i did say remains the truth they are treading together the path of duty you would be quite right about its being base in me to betray them it is very true that they have ceased to confide in me even joscelind has said nothing to me for more than a year that is doubtless a sign that the situation is more serious than before all roundtoo serious to be talked about it is also true that you are remarkably discreet and that even if you were not it would not make much difference inasmuch as if you were to repeat my revelations in america no one would know whom you were talking about but all the same i should be base and therefore after i have written out my reminiscences for your delectation i shall simply keep them for my own you must content yourself with the explanation i have already given you of sir ambrose tester and lady vandeleur they are followinghand in hand as it werethe path of duty this will not prevent me from telling everything on the contrary dont you see     i  his brilliant prospects dated from the death of his brother who had no children had indeed steadily refused to marry when i say brilliant prospects i mean the vision of the baronetcy one of the oldest in england of a charming seventeenthcentury house with its park in dorsetshire and a property worth some twenty thousand a year such a collection of items is still dazzling to me even after what you would call i suppose a familiarity with british grandeur my husband is nt a baronet or we probably should nt be in london in december and he is far alas from having twenty thousand a year the full enjoyment of these luxuries on ambrose testers part was dependent naturally on the death of his father who was still very much to the fore at the time i first knew the young man the proof of it is the way he kept nagging at his sons as the younger used to say on the question of taking a wife the nagging had been of no avail as i have mentioned with regard to francis the elder whose affections were centred his brother himself told me on the winecup and the farotable he was not an exemplary or edifying character and as the heir to an honorable name and a fine estate was very unsatisfactory indeed it had been possible in those days to put him into the army but it was not possible to keep him there and he was still a very young man when it became plain that any parental dream of a career for frank tester was exceedingly vain old sir edmund had thought matrimony would perhaps correct him but a sterner process than this was needed and it came to him one day at monacohe was most of the time abroadafter an illness so short that none of the family arrived in time he was reformed altogether he was utterly abolished  the second son stepping into his shoes was such an improvement that it was impossible there should be much simulation of mourning you have seen him you know what he is there is very little mystery about him as i am not going to show this composition to you there is no harm in my writing here that he isor at any rate he wasa remarkably attractive man i dont say this because he made love to me but precisely because he did nt he was always in love with some one elsegenerally with lady vandeleur you may say that in england that usually does nt prevent but mr tester though he had almost no intermissions did nt as a general thing have duplicates he was not provided with a second loved object understudying as they say the part it was his practice to keep me accurately informed of the state of his affectionsa matter about which he was never in the least vague when he was in love he knew it and rejoiced in it and when by a miracle he was not he greatly regretted it he expatiated to me on the charms of other persons and this interested me much more than if he had attempted to direct the conversation to my own as regards which i had no illusions he has told me some singular things and i think i may say that for a considerable period my most valued knowledge of english society was extracted from this genial youth i suppose he usually found me a woman of good counsel for certain it is that he has appealed to me for the light of wisdom in very extraordinary predicaments in his earlier years he was perpetually in hot water he tumbled into scrapes as children tumble into puddles he invited them he invented them and when he came to tell you how his trouble had come about and he always told the whole truth it was difficult to believe that a man should have been so idiotic  and yet he was not an idiot he was supposed to be very clever and certainly is very quick and amusing he was only reckless and extraordinarily natural as natural as if he had been an irishman in fact of all the englishmen that i have known he is the most irish in temperament though he has got over it comparatively of late i used to tell him that it was a great inconvenience that he didnt speak with a brogue because then we should be forewarned and know with whom we were dealing he replied that by analogy if he were irish enough to have a brogue he would probably be english which seemed to me an answer wonderfully in character like most young britons of his class he went to america to see the great country before he was twenty and he took a letter to my father who had occasion Ã  propos of some pickle of course to render him a considerable service this led to his coming to see mei had already been living here three or four yearson his return and that in the course of time led to our becoming fast friends without as i tell you the smallest philandering on either side but i must nt protest too much i shall excite your suspicion if he has made love to so many women why should nt he have made love to yousome inquiry of that sort you will be likely to make i have answered it already simply on account of those very engagements he could nt make love to every one and with me it would nt have done him the least good it was a more amiable weakness than his brothers and he has always behaved very well how well he behaved on a very important occasion is precisely the subject of my story  he was supposed to have embraced the diplomatic career had been secretary of legation at some german capital but after his brothers death he came home and looked out for a seat in parliament he found it with no great trouble and has kept it ever since no one would have the heart to turn him out he is so goodlooking its a great thing to be represented by one of the handsomest men in england it creates such a favorable association of ideas any one would be amazed to discover that the borough he sits for and the name of which i am always forgetting is not a very pretty place i have never seen it and have no idea that it is nt and i am sure he will survive every revolution the people must feel that if they should nt keep him some monster would be returned you remember his appearancehow tall and fair and strong he is and always laughing yet without looking silly he is exactly the young man girls in america figure to themselvesin the place of the herowhen they read english novels and wish to imagine something very aristocratic and saxon a bright bostonian who met him once at my house exclaimed as soon as he had gone out of the room at last at last i behold it the mustache of roland tremayne  of roland tremayne  dont you remember in a lawless love how often its mentioned and how glorious and golden it was well i have never seen it till now but now i have seen it  if you had nt seen ambrose tester the best description i could give of him would be to say that he looked like roland tremayne i dont know whether that hero was a strong liberal but this is what sir ambrose is supposed to be he succeeded his father two years ago but i shall come to that he is not exactly what i should call thoughtful but he is interested or thinks he is in a lot of things that i dont understand and that one sees and skips in the newspapersvolunteering and redistribution and sanitation and the representation of minorsminoritieswhat is it when i said just now that he is always laughing i ought to have explained that i did nt mean when he is talking to lady vandeleur she makes him serious makes him almost solemn by which i dont mean that she bores him far from it but when he is in her company he is thoughtful he pulls his golden mustache and roland tremayne looks as if his vision were turned in and he were meditating on her words he does nt say much himself it is sheshe used to be so silentwho does the talking she has plenty to say to him she describes to him the charms that she discovers in the path of duty he seldom speaks in the house i believe but when he does its offhand and amusing and sensible and every one likes it he will never be a great statesman but he will add to the softness of dorsetshire and remain in short a very gallant pleasant prosperous typical english gentleman with a name a fortune a perfect appearance a devoted bewildered little wife a great many reminiscences a great many friends including lady vandeleur and myself and strange to say with all these advantages something that faintly resembles a conscience     ii  five years ago he told me his father insisted on his marryingwould not hear of his putting it off any longer sir edmund had been harping on this string ever since he came back from germany had made it both a general and a particular request not only urging him to matrimony in the abstract but pushing him into the arms of every young woman in the country ambrose had promised procrastinated temporized but at last he was at the end of his evasions and his poor father had taken the tone of supplication he thinks immensely of the name of the place and all that and he has got it into his head that if i dont marry before he dies i wont marry after so much i remember ambrose tester said to me its a fixed idea he has got it on the brain he wants to see me married with his eyes and he wants to take his grandson in his arms not without that will he be satisfied that the whole thing will go straight he thinks he is nearing his end but he isnthe will live to see a hundred dont you think soand he has made me a solemn appeal to put an end to what he calls his suspense he has an idea some one will get hold of mesome woman i cant marry as if i were not old enough to take care of myself  perhaps he is afraid of me i suggested facetiously  no it is nt you said my visitor betraying by his tone that it was some one though he didnt say whom thats all rot of course one marries sooner or later and i shall do like every one else if i marry before i die its as good as if i marry before he dies is nt it i should be delighted to have the governor at my wedding but it is nt necessary for the legality is it  i asked him what he wished me to do and how i could help him he knew already my peculiar views that i was trying to get husbands for all the girls of my acquaintance and to prevent the men from taking wives the sight of an ummarried woman afflicted me and yet when my male friends changed their state i took it as a personal offence he let me know that so far as he was concerned i must prepare myself for this injury for he had given his father his word that another twelvemonth should not see him a bachelor the old man had given him carte blanche he made no condition beyond exacting that the lady should have youth and health ambrose tester at any rate had taken a vow and now he was going seriously to look about him i said to him that what must be must be and that there were plenty of charming girls about the land among whom he could suit himself easily enough there was no better match in england i said and he would only have to make his choice that however is not what i thought for my real reflections were summed up in the silent exclamation what a pity lady vandeleur isnt a widow i hadnt the smallest doubt that if she were he would marry her on the spot and after he had gone i wondered considerably what she thought of this turn in his affairs if it was disappointing to me how little it must be to her taste sir edmund had not been so much out of the way in fearing there might be obstacles to his sons taking the step he desired margaret vandeleur was an obstacle i knew it as well as if mr tester had told me  i dont mean there was anything in their relation he might not freely have alluded to for lady vandeleur in spite of her beauty and her tiresome husband was not a woman who could be accused of an indiscretion her husband was a pedant about triflesthe shape of his hatbrim the pose of his coachman and cared for nothing else but she was as nearly a saint as one may be when one has rubbed shoulders for ten years with the best society in europe it is a characteristic of that society that even its saints are suspected and i go too far in saying that little pinpricks were not administered in considerable numbers to her reputation but she did nt feel them for still more than ambrose tester she was a person to whose happiness a good conscience was necessary i should almost say that for her happiness it was sufficient and at any rate it was only those who didnt know her that pretended to speak of her lightly if one had the honor of her acquaintance one might have thought her rather shut up to her beauty and her grandeur but one could nt but feel there was something in her composition that would keep her from vulgar aberrations her husband was such a feeble type that she must have felt doubly she had been put upon her honor to deceive such a man as that was to make him more ridiculous than he was already and from such a result a woman bearing his name may very well have shrunk perhaps it would have been worse for lord vandeleur who had every pretension of his order and none of its amiability if he had been a better or at least a cleverer man when a woman behaves so well she is not obliged to be careful and there is no need of consulting appearances when one is ones self an appearance lady vandeleur accepted ambrose testers attentions and heaven knows they were frequent but she had such an air of perfect equilibrium that one could nt see her in imagination bend responsive incense was incense but one saw her sitting quite serene among the fumes that honor of her acquaintance of which i just now spoke it had been given me to enjoy that is to say i met her a dozen times in the season in a hot crowd and we smiled sweetly and murmured a vague question or two without hearing or even trying to hear each others answer if i knew that ambrose tester was perpetually in and out of her house and always arranging with her that they should go to the same places i doubt whether she on her side knew how often he came to see me i dont think he would have let her know and am conscious in saying this that it indicated an advanced state of intimacy with her i mean  i also doubt very much whether he asked her to look about on his behalf for a future lady tester this request he was so good as to make of me but i told him i would have nothing to do with the matter if joscelind is unhappy i am thankful to say the responsibility is not mine i have found english husbands for two or three american girls but providing english wives is a different affair i know the sort of men that will suit women but one would have to be very clever to know the sort of women that will suit men i told ambrose tester that he must look out for himself but in spite of his promise i had very little belief that he would do anything of the sort i thought it probable that the old baronet would pass away without seeing a new generation come in though when i intimated as much to mr tester he made answer in substance it was not quite so crudely said that his father old as he was would hold on till his bidding was done and if it should not be done he would hold on out of spite oh he will tire me out that i remember ambrose tester did say i had done him injustice for six months later he told me he was engaged it had all come about very suddenly from one day to the other the right young woman had been found i forget who had found her some aunt or cousin i think it had not been the young man himself but when she was found he rose to the occasion he took her up seriously he approved of her thoroughly and i am not sure that he didnt fall a little in love with her ridiculous excuse my london tone as this accident may appear he told me that his father was delighted and i knew afterwards that he had good reason to be it was not till some weeks later that i saw the girl but meanwhile i had received the pleasantest impression of her and this impression camemust have comemainly from what her intended told me that proves that he spoke with some positiveness spoke as if he really believed he was doing a good thing i had it on my tongues end to ask him how lady vandeleur liked her but i fortunately checked this vulgar inquiry he liked her evidently as i say every one liked her and when i knew her i liked her better even than the others i like her today more than ever it is fair you should know that in reading this account of her situation it doubtless colors my picture gives a point to my sense of the strangeness of my little story  joscelind bernardstone came of a military race and had been brought up in campsby which i dont mean she was one of those objectionable young women who are known as garrison hacks she was in the flower of her freshness and had been kept in the tent receiving as an only daughter the most particular education from the excellent lady emily general bernardstone married a daughter of lord clandufly who looks like a pinkfaced rabbit and is after joscelind one of the nicest women i know when i met them in a countryhouse a few weeks after the marriage was arranged as they say here joscelind won my affections by saying to me with her timid directness the speech made me feel sixty years old that she must thank me for having been so kind to mr tester you saw her at doubleton and you will remember that though she has no regular beauty many a prettier woman would be very glad to look like her she is as fresh as a newlaid egg as light as a feather as strong as a mailphaeton she is perfectly mild yet she is clever enough to be sharp if she would i dont know that clever women are necessarily thought illnatured but it is usually taken for granted that amiable women are very limited lady tester is a refutation of the theory which must have been invented by a vixenish woman who was not clever she has an adoration for her husband which absorbs her without in the least making her silly unless indeed it is silly to be modest as in this brutal world i sometimes believe her modesty is so great that being unhappy has hitherto presented itself to her as a form of egotismthat egotism which she has too much delicacy to cultivate she is by no means sure that if being married to her beautiful baronet is not the ideal state she dreamed it the weak point of the affair is not simply in her own presumption it does nt express her condition at present to say that she is unhappy or disappointed or that she has a sense of injury all this is latent meanwhile what is obvious is that she is bewilderedshe simply does nt understand and her perplexity to me is unspeakably touching she looks about her for some explanation some light she fixes her eyes on mine sometimes and on those of other people with a kind of searching dumbness as if there were some chance that ithat theymay explain may tell her what it is that has happened to her i can explain very well but not to heronly to you     iii  it was a brilliant match for miss bernardstone who had no fortune at all and all her friends were of the opinion that she had done very well after easter she was in london with her people and i saw a good deal of them in fact i rather cultivated them they might perhaps even have thought me a little patronizing if they had been given to thinking that sort of thing but they were not that is not in their line english people are very apt to attribute motivessome of them attribute much worse ones than we poor simpletons in america recognize than we have even heard of but that is only some of them others dont but take everything literally and genially that was the case with the bernardstones you could be sure that on their way home after dining with you they would nt ask each other how in the world any one could call you pretty or say that many people did believe all the same that you had poisoned your grandfather  lady emily was exceedingly gratified at her daughters engagement of course she was very quiet about it she did nt clap her hands or drag in mr testers name but it was easy to see that she felt a kind of maternal peace an abiding satisfaction the young man behaved as well as possible was constantly seen with joscelind and smiled down at her in the kindest most protecting way they looked beautiful together you would have said it was a duty for people whose color matched so well to marry of course he was immensely taken up and did nt come very often to see me but he came sometimes and when he sat there he had a look which i did nt understand at first presently i saw what it expressed in my drawingroom he was off duty he had no longer to sit up and play a part he would lean back and rest and draw a long breath and forget that the day of his execution was fixed there was to be no indecent haste about the marriage it was not to take place till after the session at the end of august it puzzled me and rather distressed me that his heart should nt be a little more in the matter it seemed strange to be engaged to so charming a girl and yet go through with it as if it were simply a social duty if one had nt been in love with her at first one ought to have been at the end of a week or two if ambrose tester was not and to me he did nt pretend to be he carried it off as i have said better than i should have expected he was a gentleman and he behaved like a gentleman with the added punctilio i think of being sorry for his betrothed but it was difficult to see what in the long run he could expect to make of such a position if a man marries an ugly unattractive woman for reasons of state the thing is comparatively simple it is understood between them and he need have no remorse at not offering her a sentiment of which there has been no question but when he picks out a charming creature to gratify his father and les convenances it is not so easy to be happy in not being able to care for her it seemed to me that it would have been much better for ambrose tester to bestow himself upon a girl who might have given him an excuse for tepidity his wife should have been healthy but stupid prolific but morose did he expect to continue not to be in love with joscelind or to conceal from her the mechanical nature of his attentions it was difficult to see how he could wish to do the one or succeed in doing the other did he expect such a girl as that would be happy if he did nt love her and did he think himself capable of being happy if it should turn out that she was miserable if she should nt be miserablethat is if she should be indifferent and as they say console herself would he like that any better  i asked myself all these questions and i should have liked to ask them of mr tester but i did nt for after all he could nt have answered them poor young man he did nt pry into things as i do he was not analytic like us americans as they say in reviews he thought he was behaving remarkably well and so he wasfor a man that was the strange part of it it had been proper that in spite of his reluctance he should take a wife and he had dutifully set about it as a good thing is better for being well done he had taken the best one he could possibly find he was enchanted withwith his young lady you might ask not in the least with himself that is the sort of person a man is their virtues are more dangerous than their vices and heaven preserve you when they want to keep a promise it is never a promise to you you will notice a man will sacrifice a woman to live as a gentleman should and then ask for your sympathyfor him and i dont speak of the bad ones but of the good they after all are the worst ambrose tester as i say did nt go into these details but synthetic as he might be was conscious that his position was false he felt that sooner or later and rather sooner than later he would have to make it truea process that could nt possibly be agreeable he would really have to make up his mind to care for his wife or not to care for her what would lady vandeleur say to one alternative and what would little joscelind say to the other that is what it was to have a pertinacious father and to be an accommodating son with me it was easy for ambrose tester to be superficial for as i tell you if i did nt wish to engage him i did nt wish to disengage him and i did nt insist lady vandeleur insisted i was afraid to be with her was of course very complicated even more than miss bernardstone she must have made him feel that his position was false i must add that he once mentioned to me that she had told him he ought to marry at any rate it is an immense thing to be a pleasant fellow our young fellow was so universally pleasant that of course his fiancÃ©e came in for her share so did lady emily suffused with hope which made her pinker than ever she told me he sent flowers even to her one day in the park i was riding early the row was almost empty i came up behind a lady and gentleman who were walking their horses close to each other side by side in a moment i recognized her but not before seeing that nothing could have been more benevolent than the way ambrose tester was bending over his future wife if he struck me as a lover at that moment of course he struck her so but that is nt the way they ride today     iv  one day about the end of june he came in to see me when i had two or three other visitors you know that even at that season i am almost always at home from six to seven he had not been three minutes in the room before i saw that he was differentdifferent from what he had been the last time and i guessed that something had happened in relation to his marriage my visitors did nt unfortunately and they stayed and stayed until i was afraid he would have to go away without telling me what i was sure he had come for but he sat them out i think that by exception they did nt find him pleasant after we were alone he abused them a little and then he said have you heard about vandeleur he s very ill shes awfully anxious i had nt heard and i told him so asking a question or two then my inquiries ceased my breath almost failed me for i had become aware of something very strange the way he looked at me when he told me his news was a full confessiona confession so full that i had needed a moment to take it in he was not too strong a man to be taken by surprisenot so strong but that in the presence of an unexpected occasion his first movement was to look about for a little help i venture to call it help the sort of thing he came to me for on that summer afternoon it is always help when a woman who is not an idiot lets an embarrassed man take up her time if he too is not an idiot that does nt diminish the service on the contrary his superiority to the average helps him to profit ambrose tester had said to me more than once in the past that he was capable of telling me things because i was an american that he would nt confide to his own people he had proved it before this as i have hinted and i must say that being an american with him was sometimes a questionable honor i dont know whether he thinks us more discreet and more sympathetic if he keeps up the system he has abandoned it with me or only more insensible more proof against shocks but it is certain that like some other englishmen i have known he has appeared in delicate cases to think i would take a comprehensive view when i have inquired into the grounds of this discrimination in our favor he has contented himself with saying in the britishcursory manner oh i dont know you are different i remember he remarked once that our impressions were fresher and i am sure that now it was because of my nationality in addition to other merits that he treated me to the confession i have just alluded to at least i dont suppose he would have gone about saying to people in general her husband will probably die you know then why should nt i marry lady vandeleur  that was the question which his whole expression and manner asked of me and of which after a moment i decided to take no notice why shouldnt he there was an excellent reason why he should nt it would just kill joscelind bernardstone that was why he should nt the idea that he should be ready to do it frightened me and independent as he might think my point of view i had no desire to discuss such abominations it struck me as an abomination at this very first moment and i have never wavered in my judgment of it i am always glad when i can take the measure of a thing as soon as i see it it s a blessing to feel what we think without balancing and comparing its a great rest too and a great luxury that as i say was the case with the feeling excited in me by this happy idea of ambrose testers cruel and wanton i thought it then cruel and wanton i thought it later when it was pressed upon me i knew there were many other people that did nt agree with me and i can only hope for them that their conviction was as quick and positive as mine it all depends upon the way a thing strikes one but i will add to this another remark i thought i was right then and i still think i was right but it strikes me as a pity that i should have wished so much to be right why could nt i be content to be wrong to renounce my influence since i appeared to possess the mystic article and let my young friend do as he liked as you observed the situation at doubleton should nt you say it was of a nature to make one wonder whether after all one did render a service to the younger lady  at all events as i say i gave no sign to ambrose tester that i understood him that i guessed what he wished to come to he got no satisfaction out of me that day it is very true that he made up for it later i expressed regret at lord vandeleurs illness inquired into its nature and origin hoped it would nt prove as grave as might be feared said i would call at the house and ask about him commiserated discreetly her ladyship and in short gave my young man no chance whatever he knew that i had guessed his arriÃ¨repensÃ©e but he let me off for the moment for which i was thankful either because he was still ashamed of it or because he supposed i was reserving myself for the catastropheshould it occur well my dear it did occur at the end of ten days mr tester came to see me twice in that interval each time to tell me that poor vandeleur was worse he had some internal inflammation which in nine cases out of ten is fatal his wife was all devotion she was with him night and day i had the news from other sources as well i leave you to imagine whether in london at the height of the season such a situation could fail to be considerably discussed to the discussion as yet however i contributed little and with ambrose tester nothing at all i was still on my guard i never admitted for a moment that it was possible there should be any change in his plans by this time i think he had quite ceased to be ashamed of his idea he was in a state almost of exaltation about it but he was very angry with me for not giving him an opening  as i look back upon the matter now there is something almost amusing in the way we watched each otherhe thinking that i evaded his question only to torment him he believed me or pretended to believe me capable of this sort of perversity and i determined not to lose ground by betraying an insight into his state of mind which he might twist into an expression of sympathy i wished to leave my sympathy where i had placed it with lady emily and her daughter of whom i continued bumping against them at parties to have some observation they gave no signal of alarm of course it would have been premature the girl i am sure had no idea of the existence of a rival how they had kept her in the dark i dont know but it was easy to see she was too much in love to suspect or to criticise with lady emily it was different she was a woman of charity but she touched the world at too many points not to feel its vibrations however the dear little woman planted herself firmly to the eye she was still enough it was not from ambrose tester that i first heard of lord vandeleurs death it was announced with a quarter of a column of padding in the times i have always known the times was a wonderful journal but this never came home to me so much as when it produced a quarter of a column about lord vandeleur it was a triumph of wordspinning if he had carried out his vocation if he had been a tailor or a hatter thats how i see him there might have been something to say about him but he missed his vocation he missed everything but posthumous honors i was so sure ambrose tester would come in that afternoon and so sure he knew i should expect him that i threw over an engagement on purpose but he didnt come in nor the next day nor the next there were two possible explanations of his absence one was that he was giving all his time to consoling lady vandeleur the other was that he was giving it all as a blind to joscelind bernardstone both proved incorrect for when he at last turned up he told me he had been for a week in the country at his fathers sir edmund also had been unwell but he had pulled through better than poor lord vandeleur i wondered at first whether his son had been talking over with him the question of a change of base but guessed in a moment that he had not suffered this alarm i dont think that ambrose would have spared him if he had thought it necessary to give him warning but he probably held that his father would have no ground for complaint so long as he should marry some one would have no right to remonstrate if he simply transferred his contract lady vandeleur had had two children whom she had lost and might therefore have others whom she should nt lose that would have been a reply to nice discriminations on sir edmunds part     v  in reality what the young man had been doing was thinking it over beneath his ancestral oaks and beeches his countenance showed thisshowed it more than miss bernardstone could have liked he looked like a man who was crossed not like a man who was happy in love i was no more disposed than before to help him out with his plot but at the end of ten minutes we were articulately discussing it when i say we were i mean he was for i sat before him quite mute at first and amazed at the clearness with which before his conscience he had argued his case he had persuaded himself that it was quite a simple matter to throw over poor joscelind and keep himself free for the expiration of lady vandeleurs term of mourning the deliberations of an impulsive man sometimes land him in strange countries ambrose tester confided his plan to me as a tremendous secret he professed to wish immensely to know how it appeared to me and whether my womans wit could nt discover for him some loophole big enough round some honorable way of not keeping faith yet at the same time he seemed not to foresee that i should of necessity be simply horrified disconcerted and perplexed a little that he was prepared to find me but if i had refused as yet to come to his assistance he appeared to suppose it was only because of the real difficulty of suggesting to him that perfect pretext of which he was in want he evidently counted upon me however for some illuminating proposal and i think he would have liked to say to me you have always pretended to be a great friend of minei hadnt the pretension was all on his sideand now is your chance to show it go to joscelind and make her feel women have a hundred ways of doing that sort of thing that through vandeleurs death the change in my situation is complete if she is the girl i take her for she will know what to do in the premises  i was not prepared to oblige him to this degree and i lost no time in telling him so after my first surprise at seeing how definite his purpose had become his contention after all was very simple he had been in love with lady vandeleur for years and was now more in love with her than ever there had been no appearance of her being within a calculable period liberated by the death of her husband this nobleman washe didnt say what just then it was too soonbut he was only forty years old and in such health and preservation as to make such a contingency infinitely remote under these circumstances ambrose had been driven for the most worldly reasonshe was ashamed of them pahinto an engagement with a girl he did nt love and did nt pretend to love suddenly the unexpected occurred the woman he did love had become accessible to him and all the relations of things were altered  why should nt he alter too why should nt miss bernardstone alter lady emily alter and every one alter it would be wrong in him to marry joscelind in so changed a worlda moments consideration would certainly assure me of that he could no longer carry out his part of the bargain and the transaction must stop before it went any further if joscelind knew she would be the first to recognize this and the thing for her now was to know  go and tell her then if you are so sure of it i said i wonder you have put it off so many days  he looked at me with a melancholy eye of course i know its beastly awkward  it was beastly awkward certainly there i could quite agree with him and this was the only sympathy he extracted from me it was impossible to be less helpful less merciful to an embarrassed young man than i was on that occasion but other occasions followed very quickly on which mr tester renewed his appeal with greater eloquence he assured me that it was torture to be with his intended and every hour that he did nt break off committed him more deeply and more fatally i repeated only once my previous questionasked him only once why then he did nt tell her he had changed his mind the inquiry was idle was even unkind for my young man was in a very tight place he did nt tell her simply because he could nt in spite of the anguish of feeling that his chance to right himself was rapidly passing away when i asked him if joscelind appeared to have guessed nothing he broke out how in the world can she guess when i am so kind to her i am so sorry for her poor little wretch that i cant help being nice to her and from the moment i am nice to her she thinks its all right  i could see perfectly what he meant by that and i liked him more for this little generosity than i disliked him for his nefarious scheme in fact i did nt dislike him at all when i saw what an influence my judgment would have on him i very soon gave him the full benefit of it i had thought over his case with all the advantages of his own presentation of it and it was impossible for me to see how he could decently get rid of the girl that as i have said had been my original opinion and quickened reflection only confirmed it as i have also said i had nt in the least recommended him to become engaged but once he had done so i recommended him to abide by it it was all very well being in love with lady vandeleur he might be in love with her but he had nt promised to marry her it was all very well not being in love with miss bernardstone but as it happened he had promised to marry her and in my country a gentleman was supposed to keep such promises if it was a question of keeping them only so long as was convenient where would any of us be i assure you i became very eloquent and moralyes moral i maintain the word in spite of your perhaps thinking as you are very capable of doing that i ought to have advised him in just the opposite sense it was not a question of love but of marriage for he had never promised to love poor joscelind it was useless his saying it was dreadful to marry without love he knew that he thought it and the people he lived with thought it nothing of the kind half his friends had married on those terms yes and a pretty sight their private life presented that might be but it was the first time i had ever heard him say it a fortnight before he had been quite ready to do like the others i knew what i thought and i suppose i expressed it with some clearness for my arguments made him still more uncomfortable unable as he was either to accept them or to act in contempt of them why he should have cared so much for my opinion is a mystery i cant elucidate to understand my little story you must simply swallow it that he did care is proved by the exasperation with which he suddenly broke out well then as i understand you what you recommend me is to marry miss bernardstone and carry on an intrigue with lady vandeleur  he knew perfectly that i recommended nothing of the sort and he must have been very angry to indulge in this boutade he told me that other people did nt think as i didthat every one was of the opinion that between a woman he did nt love and a woman he had adored for years it was a plain moral duty not to hesitate dont hesitate then i exclaimed but i did nt get rid of him with this for he returned to the charge more than once he came to me so often that i thought he must neglect both his other alternatives and let me know again that the voice of society was quite against my view you will doubtless be surprised at such an intimation that he had taken society into his confidence and wonder whether he went about asking people whether they thought he might back out i cant tell you exactly but i know that for some weeks his dilemma was a great deal talked about his friends perceived he was at the parting of the roads and many of them had no difficulty in saying which one they would take some observers thought he ought to do nothing to leave things as they were others took very high ground and discoursed upon the sanctity of love and the wickedness of really deceiving the girl as that would be what it would amount to if he should lead her to the altar some held that it was too late to escape others maintained that it is never too late some thought miss bernardstone very much to be pitied some reserved their compassion for ambrose tester others still lavished it upon lady vandeleur  the prevailing opinion i think was that he ought to obey the promptings of his heartlondon cares so much for the heart or is it that london is simply ferocious and always prefers the spectacle that is more entertaining as it would prolong the drama for the young man to throw over miss bernardstone there was a considerable readiness to see the poor girl sacrificed she was like a christian maiden in the roman arena that is what ambrose tester meant by telling me that public opinion was on his side i dont think he chattered about his quandary but people knowing his situation guessed what was going on in his mind and he on his side guessed what they said london discussions might as well go on in the whisperinggallery of st pauls i could of course do only one thingi could but reaffirm my conviction that the roman attitude as i may call it was cruel was falsely sentimental this naturally did nt help him as he wished to be helpeddid nt remove the obstacle to his marrying in a year or two lady vandeleur yet he continued to look to me for inspirationi must say it at the cost of making him appear a very feebleminded gentleman there was a moment when i thought him capable of an oblique movement of temporizing with a view to escape if he succeeded in postponing his marriage long enough the bernardstones would throw him over and i suspect that for a day he entertained the idea of fixing this responsibility on them but he was too honest and too generous to do so for longer and his destiny was staring him in the face when an accident gave him a momentary relief general bernardstone died after an illness as sudden and short as that which had carried off lord vandeleur his wife and daughter were plunged into mourning and immediately retired into the country a week later we heard that the girls marriage would be put off for several monthspartly on account of her mourning and partly because her mother whose only companion she had now become could not bear to part with her at the time originally fixed and actually so near people of course looked at each othersaid it was the beginning of the end a dodge of ambrose testers i wonder they did nt accuse him of poisoning the poor old general i know to a certainty that he had nothing to do with the delay that the proposal came from lady emily who in her bereavement wished very naturally to keep a few months longer the child she was going to lose forever it must be said in justice to her prospective soninlaw that he was capable either of resigning himself or of frankly with however many blushes telling joscelind he could nt keep his agreement but was not capable of trying to wriggle out of his difficulty the plan of simply telling joscelind he couldntthis was the one he had fixed upon as the best and this was the one of which i remarked to him that it had a defect which should be counted against its advantages the defect was that it would kill joscelind on the spot  i think he believed me and his believing me made this unexpected respite very welcome to him there was no knowing what might happen in the interval and he passed a large part of it in looking for an issue and yet at the same time he kept up the usual forms with the girl whom in his heart he had renounced i was told more than once for i had lost sight of the pair during the summer and autumn that these forms were at times very casual that he neglected miss bernardstone most flagrantly and had quite resumed his old intimacy with lady vandeleur i dont exactly know what was meant by this for she spent the first three months of her widowhood in complete seclusion in her own old house in norfolk where he certainly was not staying with her i believe he stayed some time for the partridge shooting at a place a few miles off it came to my ears that if miss bernardstone did nt take the hint it was because she was determined to stick to him through thick and thin she never offered to let him off and i was sure she never would but i was equally sure that strange as it may appear he had not ceased to be nice to her i have never exactly understood why he didnt hate her and i am convinced that he was not a comedian in his conduct to herhe was only a good fellow i have spoken of the satisfaction that sir edmund took in his daughterinlaw that was to be he delighted in looking at her longed for her when she was out of his sight and had her with her mother staying with him in the country for weeks together if ambrose was not so constantly at her side as he might have been this deficiency was covered by his fathers devotion to her by her appearance of being already one of the family mr tester was away as he might be away if they were already married     vi  in october i met him at doubleton we spent three days there together he was enjoying his respite as he didnt scruple to tell me and he talked to me a great dealas usualabout lady vandeleur he did nt mention joscelinds name except by implication in this assurance of how much he valued his weeks of grace  do you mean to say that under the circumstances lady vandeleur is willing to marry you  i made this inquiry more expressively doubtless than before for when we had talked of the matter then he had naturally spoken of her consent as a simple contingency it was contingent upon the lapse of the first months of her bereavement it was not a question he could begin to press a few days after her husbands death  not immediately of course but if i wait i think so that i remember was his answer  if you wait till you get rid of that poor girl of course  she knows nothing about thatits none of her business  do you mean to say she does nt know you are engaged  how should she know it how should she believe it when she sees how i love her the young man exclaimed but he admitted afterwards that he had not deceived her and that she rendered full justice to the motives that had determined him he thought he could answer for it that she would marry him some day or other  then she is a very cruel woman i said and i should like if you please to hear no more about her he protested against this and a month later brought her up again for a purpose the purpose you will see was a very strange one indeed i had then come back to town it was the early part of december i supposed he was hunting with his own hounds but he appeared one afternoon in my drawingroom and told me i should do him a great favor if i would go and see lady vandeleur  go and see her where do you mean in norfolk  she has come up to londondid nt you know it she has a lot of business she will be kept here till christmas i wish you would go  why should i go i asked wont you be kept here till christmas too and is nt that company enough for her  upon my word you are cruel he said and its a great shame of you when a man is trying to do his duty and is behaving like a saint  is that what you call saintly spending all your time with lady vandeleur i will tell you whom i think a saint if you would like to know  you need nt tell me i know it better than you i havent a word to say against her only she is stupid and hasnt any perceptions if i am stopping a bit in london you dont understand why its as if you had nt any perceptions either if i am here for a few days i know what i am about  why should i understand i askednot very candidly because i should have been glad to its your own affair you know what you are about as you say and of course you have counted the cost  what cost do you mean its a pretty cost i can tell you and then he tried to explainif i would only enter into it and not be so suspicious he was in london for the express purpose of breaking off  breaking off whatyour engagement  no no damn my engagementthe other thing my acquaintance my relations  your intimacy with lady van it was not very gentle but i believe i burst out laughing if this is the way you break off pray what would you do to keep up  he flushed and looked both foolish and angry for of course it was not very difficult to see my point but he wasin a very clumsy manner of his owntrying to cultivate a good conscience and he was getting no credit for it i suppose i may be allowed to look at her its a matter we have to talk over one does nt drop such a friend in half an hour  one does nt drop her at all unless one has the strength to make a sacrifice  its easy for you to talk of sacrifice you dont know what she is my visitor cried  i think i know what she is not she is not a friend as you call her if she encourages you in the wrong if she does nt help you no i have no patience with her i declared i dont like her and i wont go to see her  mr tester looked at me a moment as if he were too vexed to trust himself to speak he had to make an effort not to say something rude that effort however he was capable of making and though he held his hat as if he were going to walk out of the house he ended by staying by putting it down again by leaning his head with his elbows on his knees in his hands and groaning out that he had never heard of anything so impossible and that he was the most wretched man in england i was very sorry for him and of course i told him so but privately i did nt think he stood up to his duty as he ought i said to him however that if he would give me his word of honor that he would not abandon miss bernardstone there was no trouble i would nt take to be of use to him i did nt think lady vandeleur was behaving well he must allow me to repeat that but if going to see her would give him any pleasure of course there was no question of pleasure for her i would go fifty times i could nt imagine how it would help him but i would do it as i would do anything else he asked me he did nt give me his word of honor but he said quietly i shall go straight you need nt be afraid and as he spoke there was honor enough in his face this left an opening of course for another catastrophe there might be further postponements and poor lady emily indignant for the first time in her life might declare that her daughters situation had become intolerable and that they withdrew from the engagement but this was too odious a chance and i accepted mr testers assurance he told me that the good i could do by going to see lady vandeleur was that it would cheer her up in that dreary big house in upper brook street where she was absolutely alone with horrible overalls on the furniture and newspapersactually newspaperson the mirrors she was seeing no one there was no one to see but he knew she would see me i asked him if she knew then he was to speak to me of coming and whether i might allude to him whether it was not too delicate i shall never forget his answer to this nor the tone in which he made it blushing a little and looking away allude to me rather it was not the most fatuous speech i had ever heard it had the effect of being the most modest and it gave me an odd idea and especially a new one of the condition in which at any time one might be destined to find lady vandeleur if she too were engaged in a struggle with her conscience in this light they were an edifying pair it had perhaps changed her considerably made her more approachable and i reflected ingeniously that it probably had a humanizing effect upon her ambrose tester did nt go away after i had told him that i would comply with his request he lingered fidgeting with his stick and gloves and i perceived that he had more to tell me and that the real reason why he wished me to go and see lady vandeleur was not that she had newspapers on her mirrors he came out with it at last for that rather of his with the way i took it had broken the ice  you say you dont think she behaved well he naturally wished to defend her but i dare say you dont understand her position perhaps you would nt behave any better in her place  its very good of you to imagine me there i remarked laughing  its awkward for me to say one doesnt want to dot ones is to that extent  she would be delighted to marry you thats not such a mystery  well she likes me awfully mr tester said looking like a handsome child its not all on one side its on both thats the difficulty  you mean she wont let you goshe holds you fast  but the poor fellow had in delicacy said enough and at this he jumped up he stood there a moment smoothing his hat then he broke out again please do this let her knowmake her feel you can bring it in you know and here he paused embarrassed  what can i bring in mr tester thats the difficulty as you say  what you told me the other day you know what you have told me before  what i have told you  that it would put an end to joscelind if you cant work round to it whats the good of beingyou and with this tribute to my powers he took his departure     vii  it was all very well of him to be so flattering but i really did nt see myself talking in that manner to lady vandeleur i wondered why he didnt give her this information himself and what particular value it could have as coming from me then i said to myself that of course he had mentioned to her the truth i had impressed upon him and which by this time he had evidently taken home but that to enable it to produce its full effect upon lady yandeleur the further testimony of a witness more independent was required there was nothing for me but to go and see her and i went the next day fully conscious that to execute mr testers commission i should have either to find myself very brave or to find her strangely confidential and fully prepared also not to be admitted but she received me and the house in upper brook street was as dismal as ambrose tester had represented it the december fog the afternoon was very dusky seemed to pervade the muffled rooms and her ladyships pink lamplight to waste itself in the brown atmosphere he had mentioned to me that the heir to the title a cousin of her husband who had left her unmolested for several months was now taking possession of everything so that what kept her in town was the business of her turning out and certain formalities connected with her dower this was very ample and the large provision made for her included the london house she was very gracious on this occasion but she certainly had remarkably little to say still she was different or at any rate having taken that hint i saw her differently i saw indeed that i had never quite done her justice that i had exaggerated her stiffness attributed to her a kind of conscious grandeur which was in reality much more an accident of her appearance of her figure than a quality of her character her appearance is as grand as you know and on the day i speak of in her simplified mourning under those vaguely gleaming lambris she looked as beautiful as a great white lily she is very simple and goodnatured she will never make an advance but she will always respond to one and i saw that evening that the way to get on with her was to treat her as if she were not too imposing i saw also that with her nunlike robes and languid eyes she was a woman who might be immensely in love all the same we hadnt much to say to each other she remarked that it was very kind of me to come that she wondered how i could endure london at that season that she had taken a drive and found the park too dreadful that she would ring for some more tea if i did nt like what she had given me our conversation wandered stumbling a little among these platitudes but no allusion was made on either side to ambrose tester nevertheless as i have said she was different though it was not till i got home that i phrased to myself what i had detected  then recalling her white face and the deeper stranger expression of her beautiful eyes i entertained myself with the idea that she was under the influence of suppressed exaltation the more i thought of her the more she appeared to me not natural wound up as it were to a calmness beneath which there was a deal of agitation this would have been nonsense if i had not two days afterwards received a note from her which struck me as an absolutely exalted production not superficially of course to the casual eye it would have been perfectly commonplace but this was precisely its peculiarity that lady vandeleur should have written me a note which had no apparent point save that she should like to see me again a desire for which she did succeed in assigning a reason she reminded me that she was paying no calls and she hoped i wouldnt stand on ceremony but come in very soon again she had enjoyed my visit so much we had not been on notewriting terms and there was nothing in that visit to alter our relations moreover six months before she would not have dreamed of addressing me in that way i was doubly convinced therefore that she was passing through a crisis that she was not in her normal state of nerves mr tester had not reappeared since the occasion i have described at length and i thought it possible he had been capable of the bravery of leaving town i had however no fear of meeting him in upper brook street for according to my theory of his relations with lady vaudeleur he regularly spent his evenings with her it being clear to me that they must dine together i could answer her note only by going to see her the next day when i found abundant confirmation of that idea about the crisis i must confess to you in advance that i have never really understood her behaviornever understood why she should have taken me so suddenlywith whatever reserves and however much by implication merelyinto her confidence all i can say is that this is an accident to which one is exposed with english people who in my opinion and contrary to common report are the most demonstrative the most expansive the most gushing in the world i think she felt rather isolated at this moment and she had never had many intimates of her own sex that sex as a general thing disapproved of her proceedings during the last few months held that she was making joscelind bernardstone suffer too cruelly she possibly felt the weight of this censure and at all events was not above wishing some one to know that whatever injury had fallen upon the girl to whom mr tester had so stupidly engaged himself had not so far as she was concerned been wantonly inflicted i was there i was more or less aware of her situation and i would do as well as any one else  she seemed really glad to see me but she was very nervous nevertheless nearly half an hour elapsed and i was still wondering whether she had sent for me only to discuss the question of how a london house whose appointments had the stamp of a debased period it had been thought very handsome in 1850 could be done up without being made Ã¦sthetic i forget what satisfaction i gave her on this point i was asking myself how i could work round in the manner prescribed by joscelinds intended at the last however to my extreme surprise lady vandeleur herself relieved me of this effort  i think you know mr tester rather well she remarked abruptly irrelevantly and with a face more conscious of the bearings of things than any i had ever seen her wear on my confessing to such an acquaintance she mentioned that mr tester who had been in london a few daysperhaps i had seen him had left town and would nt come back for several weeks this for the moment seemed to be all she had to communicate but she sat looking at me from the corner of her sofa as if she wished me to profit in some way by the opportunity she had given me did she want help from outside this proud inscrutable woman and was she reduced to throwing out signals of distress did she wish to be protected against herselfapplauded for such efforts as she had already made i didnt rush forward i was not precipitate for i felt that now surely i should be able at my convenience to execute my commission what concerned me was not to prevent lady vandeleurs marrying mr tester but to prevent mr testers marrying her in a few momentswith the same irrelevanceshe announced to me that he wished to and asked whether i didnt know it i saw that this was my chance and instantly with extreme energy i exclaimed  ah for heavens sake dont listen to him it would kill miss bernardstone  the tone of my voice made her color a little and she repeated miss bernardstone  the girl he is engaged toor has beendont you know excuse me i thought every one knew  of course i know he is dreadfully entangled he was fairly hunted down lady vandeleur was silent a moment and then she added with a strange smile fancy in such a situation his wanting to marry me  fancy i replied i was so struck with the oddity of her telling me her secrets that for the moment my indignation did not come to a headmy indignation i mean at her accusing poor lady emily and even the girl herself of having trapped our friend later i said to myself that i supposed she was within her literal right in abusing her rival if she was trying sincerely to give him up i dont know anything about his having been hunted down i said but this i do know lady vandeleur i assure you that if he should throw joscelind over she would simply go out like that and i snapped my fingers  lady vandeleur listened to this serenely enough she tried at least to take the air of a woman who has no need of new arguments do you know her very well she asked as if she had been struck by my calling miss bernardstone by her christian name  well enough to like her very much i was going to say to pity her but i thought better of it  she must be a person of very little spirit if a man were to jilt me i dont think i should go out cried her ladyship with a laugh  nothing is more probable than that she has not your courage or your wisdom she may be weak but she is passionately in love with him  i looked straight into lady vandeleurs eyes as i said this and i was conscious that it was a tolerably good description of my hostess  do you think she would really die she asked in a moment  die as if one should stab her with a knife some people dont believe in broken hearts i continued i did nt till i knew joscelind bernardstone then i felt that she had one that would nt be proof  one ought to liveone ought always to live said lady yandeleur and always to hold up ones head  ah i suppose that one ought nt to feel at all if one wishes to be a great success  what do you call a great success she asked  never having occasion to be pitied  being pitied that must be odious she said and i saw that though she might wish for admiration she would never wish for sympathy then in a moment she added that men in her opinion were very basea remark that was deep but not i think very honest that is in so far as the purpose of it had been to give me the idea that ambrose tester had done nothing but press her and she had done nothing but resist they were very odd the discrepancies in the statements of each of this pair but it must be said for lady vandeleur that now that she had made up her mind as i believed she had to sacrifice herself she really persuaded herself that she had not had a moment of weakness she quite unbosomed herself and i fairly assisted at her crisis it appears that she had a consciencevery much so and even a high ideal of duty she represented herself as moving heaven and earth to keep ambrose tester up to the mark and you would never have guessed from what she told me that she had entertained ever so faintly the idea of marrying him i am sure this was a dreadful perversion but i forgave it on the score of that exaltation of which i have spoken the things she said and the way she said them come back to me and i thought that if she looked as handsome as that when she preached virtue to mr tester it was no wonder he liked the sermon to be going on perpetually  i dare say you know what old friends we are but that does nt make any difference does it nothing would induce me to marry himi have nt the smallest intention of marrying again it is not a time for me to think of marrying before his lordship has been dead six months the girl is nothing to me i know nothing about her and i dont wish to know but i should be very very sorry if she were unhappy he is the best friend i ever had but i dont see that thats any reason i should marry him do you lady vaudeleur appealed to me but without waiting for my answers asking advice in spite of herself and then remembering it was beneath her dignity to appear to be in need of it i have told him that if he does nt act properly i shall never speak to him again shes a charming girl every one says and i have no doubt she will make him perfectly happy men dont feel things like women i think and if they are coddled and flattered they forget the rest i have no doubt she is very sufficient for all that for me at any rate once i see a thing in a certain way i must abide by that i think people are so dreadfulthey do such horrible things they dont seem to think what ones duty may be i dont know whether you think much about that but really one must at times dont you think so every one is so selfish and then when they have never made an effort or a sacrifice themselves they come to you and talk such a lot of hypocrisy i know so much better than any one else whether i should marry or not but i dont mind telling you that i dont see why i should i am not in such a bad positionwith my liberty and a decent maintenance  in this manner she rambled on gravely and communicatively contradicting herself at times not talking fast she never did but dropping one simple sentence with an interval after the other with a certain richness of voice which always was part of the charm of her presence she wished to be convinced against herself and it was a comfort to her to hear herself argue i was quite willing to be part of the audience though i had to confine myself to very superficial remarks for when i had said the event i feared would kill miss bernardstone i had said everything that was open to me i had nothing to do with lady vandeleurs marrying apart from that i probably disappointed her she had caught a glimpse of the moral beauty of selfsacrifice of a certain ideal of conduct i imagine it was rather new to her and would have been glad to elicit from me as a person of some experience of life an assurance that such joys are not insubstantial i had no wish to wind her up to a spiritual ecstasy from which she would inevitably descend again and i let her deliver herself according to her humor without attempting to answer for it that she would find renunciation the road to bliss i believed that if she should give up mr tester she would suffer accordingly but i did nt think that a reason for not giving him up before i left her she said to me that nothing would induce her to do anything that she did nt think right it would be no pleasure to me dont you see i should be always thinking that another way would have been better nothing would induce menothing nothing     viii  she protested too much perhaps but the event seemed to show that she was in earnest i have described these two first visits of mine in some detail but they were not the only ones i paid her i saw her several times again before she left town and we became intimate as london intimacies are measured she ceased to protest to my relief for it made me nervous she was very gentle and gracious and reasonable and there was something in the way she looked and spoke that told me that for the present she found renunciation its own reward so far my scepticism was put to shame her spiritual ecstasy maintained itself if i could have foreseen then that it would maintain itself till the present hour i should have felt that lady vandeleurs moral nature is finer indeed than mine i heard from her that mr tester remained at his fathers and that lady emily and her daughter were also there the day for the wedding had been fixed and the preparations were going rapidly forward meanwhileshe didnt tell me but i gathered it from things she droppedshe was in almost daily correspondence with the young man i thought this a strange concomitant of his bridal arrangements but apparently henceforth they were bent on convincing each other that the torch of virtue lighted their steps and they couldnt convince each other too much she intimated to me that she had now effectually persuaded him always by letter that he would fail terribly if he should try to found his happiness on an injury done to another and that of course she could never be happy in a union with him with the sight of his wretchedness before her that a good deal of correspondence should be required to elucidate this is perhaps after all not remarkable one day when i was sitting with her it was just before she left town she suddenly burst into tears before we parted i said to her that there were several women in london i liked very muchthat was common enoughbut for her i had a positive respect and that was rare my respect continues still and it sometimes makes me furious  about the middle of january ambrose tester reappeared in town he told me he came to bid me goodby he was going to be beheaded it was no use saying that old relations would be the same after a man was married they would be different everything would be different i had wanted him to marry and now i should see how i liked it he did nt mention that i had also wanted him not to marry and i was sure that if lady vandeleur had become his wife she would have been a much greater impediment to our harmless friendship than joscelind bernardstone would ever be it took me but a short time to observe that he was in very much the same condition as lady vandeleur he was finding how sweet it is to renounce hand in hand with one we love upon him too the peace of the lord had descended he spoke of his fathers delight at the nuptials being so near at hand at the festivities that would take place in dorsetshire when he should bring home his bride the only allusion he made to what we had talked of the last time we were together was to exclaim suddenly how can i tell you how easy she has made it she is so sweet so noble she really is a perfect creature i took for granted that he was talking of his future wife but in a moment as we were at crosspurposes perceived that he meant lady vandeleur this seemed to me really ominous it stuck in my mind after he had left me i was half tempted to write him a note to say there is after all perhaps something worse than your jilting miss bernardstone would be and that is the danger that your rupture with lady vandeleur may become more of a bond than your marrying her would have been for heavens sake let your sacrifice be a sacrifice keep it in its proper place  of course i did nt write even the slight responsibility i had already incurred began to frighten me and i never saw mr tester again till he was the husband of joscelind bernardstone they have now been married some four years they have two children the eldest of whom is as he should be a boy sir edmund waited till his grandson had made good his place in the world and then feeling it was safe he quietly genially surrendered his trust he died holding the hand of his daughterinlaw and giving it doubtless a pressure which was an injunction to be brave i dont know what he thought of the success of his plan for his son but perhaps after all he saw nothing amiss for joscelind is the last woman in the world to have troubled him with her sorrows from him no doubt she successfully concealed that bewilderment on which i have touched you see i speak of her sorrows as if they were a matter of common recognition certain it is that any one who meets her must see that she does nt pass her life in joy lady vandeleur as you know has never married again she is still the most beautiful widow in england she enjoys the esteem of every one as well as the approbation of her conscience for every one knows the sacrifice she made knows that she was even more in love with sir ambrose than he was with her she goes out again of course as of old and she constantly meets the baronet and his wife she is supposed to be even very nice to lady tester and she certainly treats her with exceeding civility but you know or perhaps you dont know all the deadly things that in london may lie beneath that method i dont in the least mean that lady vandeleur has any deadly intentions she is a very good woman and i am sure that in her heart she thinks she lets poor joscelind off very easily but the result of the whole situation is that joscelind is in dreadful fear of her for how can she help seeing that she has a very peculiar power over her husband there couldnt have been a better occasion for observing the three together if together it may be called when lady tester is so completely outside than those two days of ours at doubleton thats a house where they have met more than once before i think she and sir ambrose like it by she i mean as he used to mean lady vandeleur you saw how lady tester was absolutely white with uneasiness what can she do when she meets everywhere the implication that if two people in our time have distinguished themselves for their virtue it is her husband and lady vandeleur it is my impression that this pair are exceedingly happy his marriage has made a difference and i see him much less frequently and less intimately but when i meet him i notice in him a kind of emanation of quiet bliss yes they are certainly in felicity they have trod the clouds together they have soared into the blue and they wear in their faces the glory of those altitudes they encourage they cheer inspire sustain each other remind each other that they have chosen the better part of course they have to meet for this purpose and their interviews are filled i am sure with its sanctity he holds up his head as a man may who on a very critical occasion behaved like a perfect gentleman it is only poor joscelind that droops have nt i explained to you now why she does nt understand
