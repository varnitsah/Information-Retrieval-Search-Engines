howells  all rights reserved     bride roses   scene  a lady entering the florists with her muff to her face and fluttering gayly up to the counter where the florist stands folding a mass of loose flowers in a roll of cotton batting goodmorning mr eichenlaub ah put plenty of cotton round the poor things if you dont want them frozen stiff you have no idea what a day it is here in your little tropic she takes away her muff as she speaks but gives each of her cheeks a final pressure with it and holds it up with one hand inside as she sinks upon the stool before the counter  the florist dropic with icepergs on the wintows he nods his head toward the frosty panes and wraps a sheet of tissuepaper around the cotton and the flowers  the lady but you are not near the windows back here it is midsummer  the florist yes we got a rhevricherator to keep the rhoces from sunstroke he crimps the paper at the top and twists it at the bottom of the bundle in his hand hier he calls to a young man warming his hands at the stove chon but on your hat and dtake this toholt on i forgot to but in the cart he undoes the paper and puts in a card lying on the counter before him the lady watches him vaguely there he restores the wrapping and hands the package to the young man who goes out with it well matam  the lady laying her muff with her hand in it on the counter and leaning forward over it well mr eichenlaub i am going to be very difficult  the florist that is what i lige then i dont feel so rhesbonsible  the lady but today i wish you to feel responsible i want you to take the whole responsibility do you know why i always come to you instead of those places on fifth avenue  the florist well it is a good teal cheaper for one thing  the lady not at all that isnt the reason at all some of your things are dearer its because you take so much more interest and you talk over what i want and you dont urge me when i havent made up my mind you let me consult you and you are not cross when i dont take your advice  the florist you are very goodt matam  the lady not at all i am simply just and now i want you to provide the flowers for my first saturday saturday of this week in fact and i want to talk the order all over with you are you very busy  the florist no i am qvite at your service we haf just had to egsegute a larche gommission very soddenly and we are still in a little dtisorter yet but  the lady yes i see she glances at the rear of the shop where the floor is littered with the leaves and petals of flowers and sprays of fern and evergreen a woman followed by a belated smell of breakfast which gradually mingles with the odor of the plants comes out of a door there and begins to gather the larger fragments into her apron the lady turns again and looks at the jars and vases of cut flowers in the window and on the counter what i cant understand is how you know just the quantity of flowers to buy every day you must often lose a good deal  the florist it gomes out about rhighdt nearly always when i get left sometimes i can chenerally work dem off on funerals now that bic orter hat i just fill that wass a funeral it usedt up all the flowers i hat ofer from yesterday  the lady dont speak of it and the flowers are they just the same for funerals  the florist yes rhoces nearly always whidte ones  the lady well it is too dreadful i am not going to have roses whatever i have after a thoughtful pause and a more careful look around the shop mr eichenlaub why wouldnt orchids do  the florist well they would be bretty dtear you couldnt make any show at all for less than fifteen tollars  the lady with a slight sigh no orchids wouldnt do they are fantastic things anyway and they are not very effective as you say pinks anemones marguerites narcissusthere doesnt seem to be any great variety does there  the florist patiently there will be more lader on  the lady yes there will be more sun later on but now mr eichenlaub what do you think of plants in pots set around  the florist balmss  the lady vaguely yes palms  the florist balmss would to but there would not be very much golor  the lady that is true there would be no color at all and my rooms certainly need all the color i can get into them yes i shall have to have roses after all but not white ones  the florist chacks  the lady no jacks are too oldfashioned but havent you got any other very dark rose i should like something almost black i believe  the florist setting a vase of roses on the counter before her there is the matame hoste  the lady bending over the roses and touching one of them with the tip of her gloved finger why they are black almost they are nearly as black as black pansies they are really wonderful she stoops over and inhales their fragrance delicious they are beautiful butabruptlythey are hideous their color makes me creep it is so unnatural for a rose a rosea rose ought to berosecolored have you no rosecolored roses what are those light pink ones there in the window  the florist going to the window and getting two vases of cut roses with long stems both pink but one kind a little larger than the other that is the matame watterville and this is the matame cousine they are sister rhoces both the same but the matame watterville is a little bigger and it is a little dtearer  the lady they are both exquisite and they are such a tender almondbloom pink i think the madame cousine is quite as nice but of course the larger ones are more effective she examines them turning her head from side to side and then withdrawing a step with a decisive sigh no they are too pale have you nothing of a brighter pink what is that over there she points to a vase of roses quite at the front of the window and the florist climbs over the mass of plants and gets it for her  the florist that is the midio  the lady the what  the florist the midio  the lady you will think i am very stupid this morning wont you please write it down for me the florist writes on a sheet of wrappingpaper and she leans over and reads oh meteor well it is very strikinga little too striking i dont like such a vivid pink and i dont like the name horrid to give such a name to a flower she puts both hands into her muff and drifts a little way off as if to get him in a better perspective cant you suggest something mr eichenlaub  the florist some kind off yellow rhoce dtearhoces  the lady shaking her head tearoses are ghastly i hate yellow roses i would rather have black and black is simply impossible i shall have to tell you just what i want to do i dont want to work up to my rooms with the flowers i want to work up to the young lady who is going to pour tea for me i dont care if there isnt a flower anywhere but on the table before her i want a color scheme that shall not have a false note in it from her face to the tiniest bud i want them to all come together do you understand  the florist doubtfully yes after a moment what kindt looking yong laty iss she  the lady the most ethereal creature in the world  the florist yes but what sdylefair or tark  the lady oh fair very very fair and very very fragilelooking a sort of moonlight blonde with those remote starrylooking eyes dont you know and that pale saffron hair not the least ashen and just the faintest faintest tinge of color in her face i suppose you have nothing like the oldfashioned blushrose that would be the very thing  the florist shaking his head oh no there noding like that in a chreenhouse rhoce  the lady well that is exactly what i want it ought to be something very tall and ethereal something very very pale and yet with a sort of suffusion of color she walks up and down the shop looking at all the plants and flowers  the florist waiting patiently someting beside rhoces then  the lady coming back to him no it must be roses after all i see that nothing else will do what do you call those she nods at a vase of roses on a shelf behind him  the florist turning and taking them down for her ah those whidte ones that is the pridte you sait you woultnt haf whidte ones  the lady i may have to come to them why do they call it the pride  the florist i didnt say bridte i said pridte  the lady oh bride and do they use bride roses for  the florist yes and for weddtings too for everything the lady leans back a little and surveys the flowers critically a young man enters and approaches the florist but waits with respectful impatience for the lady to transact her affairs the florist turns to him inquiringly and upon this hint he speaks  the young man i want you to send a few roseswhite ones or nearly whitehe looks at the lady perhaps  the lady oh not at all i hadnt decided to take them  the florist i got plenty this kindt all you want i can always get them  the young man dreamily regarding the roses they look rather chilly he goes to the stove and drawing off his gloves warms his hands and then comes back what do you call this rose  the florist the pridte  the young man uncertainly oh the lady moves a little way up the counter toward the window but keeps looking at the young man from time to time she cannot help hearing all that he says havent you any white rose with a little color in it just the faintest tinge the merest touch  the florist no no they are whidte or they are yellow dtearhoces marshal niel  the young man ah i dont want anything of that kind what is the palest pink rose you have  the florist indicating the different kinds in the vases where the lady has been looking at them well there is nothing lighder than the matame cousine or the matame watterville here they are sister rhoces  the young man yes yes very beautiful but too dark he stops before the madame hoste what a strange flower it is almost black what is it for funerals  the florist no a good many people lige them we dont sell them much for funerals they are too cloomy they uce whidte ones for that marshal niel dtearhoces this pridte here and other whidte ones  the young man with an accent of repulsion oh he goes toward the window and looks at a mass of easter lilies in a vase there he speaks as if thinking aloud if they had a little colorbut they would be dreadful with color why you ought to have something he continues musingly as he returns to the florist havent you got something very delicate and slender about the color of pale apple blossoms if you had them light enough some kind of azaleas  the lady involuntarily ah  the florist after a moment in which he and the young man both glance at the lady and she makes a sound in her throat to show that she is not thinking of them and had not spoken in reference to what they were saying the only azaleas i haf are these pink ones and those whidte ones  the young man and they are too pink and too white isnt there anything tall and very delicate something wellsomething like the oldfashioned blushrose but with very long stems  the florist no there is noding lige that which gomes in a crheenhouse rhoce we got a whidte rhoce herehe goes to his refrigerator and brings back a long box of rosesthat i didnt think of before he gives the lady an apologetic glance you see there is chost the least sdain of rhet on the etch of the leafs  the young man examining the petals of the roses ah that is very curious it is a caprice though  the florist yes it is a kind of sbordt that rhoce should be berfectly whidte  the young man on the whole i dont think it will do i will take some of those pure white ones bride did you call them  the florist yes pridte how many  the young man oh a dozentwo dozen i dont know i want very long slender stems and the flowers with loose open petals none of those stout toughlooking little buds here this and this and all these no i dont want any of those at all he selects the different stems of roses and while the florist gets a box and prepares it with a lining of cotton and tissuepaper he leans over and writes on a card he pauses and puts up his pencil then he takes it out again and covers the card with writing he gives it to the florist i wish that to go into the box where it will be found the first thing he turns away and encounters the ladys eyes as she chances to look toward him i beg your pardon but  the lady smiling and extending her hand i felt almost sure it was you but i couldnt believe my senses all the other authorities report you in rome  the young man i returned rather suddenly i just got in this morning our steamer was due yesterday but there was so much ice in the harbor that we didnt work up till a few hours ago  the lady you will take all your friends by surprise  the young man im a good deal taken by surprise myself two weeks ago i didnt dream of being here but i made up my mind to come andi came  the lady laughing evidently well now you must come to my saturdays you are just in time for the first one some one you know is going to pour tea for me that ought to be some consolation to you for not having stayed away long enough to escape my hospitalities  the young man blushing and smiling oh its a very charming welcome home i shall be sure to come she iseverybody iswell i hope  the lady yes or everybody was on monday when i saw them everybody is looking very beautiful this winter lovelier than ever if possible but so spiritual too spiritual but that spirit of hers will carry heri mean everybody of coursethrough everything i feel almost wicked to have asked her to pour tea for me when i think of how much else she is doing do you know i was just ordering the flowers for my saturday and i had decided to take her for my keynote in the decorations but that made it so difficult there doesnt seem anything delicate and pure and sweet enough for her there ought to be some flower created just to express her but as yet there isnt  the young man no no there isnt but now i must run away i havent been to my hotel yet i was just driving up from the ship and i saw the flowers in the window andstopped goodby  the lady goodby what devotion to somebodyeverybody dont forget my saturday  the young man no no i wont goodby he hurries out of the door and his carriage is heard driving away  the florist i wondter if he but the attress on the cart no there is noding he turns the card helplessly over what am i coing to do about these flowers  the lady why didnt he say where to send them  the florist no he rhon away and dtidnt leaf the attress  the lady that was my fault i confused him poor fellow by talking to him what are you going to do  the florist that is what i lige to know do you know what hotel he stobs at  the lady no he didnt say i have no idea where he is going but wait a moment i think i know where he meant to send the flowers  the florist oh well that is all i want to know  the lady yes but i am not certain after a moments thought i know he wants them to go at once a great deal may depend upon iteverything suddenly could you let me see that card  the florist throwing it on the counter before her why soddonly if he is a frhiendt of yours  the lady shrinking back ah it isnt so simple that makes it all the worse it would be a kind of sacrilege i have no rightor wait i will just glance at the first word it may be a clew and i want you to bear me witness mr eichenlaub that i didnt read a word more she catches up a piece of paper and covers all the card except the first two words yes it is she oh how perfectly delightful its charming charming its one of the prettiest things that ever happened and i shall be the meansno not the means quite but the accidentof bringing them together put the card into the box mr eichenlaub and dont let me see it an instant longer or i shall read every word of it in spite of myself she gives him the card and turns swiftly and makes some paces toward the door  the florist calling after her but the attress matam you forgot  the lady returning oh yes give me your pencil she writes on a piece of the white wrappingpaper there that is it she stands irresolute with the pencil at her lip there was something else that i seem to have forgotten  the florist your flowers  the lady oh yes my flowers i nearly went away without deciding let me see where are those white roses with the pink tinge on the edge of the petals the florist pushes the box towards her and she looks down at the roses no they wont do they look somehowcruel i dont wonder he wouldnt have them they are totally out of character i will take those white bride roses too it seems a fatality but there really isnt anything else and i can laugh with her about them if it all turns out well she talks to herself rather than the florist who stands patient behind the counter and repeats dreamily laugh with her  the florist how many shall i sendt you matam  the lady oh loads as many as you think i ought to have i shall not have any other flowers and i mean to toss them on the table in loose heaps perhaps i shall have some smilax to go with them  the florist yes or cypress wine  the lady no that is too crapy and creepy smilax or nothing and yet i dont like that hard shiny varnishy look of smilax either you wouldnt possibly have anything like that wild vine its scarcely more than a golden thread that trails over the wayside bushes in new england dodder they call it  the florist i nefer heardt off it  the lady no but that would have been just the thing it suggests the color of her hair it would go with her well i will have the smilax too though i dont like it i dont see why all the flowers should take to being so inexpressive send all the smilax you judge best its quite a long table nine or ten feet and i want the vine going pretty much all about it  the florist perhaps i better sendt somebody to see  the lady yes that would be the best goodmorning  the florist goodtmorning matam i will sendt rhoundt this afternoon  the lady very well she is at the door and she is about to open it when it is opened from the outside and another lady deeply veiled presses hurriedly in and passes down the shop to the counter where the florist stands sorting the longstemmed bride roses in the box before him the first lady does not go out she lingers at the door looking after the lady who has just come in then with a little hesitation she slowly returns as if she had forgotten something and waits by the stove until the florist shall have attended to the newcomer  the second lady throwing back her veil and bending over to look at the box of roses what beautiful roses what do you call these  the florist that is a new
