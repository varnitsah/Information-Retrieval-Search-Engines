just by the mint ses the man pointing      right afore my wife and the party next door she put her arm     round my waist      she learnt the news in the first halfhour from her landlady     shareholders     sailor man—said the nightwatchman musingly—a sailorman is like a fish he is safest when ’e is at sea when a fish comes ashore it is in for trouble and so is sailorman one poor chap i knew ’ardly ever came ashore without getting married and he was found out there was no less than six wimmen in the court all taking away ’is character at once and when he spoke up solomon the magistrate pretty near bit ’is ’ead off  then look at the trouble they get in with their money they come ashore from a long trip smelling of it a’most and they go from port to port like a lord everybody has got their eye on that money—everybody except the sailorman that is—and afore he knows wot’s ’appened and who ’as got it he’s looking for a ship agin when he ain’t robbed of ’is money he wastes it and when ’e don’t do either he loses it  i knew one chap who hid ’is money he’d been away ten months and knowing ’ow easy money goes ’e made up sixteen pounds in a nice little parcel and hid it where nobody could find it that’s wot he said and p’r’aps ’e was right all i know is he never found it i did the same thing myself once with a couple o’ quid i ran acrost unexpected on’y unfortunately for me i hid it the day afore my missus started ’er springcleaning  one o’ the worst men i ever knew for getting into trouble when he came ashore was old sam small if he couldn’t find it by ’imself ginger dick and peter russet would help ’im look for it generally speaking they found it without straining their eyesight  i remember one time they was home arter being away pretty near a year and when they was paid off they felt like walking goldmines they went about smiling all over with goodtemper and ’appiness and for the first three days they was like brothers that didn’t last of course and on the fourth day sam small arter saying wot ’e would do to ginger and peter if it wasn’t for the police went off by ’imself  his temper passed off arter a time and ’e began to look cheerful agin it was a lovely morning and having nothing to do and plenty in ’is pocket to do it with he went along like a schoolboy with a ’arf holiday he went as far as stratford on the top of a tram for a mouthful o’ fresh air and came back to his favourite coffeeshop with a fine appetite for dinner there was a very nice gentlemanly chap sitting opposite ’im and the way he begged sam’s pardon for splashing gravy over ’im made sam take a liking to him at once nicely dressed he was with a gold pin in ’is tie and a fine gold watchchain acrost his weskit and sam could see he ’ad been brought up well by the way he used ’is knife and fork he kept looking at sam in a thoughtful kind o’ way and at last he said wot a beautiful morning it was and wot a fine day it must be in the country in a little while they began to talk like a couple of old friends and he told sam all about ’is father wot was a clergyman in the country and sam talked about a father of his as was living private on three ’undred a year  ah money’s a useful thing ses the man  it ain’t everything ses sam it won’t give you ’appiness i’ve run through a lot in my time so i ought to know  i expect you’ve got a bit left though ses the man with a wink  sam laughed and smacked ’is pocket i’ve got a trifle to go on with he ses winking back i never feel comfortable without a pound or two in my pocket  you look as though you’re just back from a vy’ge ses the man looking at ’im very hard  i am ses sam nodding just back arter ten months and i’m going to spend a bit o’ money afore i sign on agin i can tell you  that’s wot it was given to us for ses the man nodding at him  they both got up to go at the same time and walked out into the street together and when sam asked ’im whether he might have the pleasure of standing ’im a drink he said he might he talked about the different kinds of drink as they walked along till sam wot was looking for a high class pub got such a raging thirst on ’im he hardly knew wot to do with ’imself he passed several pubs and walked on as fast as he could to the three widders  do you want to go in there partikler ses the man stopping at the door  no ses sam staring  ’cos i know a place where they sell the best glass o’ port wine in london ses the man  he took sam up two or three turnings and then led him into a quiet little pub in a back street there was a cosy little saloon bar with nobody in it and arter sam had ’ad two port wines for the look of the thing he ’ad a pint o’ sixale because he liked it his new pal had one too and he ’ad just taken a pull at it and wiped his mouth when ’e noticed a little bill pinned up at the back of the bar  lost between—the mint and—tower stairs he ses leaning forward and reading very slow a gold—locket—set with—diamonds whoever will—return—the same to—mr smith—orange villa—barnet—will receive —thirty pounds—reward  ’ow much ses sam starting thirty pounds ses the man must be a good locket where’d you get that he ses turning to the barmaid  gentleman came in an hour ago ses the gal and arter he had ’ad two or three drinks with the guv’nor he asks ’im to stick it up ’arf crying he was—said ’it ’ad belonged to his old woman wot died  she went off to serve a customer at the other end of the bar wot was making little dents in it with his pot and the man came back and sat down by sam agin and began to talk about horseracing at least he tried to but sam couldn’t talk of nothing but that locket and wot a nice steady sailorman could do with thirty pounds  well p’r’aps you’ll find it ses the man chaffinglike ’ave another pint  sam had one but it only made ’im more solemn and he got in quite a temper as ’e spoke about casuals loafing about on tower hill with their ’ands in their pockets and taking gold lockets out of the mouths of hardworking sailormen  it mightn’t be found yet ses the man speaking thoughtfullike it’s wonderful how long a thing’ll lay sometimes wot about going and ’aving a look for it  sam shook his ’ead at fust but arter turning the thing over in his mind and ’aving another look at the bill and copying down the name and address for luck ’e said p’r’aps they might as well walk that way as anywhere else  something seems to tell me we’ve got a chance ses the man as they stepped outside  it’s a funny feeling and i can’t explain it but it always means good luck last time i had it an aunt o’ mine swallered ’er false teeth and left me five ’undred pounds  there’s aunts and aunts ses sam grunting i ’ad one once but if she had swallered ’er teeth she’d ha’ been round to me to help ’er buy some new ones that’s the sort she was  mind ses the man patting ’im on the shoulder if we do find this i don’t want any of it i’ve got all i want it’s all for you  they went on like a couple o’ brothers arter that especially sam and when they got to the mint they walked along slow down tower hill looking for the locket it was awkward work because if people saw them looking about they’d ’ave started looking too and twice sam nearly fell over owing to walking like a man with a stiff neck and squinting down both sides of his nose at once when they got as far as the stairs they came back on the other side of the road and they ’ad turned to go back agin when a dockerlooking chap stopped sam’s friend and spoke to ’im  i’ve got no change my man ses sam’s pal pushing past him  i ain’t begging guv’nor ses the chap follering ’im up i’m trying to sell something  wot is it ses the other stopping  the man looked up and down the street and then he put his ’ead near them and whispered  eh ses sam’s pal  something i picked up ses the man still awhispering  sam got a pinch on the arm from ’is pal that nearly made him scream then they both stood still staring at the docker  wot is it ses sam at last  the docker looked over his shoulder agin and then ’e put his ’and in his trouserpocket and just showed ’em a big fat gold locket with diamonds stuck all over it then he shoved it back in ’is pocket while sam’s pal was giving ’im a pinch worse than wot the other was  it’s the one he ses in a whisper let’s ’ave another look at it he ses to the docker  the man fished it out of his pocket agin and held on to it tight while they looked at it  where did you find it ses sam  found it over there just by the mint ses the man pointing  illustration wot d’ye want for it ses sam’s pal  as much as i can get ses the man i don’t quite know ’ow much it’s worth that’s the worst of it wot d’ye say to twenty pounds and chance it  sam laughed—the sort of laugh a pal ’ad once give him a black eye for  twenty pounds he ses twenty pounds ’ave you gorn out of your mind or wot i’ll give you a couple of quid for it  well it’s all right captin ses the man there’s no ’arm done i’ll try somebody else—or p’r’aps there’ll be a big reward for it i don’t believe it was bought for a ’undred pounds  he was just sheering off when sam’s pal caught ’im by the arm and asked him to let ’im have another look at it then he came back to sam and led ’im a little way off whispering to ’im that it was the chance of a life time  and if you prefer to keep it for a little while and then sell it instead of getting the reward for it i dare say it would be worth a hundred pounds to you ’e ses  i ain’t got twenty pounds ses sam  ’ow much ’ave you got ses his pal  sam felt in ’is pockets and the docker came up and stood watching while he counted it altogether it was nine pounds fourteen shillings and tuppence  p’r’aps you’ve got some more at ’ome ses his pal  not a farthing ses sam which was true as far as the farthing went  or p’r’aps you could borrer some ses his pal in a soft kind voice i’d lend it to you with pleasure on’y i haven’t got it with me  sam shook his ’ead and at last arter the docker ’ad said he wouldn’t let it go for less than twenty even to save ’is life he let it go for the nine pounds odd a silver watchchain two cigars wot sam ’ad been sitting on by mistake and a sheathknife  shove it in your pocket and don’t let a soul see it ses the man handing over the locket i might as well give it away a’most but it can’t be ’elped  he went off up the ’ill shaking his ’ead and sam’s pal arter watching him for a few seconds said goodbye in a hurry and went off arter ’im to tell him to keep ’is mouth shut about it  sam walked back to his lodgings on air as the saying is and even did a little bit of a skirtdance to a piannerorgan wot was playing peter and ginger was out and so was his landlady a respectable woman as was minding the rest of ’is money for him and when he asked ’er little gal a kid of eleven to trust ’im for some tin she gave ’im a lecture on wasting his money instead wot took ’is breath away—all but a word or two  he got some of ’is money from his landlady at eight o’clock arter listening to ’er for ’arf an hour and then he ’ad to pick it up off of the floor and say thank you for it  he went to bed afore ginger and peter came in but ’e was so excited he couldn’t sleep and long arter they was in bed he laid there and thought of all the different ways of spending a ’undred pounds he kept taking the locket from under ’is piller and feeling it then he felt ’e must ’ave another look at it and arter coughing ’ard two or three times and calling out to the other two not to snore—to see if they was awake—he got out o’ bed and lit the candle ginger and peter was both fast asleep with their eyes screwed up and their mouths wide open and ’e sat on the bed and looked at the locket until he was a’most dazzled  ’ullo sam ses a voice wot ’ave you got there  sam nearly fell off the bed with surprise and temper then ’e hid the locket in his ’and and blew out the candle  who gave it to you ses ginger  you get off to sleep and mind your own bisness ses sam grinding ’is teeth  he got back into bed agin and laid there listening to ginger waking up peter peter woke up disagreeable but when ginger told ’im that sam ’ad stole a gold locket as big as a saucer covered with diamonds he altered ’is mind  let’s ’ave a look at it he ses sitting up  ginger’s dreaming ses sam in a shaky voice i ain’t got no locket wot d’you think i want a locket for  ginger got out o’ bed and lit the candle agin come on he ses let’s ’ave a look at it i wasn’t dreaming i’ve been awake all the time watching you  sam shut ’is eyes and turned his back to them  he’s gone to sleep pore old chap ses ginger we’ll ’ave a look at it without waking ’im you take that side peter mind you don’t disturb ’im  he put his ’and in under the bedclo’es and felt all up and down sam’s back very careful sam stood it for ’arf a minute and then ’e sat up in bed and behaved more like a windmill than a man  hold his ’ands ses ginger  hold ’em yourself ses peter dabbing ’is nose with his shirtsleeve  well we’re going to see it ses ginger if we have to make enough noise to rouse the ’ouse fust of all we’re going to ask you perlite then we shall get louder and louder show us the locket wot you stole sam  show—us—the—diamond locket ses peter  it’s my turn peter ses ginger one two three show—us—th’——  shut up ses sam trembling all over i’ll show it to you if you stop your noise  he put his ’and under his piller but afore he showed it to ’em he sat up in bed and made ’em a little speech he said ’e never wanted to see their faces agin as long as he lived and why ginger’s mother ’adn’t put ’im in a pail o’ cold water when ’e was born ’e couldn’t understand he said ’e didn’t believe that even a mother could love a baby that looked like a codfish with red ’air and as for peter russet ’e believed his mother died of fright  that’ll do ses ginger as sam stopped to get ’is breath are you going to show us the locket or ’ave we got to shout agin  sam swallered something that nearly choked ’im and then he opened his ’and and showed it to them peter told ’im to wave it so as they could see the diamonds flash and then ginger waved the candle to see ’ow they looked that way and pretty near set pore sam’s whiskers on fire  they didn’t leave ’im alone till they knew as much about it as he could tell ’em and they both of ’em told ’im that if he took a reward of thirty pounds for it instead of selling it for a ’undred he was a bigger fool than he looked  i shall turn it over in my mind ses sam sucking ’is teeth when i want your advice i’ll ask you for it  we wasn’t thinking of you ses ginger we was thinking of ourselves  you ses sam with a bit of a start wot’s it got to do with you  our share’ll be bigger that’s all ses ginger  much bigger ses peter i couldn’t dream of letting it go at thirty it’s chucking money away why we might get two ’undred for it who knows  sam sat on the edge of ’is bed like a man in a dream then ’e began to make a noise like a cat with a fishbone in its throat and then ’e stood up and let fly  don’t stop ’im peter ses ginger let ’im go on it’ll do him good  he’s forgot all about that penknife you picked up and went shares in ses peter i wouldn’t be mean for twenty lockets  nor me neither ses ginger but we won’t let ’im be mean—for ’is own sake we’ll ’ave our rights  rights ses sam rights you didn’t find it  we always go shares if we find anything ses ginger where’s your memory sam but i didn’t find it ses sam  no you bought it ses peter and if you don’t go shares we’ll split on you—see then you can’t sell it anyway and perhaps you won’t even get the reward we can be at orange villa as soon as wot you can  sooner ses ginger nodding but there’s no need to do that if ’e don’t go shares i’ll slip round to the policestation fust thing in the morning  you know the way there all right ses sam very bitter  and we don’t want none o’ your backanswers ses ginger are you going shares or not  wot about the money i paid for it ses sam and my trouble  ginger and peter sat down on the bed to talk it over and at last arter calling themselves a lot o’ bad names for being too kind’earted they offered ’im five pounds each for their share in the locket  and that means you’ve got your share for next to nothing sam ses ginger  some people wouldn’t ’ave given you anything ses peter  sam gave way at last and then ’e stood by making nasty remarks while ginger wrote out a paper for them all to sign because he said he had known sam such a long time  it was a’most daylight afore they got to sleep and the fust thing ginger did when he woke was to wake sam up and offer to shake ’ands with him the noise woke peter up and as sam wouldn’t shake ’ands with ’im either they both patted him on the back instead  they made him take ’em to the little pub arter breakfast to read the bill about the reward sam didn’t mind going as it ’appened as he ’oped to meet ’is new pal there and tell ’im his troubles but though they stayed there some time ’e didn’t turn up he wasn’t at the coffeeshop for dinner neither  peter and ginger was in ’igh spirits and though sam told ’em plain that he would sooner walk about with a couple of real pickpockets they wouldn’t leave ’im an inch  anybody could steal it off of you sam ses ginger patting ’im on the weskit to make sure the locket was still there it’s a good job you’ve got us to look arter you  we must buy ’im a moneybelt with a pocket in it ses peter  ginger nodded at ’im yes he ses that would be safer and he’d better wear it next to ’is skin with everything over it i should feel more comfortable then  and wot about me says sam turning on ’im  well we’ll take it in turns ses ginger you one day and then me and then peter  sam gave way at last as arter all he could see it was the safest thing to do but he ’ad so much to say about it that they got fair sick of the sound of ’is voice they ’ad to go ’ome for ’im to put the belt on and then at seven o’clock in the evening arter sam had ’ad two or three pints they had to go ’ome agin ’cos he was complaining of tightlacing  ginger had it on next day and he went ’ome five times the other two went with ’im in case he lost ’imself and stood there making nasty remarks while he messed ’imself up with a penn’orth of cold cream it was a cheap belt and pore ginger said that when they ’ad done with it it would come in handy for sandpaper  peter didn’t like it any better than the other two did and twice they ’ad to speak to ’im about stopping in the street and trying to make ’imself more comfortable by wriggling sam said people misunderstood it  arter that they agreed to wear it outside their shirt and even then ginger said it scratched ’im and every day they got more and more worried about wot was the best thing to do with the locket and whether it would be safe to try and sell it the idea o’ walking about with a fortune in their pockets that they couldn’t spend a’most drove ’em crazy  the longer we keep it the safer it’ll be ses sam as they was walking down houndsditch one day  we’ll sell it when i’m sixty ses ginger nastylike  then old sam won’t be ’ere to have ’is share ses peter  sam was just going to answer ’em back when he stopped and began to smile instead straight in front of ’im was the gentleman he ’ad met in the coffeeshop coming along with another man and he just ’ad time to see that it was the docker who ’ad sold him the locket when they both saw ’im they turned like a flash and afore sam could get ’is breath bolted up a little alley and disappeared  wot’s the row ses ginger staring  sam didn’t answer ’im he stood there struck all of a heap  do you know ’em ses peter  sam couldn’t answer ’im for a time he was doing a bit of ’ard thinking  chap i ’ad a row with the other night he ses at last  he walked on very thoughtful and the more ’e thought the less ’e liked it he was so pale that ginger thought ’e was ill and advised ’im to ’ave a drop o’ brandy peter recommended rum so to please ’em he ’ad both it brought ’is colour back but not ’is cheerfulness  he gave ’em both the slip next morning which was easy as ginger was wearing the locket and arter fust ’aving a long ride for nothing owing to getting in the wrong train he got to barnet  it was a big place big enough to ’ave a dozen orange villas but pore sam couldn’t find one it wasn’t for want of trying neither  he asked at over twenty shops and the postoffice and even went to the policestation he must ha’ walked six or seven miles looking for it and at last ’arf ready to drop ’e took the train back  he ’ad some sausages and mashed potatoes with a pint o’ stout at a place in bishopsgate and then ’e started to walk ’ome the only comfort he ’ad was the thought of the ten pounds ginger and peter ’ad paid ’im and when he remembered that he began to cheer up and even smile by the time he got ’ome ’e was beaming all over ’is face  where’ve you been ses ginger  enjoying myself by myself ses sam  please yourself ses peter very severe but where’d you ha’ been if we ’ad sold the locket and skipped eh  you wouldn’t ’ave enjoyed yourself by yourself then ses ginger yes you may laugh  sam didn’t answer ’im but he sat down on ’is bed and ’is shoulders shook till ginger lost his temper and gave him a couple o’ thumps on the back that pretty near broke it  all right ses sam very firm now you ’ave done for yourselves i ’ad a’most made up my mind to go shares now you sha’n’t ’ave a ha’penny  ginger laughed then ho he ses and ’ow are you going to prevent it  we’ve got the locket sam ses peter smiling and shaking his ’ead at ’im  and we’ll mind it till it’s sold ses ginger  sam laughed agin short and nasty then he undressed ’imself very slow and got into bed at twelve o’clock just as ginger was dropping off he began to laugh agin and ’e only stopped when ’e heard ginger getting out of bed to ’im  he stayed in bed next morning ’cos he said ’is sides was aching but ’e laughed agin as they was going out and when they came back he ’ad gorn  we never know ’ow much we’ like anything till we lose it a week arterwards as ginger was being ’elped out of a pawnshop by peter he said ’e would give all he ’adn’t got for the locket to be near enough to sam to hear ’im laugh agin     paying off     my biggest fault said the nightwatchman gloomily has been good nature i’ve spent the best part of my life trying to do my fellowcreeturs a good turn and what do i get for it if all the people i’ve helped was to come ’ere now there wouldn’t be standing room for them on this wharf ’arf of them would be pushed overboard—and a good place for ’em too  i’ve been like it all my life i was goodnatured enough to go to sea as a boy because a skipper took a fancy to me and wanted my ’elp and when i got older i was goodnatured enough to get married all my life i’ve given ’elp and advice free and only a day or two ago one of ’em wot i ’ad given it to came round here with her ’usband and ’er two brothers and ’er mother and two or three people from the same street to see her give me wot for  another fault o’ mine has been being sharp most people make mistakes and they can’t bear to see anybody as don’t over and over agin i have showed people ’ow silly they ’ave been to do certain things and told ’em wot i should ha’ done in their place but i can’t remember one that ever gave me a thank you for it  there was a man ’ere ’arf an hour ago that reminded me of both of these faults he came in apurpose to remind me and ’e brought a couple o’ grinning brassfaced monkeys with ’im to see ’im do it i was sitting on that barrel when he came and arter two minutes i felt as if i was sitting on red’ot cinders he purtended he ’ad come in for the sake of old times and to ask arter my ’ealth and all the time he was doing ’is best to upset me to amuse them two pore objecks ’e ’ad brought with ’im  capt’in mellun is his name and ’e was always a foolish soft’eaded sort o’ man and how he ’as kept ’is job i can’t think he used to trade between this wharf and bristol on a little schooner called the firefly and seeing wot a silly foolish kind o’ man he was i took a little bit o’ notice of ’im many and many a time when ’e was going to do something he’d ha’ been sorry for arterwards i ’ave taken ’im round to the bear’s head and stood ’im pint arter pint until he began to see reason and own up that i was in the right  his crew was a’most as bad as wot he was and all in one month one o’ the ’ands gave a man ten shillings for a di’mond ring he saw ’im pick up wot turned out to be worth fourpence and another one gave five bob for a meerschaum pipe made o’ chalk when i pointed out to ’em wot fools they was they didn’t like it and a week arterwards when the skipper gave a man in a pub ’is watch and chain and two pounds to hold to show ’is confidence in ’im and i told ’im exactly wot i thought of him ’e didn’t like it  you’re too sharp bill he says sneering like my opinion is that the pore man was run over he told me ’e should only be away five minutes and he ’ad got an honest face nice open blue eyes and a smile that done you good to look at  you’ve been swindled i ses and you know it if i’d been done like that i should never hold up my ’ead agin why a child o’ five would know better you and your crew all seem to be tarred with the same brush you ain’t fit to be trusted out alone  i believe ’e told his ’ands wot i said anyway two bits o’ coke missed me by ’arf an inch next evening and for some weeks not one of ’em spoke a word to me when they see me coming they just used to stand up straight and twist their nose  it didn’t ’urt me o’ course i took no notice of ’em even when one of ’em fell over the broom i was sweeping with i took no notice of ’im i just went on with my work as if ’e wasn’t there  i suppose they ’ad been in the sulks about a month and i was sitting ’ere one evening getting my breath arter a couple o’ hours’ ’ard work when one of ’em george tebb by name came off the ship and nodded to me as he passed  evening bill he ses  evening i ses rather stiff  i wanted a word with you bill he ses in a low voice in fact i might go so far as to say i want to ask you to do me a favour  i looked at him so ’ard that he coughed and looked away  we might talk about it over a ’arfpint he ses  no thank you i ses i ’ad a ’arfpint the day before yesterday and i’m not thirsty  he stood there fidgeting about for a bit and then he puts his ’and on my shoulder  well come to the end of the jetty he ses i’ve got something private to say  i got up slowlike and followed ’im i wasn’t a bit curious not a bit but if a man asks for my ’elp i always give it  it’s like this he ses looking round careful only i don’t want the other chaps to hear because i don’t want to be laughed at last week an old uncle o’ mine died and left me thirty pounds it’s just a week ago and i’ve already got through five of ’em and besides that the number of chaps that want to borrow ten bob for a couple o’ days would surprise you  i ain’t so easy surprised i ses shaking my ’ead  it ain’t safe with me he ses and the favour i want you to do is to take care of it for me i know it’ll go if i keep it i’ve got it locked up in this box and if you keep the box i’ll keep the key and when i want a bit i’ll come and see you about it  he pulled a little box out of ’is pocket and rattled it in my ear  there’s fiveandtwenty golden goblins in there he ses if you take charge of ’em they’ll be all right if you don’t i’m pretty certain i sha’n’t ’ave one of ’em in a week or two’s time  at fust i said i wouldn’t ’ave anything to do with it but he begged so ’ard that i began to alter my mind  you’re as honest as daylight bill he ses very earnest i don’t know another man in the world i could trust with twentyfive quid— especially myself now put it in your pocket and look arter it for me one of the quids in it is for you for your trouble  he slipped the box in my coatpocket and then he said ’is mind was so relieved that ’e felt like ’arf a pint i was for going to the bear’s head the place i generally go to because it is next door to the wharf so to speak but george wanted me to try the beer at another place he knew of  the wharf’s all right he ses there’s one or two ’ands on the ship and they won’t let anybody run away with it  from wot he said i thought the pub was quite close but instead o’ that i should think we walked pretty nearly a mile afore we got there nice snug place it was and the beer was all right although as i told george tebb it didn’t seem to me any better than the stuff at the bear’s head  he stood me two ’arfpints and was just going to order another when ’e found ’e ’adn’t got any money left and he wouldn’t hear of me paying for it because ’e said it was his treat  we’ll ’ave a quid out o’ the box he ses i must ’ave one to go on with anyway i shook my ’ead at ’im  only one he ses and that’ll last me a fortnight besides i want to give you the quid i promised you  i gave way at last and he put his ’and in ’is trouserpocket for the key and then found it wasn’t there  i must ha’ left it in my chest he ses i’ll ’op back and get it and afore i could prevent ’im he ’ad waved his ’and at me and gorn  my fust idea was to go arter ’im but i knew i couldn’t catch ’im and if i tried to meet ’im coming back i should most likely miss ’im through the side streets so i sat there with my pipe and waited  i suppose i ’ad been sitting down waiting for him for about ten minutes when a couple o’ sailormen came into the bar and began to make themselves a nuisance big fat chaps they was and both of ’em more than ’arf sprung and arter calling for a pint apiece they began to take a little notice of me  where d’you come from ses one of ’em ’ome i ses very quiet  it’s a good place—’ome ses the chap shaking his ’ead can you sing ’’ome sweet ’ome’ you seem to ’ave got wot i might call a ’singing face’  never mind about my face i ses very sharp you mind wot you’re doing with that beer you’ll ’ave it over in a minute  the words was ’ardly out of my mouth afore ’e gave a lurch and spilt his pint all over me from ’ead to foot i was dripping with beer and i was in such a temper i wonder i didn’t murder ’im but afore i could move they both pulled out their pocket’ankerchers and started to rub me down  that’ll do i ses at last arter they ’ad walked round me ’arfadozen times and patted me all over to see if i was dry you get off while you’re safe  it was my mistake mate ses the chap who ’ad spilt the beer  you get outside i ses go on both of you afore i put you out  they gave one look at me standing there with my fists clenched and then they went out like lambs and i ’eard ’em trot round the corner as though they was afraid i was following i felt a little bit damp and chilly but beer is like seawater—you don’t catch cold through it—and i sat down agin to wait for george tebb  he came in smiling and out ’o breath in about ten minutes’ time with the key in ’is ’and and as soon as i told ’im wot had ’appened to me with the beer he turned to the landlord and ordered me six o’ rum ’ot at once  drink that up he ses ’anding it to me but fust of all give me the box so as i can pay for it  i put my ’and in my pocket then i put it in the other one and arter that i stood staring at george tebb and shaking all over  wot’s the matter wot are you looking like that for he ses  it must ha’ been them two i ses choking while they was purtending to dry me and patting me all over they must ’ave taken it out of my pocket  wot are you talking about ses george staring at me  the box ’as gorn i ses putting down the ’ot rum and feeling in my trouserpocket the box ’as gorn and them two must ’ave taken it  gorn ses george gorn my box with twentyfive pounds in wot i trusted you with gorn wot are you talking about it can’t be—it’s too crool  he made such a noise that the landlord wot was waiting for ’is money asked ’im wot he meant by it and arter he ’ad explained i’m blest if the landlord didn’t advise him to search me i stood still and let george go through my pockets and then i told ’im i ’ad done with ’im and i never wanted to see ’im agin as long as i lived  i dare say ses george i dare say but you’ll come along with me to the wharf and see the skipper i’m not going to lose fiveandtwenty quid through your carelessness  i marched along in front of ’im with my ’ead in the air and when he spoke to me i didn’t answer him he went aboard the ship when we got to the wharf and a minute or two arterwards ’e came to the side and said the skipper wanted to see me  the airs the skipper gave ’imself was sickening he sat down there in ’is miserable little rat’ole of a cabin and acted as if ’e was a judge and i was a prisoner most of the ’ands ’ad squeezed in there too and the things they advised george to do to me was remarkable  silence ses the skipper now watchman tell me exactly ’ow this thing ’appened  i’ve told you once i ses  i know ses the skipper but i want you to tell me again to see if you contradict yourself i can’t understand ’ow such a clever man as you could be done so easy  i thought i should ha’ bust but i kept my face wonderful i just asked ’im wot the men was like that got off with ’is watch and chain and two pounds in case they might be the same  that’s different he ses  oh ses i ’ow  i lost my own property he ses but you lost george’s and ’ow a man like you that’s so much sharper and cleverer than other people could be had so easy i can’t think why a child of five would ha’ known better  a baby in arms would ha’ known better ses the man wot ’ad bought the di’mond ring ’ow could you ’ave been so silly bill at your time o’ life too  that’s neither ’ere nor there ses the skipper the watchman has lost twentyfive quid belonging to one o’ my men the question is wot is he going to do about it  nothing i ses i didn’t ask ’im to let me mind the box he done it of ’is own free will it’s got nothing to do with me  oh hasn’t it ses the skipper drawing ’imself up i don’t want to be too ’ard on you but at the same time i can’t let my man suffer i’ll make it as easy as i can and i order you to pay ’im five shillings a week till the twentyfive pounds is cleared off  i laughed i couldn’t ’elp it i just stood there and laughed at ’im  if you don’t ses the skipper then i shall lay the facts of the case afore the guv’nor whether he’ll object to you being in a pub a mile away taking care of a box of gold while you was supposed to be taking care of the wharf is his bisness my bisness is to see that my man ’as ’is rights  ’ear ’ear  ses the crew  you please yourself watchman ses the skipper you’re such a clever man that no doubt you could get a better job tomorrow there must be ’eaps of people wanting a man like you it’s for you to decide that’s all i’ve got to say—five bob a week till pore george ’as got ’is money back or else i put the case afore the guv’nor wot did you say  i said it agin and as ’e didn’t seem to understand i said it once more  please yourself ’e ses when i ’ad finished you’re an old man and five bob a week can’t be much loss to you you’ve got nothing to spend it on at your time o’ life and you’ve got a very soft job ’ere wot  i didn’t answer ’im i just turned round and arter giving a man wot stood in my way a punch in the chest i got up on deck and on to the wharf and said my little say all alone to myself behind the crane  i paid the fust five bob to george tebb the next time the ship was up and arter biting ’em over and over agin and then ringing ’em on the deck ’e took the other chaps round to the bear’s head  p’r’aps it’s just as well it’s ’appened he ses five bob a week for nearly two years ain’t to be sneezed at it’s slow but it’s sure  i thought ’e was joking at fust but arter working it out in the office with a bit o’ pencil and paper i thought i should ha’ gorn crazy and when i complained about the time to george ’e said i could make it shorter if i liked by paying ten bob a week but ’e thought the steady five bob a week was best for both of us  i got to ’ate the sight of ’im every week regular as clockwork he used to come round to me with his ’and out and then go and treat ’is mates to beer with my money if the ship came up in the daytime at six o’clock in the evening he’d be at the wharf gate waiting for me and if it came up at night she was no sooner made fast than ’e was over the side patting my trouserpocket and saying wot a good job it was for both of us that i was in steady employment  week arter week and month arter month i went on paying i a’most forgot the taste o’ beer and if i could manage to get a screw o’ baccy a week i thought myself lucky and at last just as i thought i couldn’t stand it any longer the end came  i ’ad just given george ’is week’s money—and ’ow i got it together that week i don’t know—when one o’ the chaps came up and said the skipper wanted to see me on board at once  tell ’im if he wants to see me i’m to be found on the wharf i ses very sharp  he wants to see you about george’s money ses the chap i should go if i was you my opinion is he wants to do you a good turn  i ’ung fire for a bit and then arter sweeping up for a little while deliberatelike i put down my broom and stepped aboard to see the skipper wot was sitting on the cabin skylight purtending to read a newspaper  he put it down when ’e see me and george and the others wot ’ad been standing in a little bunch for’ard came aft and stood looking on  i wanted to see you about this money watchman ses the skipper putting on ’is beastly frills agin o’ course we all feel that to a pore man like you it’s a bit of a strain and as george ses arter all you have been more foolish than wicked  much more ses george  i find that you ’ave now paid five bob a week for nineteen weeks ses the skipper and george ’as been kind enough and generous enough to let you off the rest there’s no need for you to look bashful george it’s a credit to you  i could ’ardly believe my ears george stood there grinning like a stuck fool and two o’ the chaps was on their best behaviour with their ’ands over their mouths and their eyes sticking out  that’s all watchman ses the skipper and i ’ope it’ll be a lesson to you not to neglect your dooty by going into public’ouses and taking charge of other people’s money when you ain’t fit for it  i sha’n’t try to do anybody else a kindness agin if that’s wot you mean i ses looking at ’im  no you’d better not he ses this partickler bit o’ kindness ’as cost you four pounds fifteen and that’s a curious thing when you come to think of it very curious  wot d’ye mean i ses  why he ses grinning like a madman it’s just wot we lost between us i lost a watch and chain worth two pounds and another couple o’ pounds besides joe lost ten shillings over ’is di’mond ring and charlie lost five bob over a pipe ’that’s four pounds fifteen—just the same as you  them silly fools stood there choking and sobbing and patting each other on the back as though they’d never leave off and all of a sudden i ’ad a ’orrible suspicion that i ’ad been done  did you see the sovereigns in the box i ses turning to the skipper  no he ses shaking his ’ead  ’ow do you know they was there then ses i  because you took charge of ’em said the skipper and i know wot a clever sharp chap you are it stands to reason that you wouldn’t be responsible for a box like that unless you saw inside of it why a child o’ five wouldn’t  i stood there looking at ’im but he couldn’t meet my eye none of ’em could and arter waiting there for a minute or two to give ’em a chance i turned my back on ’em and went off to my dooty     made to measure     mr mott brought his niece home from the station with considerable pride although he had received a photograph to assist identification he had been very dubious about accosting the pretty welldressed girl who had stepped from the train and gazed around with dovelike eyes in search of him now he was comfortably conscious of the admiring gaze of his younger fellowtownsmen  you’ll find it a bit dull after london i expect he remarked as he inserted his key in the door of a small house in a quiet street  i’m tired of london said miss garland i think this is a beautiful little old town—so peaceful  mr mott looked gratified  i hope you’ll stay a long time he said as he led the way into the small front room i’m a lonely old man  his niece sank into an easy chair and looked about her  thank you she said slowly i hope i shall i feel better already there is so much to upset one in london  noise queried mr mott  and other things said miss garland with a slight shudder  mr mott sighed in sympathy with the unknown and judging by his niece’s expression the unknowable he rearranged the teacups and going to the kitchen returned in a few minutes with a pot of tea  mrs pett leaves at three he said in explanation to look after her children but she comes back again at eight to look after my supper and how is your mother  miss garland told him  last letter i had from her said mr mott stealing a glance at the girl’s ringfinger i understood you were engaged  his niece drew herself up  certainly not she said with considerable vigour i have seen too much of married life i prefer my freedom besides i don’t like men  mr mott said modestly that he didn’t wonder at it and finding the subject uncongenial turned the conversation on to worthier subjects miss garland’s taste it seemed lay in the direction of hospital nursing or some other occupation beneficial to mankind at large simple and demure she filled the simpler mr mott with a strong sense of the shortcomings of his unworthy sex  within two days under the darkling glance of mrs pett she had altered the arrangements of the house flowers appeared on the mealtable knives and forks were properly cleaned and plates no longer appeared ornamented with the mustard of a previous meal fresh air circulated through the house and passing from mrs pett’s left knee to the lumbar region of mr mott went on its beneficent way rejoicing  on the fifth day of her visit mr mott sat alone in the front parlour the window was closed the door was closed and mr mott sitting in an easy chair with his feet up was aroused from a sound nap by the door opening to admit a young man who deserted by mrs pett stood bowing awkwardly in the doorway  is miss garland in he stammered  mr mott rubbed the remnants of sleep from his eyelids  she has gone for a walk he said slowly  the young man stood fingering his hat  my name is hurst he said with slight emphasis mr alfred hurst  mr mott still somewhat confused murmured that he was glad to hear it  i have come from london to see florrie continued the intruder i suppose she won’t be long  mr mott thought not and after a moment’s hesitation invited mr hurst to take a chair  i suppose she told you we are engaged said the latter  engaged said the startled mr mott why she told me she didn’t like men  playfulness replied mr hurst with an odd look ah here she is  the handle of the front door turned and a moment later the door of the room was opened and the charming head of miss garland appeared in the opening  back again she said brightly i’ve just been——  she caught sight of mr hurst and the words died away on her lips the door slammed and the two gentlemen exchanging glances heard a hurried rush upstairs and the slamming of another door also a key was heard to turn sharply in a lock  she doesn’t want to see you said mr mott staring  the young man turned pale  perhaps she has gone upstairs to take her things off he muttered resuming his seat don’t—don’t hurry her  i wasn’t going to said mr mott  he twisted his beard uneasily and at the end of ten minutes looked from the clock to mr hurst and coughed  if you wouldn’t mind letting her know i’m waiting said the young man brokenly  mr mott rose and went slowly upstairs more slowly still after an interval of a few minutes he came back again  she doesn’t want to see you he said slowly  mr hurst gasped  i—i must see her he faltered  she won’t see you repeated mr mott and she told me to say she was surprised at you following her down here  mr hurst uttered a faint moan and with bent head passed into the little passage and out into the street leaving mr mott to return to the sittingroom and listen to such explanations as miss garland deemed advisable great goodness of heart in the face of persistent and unwelcome attentions appeared to be responsible for the late engagement  well it’s over now said her uncle kindly and no doubt he’ll soon find somebody else there are plenty of girls would jump at him i expect  miss garland shook her head  he said he couldn’t live without me she remarked soberly  mr mott laughed  in less than three months i expect he’ll be congratulating himself he said cheerfully why i was nearly cau—married four times it’s a silly age  his niece said indeed and informing him in somewhat hostile tones that she was suffering from a severe headache retired to her room  mr mott spent the evening by himself and retiring to bed at tenthirty was awakened by a persistent knocking at the front door at halfpast one half awakened he lit a candle and stumbling downstairs drew back the bolt of the door and stood gaping angrily at the pathetic features of mr hurst  sorry to disturb you said the young man but would you mind giving this letter to miss garland  sorry to disturb me stuttered mr mott what do you mean by it eh what do you mean by it  it is important said mr hurst i can’t rest i’ve eaten nothing all day  glad to hear it snapped the irritated mr mott  if you will give her that letter i shall feel easier said mr hurst  i’ll give it to her in the morning said the other snatching it from him now get off  mr hurst still murmuring apologies went and mr mott also murmuring returned to bed the night was chilly and it was some time before he could get to sleep again he succeeded at last only to be awakened an hour later by a knocking more violent than before in a state of mind bordering upon frenzy he dived into his trousers again and went blundering downstairs in the dark  sorry to— began mr hurst  mr mott made uncouth noises at him  i have altered my mind said the young man would you mind letting me have that letter back again it was too final  you—get—off said the other trembling with cold and passion  i must have that letter said mr hurst doggedly all my future happiness may depend upon it  mr mott afraid to trust himself with speech dashed upstairs and after a search for the matches found the letter and returning to the front door shut it on the visitor’s thanks his niece’s door opened as he passed it and a gentle voice asked for enlightenment  how silly of him she said softly i hope he won’t catch cold what did you say  i was coughing said mr mott hastily  you’ll get cold if you’re not careful said his thoughtful niece that’s the worst of men they never seem to have any thought did he seem angry or mournful or what i suppose you couldn’t see his face  i didn’t try said mr mott crisply good night  by the morning his illhumour had vanished and he even became slightly facetious over the events of the night the mood passed at the same moment that mr hurst passed the window  better have him in and get it over he said irritably  miss garland shuddered  never she said firmly he’d be down on his knees it would be too painful you don’t know him  don’t want to said mr mott  he finished his breakfast in silence and after a digestive pipe proposed a walk the profile of mr hurst as it went forlornly past the window again served to illustrate miss garland’s refusal  i’ll go out and see him said mr mott starting up are you going to be a prisoner here until this young idiot chooses to go home it’s preposterous  he crammed his hat on firmly and set out in pursuit of mr hurst who was walking slowly up the street glancing over his shoulder morning said mr mott fiercely good morning said the other  now look here said mr mott this has gone far enough and i won’t have any more of it why you ought to be ashamed of yourself chivvying a young lady that doesn’t want you haven’t you got any pride  no said the young man not where she is concerned  i don’t believe you have said the other regarding him and i expect that’s where the trouble is did she ever have reason to think you were looking after any other girls  never i swear it said mr hurst eagerly  just so said mr mott with a satisfied nod that’s where you made a mistake she was too sure of you it was too easy no excitement girls like a man that other girls want they don’t want a turtledove in fancy trousers  mr hurst coughed  and they like a determined man continued miss garland’s uncle why in my young days if i had been jilted and come down to see about it d’you think i’d have gone out of the house without seeing her i might have been put out—by halfadozen—but i’d have taken the mantelpiece and a few other things with me and you are bigger than i am  we aren’t all made the same said mr hurst feebly  no we’re not said mr mott i’m not blaming you in a way i’m sorry for you if you’re not born with a high spirit nothing’ll give it to you  it might be learnt said mr hurst mr mott laughed  high spirits are born not made he said the best thing you can do is to go and find another girl and marry her before she finds you out  mr hurst shook his head  there’s no other girl for me he said miserably and everything seemed to be going so well we’ve been buying things for the house for the last six months and i’ve just got a good rise in my screw  it’ll do for another girl said mr mott briskly now you get off back to town you are worrying florrie by staying here and you are doing no good to anybody goodbye  i’ll walk back as far as the door with you said mr hurst you’ve done me good it’s a pity i didn’t meet you before  remember what i’ve told you and you’ll do well yet he said patting the young man on the arm  i will said mr hurst and walked on by his side deep in thought  i can’t ask you in said mr mott jocularly as he reached his door and turned the key in the lock goodbye  goodbye said mr hurst  he grasped the other’s outstretched hand and with a violent jerk pulled him into the street then he pushed open the door and slipping into the passage passed hastily into the front room closely followed by the infuriated mr mott  what—what—what stammered that gentleman  i’m taking your tip said mr hurst pale but determined i’m going to stay here until i have seen florrie  you—you’re a serpent said mr mott struggling for breath i—i’m surprised at you you go out before you get hurt  not without the mantelpiece said mr hurst with a distorted grin  a viper said mr mott with extreme bitterness if you are not out in two minutes i’ll send for the police  florrie wouldn’t like that said mr hurst she’s awfully particular about what people think you just trot upstairs and tell her that a gentleman wants to see her  he threw himself into mr mott’s own particular easy chair and crossing his knees turned a deaf ear to the threats of that incensed gentleman not until the latter had left the room did his features reveal the timorousness of the soul within muffled voices sounded from upstairs and it was evident that an argument of considerable length was in progress it was also evident from the return of mr mott alone that his niece had had the best of it  i’ve done all i could he said but she declines to see you she says she won’t see you if you stay here for a month and you couldn’t do that you know  why not inquired mr hurst  why not repeated mr mott repressing his feelings with some difficulty food  mr hurst started  and drink said mr mott following up his advantage there’s no good in starving yourself for nothing so you may as well go  when i’ve seen florrie said the young man firmly  mr mott slammed the door and for the rest of the day mr hurst saw him no more at one o’clock a savoury smell passed the door on its way upstairs and at five o’clock a middleaged woman with an inane smile looked into the room on her way aloft with a loaded teatray by supper time he was suffering considerably from hunger and thirst  at ten o’clock he heard the footsteps of mr mott descending the stairs the door opened an inch and a gruff voice demanded to know whether he was going to stay there all night receiving a cheerful reply in the affirmative mr mott secured the front door with considerable violence and went off to bed without another word  he was awakened an hour or two later by the sound of something falling and sitting up in bed to listen became aware of a warm and agreeable odour it was somewhere about the hour of midnight but a breakfast smell of eggs and bacon would not be denied  he put on some clothes and went downstairs a crack of light showed under the kitchen door and pushing it open with some force he gazed spellbound at the spectacle before him  come in said mr hurst heartily i’ve just finished  he rocked an empty beerbottle and patted another that was half full satiety was written on his face as he pushed an empty plate from him and leaning back in his chair smiled lazily at mr mott  go on said that gentleman hoarsely mr hurst shook his head  enough is as good as a feast he said reasonably i’ll have some more tomorrow  oh will you said the other will you  mr hurst nodded and opening his coat disclosed a bottle of beer in each breastpocket the other pockets it appeared contained food  and here’s the money for it he said putting down some silver on the table i am determined but honest  with a sweep of his hand mr mott sent the money flying  tomorrow morning i send for the police mind that he roared  i’d better have my breakfast early then said mr hurst tapping his pockets good night and thank you for your advice  he sat for some time after the disappearance of his host and then returning to the front room placed a chair at the end of the sofa and with the tablecloth for a quilt managed to secure a few hours’ troubled sleep at eight o’clock he washed at the scullery sink and at ten o’clock mr mott with an air of great determination came in to deliver his ultimatum  if you’re not outside the front door in five minutes i’m going to fetch the police he said fiercely  i want to see florrie said the other  well you won’t see her shouted mr mott  mr hurst stood feeling his chin  well would you mind taking a message for me he asked i just want you to ask her whether i am really free ask her whether i am free to marry again  mr mott eyed him in amazement  you see i only heard from her mother pursued mr hurst and a friend of mine who is in a solicitor’s office says that isn’t good enough i only came down here to make sure and i think the least she can do is to tell me herself if she won’t see me perhaps she’d put it in writing you see there’s another lady  but said the mystified mr mott  you told me——  you tell her that said the other  mr mott stood for a few seconds staring at him and then without a word turned on his heel and went upstairs left to himself mr hurst walked nervously up and down the room and catching sight of his face in the oldfashioned glass on the mantelpiece heightened its colour by a few pinches the minutes seemed interminable but at last he heard the steps of mr mott on the stairs again  she’s coming down to see you herself said the latter solemnly  mr hurst nodded and turning to the window tried in vain to take an interest in passing events a light step sounded on the stairs the door creaked and he turned to find himself confronted by miss garland  uncle told me she began coldly mr hurst bowed  i am sorry to have caused you so much trouble he said trying to control his voice but you see my position don’t you  no said the girl  well i wanted to make sure said mr hurst it’s best for all of us isn’t it best for you best for me and of course for my young lady  you never said anything about her before said miss garland her eyes darkening  of course not said mr hurst how could i i was engaged to you and then she wasn’t my young lady but of course as soon as you broke it off—  who is she inquired miss garland in a casual voice  you don’t know her said mr hurst  what is she like  i can’t describe her very well said mr hurst i can only say she’s the most beautiful girl i have ever seen i think that’s what made me take to her and she’s easily pleased she liked the things i have been buying for the house tremendously  did she said miss garland with a gasp  all except that pair of vases you chose continued the veracious mr hurst she says they are in bad taste but she can give them to the charwoman  oh said the girl oh indeed very kind of her isn’t there anything else she doesn’t like  mr hurst stood considering  she doesn’t like the upholstering of the best chairs he said at last she thinks they are too showy so she’s going to put covers over them  there was a long pause during which mr mott taking his niece gently by the arm assisted her to a chair  otherwise she is quite satisfied concluded mr hurst  miss garland took a deep breath but made no reply  i have got to satisfy her that i am free said the young man after another pause i suppose that i can do so  i—i’ll think it over said miss garland in a low voice i am not sure what is the right thing to do i don’t want to see you made miserable for life it’s nothing to me of course but still—  she got up and shaking off the proffered assistance of her uncle went slowly and languidly up to her room mr mott followed her as far as the door and then turned indignantly upon mr hurst  you—you’ve broke her heart he said solemnly  that’s all right said mr hurst with a delighted wink i’ll mend it again     sam’s ghost     yes i know said the nightwatchman thoughtfully as he sat with a cold pipe in his mouth gazing across the river i’ve ’eard it afore people tell me they don’t believe in ghosts and make a laugh of ’em and all i say is let them take on a nightwatchman’s job let ’em sit ’ere all alone of a night with the water lapping against the posts and the wind moaning in the corners especially if a pal of theirs has slipped overboard and there is little nasty bills stuck up just outside in the high street offering a reward for the body twice men ’ave fallen overboard from this jetty and i’ve ’ad to stand my watch here the same night and not a farthing more for it  one of the worst and artfullest ghosts i ever ’ad anything to do with was sam bullet he was a waterman at the stairs near by ’ere the sort o’ man that ’ud get you to pay for drinks and drink yours up by mistake arter he ’ad finished his own the sort of man that ’ad always left his baccybox at ’ome but always ’ad a big pipe in ’is pocket  he fell overboard off of a lighter one evening and all that his mates could save was ’is cap it was on’y two nights afore that he ’ad knocked down an old man and bit a policeman’s little finger to the bone so that as they pointed out to the widder p’r’aps he was taken for a wise purpose p’r’aps he was ’appier where he was than doing six months  he was the sort o’ chap that’ll make himself ’appy anywhere ses one of ’em comfortinglike  not without me ses mrs bullet sobbing and wiping her eyes on something she used for a pockethankercher he never could bear to be away from me was there no last words  on’y one ses one o’ the chaps joe peel by name  as ’e fell overboard ses the other  mrs bullet began to cry agin and say wot a good ’usband he ’ad been seventeen years come michaelmas she ses and never a cross word nothing was too good for me nothing i ’ad only to ask to ’ave  well he’s gorn now ses joe and we thought we ought to come round and tell you  so as you can tell the police ses the other chap  that was ’ow i came to hear of it fust a policeman told me that night as i stood outside the gate ’aving a quiet pipe he wasn’t shedding tears his only idea was that sam ’ad got off too easy  well well i ses trying to pacify ’im he won’t bite no more fingers there’s no policemen where he’s gorn to  he went off grumbling and telling me to be careful and i put my pipe out and walked up and down the wharf thinking on’y a month afore i ’ad lent sam fifteen shillings on a gold watch and chain wot he said an uncle ’ad left ’im i wasn’t wearing it because ’e said ’is uncle wouldn’t like it but i ’ad it in my pocket and i took it out under one of the lamps and wondered wot i ought to do  my fust idea was to take it to mrs bullet and then all of a sudden the thought struck me suppose he ’adn’t come by it honest  i walked up and down agin thinking if he ’adn’t and it was found out it would blacken his good name and break ’is pore wife’s ’art that’s the way i looked at it and for his sake and ’er sake i determined to stick to it  i felt ’appier in my mind when i ’ad decided on that and i went round to the bear’s head and ’ad a pint arter that i ’ad another and then i come back to the wharf and put the watch and chain on and went on with my work  every time i looked down at the chain on my waistcoat it reminded me of sam i looked on to the river and thought of ’im going down on the ebb then i got a sort o’ lonesome feeling standing on the end of the jetty all alone and i went back to the bear’s head and ’ad another pint  they didn’t find the body and i was a’most forgetting about sam when one evening as i was sitting on a box waiting to get my breath back to ’ave another go at sweeping joe peel sam’s mate came on to the wharf to see me  he came in a mysterious sort o’ way that i didn’t like looking be’ind ’im as though he was afraid of being follered and speaking in a whisper as if ’e was afraid of being heard he wasn’t a man i liked and i was glad that the watch and chain was stowed safe away in my trowsispocket  i’ve ’ad a shock watchman he ses  oh i ses  a shock wot’s shook me all up he ses working up a shiver i’ve seen something wot i thought people never could see and wot i never want to see agin i’ve seen sam  i thought a bit afore i spoke why i thought he was drownded i ses  so ’e is ses joe when i say i’ve seen ’im i mean that i ’ave seen his ghost  he began to shiver agin all over  wot was it like i ses very calm  like sam he ses rather short  when was it i ses  last night at a quarter to twelve he ses it was standing at my front door waiting for me  and ’ave you been shivering like that ever since i ses  worse than that ses joe looking at me very ’ard it’s wearing off now the ghost gave me a message for you  i put my ’and in my trowsispocket and looked at ’im then i walked very slow towards the gate  it gave me a message for you ses joe walking beside me ’we was always pals joe’ it ses ’you and me and i want you to pay up fifteen bob for me wot i borrowed off of bill the watchman i can’t rest until it’s paid’ it ses so here’s the fifteen bob watchman  he put his ’and in ’is pocket and takes out fifteen bob and ’olds it out to me  no no i ses i can’t take your money joe peel it wouldn’t be right pore sam is welcome to the fifteen bob—i don’t want it  you must take it ses joe the ghost said if you didn’t it would come to me agin and agin till you did and i can’t stand any more of it  i can’t ’elp your troubles i ses  you must ses joe ’give bill the fifteen bob’ it ses ’and he’ll give you a gold watch and chain wot i gave ’im to mind till it was paid’  i see his little game then gold watch and chain i ses laughing you must ha’ misunderstood it joe  i understood it right enough ses joe getting a bit closer to me as i stepped outside the gate here’s your fifteen bob are you going to give me that watch and chain  sartainly not i ses i don’t know wot you mean by a watch and chain if i ’ad it and i gave it to anybody i should give it to sam’s widder not to you  it’s nothing to do with ’er ses joe very quick sam was most pertikler about that  i expect you dreamt it all i ses where would pore sam get a gold watch and chain from and why should ’e go to you about it why didn’t ’e come to me if ’e thinks i ’ave got it let ’im come to me  all right i’ll go to the policestation ses joe  i’ll come with you i ses but ’ere’s a policeman coming along let’s go to ’im  i moved towards ’im but joe hung back and arter using one or two words that would ha’ made any ghost ashamed to know ’im he sheered off i ’ad a word or two with the policeman about the weather and then i went inside and locked the gate  my idea was that sam ’ad told joe about the watch and chain afore he fell overboard joe was a nasty customer and i could see that i should ’ave to be a bit careful some men might ha’ told the police about it—but i never cared much for them they’re like kids in a way always asking questions—most of which you can’t answer  it was a little bit creepy all alone on the wharf that night i don’t deny it twice i thought i ’eard something coming up on tiptoe behind me the second time i was so nervous that i began to sing to keep my spirits up and i went on singing till three of the hands of the susan emily wot was lying alongside came up from the fo’c’sle and offered to fight me i was thankful when daylight came  five nights arterwards i ’ad the shock of my life it was the fust night for some time that there was no craft up a dark night and a nasty moaning sort of a wind i ’ad just lighted the lamp at the corner of the warehouse wot ’ad blown out and was sitting down to rest afore putting the ladder away when i ’appened to look along the jetty and saw a head coming up over the edge of it in the light of the lamp i saw the dead white face of sam bullet’s ghost making faces at me  i just caught my breath sharp like and then turned and ran for the gate like a racehorse i ’ad left the key in the padlock in case of anything happening and i just gave it one turn flung the wicket open and slammed it in the ghost’s face and tumbled out into the road  i ran slap into the arms of a young policeman wot was passing nasty shorttempered chap he was but i don’t think i was more glad to see anybody in my life i hugged ’im till ’e nearly lost ’is breath and then he sat me down on the kerbstone and asked me wot i meant by it  wot with the excitement and the running i couldn’t speak at fust and when i did he said i was trying to deceive ’im  there ain’t no such thing as ghosts he ses you’ve been drinking  it came up out o’ the river and run arter me like the wind i ses  why didn’t it catch you then he ses looking me up and down and all round about talk sense  he went up to the gate and peeped in and arter watching a moment stepped inside and walked down the wharf with me follering it was my dooty besides i didn’t like being left all alone by myself  twice we walked up and down and all over the wharf he flashed his lantern into all the dark corners into empty barrels and boxes and then he turned and flashed it right into my face and shook his ’ead at me  you’ve been having a bit of a lark with me he ses and for two pins i’d take you mind if you say a word about this to anybody i will  he stalked off with his ’ead in the air and left me all alone in charge of a wharf with a ghost on it i stayed outside in the street of course but every now and then i fancied i heard something moving about the other side of the gate and once it was so distinct that i run along to the bear’s head and knocked ’em up and asked them for a little brandy for illness  i didn’t get it of course i didn’t expect to but i ’ad a little conversation with the landlord from ’is bedroomwinder that did me more good than the brandy would ha’ done once or twice i thought he would ’ave fallen out and many a man has ’ad his licence taken away for less than a quarter of wot ’e said to me that night arter he thought he ’ad finished and was going back to bed agin i pointed’ out to ’im that he ’adn’t kissed me good night and if it ’adn’t ha’ been for ’is missis and two grownup daughters and the potman i believe he’d ha’ talked to me till daylight  ow i got through the rest of the night i don’t know it seemed to be twenty nights instead of one but the day came at last and when the hands came on at six o’clock they found the gate open and me on dooty same as usual  i slept like a tired child when i got ’ome and arter a steak and onions for dinner i sat down and lit my pipe and tried to think wot was to be done one thing i was quite certain about i wasn’t going to spend another night on that wharf alone  i went out arter a bit as far as the clarendon arms for a breath of fresh air and i ’ad just finished a pint and was wondering whether i ought to ’ave another when ted dennis came in and my mind was made up he ’ad been in the army all ’is life and so far he ’ad never seen anything that ’ad frightened ’im i’ve seen him myself take on men twice ’is size just for the love of the thing and arter knocking them silly stand ’em a pint out of ’is own pocket when i asked ’im whether he was afraid of ghosts he laughed so ’ard that the landlord came from the other end of the bar to see wot was the matter  i stood ted a pint and arter he ’ad finished it i told ’im just how things was i didn’t say anything about the watch and chain because there was no need to and when we came outside agin i ’ad engaged an assistantwatchman for ninepence a night  all you’ve got to do i ses is to keep me company you needn’t turn up till eight o’clock of a night and you can leave ’arf an hour afore me in the morning  righto ses ted and if i see the ghost i’ll make it wish it ’ad never been born  it was a load off my mind and i went ’ome and ate a tea that made my missis talk about the work’ouse and orstritches in ’uman shape wot would eat a woman out of ’ouse and ’ome if she would let ’em  i got to the wharf just as it was striking six and at a quarter to seven the wicket was pushed open gentle and the ugly ’ead of mr joe peel was shoved inside  hullo i ses wot do you want  i want to save your life he ses in a solemn voice you was within a inch of death last night watchman  oh i ses carelesslike ’ow do you know  the ghost o’ sam bullet told me ses joe arter it ’ad chased you up the wharf screaming for ’elp it came round and told me all about it  it seems fond of you i ses i wonder why  it was in a terrible temper ses joe and its face was awful to look at ’tell the watchman’ it ses ’that if he don’t give you the watch and chain i shall appear to ’im agin and kill ’im’  all right i ses looking behind me to where three of the ’ands of the daisy was sitting on the fo’c’sle smoking i’ve got plenty of company tonight  company won’t save you ses joe for the last time are you going to give me that watch and chain or not here’s your fifteen bob  no i ses even if i ’ad got it i shouldn’t give it to you and it’s no use giving’ it to the ghost because being made of air he ’asn’t got anywhere to put it  very good ses joe giving me a black look i’ve done all i can to save you but if you won’t listen to sense you won’t you’ll see sam bullet agin and you’ll not on’y lose the watch and chain but your life as well  all right i ses and thank you kindly but i’ve got an assistant as it ’appens—a man wot wants to see a ghost  an’ assistant ses joe staring  an old soldier i ses a man wot likes trouble and danger his idea is to shoot the ghost and see wot ’appens  shoot ses joe shoot a pore ’armless ghost does he want to be ’ung ain’t it enough for a pore man to be drownded but wot you must try and shoot ’im arterwards why you ought to be ashamed o’ yourself where’s your ’art  it won’t be shot if it don’t come on my wharf i ses though i don’t mind if it does when i’ve got somebody with me i ain’t afraid of anything living and i don’t mind ghosts when there’s two of us besides which the noise of the pistol ’ll wake up ’arf the river  you take care you don’t get woke up ses joe ’ardly able to speak for temper  he went off stamping and grinding ’is teeth and at eight o’clock to the minute ted dennis turned up with ’is pistol and helped me take care of the wharf happy as a skylark ’e was and to see him ’iding behind a barrel with his pistol ready waiting for the ghost a’most made me forget the expense of it all  it never came near us that night and ted was a bit disappointed next morning as he took ’is ninepence and went off next night was the same and the next and then ted gave up hiding on the wharf for it and sat and snoozed in the office instead  a week went by and then another and still there was no sign of sam bullet’s ghost or joe peel and every morning i ’ad to try and work up a smile as i shelled out ninepence for ted it nearly ruined me and worse than that i couldn’t explain why i was short to the missis fust of all she asked me wot i was spending it on then she asked me who i was spending it on it nearly broke up my ’ome—she did smash one kitchen chair and a vase off the parlour mantelpiece—but i wouldn’t tell ’er and then led away by some men on strike at smith’s wharf ted went on strike for a bob a night  that was arter he ’ad been with me for three weeks and when saturday came of course i was more short than ever and people came and stood at their doors all the way down our street to listen to the missis taking my character away  i stood it as long as i could and then when ’er back was turned for ’arf a moment i slipped out while she’d been talking i’d been thinking and it came to me clear as daylight that there was no need for me to sacrifice myself any longer looking arter a dead man’s watch and chain  i didn’t know exactly where joe peel lived but i knew the part and arter peeping into seven public’ouses i see the man i wanted sitting by ’imself in a little bar i walked in quietlike and sat down opposite ’im  morning i ses  joe peel grunted  ’ave one with me i ses  he grunted agin but not quite so fierce and i fetched the two pints from the counter and took a seat alongside of ’im  i’ve been looking for you i ses  oh he ses looking me up and down and all over well you’ve found me now  i want to talk to you about the ghost of pore sam bullet i ses  joe peel put ’is mug down sudden and looked at me fierce look ’ere don’t you come and try to be funny with me he ses ’cos i won’t ’ave it  i don’t want to be funny i ses wot i want to know is are you in the same mind about that watch and chain as you was the other day  he didn’t seem to be able to speak at fust but arter a time ’e gives a gasp woes the game he ses  wot i want to know is if i give you that watch and chain for fifteen bob will that keep the ghost from ’anging round my wharf agin i ses  why o’ course he ses staring but you ain’t been seeing it agin ’ave you  i’ve not and i don’t want to i ses if it wants you to ’ave the watch and chain give me the fifteen bob and it’s yours  he looked at me for a moment as if he couldn’t believe ’is eyesight and then ’e puts his ’and into ’is trowsispocket and pulls out one shilling and fourpence ’arf a claypipe and a bit o’ leadpencil  that’s all i’ve got with me he ses i’ll owe you the rest you ought to ha’ took the fifteen bob when i ’ad it  there was no ’elp for it and arter making ’im swear to give me the rest o’ the money when ’e got it and that i shouldn’t see the ghost agin i ’anded the things over to ’im and came away he came to the door to see me off and if ever a man looked puzzled ’e did pleased at the same time  it was a load off of my mind my conscience told me i’d done right and arter sending a little boy with a note to ted dennis to tell ’im not to come any more i felt ’appier than i ’ad done for a long time when i got to the wharf that evening it seemed like a diff’rent place and i was whistling and smiling over my work quite in my old way when the young policeman passed  hullo he ses ’ave you seen the ghost agin  i ’ave not i ses drawing myself up ’ave you  no he ses  we missed it  missed it i ses staring at ’im  yes he ses nodding the day arter you came out screaming and cuddling me like a frightened baby it shipped as ab on the barque ocean king for valparaiso we missed it by a few hours next time you see a ghost knock it down fust and go and cuddle the police arterwards     bedridden     july 12 1915—disquieting rumours to the effect that

and hung over him almost tenderly as they walked along mr billing with a look of conscious virtue on his jolly face listened with much satisfaction to his friend’s compliments  it’s such an example said the latter now we’ve got you the others will follow like sheep you will be a bright lamp in the darkness  wot’s good enough for me ought to be good enough for them said mr billing modestly they’d better not let me catch—  h’sh h’sh breathed mr purnip tilting his hat and wiping his bald benevolent head  i forgot said the other with something like a sigh no more fighting but suppose somebody hits me  turn the other cheek replied mr purnip  they won’t hit that and when they see you standing there smiling at them—  after being hit interrupted mr billing  after being hit assented the other they’ll be ashamed of themselves and it’ll hurt them more than if you struck them  let’s ’ope so said the convert but it don’t sound reasonable i can hit a man pretty ’ard not that i’m badtempered mind you a bit quick p’r’aps and after all a good smack in the jaw saves any amount of argufying  mr purnip smiled and as they walked along painted a glowing picture of the influence to be wielded by a firstclass fightingman who refused to fight it was a rough neighbourhood and he recognized with sorrow that more respect was paid to a heavy fist than to a noble intellect or a loving heart  and you combine them all he said patting his companion’s arm  mr billing smiled you ought to know best he said modestly  you’ll be surprised to find how easy it is continued mr purnip you will go from strength to strength old habits will disappear and you will hardly know you have lost them in a few months’ time you will probably be wondering what you could ever have seen in beer for example  i thought you said you didn’t want me to give up beer said the other  we don’t said mr purnip i mean that as you grow in stature you will simply lose the taste for it  mr billing came to a sudden full stop d’ye mean i shall lose my liking for a drop o’ beer without being able to help myself he demanded in an anxious voice  of course it doesn’t happen in every case he said hastily  mr billing’s features relaxed well let’s ’ope i shall be one of the fortunate ones he said simply i can put up with a good deal but when it comes to beer——  we shall see said the other smiling  we don’t want to interfere with anybody’s comfort we want to make them happier that’s all a little more kindness between man and man a little more consideration for each other a little more brightness in dull lives  he paused at the corner of the street and with a hearty handshake went off mr billing a prey to somewhat mixed emotions continued on his way home the little knot of earnest men and women who had settled in the district to spread light and culture had been angling for him for some time he wondered as he walked what particular bait it was that had done the mischief  they’ve got me at last he remarked as he opened the housedoor and walked into his small kitchen i couldn’t say ’no’ to mr purnip  wish ’em joy said mrs billing briefly did you wipe your boots  her husband turned without a word and retreating to the mat executed a prolonged doubleshuffle  you needn’t wear it out said the surprised mrs billing  we’ve got to make people ’appier said her husband seriously be kinder to ’em and brighten up their dull lives a bit that’s wot mr purnip says  you’ll brighten ’em up all right declared mrs billing with a sniff i sha’n’t forget last tuesday week—no not if i live to be a hundred you’d ha’ brightened up the policestation if i ’adn’t got you home just in the nick of time  her husband who was by this time busy under the scullerytap made no reply he came from it spluttering and seizing a small towel stood in the doorway burnishing his face and regarding his wife with a smile which mr purnip himself could not have surpassed he sat down to supper and between bites explained in some detail the lines on which his future life was to be run as an earnest of good faith he consented after a short struggle to a slip of oilcloth for the passage a pair of vases for the front room and a new and somewhat expensive corncure for mrs billing  and let’s ’ope you go on as you’ve begun said that gratified lady there’s something in old purnip after all i’ve been worrying you for months for that oilcloth are you going to help me wash up mr purnip would  mr billing appeared not to hear and taking up his cap strolled slowly in the direction of the blue lion it was a beautiful summer evening and his bosom swelled as he thought of the improvements that a little brotherliness might effect in elk street engrossed in such ideas it almost hurt him to find that as he entered one door of the blue lion two gentlemen forgetting all about their beer disappeared through the other  wot ’ave they run away like that for he demanded looking round i wouldn’t hurt ’em  depends on wot you call hurting joe said a friend  mr billing shook his head they’ve no call to be afraid of me he said gravely i wouldn’t hurt a fly i’ve got a new ’art  a new wot inquired his friend staring  a new ’art repeated the other i’ve given up fighting and swearing and drinking too much i’m going to lead a new life and do all the good i can i’m going—  glory glory ejaculated a long thin youth and making a dash for the door disappeared  he’ll know me better in time said mr billing why i wouldn’t hurt a fly i want to do good to people not to hurt ’em i’ll have a pint he added turning to the bar  not here you won’t said the landlord eyeing him coldly  why not demanded the astonished mr billing  you’ve had all you ought to have already was the reply and there’s one thing i’ll swear to—you ain’t had it ’ere  i haven’t ’ad a drop pass my lips began the outraged mr billing  yes i know said the other wearily as he shifted one or two glasses and wiped the counter i’ve heard it all before over and over again mind you i’ve been in this business thirty years and if i don’t know when a man’s had his whack and a drop more nobody does you get off ’ome and ask your missis to make you a nice cup o’ good strong tea and then get up to bed and sleep it off  i dare say said mr billing with cold dignity as he paused at the door—i dare say i may give up beer altogether  he stood outside pondering over the unforeseen difficulties attendant upon his new career moving a few inches to one side as mr ricketts a foe of long standing came towards the publichouse and halting a yard or two away eyed him warily  come along said mr billing speaking somewhat loudly for the benefit of the men in the bar i sha’n’t hurt you my fighting days are over  yes i dessay replied the other edging away  it’s all right bill said a mutual friend through the halfopen door he’s got a new ’art  mr ricketts looked perplexed ’art disease d’ye mean he inquired hopefully can’t he fight no more  a new ’art said mr billing it’s as strong as ever it was but it’s changed—brother  if you call me ’brother’ agin i’ll give you something for yourself and chance it said mr ricketts ferociously i’m a pore man but i’ve got my pride  mr billing with a smile charged with brotherly love leaned his left cheek towards him hit it he said gently  give it a smack and run bill said the voice of a wellwisher inside  there’d be no need for ’im to run said mr billing i wouldn’t hit ’im back for anything i should turn the other cheek  whaffor inquired the amazed mr ricketts  for another swipe said mr billing radiantly  in the fraction of a second he got the first and reeled back staggering the onlookers from the bar came out hastily mr ricketts somewhat pale stood his ground  you see i don’t hit you said mr billing with a ghastly attempt at a smile  he stood rubbing his cheek gently and remembering mr purnip’s statements slowly inch by inch turned the other in the direction of his adversary the circuit was still incomplete when mr ricketts balancing himself carefully fetched it a smash that nearly burst it mr billing somewhat jarred by his contact with the pavement rose painfully and confronted him  i’ve only got two cheeks mind he said slowly  mr ricketts sighed i wish you’d got a blinking dozen he said wistfully well so long be good  he walked into the blue lion absolutely free from that sense of shame which mr purnip had predicted and accepting a pint from an admirer boasted noisily of his exploit mr billing suffering both mentally and physically walked slowly home to his astonished wife  p’r’aps he’ll be ashamed of hisself when ’e comes to think it over he murmured as mrs billing rendered almost perfect by practice administered first aid  i s’pect he’s crying his eyes out she said with a sniff tell me if that ’urts  mr billing told her then suddenly remembering himself issued an expurgated edition  i’m sorry for the next man that ’its you said his wife as she drew back and regarded her handiwork  ’well you needn’t be said mr billing with dignity it would take more than a couple o’ props in the jaw to make me alter my mind when i’ve made it up you ought to know that by this time hurry up and finish i want you to go to the corner and fetch me a pot  what ain’t you going out agin demanded his astonished wife  mr billing shook his head somebody else might want to give me one he said resignedly and i’ve ’ad about all i want tonight  his face was still painful next morning but as he sat at breakfast in the small kitchen he was able to refer to mr ricketts in terms which were an eloquent testimony to mr purnip’s teaching mrs billing unable to contain herself wandered off into the front room with a duster  are you nearly ready to go she inquired returning after a short interval  five minutes said mr billing nodding i’ll just light my pipe and then i’m off  ’cos there’s two or three waiting outside for you added his wife  mr billing rose ho is there he said grimly as he removed his coat and proceeded to roll up his shirtsleeves i’ll learn ’em i’ll give ’em something to wait for i’ll——  his voice died away as he saw the triumph in his wife’s face and drawing down his sleeves again he took up his coat and stood eyeing her in genuine perplexity  tell ’em i’ve gorn he said at last  and what about telling lies demanded his wife what would your mr purnip say to that  you do as you’re told exclaimed the harassed mr billing i’m not going to tell ’em it’s you  mrs billing returned to the parlour and with mr billing lurking in the background busied herself over a china flowerpot that stood in the window and turned an anxious eye upon three men waiting outside after a glance or two she went to the door  did you want to see my husband she inquired  the biggest of the three nodded yus he said shortly  i’m sorry said mrs billing but he ’ad to go early this morning was it anything partikler  gorn said the other in disappointed tones well you tell ’im i’ll see ’im later on  he turned away and followed by the other two walked slowly up the road mr billing after waiting till the coast was clear went off in the other direction  he sought counsel of his friend and mentor that afternoon and stood beaming with pride at the praise lavished upon him mr purnip’s coworkers were no less enthusiastic than their chief and various suggestions were made to mr billing as to his behaviour in the unlikely event of further attacks upon his noble person  he tried to remember the suggestions in the harassing days that followed baiting joe billing becoming popular as a pastime from which no evil results need be feared it was creditable to his fellowcitizens that most of them refrained from violence with a man who declined to hit back but as a butt his success was assured the night when a gawky lad of eighteen drank up his beer and then invited him to step outside if he didn’t like it dwelt long in his memory and elk street thrilled one evening at the sight of their erstwhile champion flying up the road hotly pursued by a foeman half his size his explanation to his indignant wife that having turned the other cheek the night before he was in no mood for further punishment was received in chilling silence  they’ll soon get tired of it he said hopefully and i ain’t going to be beat by a lot of chaps wot i could lick with one ’and tied behind me they’ll get to understand in time mr purnip says so it’s a pity that you don’t try and do some good yourself  mrs billing received the suggestion with a sniff but the seed was sown she thought the matter over in private and came to the conclusion that if her husband wished her to participate in good works it was not for her to deny him hitherto her efforts in that direction had been promptly suppressed mr billing’s idea being that if a woman looked after her home and her husband properly there should be neither time nor desire for anything else his surprise on arriving home to tea on saturday afternoon and finding a couple of hardworking neighbours devouring his substance almost deprived him of speech  poor things said his wife after the guests had gone they did enjoy it it’s cheered ’em up wonderful you and mr purnip are quite right i can see that now you can tell him that it was you what put it into my ’art  me why i never dreamt o’ such a thing declared the surprised mr billing and there’s other ways of doing good besides asking a pack of old women in to tea  i know there is said his wife all in good time she added with a faraway look in her eyes  mr billing cleared his throat but nothing came of it he cleared it again  i couldn’t let you do all the good said his wife hastily it wouldn’t be fair i must help  mr billing lit his pipe noisily and then took it out into the backyard and sat down to think over the situation the ungenerous idea that his wife was making goodness serve her own ends was the first that occurred to him  his suspicions increased with time mrs billing’s good works seemed to be almost entirely connected with hospitality true she had entertained mr purnip and one of the ladies from the settlement to tea but that only riveted his bonds more firmly other visitors included his sister inlaw for whom he had a great distaste and some of the worstbehaved children in the street  it’s only high spirits said mrs billing all children are like that and i do it to help the mothers  and ’cos you like children said her husband preserving his good humour with an effort  there was a touch of monotony about the new life and the good deeds that accompanied it which to a man of ardent temperament was apt to pall and elk street instead of giving him the credit which was his due preferred to ascribe the change in his behaviour to what they called being a bit barmy on the crumpet  he came home one evening somewhat dejected brightening up as he stood in the passage and inhaled the ravishing odours from the kitchen mrs billing with a trace of nervousness somewhat unaccountable in view of the excellent quality of the repast provided poured him out a glass of beer and passed flattering comment upon his appearance  wot’s the game he inquired  game repeated his wife in a trembling voice nothing ’ow do you find that steakpudding i thought of giving you one every wednesday  mr billing put down his knife and fork and sat regarding her thoughtfully then he pushed back his chair suddenly and a picture of consternation and wrath held up his hand for silence  wwwot is it he demanded a cat  mrs billing made no reply and her husband sprang to his feet as a long thin wailing sounded through the house a note of temper crept into it and strengthened it  wot is it demanded mr billing again it’s—it’s mrs smith’s charlie stammered his wife  in—in my bedroom exclaimed her husband in incredulous accents wot’s it doing there  i took it for the night said his wife hurriedly poor thing what with the others being ill she’s ’ad a dreadful time and she said if i’d take charlie for a few—for a night she might be able to get some sleep  mr billing choked and what about my sleep he shouted chuck it outside at once d’ye hear me  his words fell on empty air his wife having already sped upstairs to pacify master smith by a rhythmical and monotonous thumping on the back also she lifted up a thin and not particularly sweet voice and sang to him mr billing finishing his supper in indignant silence told himself grimly that he was beginning to have enough of it  he spent the evening at the charlton arms and returning late went slowly and heavily up to bed in the light of a shaded candle he saw a small objectionablelooking infant fast asleep on two chairs by the side of the bed  h’sh said his wife in a thrilling whisper he’s just gone off  d’ye mean i mustn’t open my mouth in my own bedroom demanded the indignant man loudly  h’sh said his wife again  it was too late master smith opening first one eye and then the other finished by opening his mouth the noise was appalling  h’sh h’sh repeated mrs billing as her husband began to add to the noise don’t wake ’im right up  right up repeated the astonished man right up why is he doing this in ’is sleep  he subsided into silence and undressing with stealthy care crept into bed and lay there marvelling at his selfcontrol he was a sound sleeper but six times at least he was awakened by mrs billing slipping out of bed—regardless of draughts to her liege lord—and marching up and down the room with the visitor in her arms he rose in the morning and dressed in ominous silence  i ’ope he didn’t disturb you said his wife anxiously  you’ve done it replied mr billing you’ve upset everything now since i joined the purnip lot everybody’s took advantage of me now i’m going to get some of my own back you wouldn’t ha’ dreamt of behaving like this a few weeks ago  oh joe said his wife entreatingly and everybody’s been so happy  except me retorted joe billing you come down and get my breakfast ready if i start early i shall catch mr bill ricketts on ’is way to work and mind if i find that steamorgin ’ere when i come ’ome tonight you’ll hear of it  he left the house with head erect and the light of battle in his eyes and meeting mr ricketts at the corner gave that justly aggrieved gentleman the surprise of his life elk street thrilled to the fact that mr billing had broken out again and spoke darkly of what the evening might bring forth curious eyes followed his progress as he returned home from work and a little later on the news was spread abroad that he was out and paying off old scores with an ardour that nothing could withstand  and wot about your change of ’art demanded one indignant matron as her husband reached home five seconds ahead of mr billing and hid in the scullery  it’s changed agin said mr billing simply  he finished the evening in the blue lion where he had one bar almost to himself and avoiding his wife’s reproachful glance when he arrived home procured some warm water and began to bathe his honourable scars  mr purnip ’as been round with another gentleman said his wife  mr billing said oh  very much upset they was and ’ope you’ll go and see them she continued  mr billing said oh again and after thinking the matter over called next day at the settlement and explained his position  it’s all right for gentlemen like you he said civilly but a man like me can’t call his soul ’is own—or even ’is bedroom everybody takes advantage of ’im nobody ever gives you a punch and as for putting babies in your bedroom they wouldn’t dream of it  he left amid expressions of general regret turning a deaf ear to all suggestions about making another start and went off exulting in his freedom  his one trouble was mr purnip that estimable gentleman who seemed to have a weird gift of meeting him at all sorts of times and places never making any allusion to his desertion but showing quite clearly by his manner that he still hoped for the return of the wanderer it was awkward for a man of sensitive disposition and mr billing before entering a street got into the habit of peering round the corner first  he pulled up suddenly one evening as he saw his tenacious friend accompanied by a ladymember some little distance ahead then he sprang forward with fists clenched as a passerby after scowling at mr purnip leaned forward and deliberately blew a mouthful of smoke into the face of his companion  mr billing stopped again and stood gaping with astonishment the aggressor was getting up from the pavement while mr purnip in an absolutely correct attitude stood waiting for him mr billing in a glow of delight edged forward and with a few other fortunates stood by watching one of the best fights that had ever been seen in the district mr purnip’s footwork was excellent and the way he timed his blows made mr billing’s eyes moist with admiration  it was over at last the aggressor went limping off and mr purnip wiping his bald head picked up his battered and dusty hat from the roadway and brushed it on his sleeve he turned with a start and a blush to meet the delighted gaze of mr billing  i’m ashamed of myself he murmured brokenly—ashamed  ashamed exclaimed the amazed mr billing why a pro couldn’t ha’ done better  such an awful example moaned the other all my good work here thrown away  don’t you believe it sir said mr billing earnestly as soon as this gets about you’ll get more members than you want a’most i’m coming back for one  mr purnip turned and grasped his hand  i understand things now said mr billing nodding sagely turning the other cheek’s all right so long as you don’t do it always if you don’t let ’em know whether you are going to turn the other cheek or knock their blessed heads off it’s all right ’arf the trouble in the world is caused by letting people know too much     husbandry     dealing with a man said the nightwatchman thoughtfully is as easy as a teetotaller walking along a nice wide pavement dealing with a woman is like the same teetotaller arter four or five whiskies trying to get up a step that ain’t there if a man can’t get ’is own way he eases ’is mind with a little nasty language and then forgets all about it if a woman can’t get ’er own way she flies into a temper and reminds you of something you oughtn’t to ha’ done ten years ago wot a woman would do whose ’usband had never done anything wrong i can’t think  i remember a young feller telling me about a row he ’ad with ’is wife once he ’adn’t been married long and he talked as if the way she carried on was unusual fust of all he said she spoke to ’im in a cooing sort o’ voice and pulled his moustache then when he wouldn’t give way she worked herself up into a temper and said things about ’is sister arter which she went out o’ the room and banged the door so hard it blew down a vase off the fireplace four times she came back to tell ’im other things she ’ad thought of and then she got so upset she ’ad to go up to bed and lay down instead of getting his tea when that didn’t do no good she refused her food and when ’e took her up toast and tea she wouldn’t look at it said she wanted to die he got quite uneasy till ’e came ’ome the next night and found the best part of a loaf o’ bread a quarter o’ butter and a couple o’ chops he ’ad got in for ’is supper had gorn and then when he said ’e was glad she ’ad got ’er appetite back she turned round and said that he grudged ’er the food she ate  and no woman ever owned up as ’ow she was wrong and the more you try and prove it to ’em the louder they talk about something else i know wot i’m talking about because a woman made a mistake about me once and though she was proved to be in the wrong and it was years ago my missus shakes her ’ead about it to this day  it was about eight years arter i ’ad left off going to sea and took up nightwatching a beautiful summer evening it was and i was sitting by the gate smoking a pipe till it should be time to light up when i noticed a woman who ’ad just passed turn back and stand staring at me i’ve ’ad that sort o’ thing before and i went on smoking and looking straight in front of me fat middleaged woman she was wot ’ad lost her good looks and found others she stood there staring and staring and by and by she tries a little cough  i got up very slow then and arter looking all round at the evening without seeing ’er i was just going to step inside and shut the wicket when she came closer  bill she ses in a choking sort o’ voice  bill  i gave her a look that made her catch ’er breath and i was just stepping through the wicket when she laid hold of my coat and tried to hold me back  do you know wot you’re adoing of i ses turning on her  oh bill dear she ses don’t talk to me like that do you want to break my ’art arter all these years  she pulled out a dirtcoloured pocket’ankercher and stood there dabbing her eyes with it one eye at a time she dabbed while she looked at me reproachful with the other and arter eight dabs four to each eye she began to sob as if her ’art would break  go away i ses very slow you can’t stand making that noise outside my wharf go away and give somebody else a treat  afore she could say anything the potman from the tiger a nasty ginger ’aired little chap that nobody liked come by and stopped to pat her on the back  there there don’t take on mother he ses wot’s he been adoing to you  you get off ’ome i ses losing my temper  wot d’ye mean trying to drag me into it i’ve never seen the woman afore in my life  oh bill ses the woman sobbing louder than ever oh oh oh  ’ow does she know your name then ses the little beast of a potman  i didn’t answer him i might have told ’im that there’s about five million bills in england but i didn’t i stood there with my arms folded acrost my chest and looked at him superior  where ’ave you been all this long long time she ses between her sobs why did you leave your happy ’ome and your children wot loved you  the potman let off a whistle that you could have ’eard acrost the river and as for me i thought i should ha’ dropped to have a woman standing sobbing and taking my character away like that was a’most more than i could bear  did he run away from you ses the potman  yeyeyes she ses he went off on a vy’ge to china over nine years ago and that’s the last i saw of ’im till tonight a lady friend o’ mine thought she reckernized ’im yesterday and told me  i shouldn’t cry over ’im ses the potman shaking his ’ead he ain’t worth it if i was you i should just give ’im a bang or two over the ’ead with my umberella and then give ’im in charge  i stepped inside the wicket—backwards—and then i slammed it in their faces and putting the key in my pocket walked up the wharf i knew it was no good standing out there argufying i felt sorry for the pore thing in a way if she really thought i was her ’usband and she ’ad lost me—— i put one or two things straight and then for the sake of distracting my mind i ’ad a word or two with the skipper of the john henry who was leaning against the side of his ship smoking  wot’s that tapping noise he ses all of a sudden ’ark  i knew wot it was it was the handle of that umberella ’ammering on the gate i went cold all over and then when i thought that the potman was most likely encouraging ’er to do it i began to boil  somebody at the gate ses the skipper  aye aye i ses i know all about it  i went on talking until at last the skipper asked me whether he was wandering in ’is mind or whether i was the mate came up from the cabin just then and o’ course he ’ad to tell me there was somebody knocking at the gate  ain’t you going to open it ses the skipper staring at me  let ’em ring i ses offhand  the words was ’ardly out of my mouth afore they did ring and if they ’ad been selling muffins they couldn’t ha’ kept it up harder and all the time the umberella was doing ratatat tats on the gate while a voice— much too loud for the potman’s—started calling out watchman ahoy  they’re calling you bill ses the skipper i ain’t deaf i ses very cold  well i wish i was ses the skipper it’s fair making my ear ache why the blazes don’t you do your dooty and open the gate  you mind your bisness and i’ll mind mine i ses i know wot i’m doing it’s just some silly fools ’aving a game with me and i’m not going to encourage ’em  game with you ses the skipper ain’t they got anything better than that to play with look ’ere if you don’t open that gate i will  it’s nothing to do with you i ses you look arter your ship and i’ll look arter my wharf see if you don’t like the noise go down in the cabin and stick your ’ead in a biscuitbag  to my surprise he took the mate by the arm and went and i was just thinking wot a good thing it was to be a bit firm with people sometimes when they came back dressed up in their coats and bowlerhats and climbed on to the wharf  watchman ses the skipper in a hoitytoity sort o’ voice me and the mate is going as far as aldgate for a breath o’ fresh air open the gate  i gave him a look that might ha’ melted a ’art of stone and all it done to ’im was to make ’im laugh  hurry up he ses it a’most seems to me that there’s somebody ringing the bell and you can let them in same time as you let us out is it the bell or is it my fancy joe he ses turning to the mate  they marched on in front of me with their noses cocked in the air and all the time the noise at the gate got worse and worse so far as i could make out there was quite a crowd outside and i stood there with the key in the lock trembling all over then i unlocked it very careful and put my hand on the skipper’s arm  nip out quick i ses in a whisper  i’m in no hurry ses the skipper here halloa wot’s up  it was like opening the door at a theatre and the fust one through was that woman shoved behind by the potman arter ’im came a carman two big ’ulking brewers’ draymen a little scrap of a woman with ’er bonnet cocked over one eye and a couple of dirty little boys  wot is it ses the skipper shutting the wicket behind ’em a beanfeast  this lady wants her ’usband ses the potman pointing at me he run away from her nine years ago and now he says he ’as never seen ’er before he ought to be ’ung  bill ses the skipper shaking his silly ’ead at me i can ’ardly believe it  it’s all a pack o’ silly lies i ses firing up she’s made a mistake  she made a mistake when she married you ses the thin little woman if i was in ’er shoes i’d take ’old of you and tear you limb from limb  i don’t want to hurt ’im ma’am ses the other woman i on’y want him to come ’ome to me and my five why he’s never seen the youngest little annie she’s as like ’im as two peas  pore little devil ses the carman  look here i ses you clear off all of you ’ow dare you come on to my wharf if you aren’t gone in two minutes i’ll give you all in charge  who to ses one of the draymen sticking his face into mine you go ’ome to your wife and kids go on now afore i put up my ’ands to you  that’s the way to talk to ’im ses the potman nodding at ’em  they all began to talk to me then and tell me wot i was to do and wot they would do if i didn’t i couldn’t get a word in edgeways when i reminded the mate that when he was up in london ’e always passed himself off as a single man ’e wouldn’t listen and when i asked the skipper whether ’is pore missus was blind he on’y went on shouting at the top of ’is voice it on’y showed me ’ow anxious most people are that everybody else should be good  i thought they was never going to stop and if it ’adn’t been for a fit of coughing i don’t believe that the scraggy little woman could ha’ stopped arter one o’ the draymen ’ad saved her life and spoilt ’er temper by patting ’er on the back with a hand the size of a leg o’ mutton the carman turned to me and told me to tell the truth if it choked me  i have told you the truth i ses she ses i’m her ’usband and i say i ain’t ow’s she going to prove it why should you believe her and not me  she’s got a truthful face ses the carman  look here ses the skipper speaking very slow i’ve got an idea wot’ll settle it p’raps you get outside he ses turning sharp on the two little boys  one o’ the draymen ’elped ’em to go out and ’arf a minute arterwards a stone came over the gate and cut the potman’s lip open boys will be boys  now ses the skipper turning to the woman and smiling with conceitedness had your ’usband got any marks on ’im birthmark or moles or anything of that sort  i’m sure he is my ’usband ses the woman dabbing her eyes  yes yes ses the skipper but answer my question if you can tell us any marks your ’usband had we can take bill down into my cabin and——  you’ll do wot i ses in a loud voice  you speak when you’re spoke to ses the carman it’s got nothing to do with you  no he ain’t got no birthmarks ses the woman speaking very slow—and i could see she was afraid of making a mistake and losing me—but he’s got tattoo marks he’s got a mermaid tattooed on ’im  where ses the skipper a’most jumping  i ’eld my breath five sailormen out of ten have been tattooed with mermaids and i was one of ’em when she spoke agin i thought i should ha’ dropped  on ’is right arm she ses unless he’s ’ad it rubbed off  you can’t rub out tattoo marks ses the skipper  they all stood looking at me as if they was waiting for something i folded my arms—tight—and stared back at ’em  if you ain’t this lady’s ’usband ses the skipper turning to me you can take off your coat and prove it  and if you don’t we’ll take it off for you ses the carman coming a bit closer  arter that things ’appened so quick i hardly knew whether i was standing on my ’cad or my heels both i think they was all on top o’ me at once and the next thing i can remember is sitting on the ground in my shirtsleeves listening to the potman who was making a fearful fuss because somebody ’ad bit his ear ’arf off my coat was ripped up the back and one of the draymen was holding up my arm and showing them all the mermaid while the other struck matches so as they could see better  that’s your ’usband right enough he ses to the woman take ’im  p’raps she’ll carry ’im ’ome i ses very fierce and sarcastic  and we don’t want none of your lip ses the carman who was in a bad temper because he ’ad got a fearful kick on the shin from somewhere  i got up very slow and began to put my coat on again and twice i ’ad to tell that silly woman that when i wanted her ’elp i’d let ’er know then i ’eard slow heavy footsteps in the road outside and afore any of ’em could stop me i was calling for the police  i don’t like policemen as a rule they’re too inquisitive but when the wicket was pushed open and i saw a face with a helmet on it peeping in i felt quite a liking for ’em  wot’s up ses the policeman staring ’ard at my little party  they all started telling ’im at once and i should think if the potman showed him ’is ear once he showed it to ’im twenty times he lost his temper and pushed it away at last and the potman gave a ’owl that set my teeth on edge i waited till they was all finished and the policeman trying to get ’is hearing back and then i spoke up in a quiet way and told ’im to clear them all off of my wharf  they’re trespassing i ses all except the skipper and mate here they belong to a little washtub that’s laying alongside and they’re both as ’armless as they look  it’s wonderful wot a uniform will do the policeman just jerked his ’ead and said outside and the men went out like a flock of sheep the on’y man that said a word was the carman who was in such a hurry that ’e knocked his bad shin against my foot as ’e went by the thin little woman was passed out by the policeman in the middle of a speech she was making and he was just going for the other when the skipper stopped ’im  this lady is coming on my ship he ses puffing out ’is chest  i looked at ’im and then i turned to the policeman so long as she goes off my wharf i don’t mind where she goes i ses the skipper’s goingson ’ave got nothing to do with me  then she can foller him ’ome in the morning ses the skipper good night watchman  him and the mate ’elped the silly old thing to the ship and arter i ’ad been round to the bear’s head and fetched a pint for the policeman i locked up and sat down to think things out and the more i thought the worse they seemed i’ve ’eard people say that if you have a clear conscience nothing can hurt you they didn’t know my missus  i got up at last and walked on to the jetty and the woman wot was sitting on the deck of the john henry kept calling out bill like a sick baalamb crying for its ma i went back and ’ad four pints at the bear’s head but it didn’t seem to do me any good and at last i went and sat down in the office to wait for morning  it came at last a lovely morning with a beautiful sunrise and that woman sitting up wide awake waiting to foller me ’ome when i opened the gate at six o’clock she was there with the mate and the skipper waiting and when i left at five minutes past she was trotting along beside me  twice i stopped and spoke to ’er but it was no good other people stopped too and i ’ad to move on agin and every step was bringing me nearer to my house and the missus  i turned into our street arter passing it three times and the first thing i saw was my missus standing on the doorstep ’aving a few words with the lady next door then she ’appened to look up and see us just as that silly woman was trying to walk arminarm  twice i knocked her ’and away and then right afore my wife and the party next door she put her arm round my waist by the time i got to the ’ouse my legs was trembling so i could hardly stand and when i got into the passage i ’ad to lean up against the wall for a bit  keep ’er out i ses  wot do you want ses my missus trembling with passion wot do you think you’re doing  i want my ’usband bill ses the woman  my missus put her ’and to her throat and came in without a word and the woman follered ’er if i hadn’t kept my presence o’ mind and shut the door two or three more would ’ave come in too  i went into the kitchen about ten minutes arterwards to see ’ow they was getting on besides which they was both calling for me  now then ses my missus who was leaning up against the dresser with ’er arms folded wot ’ave you got to say for yourself walking in as bold as brass with this hussy  bill ses the woman did you hear wot she called me  she spoke to me like that afore my wife and in two minutes they was at it hammer and tongs  fust of all they spoke about each other and then my missus started speaking about me she’s got a better memory than most people because she can remember things that never ’appened and every time i coughed she turned on me like a tiger  and as for you she ses turning to the woman if you did marry ’im you should ha’ made sure that he ’adn’t got a wife already  he married me fust ses the woman  when ses my wife wot was the date  wot was the date you married ’im ses the other one  they stood looking at each other like a couple o’ gamecocks and i could see as plain as a pikestaff ’ow frightened both of ’em was o’ losing me  look here i ses at last to my missus talk sense ’ow could i be married to ’er when i was at sea i was at sea and when i was ashore i was with you  did you use to go down to the ship to see ’im off ses the woman  no ses my wife i’d something better to do  neither did i ses the woman p’raps that’s where we both made a mistake  you get out of my ’ouse ses my missus very sudden go on afore i put you out  not without my bill ses the woman if you lay a finger on me i’ll scream the house down  you brought her ’ere ses my wife turning to me now you can take ’er away  i didn’t bring ’er i ses she follered me  well she can foller you agin she ses go on she ses trembling all over git out afore i start on you  i was in such a temper that i daren’t trust myself to stop i just gave ’er one look and then i drew myself up and went out ’alf the fools in our street was standing in front of the ’ouse ’umming like bees but i took no notice i held my ’ead up and walked through them with that woman trailing arter me  i was in such a state of mind that i went on like a man in a dream if it had ha’ been a dream i should ha’ pushed ’er under an omnibus but you can’t do things like that in real life  penny for your thoughts bill she ses i didn’t answer her  why don’t you speak to me she ses  you don’t know wot you’re asking for i ses  i was hungry and sleepy and ’ow i was going to get through the day i couldn’t think i went into a pub and ’ad a couple o’ pints o’ stout and a crust o’ bread and cheese for brekfuss i don’t know wot she ’ad but when the barman tried to take for it out o’ my money i surprised ’im  we walked about till i was ready to drop then we got to victoria park and i ’ad no sooner got on to the grass than i laid down and went straight off to sleep it was two o’clock when i woke and arter a couple o’ porkpies and a pint or two i sat on a seat in the park smoking while she kep’ dabbing ’er eyes agin and asking me to come ’ome  at five o’clock i got up to go back to the wharf and taking no notice of ’er i walked into the street and jumped on a ’bus that was passing she jumped too and arter the conductor had ’elped ’er up off of ’er knees and taken her arms away from his waist i’m blest if he didn’t turn on me and ask me why i ’adn’t left her at ’ome  we got to the wharf just afore six the john henry ’ad gorn but the skipper ’ad done all the ’arm he could afore he sailed and if i ’adn’t kept my temper i should ha’ murdered arf a dozen of ’em  the woman wanted to come on to the wharf but i ’ad a word or two with one o’ the foremen who owed me arfadollar and he made that all right  we all ’ave our faults bill he ses as ’e went out and i suppose she was better looking once upon a time  i didn’t answer ’im i shut the wicket arter ’im quick and turned the key and then i went on with my work for a long time everything was as quiet as the grave and then there came just one little pull at the bell five minutes arterwards there was another  i thought it was that woman but i ’ad to make sure when it came the third time i crept up to the gate  halloa i ses who is it  me darling ses a voice i reckernized as the potman’s your missus wants to come in and sit down  i could ’ear several people talking and it seemed to me there was quite a crowd out there and by and by that bell was going like mad then people started kicking the gate and shouting but i took no notice until presently it left off all of a sudden and i ’eard a loud voice asking what it was all about i suppose there was about fifty of ’em all telling it at once and then there was the sound of a fist on the gate  who is it i ses  police ses the voice  i opened the wicket then and looked out a couple o’ policemen was standing by the gate and arf the riffraff of wapping behind ’em  wot’s all this about ses one o’ the policemen  i shook my ’ead ask me another i ses your missus is causing a disturbance he ses  she’s not my missus i ses she’s a complete stranger to me  and causing a crowd to collect and refusing to go away ses the other policeman  that’s your business i ses it’s nothing to do with me  they talked to each other for a moment and then they spoke to the woman i didn’t ’ear wot she said but i saw her shake her ’ead and a’most direckly arterwards she was marching away between the two policemen with the crowd follering and advising ’er where to kick ’em  i was a bit worried at fust—not about her—and then i began to think that p’raps it was the best thing that could have ’appened  i went ’ome in the morning with a load lifted off my mind but i ’adn’t been in the ’ouse two seconds afore my missus started to put it on agin fust of all she asked me ’ow i dared to come into the ’ouse and then she wanted to know wot i meant by leaving her at ’ome and going out for the day with another woman  you told me to i ses  oh yes she ses trembling with temper you always do wot i tell you don’t you always ’ave especially when it’s anything you like  she fetched a bucket o’ water and scrubbed the kitchen while i was having my brekfuss but i kept my eye on ’er and the moment she ’ad finished i did the perlite and emptied the bucket for ’er to prevent mistakes  i read about the case in the sunday paper and i’m thankful to say my name wasn’t in it all the magistrate done was to make ’er promise that she wouldn’t do it again and then he let ’er go i should ha’ felt more comfortable if he ’ad given ’er five years but as it turned out it didn’t matter her ’usband happened to read it and whether ’e was tired of living alone or whether he was excited by ’caring that she ’ad got a little general shop ’e went back to her  the fust i knew about it was they came round to the wharf to see me he ’ad been a finelooking chap in ’is day and even then ’e was enough like me for me to see ’ow she ’ad made the mistake and all the time she was telling me ’ow it ’appened he was looking me up and down and sniffing  ’ave you got a cold i ses at last  wot’s that got to do with you he ses wot do you mean by walking out with my wife that’s what i’ve come to talk about  for a moment i thought that his bad luck ’ad turned ’is brain you’ve got it wrong i ses as soon as i could speak she walked out with me  cos she thought you was her ’usband he ses but you didn’t think you was me did you  ’course i didn’t i ses  then ’ow dare you walk out with ’er he ses  look ’ere i ses you get off ’ome as quick as you like i’ve ’ad about enough of your family go on hook it  afore i could put my ’ands up he ’it me hard in the mouth and the next moment we was at it as ’ard as we could go nearly every time i hit ’im he wasn’t there and every time ’e hit me i wished i hadn’t ha’ been when i said i had ’ad enough ’e contradicted me and kept on but he got tired of it at last and arter telling me wot he would do if i ever walked ’is wife out agin they went off like a couple o’ lovebirds  by the time i got ’ome next morning my eyes was so swelled up i could ’ardly see and my nose wouldn’t let me touch it i was so done up i could ’ardly speak but i managed to tell my missus about it arter i had ’ad a cup o’ tea judging by her face anybody might ha’ thought i was telling ’er something funny and when i ’ad finished she looks up at the ceiling and ses  i ’ope it’ll be a lesson to you she ses     family cares     mr jernshaw who was taking the opportunity of a lull in business to weigh out pound packets of sugar knocked his hands together and stood waiting for the order of the tall bronzed man who had just entered the shop—a wellbuilt man of about forty—who was regarding him with blue eyes set in quizzical wrinkles  what harry exclaimed mr jernshaw in response to the wrinkles harry barrett  that’s me said the other extending his hand the rolling stone come home covered with moss  mr jernshaw somewhat excited shook hands and led the way into the little parlour behind the shop  fifteen years said mr barrett sinking into a chair and the old place hasn’t altered a bit  smithson told me he had let that house in webb street to a barrett said the grocer regarding him but i never thought of you i suppose you’ve done well then  mr barrett nodded can’t grumble he said modestly i’ve got enough to live on melbourne’s all right but i thought i’d come home for the evening of my life  evening repeated his friend fortythree said mr barrett gravely i’m getting on  you haven’t changed much said the grocer passing his hand through his spare grey whiskers wait till you have a wife and seven youngsters why boots alone——  mr barrett uttered a groan intended for sympathy perhaps you could help me with the furnishing he said slowly i’ve never had a place of my own before and i don’t know much about it  anything i can do said his friend better not get much yet you might marry and my taste mightn’t be hers  mr barrett laughed i’m not marrying he said with conviction  seen anything of miss prentice yet inquired mr jernshaw  no said the other with a slight flush why  she’s still single said the grocer  what of it demanded mr barrett with warmth what of it  nothing said mr jernshaw slowly nothing only i——  well said the other as he paused  i—there was an idea that you went to australia to—to better your condition murmured the grocer that—that you were not in a position to marry—that——  boy and girl nonsense said mr barrett sharply why it’s fifteen years ago i don’t suppose i should know her if i saw her is her mother alive  rather said mr jernshaw with emphasis louisa is something like what her mother was when you went away  mr barrett shivered  but you’ll see for yourself continued the other you’ll have to go and see them they’ll wonder you haven’t been before  let ’em wonder said the embarrassed mr barrett i shall go and see all my old friends in their turn casuallike you might let ’em hear that i’ve been to see you before seeing them and then if they’re thinking any nonsense it’ll be a hint i’m stopping in town while the house is being decorated next time i come down i’ll call and see somebody else  that’ll be another hint assented mr jernshaw not that hints are much good to mrs prentice  we’ll see said mr barrett  in accordance with his plan his return to his native town was heralded by a few short visits at respectable intervals a sort of human butterfly he streaked rapidly across one or two streets alighted for half an hour to resume an old friendship and then disappeared again having given at least halfadozen hints of this kind he made a final return to ramsbury and entered into occupation of his new house  it does you credit jernshaw he said gratefully i should have made a rare mess of it without your help  it looks very nice admitted his friend too nice  that’s all nonsense said the owner irritably  all right said mr jernshaw i don’t know the sex then that’s all if you think that you’re going to keep a nice house like this all to yourself you’re mistaken it’s a home and where there’s a home a woman comes in somehow  mr barrett grunted his disbelief  i give you four days said mr jernshaw  as a matter of fact mrs prentice and her daughter came on the fifth mr barrett who was in an easychair wooing slumber with a handkerchief over his head heard their voices at the front door and the cordial invitation of his housekeeper they entered the room as he sat hastily smoothing his rumpled hair  good afternoon he said shaking hands  mrs prentice returned the greeting in a level voice and accepting a chair gazed around the room  nice weather said mr barrett  very said mrs prentice  it’s—it’s quite a pleasure to see you again said mr barrett  we thought we should have seen you before said mrs prentice but i told louisa that no doubt you were busy and wanted to surprise her i like the carpet don’t you louisa  miss prentice said she did  the room is nice and airy said mrs prentice but it’s a pity you didn’t come to me before deciding i could have told you of a better house for the same money  i’m very well satisfied with this said mr barrett it’s all i want  it’s well enough conceded mrs prentice amiably and how have you been all these years  mr barrett with some haste replied that his health and spirits had been excellent  you look well said mrs prentice neither of you seem to have changed much she added looking from him to her daughter and i think you did quite well not to write i think it was much the best  mr barrett sought for a question a natural artless question that would neutralize the hideous suggestion conveyed by this remark but it eluded him he sat and gazed in growing fear at mrs prentice  i—i couldn’t write he said at last in desperation my wife——  your what exclaimed mrs prentice loudly  wife said mr barrett suddenly calm now that he had taken the plunge she wouldn’t have liked it  mrs prentice tried to control her voice i never heard you were married she gasped why isn’t she here  we couldn’t agree said the veracious mr barrett she was very difficult so i left the children with her and——  chil—— said mrs prentice and paused unable to complete the word  five said mr barrett in tones of resignation it was rather a wrench parting with them especially the baby he got his first tooth the day i left  the information fell on deaf ears mrs prentice for once in her life thoroughly at a loss sat trying to collect her scattered faculties she had come out prepared for a hard job but not an impossible one all things considered she took her defeat with admirable composure  i have no doubt it is much the best thing for the children to remain with their mother she said rising  much the best agreed mr barrett whatever she is like continued the old lady are you ready louisa  mr barrett followed them to the door and then returning to the room watched with glad eyes their progress up the street  wonder whether she’ll keep it to herself he muttered  his doubts were set at rest next day all ramsbury knew by then of his matrimonial complications and seemed anxious to talk about them complications which tended to increase until mr barrett wrote out a list of his children’s names and ages and learnt it off by heart  relieved of the attentions of the prentice family he walked the streets a free man and it was counted to him for righteousness that he never said a hard word about his wife she had her faults he said but they were many thousand miles away and he preferred to forget them and he added with some truth that he owed her a good deal  for a few months he had no reason to alter his opinion thanks to his presence of mind the prentice family had no terrors for him heart whole and fancy free he led the easy life of a man of leisure a condition of things suddenly upset by the arrival of miss grace lindsay to take up a post at the elementary school mr barrett succumbed almost at once and after a few encounters in the street and meetings at mutual friends’ went to unbosom himself to mr jernshaw  what has she got to do with you demanded that gentleman  i—i’m rather struck with her said mr barrett  struck with her repeated his friend sharply i’m surprised at you you’ve no business to think of such things  why not demanded mr barrett in tones that were sharper still  why not repeated the other have you forgotten your wife and children  mr barrett who to do him justice had forgotten fell back in his chair and sat gazing at him openmouthed  you’re in a false position—in a way said mr jernshaw sternly  false is no name for it said mr barrett huskily what am i to do  do repeated the other staring at him nothing unless perhaps you send for your wife and children i suppose in any case you would have to have the little ones if anything happened to her  mr barrett grinned ruefully  think it over said mr jernshaw i will said the other heartily  he walked home deep in thought he was a kindly man and he spent some time thinking out the easiest death for mrs barrett he decided at last upon heartdisease and a fortnight later all ramsbury knew of the letter from australia conveying the mournful intelligence it was generally agreed that the mourning and the general behaviour of the widower left nothing to be desired  she’s at peace at last he said solemnly to jernshaw  i believe you killed her said his friend mr barrett started violently  i mean your leaving broke her heart explained the other  mr barrett breathed easily again  it’s your duty to look after the children said jernshaw firmly and i’m not the only one that thinks so  they are with their grandfather and grandmother said mr barrett  mr jernshaw sniffed  and four uncles and five aunts added mr barrett triumphantly  think how they would brighten up your house said mr jernshaw  his friend shook his head it wouldn’t be fair to their grandmother he said decidedly besides australia wants population  he found to his annoyance that mr jernshaw’s statement that he was not alone in his views was correct public opinion seemed to expect the arrival of the children and one citizen even went so far as to recommend a girl he knew as nurse  ramsbury understood at last that his decision was final and observing his attentions to the new schoolmistress flattered itself that it had discovered the reason it is possible that miss lindsay shared their views but if so she made no sign and on the many occasions on which she met mr barrett on her way to and from school greeted him with frank cordiality even when he referred to his loneliness which he did frequently she made no comment  he went into halfmourning at the end of two months and a month later bore no outward signs of his loss added to that his step was springy and his manner youthful miss lindsay was twentyeight and he persuaded himself that sexes considered there was no disparity worth mentioning  he was only restrained from proposing by a question of etiquette even a shilling book on the science failed to state the interval that should elapse between the death of one wife and the negotiations for another it preferred instead to give minute instructions with regard to the eating of asparagus in this dilemma he consulted jernshaw  don’t know i’m sure said that gentleman besides it doesn’t matter  doesn’t matter repeated mr barrett why not  because i think tillett is paying her attentions was the reply he’s ten years younger than you are and a bachelor a girl would naturally prefer him to a middleaged widower with five children  in australia the other reminded him  man for man bachelor for bachelor said mr jernshaw regarding him she might prefer you as things are—  i shall ask her said mr barrett doggedly i was going to wait a bit longer but if there’s any chance of her wrecking her prospects for life by marrying that tailor’s dummy it’s my duty to risk it—for her sake i’ve seen him talking to her twice myself but i never thought he’d dream of such a thing  apprehension and indignation kept him awake half the night but when he arose next morning it was with the firm resolve to put his fortune to the test that day at four o’clock he changed his necktie for the third time and at ten past sallied out in the direction of the school he met miss lindsay just coming out and after a welldeserved compliment to the weather turned and walked with her  i was hoping to meet you he said slowly  yes said the girl  i—i have been feeling rather lonely today he continued  you often do said miss lindsay guardedly  it gets worse and worse said mr barrett sadly  i think i know what is the matter with you said the girl in a soft voice you have got nothing to do all day and you live alone except for your housekeeper  mr barrett assented with some eagerness and stole a hopeful glance at her  you—you miss something continued miss lindsay in a faltering voice  i do said mr barrett with ardour  you miss—the girl made an effort—you miss the footsteps and voices of your little children  mr barrett stopped suddenly in the street and then with a jerk went blindly on  i’ve never spoken of it before because it’s your business not mine continued the girl i wouldn’t have spoken now but when you referred to your loneliness i thought perhaps you didn’t realize the cause of it  mr barrett walked on in silent misery  poor little motherless things said miss lindsay softly motherless and—fatherless  better for them said mr barrett finding his voice at last  it almost looks like it said miss lindsay with a sigh  mr barrett tried to think clearly but the circumstances were hardly favourable suppose he said speaking very slowly suppose i wanted to get married  miss lindsay started what again she said with an air of surprise  how could i ask a girl to come and take over five children  no woman that was worth having would let little children be sacrificed for her sake said miss lindsay decidedly  do you think anybody would marry me with five children demanded mr barrett  she might said the girl edging away from him a little it depends on the woman  would—you for instance said mr barrett desperately  miss lindsay shrank still farther away i don’t know it would depend upon circumstances she murmured  i will write and send for them said mr barrett significantly  miss lindsay made no reply they had arrived at her gate by this time and with a hurried handshake she disappeared indoors  mr barrett somewhat troubled in mind went home to tea  he resolved after a little natural hesitation to drown the children and reproached himself bitterly for not having disposed of them at the same time as their mother now he would have to go through another period of mourning and the consequent delay in pressing his suit moreover he would have to allow a decent interval between his conversation with miss lindsay and their untimely end  the news of the catastrophe arrived two or three days before the return of the girl from her summer holidays she learnt it in the first half hour from her landlady and sat in a dazed condition listening to a description of the griefstricken father and the sympathy extended to him by his fellowcitizens it appeared that nothing had passed his lips for two days  shocking said miss lindsay briefly shocking  an instinctive feeling that the right and proper thing to do was to nurse his grief in solitude kept mr barrett out of her way for nearly a week when she did meet him she received a limp handshake and a greeting in a voice from which all hope seemed to have departed  i am very sorry she said with a sort of measured gentleness  mr barrett in his hushed voice thanked her  i am all alone now he said pathetically there is nobody now to care whether i live or die  miss lindsay did not contradict him  how did it happen she inquired after they had gone some distance in silence  they were out in a sailingboat said mr barrett the boat capsized in a puff of wind and they were all drowned  who was in charge of them inquired the girl after a decent interval  boatman replied the other  how did you hear  i had a letter from one of my sistersinlaw charlotte said mr barrett a most affecting letter poor charlotte was like a second mother to them she’ll never be the same woman again never  i should like to see the letter said miss lindsay musingly  mr barrett suppressed a start i should like to show it to you he said but i’m afraid i have destroyed it it made me shudder every time i looked at it  it’s a pity said the girl dryly i should have liked to see it i’ve got my own idea about the matter are you sure she was very fond of them  she lived only for them said mr barrett in a rapt voice  exactly i don’t believe they are drowned at all said miss lindsay suddenly i believe you have had all this terrible anguish for nothing it’s too cruel  mr barrett stared at her in anxious amazement  i see it all now continued the girl their aunt charlotte was devoted to them she always had the fear that some day you would return and claim them and to prevent that she invented the story of their death  charlotte is the most truthful woman that ever breathed said the distressed mr barrett  miss lindsay shook her head you are like all other honourable truthful people she said looking at him gravely you can’t imagine anybody else telling a falsehood i don’t believe you could tell one if you tried  mr barrett gazed about him with the despairing look of a drowning mariner  i’m certain i’m right continued the girl i can see charlotte exulting in her wickedness why  what’s the matter inquired mr barrett greatly worried  i’ve just thought of it said miss lindsay she’s told you that your children are drowned and she has probably told them you are dead a woman like that would stick at nothing to gain her ends  you don’t know charlotte said mr barrett feebly  i think i do was the reply however we’ll make sure i suppose you’ve got friends in melbourne  a few said mr barrett guardedly  come down to the postoffice and cable to one of them  mr barrett hesitated i’ll write he said slowly it’s an awkward thing to cable and there’s no hurry i’ll write to jack adams i think  it’s no good writing said miss lindsay firmly you ought to know that  why not demanded the other  because you foolish man said the girl calmly before your letter got there there would be one from melbourne saying that he had been choked by a fishbone or died of measles or something of that sort  mr barrett hardly able to believe his ears stopped short and looked at her the girl’s eyes were moist with mirth and her lips trembling he put out his hand and took her wrist in a strong grip  that’s all right he said with a great gasp of relief phew at one time i thought i had lost you  by heartdisease or drowning

the 23rd you are losing me     the substitute     the night watchman had just returned to the office fire after leaving it to attend a ring at the wharf bell he sat for some time puffing fiercely at his pipe and breathing heavily  boys he said at last that’s the third time this week and yet if i was to catch one and skin ’im alive i suppose i should get into trouble over it even ’is own father and mother would make a fuss most like some people have boys and other people ’ave the trouble of ’em our street’s full of ’em and the way they carry on would make a monkey’ouse ashamed of itself the man next door to me’s got seven of ’em and when i spoke to ’im friendly about it over a pint one night he put the blame on ’is wife  the worst boy i ever knew used to be officeboy in this ’ere office and i can’t understand now why i wasn’t ’ung for him undersized little chap he was with a face the colour o’ bad piecrust and two little black eyes like shoebuttons to see ’im with his little white cuffs and a standup collar and a little black bow and a little bowler’at was enough to make a cat laugh i told ’im so one day and arter that we knew where we was both of us  by rights he ought to ’ave left the office at six—just my time for coming on as it was he used to stay late purtending to work ’ard so as to get a rise arter all the clerks ’ad gorn ’ome he used to sit perched up on a stool yards too ’igh for him with one eye on the ledger and the other looking through the winder at me i remember once going off for ’arf a pint and when i come back i found ’im with a policeman two carmen and all the hands off of the maid marian standing on the edge of the jetty waiting for me to come up he said that not finding me on the wharf ’e made sure that i must ’ave tumbled overboard as he felt certain that i wouldn’t neglect my dooty while there was breath in my body but ’e was sorry to find ’e was mistook he stood there talking like a little clergyman until one of the carmen knocked his ’at over ’is eyes and then he forgot ’imself for a bit  arter that i used to wait until he ’ad gorn afore i ’ad my arfpint i didn’t want my good name taken away and i had to be careful and many’s the good arfpint i ’ad to refuse because that little imitation monkey was sitting in the office drawing faces on ’is blottingpaper but sometimes it don’t matter ’ow careful you are you make a mistake  there was a little steamer called the eastern monarch used to come up here in them days once a week fat little tub she was with a crew o’ fattish old men and a skipper that i didn’t like he’d been in the coasting trade all ’is life while i’ve knocked about all over the world but to hear ’im talk you’d think he knew more about things than i did  eddication bill’ he ses one evening ’that’s the thing you can’t argufy without it you only talk foolish like you are doing now’  ’there’s eddication and there’s common sense’ i ses ’some people ’as one and some people ’as the other give me common sense’  ’that’s wot you want’ he ses nodding  ’and o’ course’ i ses looking at ’im ’there’s some people ’asn’t got either one or the other’  the officeboy came out of the office afore he could think of an answer and the pair of ’em stood there talking to show off their cleverness till their tongues ached i took up my broom and went on sweeping and they was so busy talking long words they didn’t know the meaning of to each other that they was arf choked with dust afore they noticed it when they did notice it they left off using long words and the skipper tried to hurt my feelings with a few short ones ’e knew  ’it’s no good wasting your breath on ’im’ ses the boy ’you might as well talk to a beerbarrel’  he went off dusting ’imself down with his little pocket’ankercher and arter the skipper ’ad told me wot he’d like to do only he was too sorry for me to do it ’e went back to the ship to put on a clean collar and went off for the evening  he always used to go off by hisself of a evening and i used to wonder ’ow he passed the time then one night i found out  i had just come out of the bear’s head and stopped to look round afore going back to the wharf when i see a couple o’ people standing on the swingbridge saying ’goodbye’ to each other one of ’em was a man and the other wasn’t  ’evening cap’n’ i ses as he came towards me and gave a little start ’i didn’t know you ’ad brought your missis up with you this trip’  ’evening bill’ he ses very peaceful ’wot a lovely evening’  ’beeutiful’ i ses  ’so fresh’ ses the skipper sniffing in some of the air  ’makes you feel quite young agin’ i ses  he didn’t say nothing to that except to look at me out of the corner of ’is eye and stepping on to the wharf had another look at the sky to admire it and then went aboard his ship if he ’ad only stood me a pint and trusted me things might ha’ turned out different  quite by chance i happened to be in the bear’s head a week arterwards and quite by chance as i came out i saw the skipper saying ’goodbye’ on the bridge agin he seemed to be put out about something and when i said ’wot a lovely evening it would be if only it wasn’t raining ’ard’ he said something about knocking my ’ead off  ’and you keep your nose out o’ my bisness’ he ses very fierce  ’your bisness’ i ses ’wot bisness’  ’there’s some people as might like to know that you leave the wharf to look arter itself while you’re sitting in a pub swilling gallons and gallons o’ beer’ he ses in a nasty sort o’ way ’live and let live that’s my motter  ’i don’t know wot you’re talking about’ i ses ’but it don’t matter anyways i’ve got a clear conscience that’s the main thing i’m as open as the day and there’s nothing about me that i’d mind anybody knowing wot a pity it is everybody can’t say the same’  i didn’t see ’im saying ’goodbye’ the next week or the week arter that either but the third week arter just calling in at the bear’s head i strolled on casuallike and got as far as the bottom of tower hill afore i remembered myself turning the corner i a’most fell over the skipper wot was right in the fair way shaking ’ands with his ladyfriend under the lamppost both of ’em started and i couldn’t make up my mind which gave me the most unpleasant look  ’peepbo’ i ses cheerfullike  he stood making a gobbling noise at me like a turkey  ’give me quite a start you did’ i ses ’i didn’t dream of you being there’  ’get off’ he ses spluttering ’get off afore i tear you limb from limb ’ow dare you follow me about and come spying round corners at me wot d’ye mean by it’  i stood there with my arms folded acrost my chest as calm as a cucumber the other party stood there watching us and wot ’e could ’ave seen in her i can’t think she was dressed more like a man than a woman and it would have taken the good looks of twenty like her to ’ave made one barmaid i stood looking at ’er like a man in a dream  ’well will you know me agin’ she ses in a nasty cracked sort of voice  ’i could pick you out of a million’ i ses—’if i wanted to’  ’clear out’ ses the skipper ’clear out and thank your stars there’s a lady present’  ’don’t take no notice of ’im captain pratt’ ses the lady ’he’s beneath you you only encourage people like that by taking notice of ’em goodbye’  she held out her ’and and while the skipper was shaking it i began to walk back to the wharf i ’adn’t gorn far afore i heard ’im coming up behind me and next moment ’e was walking alongside and saying things to try and make me lose my temper  ’ah it’s a pity your pore missis can’t ’ear you’ i ses ’i expect she thinks you are stowed away in your bunk dreaming of ’er instead of saying things about a face as don’t belong to you’  ’you mind your bisness’ he ses shouting ’and not so much about my missis d’ye hear wot’s it got to do with you who asked you to shove your oar in’  ’you’re quite mistook’ i ses very calm ’i’d no idea that there was anything on as shouldn’t be i was never more surprised in my life if anybody ’ad told me i shouldn’t ’ave believed ’em i couldn’t knowing you and knowing ’ow respectable you ’ave always purtended to be and also and likewise that you ain’t no chicken——’  i thought ’e was going to ’ave a fit he ’opped about waving his arms and stuttering and going on in such a silly way that i didn’t like to be seen with ’im twice he knocked my ’at off and arter telling him wot would ’appen if ’e did it agin i walked off and left him  even then ’e wasn’t satisfied and arter coming on to the wharf and following me up and down like a little dog he got in front of me and told me some more things he ’ad thought of  ’if i catch you spying on me agin’ he ses ’you’ll wish you’d never been born’  ’you get aboard and ’ave a quiet sleep’ i ses ’you’re wandering in your mind’  ’the lady you saw me with’ he ses looking at me very fierce ’is a friend o’ mine that i meet sometimes for the sake of her talk’  ’talk’ i ses staring at ’im ’talk wot can’t one woman talk enough for you is your missis dumb or wot’  ’you don’t understand’ he ses cocking up ’is nose at me ’she’s a interleckshal woman full of eddication and information when my missis talks she talks about the price o’ things and says she must ’ave more money or else she talks about things i’ve done or sometimes things i ’aven’t done it’s all one to her there’s no pleasure in that sort o’ talk it don’t help a man’  ’i never ’eard of any talk as did’ i ses  ’i don’t suppose you did’ he ses sneeringlike ’now tonight fust of all we talked about the house of lords and whether it ought to be allowed and arter that she gave me quite a little lecture on insecks’  ’it don’t seem proper to me’ i ses ’i ’ave spoke to my wife about ’em once or twice but i should no more think of talking about such things to a single lady——’  he began to jump about agin as if i’d bit ’im and he ’ad so much to say about my ’ed and blocks of wood that i pretty near lost my temper i should ha’ lost it with some men but ’e was a very stiffbuilt chap and as hard as nails  ’beer’s your trouble’ he ses at last ’fust of all you put it down and then it climbs up and soaks wot little brains you’ve got wot you want is a kind friend to prevent you from getting it’  i don’t know wot it was but i ’ad a sort of sinking feeling inside as ’e spoke and next evening when i saw ’im walk to the end of the jetty with the officeboy and stand there talking to ’im with his ’and on his shoulder it came on worse than ever and i put two and two together when the guv’nor came up to me next day and arter talking about ’dooty’ and ’ow easy it was to get nightwatchmen mentioned in ’a off’and sort of way that if i left the wharf at all between six and six i could stay away altogether  i didn’t answer ’im a word i might ha’ told ’im that there was plenty of people arter me ready to give me double the money but i knew he could never get anybody to do their dooty by the wharf like i ’ad done so i kept quiet it’s the way i treat my missis nowadays and it pays in the old days i used to waste my breath answering ’er back  i wouldn’t ha’ minded so much if it ’adn’t ha’ been for that boy he used to pass me as ’e went off of a evening with a little sly smile on ’is ugly little face and sometimes when i was standing at the gate he’d give a sniff or two and say that he could smell beer and he supposed it came from the bear’s head  it was about three weeks arter the guv’nor ’ad forgot ’imself and i was standing by the gate one evening when i saw a woman coming along carrying a big bag in her ’and i ’adn’t seen ’er afore and when she stopped in front of me and smiled i was on my guard at once i don’t smile at other people and i don’t expect them to smile at me  ’at last’ she ses setting down ’er bag and giving me another smile ’i thought i was never going to get ’ere  i coughed and backed inside a little bit on to my own ground i didn’t want to ’ave that little beast of a officeboy spreading tales about me  ’i’ve come up to ’ave a little fling’ she ses smiling away harder than ever ’my husband don’t know i’m ’ere he thinks i’m at ’ome’  i think i went back pretty near three yards  ’i come up by train’ she ses nodding  ’yes’ i ses very severe ’and wot about going back by it’  ’oh i shall go back by ship’ she ses ’wot time do you expect the eastern monarch up’  ’well’ i ses ’ardly knowing wot to make of ’er ’she ought to be up this tide but there’s no reckoning on wot an old washtub with a engine like a sewingmachine inside ’er will do’  ’oh indeed’ she ses leaving off smiling very sudden ’oh indeed my husband might ’ave something to say about that’  ’your ’usband’ i ses  ’captain pratt’ she ses drawing ’erself up ’i’m mrs pratt he left yesterday morning and i’ve come up ’ere by train to give ’im a little surprise’  you might ha’ knocked me down with a feather and i stood there staring at her with my mouth open trying to think  ’take care’ i ses at last ’take care as you don’t give ’im too much of a surprise’  ’wot do you mean’ she ses firing up  ’nothing’ i ses ’nothing only i’ve known ’usbands in my time as didn’t like being surprised—that’s all if you take my advice you’ll go straight back home agin’  ’i’ll tell ’im wot you say’ she ses ’as soon as ’is ship comes in’  that’s a woman all over the moment they get into a temper they want to hurt somebody and i made up my mind at once that if anybody was going to be ’urt it wasn’t me and besides i thought it might be for the skipper’s good—in the long run  i broke it to her as gentle as i could i didn’t tell ’er much i just gave her a few ’ints just enough to make her ask for more  ’and mind’ i ses ’i don’t want to be brought into it if you should ’appen to take a fancy into your ’ed to wait behind a pile of empties till the ship comes in and then slip out and foller your ’usband and give ’im the little surprise you spoke of it’s nothing to do with me’  ’i understand’ she ses biting her lip ’there’s no need for ’im to know that i’ve been on the wharf at all’  i gave ’er a smile—i thought she deserved it—but she didn’t smile back she was rather a nicelooking woman in the ordinary way but i could easy see ’ow temper spoils a woman’s looks she stood there giving little shivers and looking as if she wanted to bite somebody  ’i’ll go and hide now’ she ses  ’not yet’ i ses ’you’ll ’ave to wait till that little blackbeetle in the office ’as gorn’ ’blackbeetle’ she ses staring  ’officeboy’ i ses ’he’d better not see you at all s’pose you go off for a bit and come back when i whistle’  afore she could answer the boy came out of the office ready to go ’ome he gave a little bit of a start when ’e saw me talking to a lady and then ’e nips down sudden about a couple o’ yards away and begins to do ’is bootlace up it took ’im some time because he ’ad to undo it fust but ’e finished it at last and arter a quick look at mrs pratt and one at me that i could ha’ smacked his ’ed for ’e went off whistling and showing ’is little cuffs  i stepped out into the road and watched ’im out o’ sight then i told mrs pratt to pick up ’er bag and foller me  as it ’appened there was a big pile of empties in the corner of the ware’ouse wall just opposite the eastern monarch’s berth it might ha’ been made for the job and arter i ’ad tucked her away behind and given ’er a box to sit on i picked up my broom and began to make up for lost time  she sat there as quiet as a cat watching a mouse’ole and i was going on with my work stopping every now and then to look and see whether the monarch was in sight when i ’appened to turn round and see the office boy standing on the edge of the wharf with his back to the empties looking down at the water i nearly dropped my broom  ’’ullo’ i ses going up to ’im ’i thought you ’ad gorn ’ome’  ’i was going’ he ses with a nasty oily little smile ’and then it struck me all of a sudden ’ow lonely it was for you all alone ’ere and i come back to keep you company’  he winked at something acrost the river as ’e spoke and i stood there thinking my ’ardest wot was the best thing to be done i couldn’t get mrs pratt away while ’e was there besides which i felt quite sartain she wouldn’t go the only ’ope i ’ad was that he’d get tired of spying on me and go away before he found out she was ’iding on the wharf  i walked off in a unconcerned way—not too far—and with one eye on ’im and the other on where mrs pratt was ’iding went on with my work there’s nothing like ’ard work when a man is worried and i was a’most forgetting my troubles when i looked up and saw the monarch coming up the river  she turned to come into ’er berth with the skipper shouting away on the bridge and making as much fuss as if ’e was berthing a liner i helped to make ’er fast and the skipper arter ’e had ’ad a good look round to see wot ’e could find fault with went below to clean ’imself  he was up agin in about ten minutes with a clean collar and a clean face and a blue necktie that looked as though it ’ad got yeller measles good temper ’e was in too and arter pulling the officeboy’s ear gentle as ’e was passing he stopped for a moment to ’ave a word with ’im  ’bit late ain’t you’ he ses  ’i’ve been keeping a eye on the watchman’ ses the boy ’he works better when ’e knows there’s somebody watching ’im’  ’look ’ere’ i ses ’you take yourself off i’ve had about enough of you you take your little face ’ome and ask your mother to wipe its nose strickly speaking you’ve no right to be on the wharf at all at this time’  ’i’ve as much right as other people’ he ses giving me a wicked look ’i’ve got more right than some people p’r’aps’  he stooped down deliberate and picking up a bit o’ coke from the ’eap by the crane pitched it over at the empties  ’stop that’ i ses shouting at ’im  ’what for’ ’e ses shying another piece ’why shouldn’t i’  ’cos i won’t ’ave it’ i ses ’d’ye hear stop it’  i rushed at ’im as he sent another piece over and for the next two or three minutes ’e was dodging me and chucking coke at the empties with the fool of a skipper standing by laughing and two or three of the crew leaning over the side and cheering ’im on  ’all right’ he ses at last dusting ’is hands together ’i’ve finished there’s no need to make such a fuss over a bit of coke’  ’you’ve wasted pretty near arf a ’underedweight’ i ses ’i’ve a good mind to report you’  ’don’t do that watchman’ he ses in a pitiful voice ’don’t do that ’ere i tell you wot i’ll do i’ll pick it all up agin’  afore i could move ’and or foot he ’ad shifted a couple o’ cases out of ’is way and was in among the empties i stood there dazedlike while two bits o’ coke came flying back past my ’ed then i ’eard a loud whistle and ’e came out agin with ’is eyes rolling and ’is mouth wide open  ’wot’s the matter’ ses the skipper staring at ’im  ’i—i—i’m sorry watchman’ ses that beast of a boy purtending ’e was ’ardly able to speak ’i’d no idea——’  ’all right’ i ses very quick  ’wot’s the matter’ ses the skipper agin and as ’e spoke it came over me like a flash wot a false persition i was in and wot a nastytempered man ’e could be when ’e liked  ’why didn’t you tell me you’d got a ladyfriend there’ ses the boy shaking his ’ed at me ’why i might ’ave hit ’er with a bit o’ coke and never forgiven myself’  ’ladyfriend’ ses the skipper with a start ’oh bill i am surprised’  my throat was so dry i couldn’t ’ardly speak ’it’s my missis’ i ses at last  ’your missis’ ses the skipper ’woes she ’iding behind there for’  ’she—she’s shy’ i ses ’always was all ’er life she can’t bear other people she likes to be alone with me’  ’oh watchman’ ses the boy ’i wonder where you expect to go to’  ’missis my grandmother’ ses the skipper with a wink ’i’m going to ’ave a peep’  ’stand back’ i ses pushing ’im off ’i don’t spy on you and i don’t want you to come spying on me you get off d’ye hear me get off’  we had a bit of a struggle till my foot slipped and while i was waving my arms and trying to get my balance back ’e made a dash for the empties next moment he was roaring like a mad bull that ’ad sat down in a sorsepan of boiling water and rushing back agin to kill me  i believe that if it ’adn’t ha’ been for a couple o’ lightermen wot ’ad just come on to the jetty from their skiff and two of his own ’ands he’d ha’ done it crazy with passion ’e was and it was all the four of ’em could do to hold ’im every now and then he’d get a yard nearer to me and then they’d pull ’im back a couple o’ yards and beg of ’im to listen to reason and ’ear wot i ’ad to say and as soon as i started and began to tell ’em about ’is ladyfriend he broke out worse than ever people acrost the river must ha’ wondered wot was ’appening there was two lightermen two sailormen me and the skipper and mrs pratt all talking at once and nobody listening but the officeboy and in the middle of it all the wicket was pushed open and the ’ed of the lady wot all the trouble was about peeped in and drew back agin  ’there you are’ i ses shouting my ’ardest ’there she is that’s the lady i was telling you about now then put ’em face to face and clear my character don’t let ’er escape’  one o’ the lightermen let go o’ the skipper and went arter ’er and just as i was giving the other three a helping ’and ’e came back with ’er mrs pratt caught ’er breath and as for the skipper ’e didn’t know where to look as the saying is i just saw the lady give ’im one quick look and then afore i could dream of wot was coming she rushes up to me and flings ’er long bony arms round my neck  ’why william’ she ses ’wot’s the matter why didn’t you meet me didn’t you get my letter or ’ave you ceased to care for me  ’let go’ i ses struggling ’let go d’ye ’ear wot d’ye mean by it you’ve got ’old of the wrong one’  ’oh ’william’ she ses arf strangling me ’’ow can you talk to me like that where’s your ’art’  i never knew a woman so strong i don’t suppose she’d ever ’ad the chance of getting ’er arms round a man’s neck afore and she hung on to me as if she’d never let go and all the time i was trying to explain things to them over ’er shoulder i could see they didn’t believe a word i was saying one o’ the lightermen said i was a ’wonder’ and the other said i was a ’fair coughdrop’ me  she got tired of it at last but by that time i was so done up i couldn’t say a word i just dropped on to a box and sat there getting my breath back while the skipper forgave ’is wife for ’er unjust suspicions of ’im—but told ’er not to do it agin—and the officeboy was saying i’d surprised even ’im the last i saw of the ladyfriend the two lightermen was helping ’er to walk to the gate and the two sailormen was follering ’er up behind carrying ’er pocket’ankercher and upberella     striking hard     you’ve what demanded mrs porter placing the hot iron carefully on its stand and turning a heated face on the head of the family  struck repeated mr porter and the only wonder to me is we’ve stood it so long as we have if i was to tell you all we’ve ’ad to put up with i don’t suppose you’d believe me  very likely was the reply you can keep your fairytales for them that like ’em they’re no good to me  we stood it till flesh and blood could stand it no longer declared her husband and at last we came out shoulder to shoulder singing the people cheered us and one of our leaders made ’em a speech  i should have liked to ’ave heard the singing remarked his wife if they all sang like you it must ha’ been as good as a pantermime do you remember the last time you went on strike  this is different said mr porter with dignity  all our things went bit by bit pursued his wife all the money we had put by for a rainy day and we ’ad to begin all over again what are we going to live on o’ course you might earn something by singing in the street people who like funny faces might give you something why not go upstairs and put your ’ead under the bedclothes and practise a bit  mr porter coughed it’ll be all right he said confidently our committee knows what it’s about bert robinson is one of the best speakers i’ve ever ’eard if we don’t all get five bob a week more i’ll eat my ’ead  it’s the best thing you could do with it snapped his wife she took up her iron again and turning an obstinate back to his remarks resumed her work  mr porter lay long next morning and dressing with comfortable slowness noticed with pleasure that the sun was shining visions of a good breakfast and a digestive pipe followed by a walk in the fresh air passed before his eyes as he laced his boots whistling cheerfully he went briskly downstairs  it was an october morning but despite the invigorating chill in the air the kitchengrate was cold and dull herringbones and a disorderly collection of dirty cups and platters graced the table perplexed and angry he looked around for his wife and then opening the backdoor stood gaping with astonishment the wife of his bosom who should have had a bright fire and a good breakfast waiting for him was sitting on a box in the sunshine elbows on knees and puffing laboriously at a cigarette  susan he exclaimed  mrs porter turned and puffing out her lips blew an immense volume of smoke halloa she said carelessly  wot—wot does this mean demanded her husband  mrs porter smiled with conscious pride i made it come out of my nose just now she replied at least some of it did and i swallowed the rest will it hurt me  where’s my breakfast inquired the other hotly why ain’t the kitchenfire alight wot do you think you’re doing of  i’m not doing anything said his wife with an aggrieved air i’m on strike  mr porter reeled against the doorpost wot he stammered on strike nonsense you can’t be  o yes i can retorted mrs porter closing one eye and ministering to it hastily with the corner of her apron not ’aving no bert robinson to do it for me i made a little speech all to myself and here i am  she dropped her apron replaced the cigarette and with her hands on her plump knees eyes him steadily  but—but this ain’t a factory objected the dismayed man and besides —i won’t ’ave it  mrs porter laughed—a fat comfortable laugh but with a touch of hardness in it  all right mate she said comfortably what are you out on strike for  shorter hours and more money said mr porter glaring at her  his wife nodded so am i she said i wonder who gets it first  she smiled agreeably at the bewildered mr porter and extracting a paper packet of cigarettes from her pocket lit a fresh one at the stub of the first  that’s the worst of a woman said her husband avoiding her eye and addressing a sanitary dustbin of severe aspect they do things without thinking first that’s why men are superior before they do a thing they look at it all round and upside down and—and—make sure it can be done now you get up in a temper this morning and the first thing you do—not even waiting to get my breakfast ready first—is to go on strike if you’d thought for two minutes you’d see as ’ow it’s impossible for you to go on strike for more than a couple of hours or so  why inquired mrs porter  kids replied her husband triumphantly they’ll be coming ’ome from school soon won’t they and they’ll be wanting their dinner won’t they  that’s all right murmured the other vaguely  after which when night comes pursued mr porter they’ll ’ave to be put to bed in the morning they’ll ’ave to be got up and washed and dressed and given their breakfast and sent off to school then there’s shopping wot must be done and beds wot must be made  i’ll make ours said his wife decidedly for my own sake  and wot about the others inquired mr porter  the others’ll be made by the same party as washes the children and cooks their dinner for ’em and puts ’em to bed and cleans the ’ouse was the reply  i’m not going to have your mother ’ere exclaimed mr porter with sudden heat mind that  i don’t want her said mrs porter it’s a job for a strong healthy man not a pore old thing with swelled legs and short in the breath  strong—’ealthy—man repeated her husband in a dazed voice strong—’eal—— wot are you talking about  mrs porter beamed on him you she said sweetly  there was a long silence broken at last by a firework display of expletives mrs porter still smiling sat unmoved  you may smile raved the indignant mr porter you may sit there smiling and smoking like a—like a man but if you think that i’m going to get the meals ready and soil my ’ands with making beds and washingup you’re mistook there’s some ’usbands i know as would set about you  mrs porter rose well i can’t sit here gossiping with you all day she said entering the house  wot are you going to do demanded her husband following her  going to see aunt jane and ’ave a bit o’ dinner with her was the reply and after that i think i shall go to the ’pictures’ if you ’ave bloaters for dinner be very careful with little jemmy and the bones  i forbid you to leave this ’ouse said mr porter in a thrilling voice if you do you won’t find nothing done when you come home and all the kids dirty and starving  cheerio said mrs porter  arrayed in her sunday best she left the house half an hour later a glance over her shoulder revealed her husband huddled up in a chair in the dirty kitchen gazing straight before him at the empty grate  he made a hearty breakfast at a neighbouring coffeeshop and returning home lit the fire and sat before it smoking the return of the four children from school soon after midday found him still wrestling with the difficulties of the situation his announcement that their mother was out and that there would be no dinner was received at first in stupefied silence then jemmy opening his mouth to its widest extent acted as conductor to an alltoowilling chorus  the noise was unbearable and mr porter said so pleased with the tribute the choir redoubled its efforts and mr porter vociferating orders for silence saw only too clearly the base advantage his wife had taken of his affection for his children he took some money from his pocket and sent the leading treble out marketing after which with the assistance of a soprano aged eight he washed up the breakfast things and placed one of them in the dustbin  the entire family stood at his elbow as he cooked the dinner and watched with bated breath his frantic efforts to recover a sausage which had fallen out of the fryingpan into the fire a fourfold sigh of relief heralded its return to the pan  mother always— began the eldest boy  mr porter took his scorched fingers out of his mouth and smacked the critic’s head  the dinner was not a success portions of halfcooked sausages returned to the pan and coming back in the guise of cinders failed to find their rightful owners  last time we had sausages said the eightyearold muriel they melted in your mouth mr porter glowered at her  instead of in the fire said the eldest boy with a mournful snigger  if i get up to you my lad said the harassed mr porter you’ll know it pity you don’t keep your sharpness for your lessons wot country is africa in  why africa’s a continent said the startled youth  jes so said his father but wot i’m asking you is wot country is it in  asia said the reckless one with a sideglance at muriel  and why couldn’t you say so before demanded mr porter sternly now you go to the sink and give yourself a thorough good wash and mind you come straight home from school there’s work to be done  he did some of it himself after the children had gone and finished up the afternoon with a little shopping in the course of which he twice changed his grocer and was threatened with an action for slander by his fishmonger he returned home with his clothes bulging although a couple of eggs in the lefthand coatpocket had done their best to accommodate themselves to his figure  he went to bed at eleven o’clock and at a quarter past clad all too lightly for the job sped rapidly downstairs to admit his wife  some ’usbands would ’ave let you sleep on the doorstep all night he said crisply  i know they would returned his wife cheerfully that’s why i married you i remember the first time i let you come ’ome with me mother ses ’there ain’t much of ’im susan’ she ses ’still arf a loaf is better than—’  the bedroomdoor slammed behind the indignant mr porter and the three lumps and a depression which had once been a bed received his quivering frame again with the sheet obstinately drawn over his head he turned a deaf ear to his wife’s panegyrics on striking and her heartfelt tribute to the end of a perfect day even when standing on the cold floor while she remade the bed he maintained an attitude of unbending dignity only relaxing when she smote him lightheartedly with the bolster in a few illchosen words he expressed his opinion of her mother and her deplorable methods of bringing up her daughters  he rose early next morning and after getting his own breakfast put on his cap and went out closing the streetdoor with a bang that awoke the entire family and caused the somnolent mrs porter to open one eye for the purpose of winking with it slowly as became a man of leisure he strolled down to the works and moving from knot to knot of his colleagues discussed the prospects of victory later on with a little natural diffidence he drew mr bert robinson apart and asked his advice upon a situation which was growing more and more difficult  i’ve got my hands pretty full as it is you know said mr robinson hastily  i know you ’ave bert murmured the other but you see she told me last night she’s going to try and get some of the other chaps’ wives to join ’er so i thought i ought to tell you  mr robinson started have you tried giving her a hiding he inquired  mr porter shook his head i daren’t trust myself he replied i might go too far once i started  what about appealing to her better nature inquired the other  she ain’t got one said the unfortunate well i’m sorry for you said mr robinson but i’m busy i’ve got to see a labourleader this afternoon and two reporters and this evening there’s the meeting try kindness first and if that don’t do lock her up in her bedroom and keep her on bread and water  he moved off to confer with his supporters and mr porter after wandering aimlessly about for an hour or two returned home at midday with a faint hope that his wife might have seen the error of her ways and provided dinner for him he found the house empty and the beds unmade the remains of breakfast stood on the kitchentable and a puddle of cold tea decorated the floor the arrival of the children from school hungry and eager completed his discomfiture  for several days he wrestled grimly with the situation while mrs porter who had planned out her week into four days of charing two of amusement and sunday in bed looked on with smiling approval she even offered to give him a little instruction—verbal—in scrubbing the kitchenfloor  mr porter who was on his knees at the time rose slowly to his full height and with a superb gesture emptied the bucket which also contained a scrubbingbrush and lump of soap into the backyard then he set off down the street in quest of a staff  he found it in the person of maudie stevens aged fourteen who lived a few doors lower down fresh from school the week before she cheerfully undertook to do the housework and cooking and to act as nursemaid in her spare time her father on his part cheerfully undertook to take care of her wages for her the first week’s payable in advance being banked the same evening at the lord nelson  it was another mouth to feed but the strikepay was coming in very well and mr porter relieved from his unmanly tasks walked the streets a free man beds were made without his interference meals were ready roughly at the appointed hour and for the first time since the strike he experienced satisfaction in finding fault with the cook the children’s content was not so great maudie possessing a faith in the virtues of soap and water that they made no attempt to share they were greatly relieved when their mother returned home after spending a couple of days with aunt jane  what’s all this she demanded as she entered the kitchen followed by a ladyfriend  what’s all what inquired mr porter who was sitting at dinner with the family  that said his wife pointing at the cookgeneral  mr porter put down his knife and fork got ’er in to help he replied uneasily  do you hear that demanded his wife turning to her friend mrs gorman oh these masters  ah said her friend vaguely  a strikebreaker said mrs porter rolling her eyes  shame said mrs gorman beginning to understand  coming after my job and taking the bread out of my mouth continued mrs porter fluently underselling me too i’ll be bound that’s what comes of not having pickets  unskilled labour said mrs gorman tightening her lips and shaking her head  a scab cried mrs porter wildly a scab  put her out counselled her friend  put her out repeated mrs porter in a terrible voice put her out i’ll tear her limb from limb i’ll put her in the copper and boil her  her voice was so loud and her appearance so alarming that the unfortunate maudie emitting three piercing shrieks rose hastily from the table and looked around for a way of escape the road to the frontdoor was barred and with a final yelp that set her employer’s teeth on edge she dashed into the yard and went home via the backfences housewives busy in their kitchens looked up in amazement at the spectacle of a pair of thin black legs descending one fence scudding across the yard to the accompaniment of a terrified moaning and scrambling madly over the other at her own backdoor maudie collapsed on the step and to the intense discomfort and annoyance of her father had her first fit of hysterics  and the next scab that comes into my house won’t get off so easy said mrs porter to her husband d’you understand  if you ’ad some husbands— began mr porter trembling with rage  yes i know said his wife nodding don’t cry jemmy she added taking the youngest on her knee mother’s only having a little game she and dad are both on strike for more pay and less work  mr porter got up and without going through the formality of saying goodbye to the hardfeatured mrs gorman put on his cap and went out over a couple of halfpints taken as a sedative he realized the growing seriousness of his position  in a dull resigned fashion he took up his household duties again made harder now than before by the scandalous gossip of the aggrieved mr stevens the anonymous present of a muchworn apron put the finishing touch to his discomfiture and the wellmeant offer of a fair neighbour to teach him how to shake a mat without choking himself met with a reception that took her breath away  it was a surprise to him one afternoon to find that his wife had so far unbent as to tidy up the parlour ornaments had been dusted and polished and the carpet swept she had even altered the position of the furniture the table had been pushed against the wall and the easy chair with its back to the window stood stiffly confronting six or seven assorted chairs two of which at least had been promoted from a lower sphere  it’s for the meeting said muriel peeping in  meeting repeated her father in a dazed voice  strikemeetings was the reply mrs gorman and some other ladies are coming at four o’clock didn’t mother tell you  mr porter staring helplessly at the row of chairs shook his head  mrs evans is coming continued muriel in a hushed voice—the lady what punched mr brown because he kept bobbie evans in one day he ain’t been kept in since i wish you——  she stopped suddenly and held by her father’s gaze backed slowly out of the room mr porter left with the chairs stood regarding them thoughtfully their emptiness made an appeal that no rightminded man could ignore he put his hand over his mouth and his eyes watered  he spent the next halfhour in issuing invitations and at halfpast three every chair was filled by fellowstrikers three cans of beer clay pipes and a paper of shag stood on the table mr benjamin todd an obese freshcoloured gentleman of middle age took the easychair glasses and teacups were filled  gentlemen said mr todd lighting his pipe afore we get on to the business of this meeting i want to remind you that there is another meeting of ladies at four o’clock so we’ve got to hurry up o’ course if it should happen that we ain’t finished——  go on bennie said a delighted admirer i see a female ’ead peeping in at the winder already said a voice  let ’em peep said mr todd benignly then p’r’aps they’ll be able to see how to run a meeting  there’s two more ’eads said the other oh lord i know i sha’n’t be able to keep a straight face  h’sh commanded mr todd sternly as the streetdoor was heard to open be’ave yourself as i was saying the thing we’ve got to consider about this strike——  the door opened and six ladies headed by mrs porter entered the room in single file and ranged themselves silently along the wall  strike proceeded mr todd who found himself gazing uneasily into the eyes of mrs gorman——strike—er—strike——  he said that before said a stout lady in a loud whisper i’m sure he did  is continued mr todd that we have got to keep this—this—er—  strike prompted the same voice  mr todd paused and wiping his mouth with a red pockethandkerchief sat staring straight before him  i move said mrs evans her sharp features twitching with excitement that mrs gorman takes the chair  ’ow can i take it when he’s sitting in it demanded that lady  she’s a lady that knows what she wants and how to get it pursued mrs evans unheeding she understands men—  i’ve buried two ’usbands murmured mrs gorman nodding  and how to manage them continued mrs evans i move that mrs gorman takes the chair those in favour—  mr todd leaning back in his chair and gripping the arms gazed defiantly at a row of palms  carried unanimously snapped mrs evans  mrs gorman tall and bony advanced and stood over mr todd strong men held their breath  it’s my chair she said gruffly i’ve been moved into it  possession said mr todd in as firm a voice as he could manage is nine points of the law i’m here and—  mrs gorman turned and without the slightest warning sat down suddenly and heavily in his lap a hum of admiration greeted the achievement  get up shouted the horrified mr todd get up  mrs gorman settled herself more firmly  let me get up said mr todd panting  mrs gorman rose but remained in a hovering position between which and the chair mr todd flushed and dishevelled extricated himself in all haste a shrill titter of laughter and a clapping of hands greeted his appearance he turned furiously on the pallid mr porter  what d’you mean by it he demanded are you the master or ain’t you a man what can’t keep order in his own house ain’t fit to be called a man if my wife was carrying on like this——  i wish i was your wife said mrs gorman moistening her lips  mr todd turned slowly and surveyed her  i don’t he said simply and being by this time near the door faded gently from the room  order cried mrs gorman thumping the arm of her chair with a large hardworking fist take your seats ladies  a strange thrill passed through the bodies of her companions and communicated itself to the men in the chairs there was a moment’s tense pause and then the end man muttering something about going to see what had happened to poor old ben todd rose slowly and went out his companions with heads erect and a look of cold disdain upon their faces followed him  it was mr porter’s last meeting but his wife had several more they lasted in fact until the day a fortnight later when he came in with flushed face and sparkling eyes to announce that the strike was over and the men victorious  six bob a week more he said with enthusiasm you see i was right to strike after all  mrs porter eyed him i am out for four bob a week more she said calmly  her husband swallowed you—you don’t understand ’ow these things are done he said at last it takes time we ought to ne—negotiate  all right said mrs porter readily seven shillings a week then  let’s say four and have done with it exclaimed the other hastily  and mrs porter said it     dirty work     it was nearly highwater and the nightwatchman who had stepped aboard a lighter lying alongside the wharf to smoke a pipe sat with halfclosed eyes enjoying the summer evening the bustle of the day was over the wharves were deserted and hardly a craft moved on the river perfumed clouds of shag hovering for a time over the lighter floated lazily towards the surrey shore  there’s one thing about my job said the nightwatchman slowly it’s done all alone by yourself there’s no foreman ahollering at you and offering you a penny for your thoughts and no mates to run into you from behind with a loaded truck and then ask you why you didn’t look where you’re going to from six o’clock in the evening to six o’clock next morning i’m my own master  he rammed down the tobacco with an experienced forefinger and puffed contentedly  people like you ’ud find it lonely he continued after a pause i did at fust i used to let people come and sit ’ere with me of an evening talking but i got tired of it arter a time and when one chap fell overboard while ’e was showing me ’ow he put his wife’s mother in ’er place i gave it up altogether there was three foot o’ mud in the dock at the time and arter i ’ad got ’im out he fainted in my arms  arter that i kept myself to myself say wot you like a man’s best friend is ’imself there’s nobody else’ll do as much for ’im or let ’im off easier when he makes a mistake if i felt a bit lonely i used to open the wicket in the gate and sit there watching the road and p’r’aps pass a word or two with the policeman then something ’appened one night that made me take quite a dislike to it for a time  i was sitting there with my feet outside smoking a quiet pipe when i ’eard a bit of a noise in the distance then i ’eard people running and shouts of stop thief a man came along round the corner full pelt and just as i got up dashed through the wicket and ran on to the wharf i was arter ’im like a shot and got up to ’im just in time to see him throw something into the dock and at the same moment i ’eard the other people run past the gate  wot’s up i ses collaring ’im  nothing he ses breathing ’ard and struggling let me go  he was a little wisp of a man and i shook ’im like a dog shakes a rat i remembered my own pocket being picked and i nearly shook the breath out of ’im  and now i’m going to give you in charge i ses pushing ’im along towards the gate  wot for he ses purtending to be surprised  stealing i ses  you’ve made a mistake he ses you can search me if you like  more use to search the dock i ses i see you throw it in now you keep quiet else you’ll get ’urt if you get five years i shall be all the more pleased  i don’t know ’ow he did it but ’e did he seemed to sink away between my legs and afore i knew wot was ’appening i was standing upside down with all the blood rushing to my ’ead as i rolled over he bolted through the wicket and was off like a flash of lightning  a couple o’ minutes arterwards the people wot i ’ad ’eard run past came back agin there was a big fat policeman with ’em—a man i’d seen afore on the beat—and when they ’ad gorn on he stopped to ’ave a word with me  ’ot work he ses taking off his ’elmet and wiping his bald ’ead with a large red handkerchief i’ve lost all my puff  been running i ses very perlite  arter a pickpocket he ses he snatched a lady’s purse just as she was stepping aboard the french boat with her ’usband ’twelve pounds in it in gold two peppermint lozenges and a postage stamp’  he shook his ’ead and put his ’elmet on agin  holding it in her little ’and as usual he ses asking for trouble i call it i believe if a woman ’ad one hand off and only a finger and thumb left on the other she’d carry ’er purse in it  he knew a’most as much about wimmen as i do when ’is fust wife died she said ’er only wish was that she could take ’im with her and she made ’im promise her faithful that ’e’d never marry agin his second wife arter a long illness passed away while he was playing hymns on the concertina to her and ’er mother arter looking at ’er very hard went to the doctor and said she wanted an inquest  he went on talking for a long time but i was busy doing a bit of ’ead work and didn’t pay much attention to ’im i was thinking o’ twelve pounds two lozenges and a postage stamp laying in the mud at the bottom of my dock and arter a time ’e said ’e see as ’ow i was waiting to get back to my night’s rest and went off—stamping  i locked the wicket when he ’ad gorn away and then i went to the edge of the dock and stood looking down at the spot where the purse ’ad been chucked in the tide was on the ebb but there was still a foot or two of water atop of the mud i walked up and down thinking  i thought for a long time and then i made up my mind if i got the purse and took it to the policestation the police would share the money out between ’em and tell me they ’ad given it back to the lady if i found it and put a notice in the newspaper—which would cost money—very likely a dozen or two ladies would come and see me and say it was theirs then if i gave it to the bestlooking one and the one it belonged to turned up there’d be trouble my idea was to keep it—for a time—and then if the lady who lost it came to me and asked me for it i would give it to ’er  once i had made up my mind to do wot was right i felt quite ’appy and arter a look up and down i stepped round to the bear’s head and ’ad a couple o’ goes o’ rum to keep the cold out there was nobody in there but the landlord and ’e started at once talking about the thief and ’ow he ’ad run arter him in ’is shirtsleeves  my opinion is he ses that ’e bolted on one of the wharves and ’id ’imself he disappeared like magic was that little gate o’ yours open  i was on the wharf i ses very cold  you might ha’ been on the wharf and yet not ’ave seen anybody come on he ses nodding  wot d’ye mean i ses very sharp nothing he ses nothing  are you trying to take my character away i ses fixing ’im with my eye  lo’ bless me no he ses staring at me it’s no good to me  he sat down in ’is chair behind the bar and went straight off to sleep with his eyes screwed up as tight as they would go then ’e opened his mouth and snored till the glasses shook i suppose i’ve been one of the best customers he ever ’ad and that’s the way he treated me for two pins i’d ha’ knocked ’is ugly ’ead off but arter waking him up very sudden by dropping my glass on the floor i went off back to the wharf  i locked up agin and ’ad another look at the dock the water ’ad nearly gone and the mud was showing in patches my mind went back to a sailorman wot had dropped ’is watch overboard two years before and found it by walking about in the dock in ’is bare feet he found it more easy because the glass broke when he trod on it  the evening was a trifle chilly for june but i’ve been used to roughing it all my life especially when i was afloat and i went into the office and began to take my clothes off i took off everything but my pants and i made sure o’ them by making braces for ’em out of a bit of string then i turned the gas low and arter slipping on my boots went outside  it was so cold that at fust i thought i’d give up the idea the longer i stood on the edge looking at the mud the colder it looked but at last i turned round and went slowly down the ladder i waited a moment at the bottom and was just going to step off when i remembered that i ’ad got my boots on and i ’ad to go up agin and take ’em off  i went down very slow the next time and anybody who ’as been down an iron ladder with thin cold rungs in their bare feet will know why and i had just dipped my left foot in when the wharfbell rang  i ’oped at fust that it was a runawayring but it kept on and the longer it kept on the worse it got i went up that ladder agin and called out that i was coming and then i went into the office and just slipped on my coat and trousers and went to the gate  wot d’you want i ses opening the wicket three or four inches and looking out at a man wot was standing there  are you old bill he ses  i’m the watchman i ses sharplike wot d’you want  don’t bite me he ses purtending to draw back i ain’t done no ’arm i’ve come round about that glass you smashed at the bear’s head  glass i ses ’ardly able to speak  yes glass he ses—thing wot yer drink out of the landlord says it’ll cost you a tanner and ’e wants it now in case you pass away in your sleep he couldn’t come ’imself cos he’s got nobody to mind the bar so ’e sent me why halloa where’s your boots ain’t you afraid o’ ketching cold  you clear off i ses shouting at him d’ye ’ear me clear off while you’re safe and you tell the landlord that next time ’e insults me i’ll smash every glass in ’is place and then sit ’im on top of ’cm tell ’im if ’e wants a tanner out o’ me to come round ’imself and see wot he gets  it was a silly thing to say and i saw it arterwards but i was in such a temper i ’ardly knew wot i was saying i slammed the wicket in ’is face and turned the key and then i took off my clothes and went down that ladder agin  it seemed colder than ever and the mud when i got fairly into it was worse than i thought it could ha’ been it stuck to me like glue and every step i took seemed colder than the one before ’owever when i make up my mind to do a thing i do it i fixed my eyes on the place where i thought the purse was and every time i felt anything under my foot i reached down and picked it up—and then chucked it away as far as i could so as not to pick it up agin dirty job it was too and in five minutes i was mud up to the neck a’most and i ’ad just got to wot i thought was the right place and feeling about very careful when the bell rang agin  i thought i should ha’ gorn out o’ my mind it was just a little tinkle at first then another tinkle but as i stood there all in the dark and cold trying to make up my mind to take no notice of it it began to ring like mad i ’ad to go—i’ve known men climb over the gate afore now—and i didn’t want to be caught in that dock  the mud seemed stickier than ever but i got out at last and arter scraping some of it off with a bit o’ stick i put on my coat and trousers and boots just as i was and went to the gate with the bell going its ’ardest all the time  when i opened the gate and see the landlord of the bear’s head standing there i turned quite dizzy and there was a noise in my ears like the roaring of the sea i should think i stood there for a couple o’ minutes without being able to say a word i could think of ’em  don’t be frightened bill ses the landlord i’m not going to eat you  he looks as if he’s walking in ’is sleep ses the fat policeman wot was standing near by don’t startle ’im  he always looks like that ses the landlord  i stood looking at ’im i could speak then but i couldn’t think of any words good enough not with a policeman standing by with a notebook in ’is pocket  wot was you ringing my bell for i ses at last  why didn’t you answer it before ses the landlord d’you think i’ve got nothing better to do than to stand ringing your bell for three quarters of an hour some people would report you  i know my dooty i ses there’s no craft up tonight and no reason for anybody to come to my bell if i was to open the gate every time a parcel of overgrown boys rang my bell i should ’ave enough to do  well i’ll overlook it this time seeing as you’re an old man and couldn’t get another sleepingin job he ses looking at the policeman for him to see ’ow clever ’e was wot about that tanner that’s wot i’ve come for  you be off i ses starting to shut the wicket you won’t get no tanner out of me  all right he ses i shall stand here and go on ringing the bell till you pay up that’s all  he gave it another tug and the policeman instead of locking ’im up for it stood there laughing  i gave ’im the tanner it was no use standing there arguing over a tanner with a purse of twelve quid waiting for me in the dock but i told ’im wot people thought of ’im  arf a second watchman ses the policeman as i started to shut the wicket agin you didn’t see anything of that pickpocket did you  i did not i ses  ’cos this gentleman thought he might ’ave come in here ses the policeman  ’ow could he ’ave come in here without me knowing it i ses firing up  easy ses the landlord and stole your boots into the bargain  he might ’ave come when your back was turned ses the policeman and if so he might be ’iding there now i wonder whether you’d mind me having a look round  i tell you he ain’t ’ere i ses very short but to ease your mind i’ll ’ave a look round myself arter you’ve gorn  the policeman shook his ’ead well o’ course i can’t come in without your permission he ses with a little cough but i ’ave an idea that if it was your guv’nor ’ere instead of you he’d ha’ been on’y too pleased to do anything ’e could to help the law i’ll beg his pardon tomorrow for asking you in case he might object  that settled it that’s the police all over and that’s ’ow they get their way and do as they like i could see ’im in my mind’s eye talking to the guv’nor and letting out little things about broken glasses and suchlike by accident i drew back to let ’im pass and i was so upset that when that little rat of a landlord follered ’im i didn’t say a word  i stood and watched them poking and prying about the wharf as if it belonged to ’em with the light from the policeman’s lantern flashing about all over the place i was shivering with cold and temper the mud was drying on me  if you’ve finished ’unting for the pickpocket i’ll let you out and get on with my work i ses drawing myself up  good night ses the policeman moving off good night dear ses the landlord mind you tuck yourself up warm  i lost my temper for the moment and afore i knew wot i was doing i ’ad got hold of him and was shoving ’im towards the gate as ’ard as i could shove he pretty near got my coat off in the struggle and next moment the policeman ’ad turned his lantern on me and they was both staring at me as if they couldn’t believe their eyesight  he—he’s turning black ses the landlord  he’s turned black ses the policeman  they both stood there looking at me with their mouths open and then afore i knew wot he was up to the policeman came close up to me and scratched my chest with his fingernail  it’s mud he ses  you keep your nails to yourself i ses it’s nothing to do with you and i couldn’t ’elp noticing the smell of it nobody could and wot was worse than all was that the tide ’ad turned and was creeping over the mud in the dock  they got tired of it at last and came back to where i was and stood there shaking their ’eads at me  if he was on the wharf ’e must ’ave made his escape while you was in the bear’s head ses the policeman  he was in my place a long time ses the landlord  well it’s no use crying over spilt milk ses the policeman funny smell about ’ere ain’t there he ses sniffing and turning to the landlord wot is it  i dunno ses the landlord i noticed it while we was talking to ’im at the gate it seems to foller ’im about  i’ve smelt things i like better ses the policeman sniffing agin it’s just like the foreshore when somebody ’as been stirring the mud up a bit  unless it’s a case of ’tempted suicide he ses looking at me very ’ard  ah ses the landlord  there’s no mud on ’is clothes ses the policeman looking me over with his lantern agin  he must ’ave gone in naked but i should like to see ’is legs to make— all right all right keep your ’air on  you look arter your own legs then i ses very sharp and mind your own business  it is my business he ses turning to the landlord was ’e strange in his manner at all when ’e was in your place tonight  he smashed one o’ my best glasses ses the landlord  so he did ses the policeman so he did i’d forgot that do you know ’im well  not more than i can ’elp ses the landlord he’s been in my place a good bit but i never knew of any reason why ’e should try and do away with ’imself if he’s been disappointed in love he ain’t told me anything about it  i suppose that couple o’ fools ’ud ’ave stood there talking about me all night if i’d ha’ let ’em but i had about enough of it  look ’ere i ses you’re very clever both of you but you needn’t worry your ’eads about me i’ve just been having a mudbath that’s all  a mudbath ses both of ’em squeaking like a couple o’ silly parrots  for rheumatics i ses i ’ad it something cruel tonight and i thought that p’r’aps the mud ’ud do it good i read about it in the papers there’s places where you pay pounds and pounds for ’em but being a pore man i ’ad to ’ave mine on the cheap  the policeman stood there looking at me for a moment and then ’e began to laugh till he couldn’t stop ’imself  loveaduck he ses at last wiping his eyes i wish i’d seen it  must ha’ looked like a fat mermaid ses the landlord wagging his silly ’ead at me i can just see old bill sitting in the mud acombing his ’air and singing  they ’ad some more talk o’ that sort just to show each other ’ow funny they was but they went off at last and i fastened up the gate and went into the office to clean myself up as well as i could one comfort was they ’adn’t got the least idea of wot i was arter and i ’ad a fancy that the one as laughed last would be the one as got that twelve quid  i was so tired that i slept nearly all day arter i ’ad got ’ome and i ’ad no sooner got back to the wharf in the evening than i see that the landlord ’ad been busy if there was one silly fool that asked me the best way of making mudpies i should think there was fifty little things please little minds and the silly way some of ’em went on made me feel sorry for my sects  by eight o’clock ’owever they ’ad all sheered off and i got a broom and began to sweep up to ’elp pass the time away until lowwater on’y one craft ’ad come up that day—a ketch called the peewit—and as she was berthed at the end of the jetty she wasn’t in my way at all  her skipper came on to the wharf just afore ten fat silly old man ’e was named fogg always talking about ’is ’ealth and taking medicine to do it good he came up to me slow like and when ’e stopped and asked me about the rheumatics the broom shook in my ’and  look here i ses if you want to be funny go and be funny with them as likes it i’m fair sick of it so i give you warning  funny he ses staring at me with eyes like a cow wot d’ye mean there’s nothing funny about rheumatics i ought to know i’m a martyr to it did you find as ’ow the mud did you any good  i looked at ’im hard but ’e stood there looking at me with his fat baby face and i knew he didn’t mean any harm so i answered ’im perlite and wished ’im good night  i’ve ’ad pretty near everything a man can have he ses casting anchor on a empty box but i think the rheumatics was about the worst of ’em all i even tried bees for it once  bees i ses bees  beestings he ses a man told me that if i could on’y persuade a few bees to sting me that ’ud cure me i don’t know what ’e meant by persuading they didn’t want no persuading i took off my coat and shirt and went and rocked one of my neighbour’s beehives next door and i thought my last hour ’ad come  he sat on that box and shivered at the memory of it  now i take dr pepper’s pellets instead he ses i’ve got a box in my stateroom and if you’d like to try ’em you’re welcome  he sat there talking about the complaints he had ’ad and wot he ’ad done for them till i thought i should never have got rid of ’im he got up at last though and arter telling me to always wear flannel next to my skin climbed aboard and went below  i knew the hands was aboard and arter watching ’is cabinskylight until the light was out i went and undressed then i crept back on to the jetty and arter listening by the peewit to make sure that they was all asleep i went back and climbed down the ladder  it was colder than ever the cold seemed to get into my bones but i made up my mind to ’ave that twelve quid if i died for it i trod round and round the place where i ’ad seen that purse chucked in until i was tired and the rubbish i picked up by mistake you wouldn’t believe  i suppose i ’ad been in there arf an hour and i was standing up with my teeth clenched to keep them from chattering when i ’appened to look round and see something like a white ball coming down the ladder my ’art seemed to stand still for a moment and then it began to beat as though it would burst the white thing came down lower and lower and then all of a sudden it stood in the mud and said ow  who is it i ses who are you halloa bill it ses ain’t it perishing cold  it was the voice o’ cap’n fogg and if ever i wanted to kill a fellow creetur i wanted to then  ’ave you been in long bill he ses about ten minutes i ses grinding my teeth  is it doing you good he ses  i didn’t answer ’im  i was just going off to sleep he ses when i felt a sort of hot pain in my left knee o’ course i knew what it meant at once and instead o’ taking some of the pellets i thought i’d try your remedy instead it’s a bit nippy but i don’t mind that if it does me good  he laughed a silly sort o’ laugh and then i’m blest if ’e didn’t sit down in that mud and waller in it then he’d get up and come for’ard two or three steps and sit down agin  ain’t you sitting down bill he ses arter a time  no i ses i’m not  i don’t think you can expect to get the full benefit unless you do he ses coming up close to me and sitting down agin it’s a bit of a shock at fust but halloa  wot’s up i ses  sitting on something hard he ses i wish people ’ud be more careful  he took a list to port and felt under the starboard side then he brought his ’and up and tried to wipe the mud off and see wot he ’ad got  wot is it i ses with a nasty sinking sort o’ feeling inside me  i don’t know he ses going on wiping it’s soft outside and ’ard inside it——  let’s ’ave a look at it i ses holding out my ’and  it’s nothing he ses in a queer voice getting up and steering for the ladder bit of oystershell i think  he was up that ladder hand over fist with me close behind ’im and as soon as he ’ad got on to the wharf started to run to ’is ship  good night bill he ses over ’is shoulder  arf a moment i ses follering ’im  i must get aboard he ses i believe i’ve got a chill and afore i could stop ’im he ’ad jumped on and run down to ’is cabin  i stood on the jetty for a minute or two trembling all over with cold and temper then i saw he ’ad got a light in ’is cabin and i crept aboard and peeped down the skylight and i just ’ad time to see some sovereigns on the table when he looked up and blew out the light
