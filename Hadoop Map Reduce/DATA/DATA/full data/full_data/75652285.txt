75652285	the call of the canyon  by zane grey     chapter i  what subtle strange message had come to her out of the west carley burch laid the letter in her lap and gazed dreamily through the window  it was a day typical of early april in new york rather cold and gray with steely sunlight spring breathed in the air but the women passing along fiftyseventh street wore furs and wraps she heard the distant clatter of an l train and then the hum of a motor car a hurdygurdy jarred into the interval of quiet  glenn has been gone over a year she mused three months over a yearand of all his strange letters this seems the strangest yet  she lived again for the thousandth time the last moments she had spent with him it had been on newyears eve 1918 they had called upon friends who were staying at the mcalpin in a suite on the twentyfirst floor overlooking broadway and when the last quarter hour of that eventful and tragic year began slowly to pass with the low swell of whistles and bells carleys friends had discreetly left her alone with her lover at the open window to watch and hear the old year out the new year in glenn kilbourne had returned from france early that fall shellshocked and gassed and otherwise incapacitated for service in the armya wreck of his former sterling self and in many unaccountable ways a stranger to her cold silent haunted by something he had made her miserable with his aloofness but as the bells began to ring out the year that had been his ruin glenn had drawn her close tenderly passionately and yet strangely too  carley look and listen he had whispered  under them stretched the great long white flare of broadway with its snowcovered length glittering under a myriad of electric lights sixth avenue swerved away to the right a less brilliant lane of blanched snow the l trains crept along like huge fireeyed serpents the hum of the ceaseless moving line of motor cars drifted upward faintly almost drowned in the rising clamor of the street broadways gay and thoughtless crowds surged to and fro from that height merely a thick stream of black figures like contending columns of ants on the march and everywhere the monstrous electric signs flared up vivid in white and red and green and dimmed and paled only to flash up again  ring out the old ring in the new carley had poignantly felt the sadness of the one the promise of the other as one by one the siren factory whistles opened up with deep hoarse bellow the clamor of the street and the ringing of the bells were lost in a volume of continuous sound that swelled on high into a magnificent roar it was the voice of a cityof a nation it was the voice of a people crying out the strife and the agony of the yearpealing forth a prayer for the future  glenn had put his lips to her ear its like the voice in my soul never would she forget the shock of that and how she had stood spellbound enveloped in the mighty volume of sound no longer discordant but full of great pregnant melody until the white ball burst upon the tower of the times building showing the bright figures 1919  the new year had not been many minutes old when glenn kilbourne had told her he was going west to try to recover his health  carley roused out of her memories to take up the letter that had so perplexed her it bore the postmark flagstaff arizona she reread it with slow pondering thoughtfulness   west fork  march 25  dear carley  it does seem my neglect in writing you is unpardonable i used to be a pretty fair correspondent but in that as in other things i have changed  one reason i have not answered sooner is because your letter was so sweet and loving that it made me feel an ungrateful and unappreciative wretch another is that this life i now lead does not induce writing i am outdoors all day and when i get back to this cabin at night i am too tired for anything but bed  your imperious questions i must answerand that must of course is a third reason why i have delayed my reply first you ask dont you love me any more as you used to frankly i do not i am sure my old love for you before i went to france was selfish thoughtless sentimental and boyish i am a man now and my love for you is different let me assure you that it has been about all left to me of what is noble and beautiful whatever the changes in me for the worse my love for you at least has grown better finer purer  and now for your second question are you coming home as soon as you are well again carley i am well i have delayed telling you this because i knew you would expect me to rush back east with the telling butthe fact is carley i am not comingjust yet i wish it were possible for me to make you understand for a long time i seem to have been frozen within you know when i came back from france i couldnt talk its almost as bad as that now yet all that i was then seems to have changed again it is only fair to you to tell you that as i feel now i hate the city i hate people and particularly i hate that dancing drinking lounging set you chase with i dont want to come east until i am over that you know suppose i never get over it well carley you can free yourself from me by one word that i could never utter i could never break our engagement during the hell i went through in the war my attachment to you saved me from moral ruin if it did not from perfect honor and fidelity this is another thing i despair of making you understand and in the chaos ive wandered through since the war my love for you was my only anchor you never guessed did you that i lived on your letters until i got well and now the fact that i might get along without them is no discredit to their charm or to you  it is all so hard to put in words carley to lie down with death and get up with death was nothing to face ones degradation was nothing but to come home an incomprehensibly changed manand to see my old life as strange as if it were the new life of another planetto try to slip into the old groovewell no words of mine can tell you how utterly impossible it was  my old job was not open to me even if i had been able to work the government that i fought for left me to starve or to die of my maladies like a dog for all it cared  i could not live on your money carley my people are poor as you know so there was nothing for me to do but to borrow a little money from my friends and to come west im glad i had the courage to come what this west is ill never try to tell you because loving the luxury and excitement and glitter of the city as you do youd think i was crazy  getting on here in my condition was as hard as trench life but now carleysomething has come to me out of the west that too i am unable to put into words maybe i can give you an inkling of it im strong enough to chop wood all day no man or woman passes my cabin in a month but i am never lonely i love these vast red canyon walls towering above me and the silence is so sweet think of the hellish din that filled my ears even nowsometimes the brook here changes its babbling murmur to the roar of war i never understood anything of the meaning of nature until i lived under these looming stone walls and whispering pines  so carley try to understand me or at least be kind you know they came very near writing gone west after my name and considering that this out west signifies for me a very fortunate difference a tremendous difference for the present ill let well enough alone  adios write soon love from  glen   carleys second reaction to the letter was a sudden upflashing desire to see her loverto go out west and find him impulses with her were rather rare and inhibited but this one made her tremble if glenn was well again he must have vastly changed from the moody stonefaced and hauntedeyed man who had so worried and distressed her he had embarrassed her too for sometimes in her home meeting young men there who had not gone into the service he had seemed to retreat into himself singularly aloof as if his world was not theirs  again with eager eyes and quivering lips she read the letter it contained words that lifted her heart her starved love greedily absorbed them in them she had excuse for any resolve that might bring glenn closer to her and she pondered over this longing to go to him  carley had the means to come and go and live as she liked she did not remember her father who had died when she was a child her mother had left her in the care of a sister and before the war they had divided their time between new york and europe the adirondacks and florida carley had gone in for red cross and relief work with more of sincerity than most of her set but she was really not used to making any decision as definite and important as that of going out west alone she had never been farther west than jersey city and her conception of the west was a hazy one of vast plains and rough mountains squalid towns cattle herds and uncouth illclad men  so she carried the letter to her aunt a rather slight woman with a kindly face and shrewd eyes and who appeared somewhat given to oldfashioned garments  aunt mary heres a letter from glenn said carley its more of a stumper than usual please read it  dear me you look upset replied the aunt mildly and adjusting her spectacles she took the letter  carley waited impatiently for the perusal conscious of inward forces coming more and more to the aid of her impulse to go west her aunt paused once to murmur how glad she was that glenn had gotten well then she read on to the close  carley thats a fine letter she said fervently do you see through it  no i dont replied carley thats why i asked you to read it  do you still love glenn as you used to before  why aunt mary exclaimed carley in surprise  excuse me carley if im blunt but the fact is young women of modern times are very different from my kind when i was a girl you havent acted as though you pined for glenn you gad around almost the same as ever  whats a girl to do protested carley  you are twentysix years old carley retorted aunt mary  suppose i am im as youngas i ever was  well lets not argue about modern girls and modern times we never get anywhere returned her aunt kindly but i can tell you something of what glenn kilbourne means in that letterif you want to hear it  i doindeed  the war did something horrible to glenn aside from wrecking his health shellshock they said i dont understand that out of his mind they said but that never was true glenn was as sane as i am and my dear thats pretty sane ill have you remember but he must have suffered some terrible blight to his spiritsome blunting of his soul for months after he returned he walked as one in a trance then came a change he grew restless perhaps that change was for the better at least it showed hed roused glenn saw you and your friends and the life you lead and all the present with eyes from which the scales had dropped he saw what was wrong he never said so to me but i knew it it wasnt only to get well that he went west it was to get away and carley burch if your happiness depends on him you had better be up and doingor youll lose him  aunt mary gasped carley  i mean it that letter shows how near he came to the valley of the shadowand how he has become a man if i were you id go out west surely there must be a place where it would be all right for you to stay  oh yes replied carley eagerly glenn wrote me there was a lodge where people went in nice weatherright down in the canyon not far from his place then of course the townflagstaffisnt far aunt mary i think ill go  i would youre certainly wasting your time here  but i could only go for a visit rejoined carley thoughtfully a month perhaps six weeks if i could stand it  seems to me if you can stand new york you could stand that place said aunt mary dryly  the idea of staying away from new york any length of timewhy i couldnt do it i but i can stay out there long enough to bring glenn back with me  that may take you longer than you think replied her aunt with a gleam in her shrewd eyes if you want my advice you will surprise glenn dont write himdont give him a chance towell to suggest courteously that youd better not come just yet i dont like his words just yet  auntie yourerathermore than blunt said carley divided between resentment and amaze glenn would be simply wild to have me come  maybe he would has he ever asked you  noocome to think of it he hasnt replied carley reluctantly aunt mary you hurt my feelings  well child im glad to learn your feelings are hurt returned the aunt im sure carley that underneath all thisthis blase ultra something youve acquired theres a real heart only you must hurry and listen to itor  or what queried carley  aunt mary shook her gray head sagely never mind what carley id like your idea of the most significant thing in glenns letter  why his love for me of course replied carley  naturally you think that but i dont what struck me most were his words out of the west carley youd do well to ponder over them  i will rejoined carley positively ill do more ill go out to his wonderful west and see what he meant by them  carley burch possessed in full degree the prevailing modern craze for speed she loved a motorcar ride at sixty miles an hour along a smooth straight road or better on the level seashore of ormond where on moonlight nights the white blanched sand seemed to flash toward her therefore quite to her taste was the twentieth century limited which was hurtling her on the way to chicago the unceasingly smooth and even rush of the train satisfied something in her an old lady sitting in an adjoining seat with a companion amused carley by the remark i wish we didnt go so fast people nowadays havent time to draw a comfortable breath suppose we should run off the track  carley had no fear of express trains or motor cars or transatlantic liners in fact she prided herself in not being afraid of anything but she wondered if this was not the false courage of association with a crowd before this enterprise at hand she could not remember anything she had undertaken alone her thrills seemed to be in abeyance to the end of her journey that night her sleep was permeated with the steady low whirring of the wheels once roused by a jerk she lay awake in the darkness while the thought came to her that she and all her fellow passengers were really at the mercy of the engineer who was he and did he stand at his throttle keen and vigilant thinking of the lives intrusted to him such thoughts vaguely annoyed carley and she dismissed them  a long halfday wait in chicago was a tedious preliminary to the second part of her journey but at last she found herself aboard the california limited and went to bed with a relief quite a stranger to her the glare of the sun under the curtain awakened her propped up on her pillows she looked out at apparently endless green fields or pastures dotted now and then with little farmhouses and treeskirted villages this country she thought must be the prairie land she remembered lay west of the mississippi  later in the dining car the steward smilingly answered her question this is kansas and those green fields out there are the wheat that feeds the nation  carley was not impressed the color of the short wheat appeared soft and rich and the boundless fields stretched away monotonously she had not known there was so much flat land in the world and she imagined it might be a fine country for automobile roads when she got back to her seat she drew the blinds down and read her magazines then tiring of that she went back to the observation car carley was accustomed to attracting attention and did not resent it unless she was annoyed the train evidently had a full complement of passengers who as far as carley could see were people not of her station in life the glare from the many windows and the rather crass interest of several men drove her back to her own section there she discovered that some one had drawn up her window shades carley promptly pulled them down and settled herself comfortably then she heard a woman speak not particularly low i thought people traveled west to see the country and a man replied rather dryly wal not always his companion went on if that girl was mine id let down her skirt the man laughed and replied martha youre shore behind the times look at the pictures in the magazines  such remarks amused carley and later she took advantage of an opportunity to notice her neighbors they appeared a rather quaint old couple reminding her of the natives of country towns in the adirondacks she was not amused however when another of her woman neighbors speaking low referred to her as a lunger carley appreciated the fact that she was pale but she assured herself that there ended any possible resemblance she might have to a consumptive and she was somewhat pleased to hear this womans male companion forcibly voice her own convictions in fact he was nothing if not admiring  kansas was interminably long to carley and she went to sleep before riding out of it next morning she found herself looking out at the rough gray and black land of new mexico she searched the horizon for mountains but there did not appear to be any she received a vague slowdawning impression that was hard to define she did not like the country though that was not the impression which eluded her bare gray flats low scrubfringed hills bleak cliffs jumble after jumble of rocks and occasionally a long vista down a valley somehow compellingthese passed before her gaze until she tired of them where was the west glenn had written about one thing seemed sure and it was that every mile of this crude country brought her nearer to him this recurring thought gave carley all the pleasure she had felt so far in this endless ride it struck her that england or france could be dropped down into new mexico and scarcely noticed  by and by the sun grew hot the train wound slowly and creakingly upgrade the car became full of dust all of which was disagreeable to carley she dozed on her pillow for hours until she was stirred by a passenger crying out delightedly look indians  carley looked not without interest as a child she had read about indians and memory returned images both colorful and romantic from the car window she espied dusty flat barrens low squat mud houses and queerlooking little people children naked or extremely ragged and dirty women in loose garments with flares of red and men in white mans garb slovenly and motley all these strange individuals stared apathetically as the train slowly passed  indians muttered carley incredulously well if they are the noble red people my illusions are dispelled she did not look out of the window again not even when the brakeman called out the remarkable name of albuquerque  next day carleys languid attention quickened to the name of arizona and to the frowning red walls of rock and to the vast rolling stretches of cedardotted land nevertheless it affronted her this was no country for people to live in and so far as she could see it was indeed uninhabited her sensations were not however limited to sight she became aware of unfamiliar disturbing little shocks or vibrations in her ear drums and after that a disagreeable bleeding of the nose the porter told her this was owing to the altitude thus one thing and another kept carley most of the time away from the window so that she really saw very little of the country from what she had seen she drew the conviction that she had not missed much at sunset she deliberately gazed out to discover what an arizona sunset was like just a pale yellow flare she had seen better than that above the palisades not until reaching winslow did she realize how near she was to her journeys end and that she would arrive at flagstaff after dark she grew conscious of nervousness suppose flagstaff were like these other queer little towns  not only once but several times before the train slowed down for her destination did carley wish she had sent glenn word to meet her and when presently she found herself standing out in the dark cold windy night before a dimlit railroad station she more than regretted her decision to surprise glenn but that was too late and she must make the best of her poor judgment  men were passing to and fro on the platform some of whom appeared to be very dark of skin and eye and were probably mexicans at length an expressman approached carley soliciting patronage he took her bags and depositing them in a wagon he pointed up the wide street one block up an turn hotel wetherford then he drove off carley followed carrying her small satchel a cold wind driving the dust stung her face as she crossed the street to a high sidewalk that extended along the block there were lights in the stores and on the corners yet she seemed impressed by a dark cold windy bigness many people mostly men were passing up and down and there were motor cars everywhere no one paid any attention to her gaining the corner of the block she turned and was relieved to see the hotel sign as she entered the lobby a clicking of pool balls and the discordant rasp of a phonograph assailed her ears the expressman set down her bags and left carley standing there the clerk or proprietor was talking from behind his desk to several men and there were loungers in the lobby the air was thick with tobacco smoke no one paid any attention to carley until at length she stepped up to the desk and interrupted the conversation there  is this a hotel she queried brusquely  the shirtsleeved individual leisurely turned and replied yes maam  and carley said no one would recognize it by the courtesy shown i have been standing here waiting to register  with the same leisurely case and a cool laconic stare the clerk turned the book toward her reckon people round here ask for what they want  carley made no further comment she assuredly recognized that what she had been accustomed to could not be expected out here what she most wished to do at the moment was to get close to the big open grate where a cheery redandgold fire cracked it was necessary however to follow the clerk he assigned her to a small drab room which contained a bed a bureau and a stationary washstand with one spigot there was also a chair while carley removed her coat and hat the clerk went downstairs for the rest of her luggage upon his return carley learned that a stage left the hotel for oak creek canyon at nine oclock next morning and this cheered her so much that she faced the strange sense of loneliness and discomfort with something of fortitude there was no heat in the room and no hot water when carley squeezed the spigot handle there burst forth a torrent of water that spouted up out of the washbasin to deluge her it was colder than any ice water she had ever felt it was piercingly cold hard upon the surprise and shock carley suffered a flash of temper but then the humor of it struck her and she had to laugh  serves you rightyou spoiled doll of luxury she mocked this is out west shiver and wait on yourself  never before had she undressed so swiftly nor felt grateful for thick woollen blankets on a hard bed gradually she grew warm the blackness too seemed rather comforting  im only twenty miles from glenn she whispered how strange i wonder will he be glad she felt a sweet glowing assurance of that sleep did not come readily excitement had laid hold of her nerves and for a long time she lay awake after a while the chug of motor cars the click of pool balls the murmur of low voices all ceased then she heard a sound of wind outside an intermittent low moaning new to her ears and somehow pleasant another sound greeted herthe musical clanging of a clock that struck the quarters of the hour some time late sleep claimed her  upon awakening she found she had overslept necessitating haste upon her part as to that the temperature of the room did not admit of leisurely dressing she had no adequate name for the feeling of the water and her fingers grew so numb that she made what she considered a disgraceful matter of her attire  downstairs in the lobby another cheerful red fire burned in the grate how perfectly satisfying was an open fireplace she thrust her numb hands almost into the blaze and simply shook with the tingling pain that slowly warmed out of them the lobby was deserted a sign directed her to a dining room in the basement where of the ham and eggs and strong coffee she managed to partake a little then she went upstairs into the lobby and out into the street  a cold piercing air seemed to blow right through her walking to the near corner she paused to look around down the main street flowed a leisurely stream of pedestrians horses cars extending between two blocks of low buildings across from where she stood lay a vacant lot beyond which began a line of neat oddly constructed houses evidently residences of the town and then lifting her gaze instinctively drawn by something obstructing the sky line she was suddenly struck with surprise and delight  oh how perfectly splendid she burst out  two magnificent mountains loomed right over her sloping up with majestic sweep of green and black timber to a ragged treefringed snow area that swept up cleaner and whiter at last to lift pure glistening peaks noble and sharp and sunriseflushed against the blue  carley had climbed mont blanc and she had seen the matterhorn but they had never struck such amaze and admiration from her as these twin peaks of her native land  what mountains are those she asked a passerby  san francisco peaks maam replied the man  why they cant be over a mile away she said  eighteen miles maam he returned with a grin shore this arizonie air is deceivin  how strange murmured carley its not that way in the adirondacks  she was still gazing upward when a man approached her and said the stage for oak creek canyon would soon be ready to start and he wanted to know if her baggage was ready carley hurried back to her room to pack  she had expected the stage would be a motor bus or at least a large touring car but it turned out to be a twoseated vehicle drawn by a team of ragged horses the driver was a little wizenfaced man of doubtful years and he did not appear obviously susceptible to the importance of his passenger there was considerable freight to be hauled besides carleys luggage but evidently she was the only passenger  reckon its goin to be a bad day said the driver these april days high up on the desert are windy an cold mebbe itll snow too them clouds hangin around the peaks aint very promisin now miss havent you a heavier coat or somethin  no i have not replied carley ill have to stand it did you say this was desert  i shore did wal theres a hoss blanket under the seat an you can have that he replied and climbing to the seat in front of carley he took up the reins and started the horses off at a trot  at the first turning carley became specifically acquainted with the drivers meaning of a bad day a gust of wind raw and penetrating laden with dust and stinging sand swept full in her face it came so suddenly that she was scarcely quick enough to close her eyes it took considerable clumsy effort on her part with a handkerchief aided by relieving tears to clear her sight again thus uncomfortably carley found herself launched on the last lap of her journey  all before her and alongside lay the squalid environs of the town looked back at with the peaks rising behind it was not unpicturesque but the hard road with its sheets of flying dust the bleak railroad yards the round pens she took for cattle corrals and the sordid debris littering the approach to a huge sawmillthese were offensive in carleys sight from a tall domelike stack rose a yellowish smoke that spread overhead adding to the lowering aspect of the sky beyond the sawmill extended the open country sloping somewhat roughly and evidently once a forest but now a hideous bare slash with ghastly burned stems of trees still standing and myriads of stumps attesting to denudation  the bleak road wound away to the southwest and from this direction came the gusty wind it did not blow regularly so that carley could be on her guard it lulled now and then permitting her to look about and then suddenly again whipping dust into her face the smell of the dust was as unpleasant as the sting it made her nostrils smart it was penetrating and a little more of it would have been suffocating and as a leaden gray bank of broken clouds rolled up the wind grew stronger and the air colder chilled before carley now became thoroughly cold  there appeared to be no end to the devastated forest land and the farther she rode the more barren and sordid grew the landscape carley forgot about the impressive mountains behind her and as the ride wore into hours such was her discomfort and disillusion that she forgot about glenn kilbourne she did not reach the point of regretting her adventure but she grew mightily unhappy now and then she espied dilapidated log cabins and surroundings even more squalid than the ruined forest what wretched abodes could it be possible that people had lived in them she imagined men had but hardly women and children somewhere she had forgotten an idea that women and children were extremely scarce in the west  straggling bits of forestyellow pines the driver called the treesbegan to encroach upon the burnedover and arid barren land to carley these groves by reason of contrast and proof of what once was only rendered the landscape more forlorn and dreary why had these miles and miles of forest been cut by money grubbers she supposed the same as were devastating the adirondacks presently when the driver had to halt to repair or adjust something wrong with the harness carley was grateful for a respite from cold inaction she got out and walked sleet began to fall and when she resumed her seat in the vehicle she asked the driver for the blanket to cover her the smell of this horse blanket was less endurable than the cold carley huddled down into a state of apathetic misery already she had enough of the west  but the sleet storm passed the clouds broke the sun shone through greatly mitigating her discomfort by and by the road led into a section of real forest unspoiled in any degree carley saw large gray squirrels with tufted ears and white bushy tails presently the driver pointed out a flock of huge birds which carley on second glance recognized as turkeys only these were sleek and glossy with flecks of bronze and black and white quite different from turkeys back east there must be a farm near said carley gazing about  no maam thems wild turkeys replied the driver an shore the best eatin you ever had in your life  a little while afterwards as they were emerging from the woodland into more denuded country he pointed out to carley a herd of gray whiterumped animals that she took to be sheep  an thems antelope he said once this desert was overrun by antelope then they nearly disappeared an now theyre increasin again  more barren country more bad weather and especially an exceedingly rough road reduced carley to her former state of dejection the jolting over roots and rocks and ruts was worse than uncomfortable she had to hold on to the seat to keep from being thrown out the horses did not appreciably change their gait for rough sections of the road then a more severe jolt brought carleys knee in violent contact with an iron bolt on the forward seat and it hurt her so acutely that she had to bite her lips to keep from screaming a smoother stretch of road did not come any too soon for her  it led into forest again and carley soon became aware that they had at last left the cut and burnedover district of timberland behind a cold wind moaned through the treetops and set the drops of water pattering down upon her it lashed her wet face carley closed her eyes and sagged in her seat mostly oblivious to the passing scenery the girls will never believe this of me she soliloquized and indeed she was amazed at herself then thought of glenn strengthened her it did not really matter what she suffered on the way to him only she was disgusted at her lack of stamina and her appalling sensitiveness to discomfort  wal hyars oak creek canyon called the driver  carley rousing out of her weary preoccupation opened her eyes to see that the driver had halted at a turn of the road where apparently it descended a fearful declivity  the very forestfringed earth seemed to have opened into a deep abyss ribbed by red rock walls and choked by steep mats of green timber the chasm was a vshaped split and so deep that looking downward sent at once a chill and a shudder over carley at that point it appeared narrow and ended in a box in the other direction it widened and deepened and stretched farther on between tremendous walls of red and split its winding floor of green with glimpses of a gleaming creek bowlderstrewn and ridged by white rapids a low mellow roar of rushing waters floated up to carleys ears what a wild lonely terrible place could glenn possibly live down there in that ragged rent in the earth it frightened herthe sheer sudden plunge of it from the heights far down the gorge a purple light shone on the forested floor and on the moment the sun burst through the clouds and sent a golden blaze down into the depths transforming them incalculably the great cliffs turned gold the creek changed to glancing silver the green of trees vividly freshened and in the clefts rays of sunlight burned into the blue shadows carley had never gazed upon a scene like this hostile and prejudiced she yet felt wrung from her an acknowledgment of beauty and grandeur but wild violent savage not livable this insulated rift in the crust of the earth was a gigantic burrow for beasts perhaps for outlawed mennot for a civilized personnot for glenn kilbourne  dont be scart maam spoke up the driver its safe if youre careful an ive druv this manys the time  carleys heartbeats thumped at her side rather denying her taunted assurance of fearlessness then the rickety vehicle started down at an angle that forced her to cling to her seat    chapter ii  carley clutching her support with abated breath and prickling skin gazed in fascinated suspense over the rim of the gorge sometimes the wheels on that side of the vehicle passed within a few inches of the edge the brakes squeaked the wheels slid and she could hear the scrape of the ironshod hoofs of the horses as they held back stiff legged obedient to the wary call of the driver  the first hundred yards of that steep road cut out of the cliff appeared to be the worst it began to widen with descents less precipitous tips of trees rose level with her gaze obstructing sight of the blue depths then brush appeared on each side of the road gradually carleys strain relaxed and also the muscular contraction by which she had braced herself in the seat the horses began to trot again the wheels rattled the road wound around abrupt corners and soon the green and red wall of the opposite side of the canyon loomed close low roar of running water rose to carleys ears when at length she looked out instead of down she could see nothing but a mass of green foliage crossed by tree trunks and branches of brown and gray then the vehicle bowled under dark cool shade into a tunnel with mossy wet cliff on one side and closestanding trees on the other  reckon were all right now onless we meet somebody comin up declared the driver  carley relaxed she drew a deep breath of relief she had her first faint intimation that perhaps her extensive experience of motor cars express trains transatlantic liners and even a little of airplanes did not range over the whole of adventurous life she was likely to meet something entirely new and striking out here in the west  the murmur of falling water sounded closer presently carley saw that the road turned at the notch in the canyon and crossed a clear swift stream here were huge mossy boulders and red walls covered by lichens and the air appeared dim and moist and full of mellow hollow roar beyond this crossing the road descended the west side of the canyon drawing away and higher from the creek huge trees the like of which carley had never seen began to stand majestically up out of the gorge dwarfing the maples and whitespotted sycamores the driver called these great trees yellow pines  at last the road led down from the steep slope to the floor of the canyon what from far above had appeared only a green timberchoked cleft proved from close relation to be a wide winding valley tip and down densely forested for the most part yet having open glades and bisected from wall to wall by the creek every quarter of a mile or so the road crossed the stream and at these fords carley again held on desperately and gazed out dubiously for the creek was deep swift and full of bowlders neither driver nor horses appeared to mind obstacles carley was splashed and jolted not inconsiderably they passed through groves of oak trees from which the creek manifestly derived its name and under gleaming walls cold wet gloomy and silent and between lines of solemn widespreading pines carley saw deep still green pools eddying under huge massed jumble of cliffs and stretches of white water and then high above the treetops a wild line of canyon rim cold against the sky she felt shut in from the world lost in an unscalable rut of the earth again the sunlight had failed and the gray gloom of the canyon oppressed her it struck carley as singular that she could not help being affected by mere weather mere heights and depths mere rock walls and pine trees and rushing water for really what had these to do with her these were only physical things that she was passing nevertheless although she resisted sensation she was more and more shot through and through with the wildness and savageness of this canyon  a sharp turn of the road to the right disclosed a slope down the creek across which showed orchards and fields and a cottage nestling at the base of the wall the ford at this crossing gave carley more concern than any that had been passed for there was greater volume and depth of water one of the horses slipped on the rocks plunged up and on with great splash they crossed however without more mishap to carley than further acquaintance with this iciest of waters from this point the driver turned back along the creek passed between orchards and fields and drove along the base of the red wall to come suddenly upon a large rustic house that had been hidden from carleys sight it sat almost against the stone cliff from which poured a white foamy sheet of water the house was built of slabs with the bark on and it had a lower and upper porch running all around at least as far as the cliff green growths from the rock wall overhung the upper porch a column of blue smoke curled lazily upward from a stone chimney on one of the porch posts hung a sign with rude lettering lolomi lodge  hey josh did you fetch the flour called a womans voice from inside  hullo i reckon i didnt forgit nothin replied the man as he got down an say mrs hutter hyars a young lady from noo yorrk  that latter speech of the drivers brought mrs hutter out on the porch flo come here she called to some one evidently near at hand and then she smilingly greeted carley  get down an come in miss she said im sure glad to see you  carley being stiff and cold did not very gracefully disengage herself from the high muddy wheel and step when she mounted to the porch she saw that mrs hutter was a woman of middle age rather stout with strong face full of fine wavy lines and kind dark eyes  im miss burch said carley  youre the girl whose picture glenn kilbourne has over his fireplace declared the woman heartily im sure glad to meet you an my daughter flo will be too  that about her picture pleased and warmed carley yes im glenn kilbournes fiancee ive come west to surprise him is he here isis he well  fine i saw him yesterday hes changed a great deal from what he was at first most all the last few months i reckon you wont know him but youre wet an cold an you look fagged come right in to the fire  thank you im all right returned carley  at the doorway they encountered a girl of lithe and robust figure quick in her movements carley was swift to see the youth and grace of her and then a face that struck carley as neither pretty nor beautiful but still wonderfully attractive  flo heres miss burch burst out mrs hutter with cheerful importance glenn kilbournes girl come all the way from new york to surprise him  oh carley im shore happy to meet you said the girl in a voice of slow drawling richness i know you glenn has told me all about you  if this greeting sweet and warm as it seemed was a shock to carley she gave no sign but as she murmured something in reply she looked with all a womans keenness into the face before her flo hutter had a fair skin generously freckled a mouth and chin too firmly cut to suggest a softer feminine beauty and eyes of clear light hazel penetrating frank fearless her hair was very abundant almost silvergold in color and it was either rebellious or showed lack of care carley liked the girls looks and liked the sincerity of her greeting but instinctively she reacted antagonistically because of the frank suggestion of intimacy with glenn  but for that she would have been spontaneous and friendly rather than restrained  they ushered carley into a big living room and up to a fire of blazing logs where they helped divest her of the wet wraps and all the time they talked in the solicitous way natural to women who were kind and unused to many visitors then mrs hutter bustled off to make a cup of hot coffee while flo talked  well shore give you the nicest roomwith a sleeping porch right under the cliff where the water falls itll sing you to sleep of course you neednt use the bed outdoors until its warmer spring is late here you know and well have nasty weather yet you really happened on oak creek at its least attractive season but then its alwayswell just oak creek youll come to know  i dare say ill remember my first sight of it and the ride down that cliff road said carley with a wan smile  oh thats nothing to what youll see and do returned flo knowingly weve had eastern tenderfeet here before and never was there a one of them who didnt come to love arizona  tenderfoot it hadnt occurred to me but of course murmured carley  then mrs hutter returned carrying a tray which she set upon a chair and drew to carleys side eat an drink she said as if these actions were the cardinally important ones of life flo you carry her bags up to that west room we always give to some particular person we want to love lolomi next she threw sticks of wood upon the fire making it crackle and blaze then seated herself near carley and beamed upon her  youll not mind if we call you carley she asked eagerly  oh indeed no iid like it returned carley made to feel friendly and at home in spite of herself  you see its not as if you were just a stranger went on mrs hutter tomthats flos fathertook a likin to glenn kilbourne when he first came to oak creek over a year ago i wonder if you all know how sick that soldier boy was well he lay on his back for two solid weeksin the room were givin you an i for one didnt think hed ever get up but he did an he got better an after a while he went to work for tom then six months an more ago he invested in the sheep business with tom he lived with us until he built his cabin up west fork he an flo have run together a good deal an naturally he told her about you so you see youre not a stranger an we want you to feel youre with friends  i thank you mrs hutter replied carley feelingly i never could thank you enough for being good to glenn i did not know he was soso sick at first he wrote but seldom  reckon he never wrote you or told you what he did in the war declared mrs hutter  indeed he never did  well ill tell you some day for tom found out all about him got some of it from a soldier who came to flagstaff for lung trouble hed been in the same company with glenn we didnt know this boys name while he was in flagstaff but later tom found out john henderson he was only twentytwo a fine lad an he died in phoenix we tried to get him out here but the boy wouldnt live on charity he was always expectin moneya war bonus whatever that was it didnt come he was a clerk at the el tovar for a while then he came to flagstaff but it was too cold an he stayed there too long  too bad rejoined carley thoughtfully this information as to the suffering of american soldiers had augmented during the last few months and seemed to possess strange poignant power to depress carley always she had turned away from the unpleasant and the misery of unfortunates was as disturbing almost as direct contact with disease and squalor but it had begun to dawn upon carley that there might occur circumstances of life in every way affronting her comfort and happiness which it would be impossible to turn her back upon  at this juncture flo returned to the room and again carley was struck with the girls singular freedom of movement and the sense of sure poise and joy that seemed to emanate from her presence  ive made a fire in your little stove she said theres water heating now wont you come up and change those traveling clothes youll want to fix up for glenn wont you  carley had to smile at that this girl indeed was frank and unsophisticated and somehow refreshing carley rose  you are both very good to receive me as a friend she said i hope i shall not disappoint you yes i do want to improve my appearance before glenn sees me is there any way i can send word to himby someone who has not seen me  there shore is ill send charley one of our hired boys  thank you then tell him to say there is a lady here from new york to see him and it is very important  flo hutter clapped her hands and laughed with glee her gladness gave carley a little twinge of conscience jealously was an unjust and stifling thing  carley was conducted up a broad stairway and along a boarded hallway to a room that opened out on the porch a steady low murmur of falling water assailed her ears through the open door she saw across the porch to a white tumbling lacy veil of water falling leaping changing so close that it seemed to touch the heavy pole railing of the porch  this room resembled a tent the sides were of canvas it had no ceiling but the roughhewn shingles of the roof of the house sloped down closely the furniture was home made an indian rug covered the floor the bed with its woolly clean blankets and the white pillows looked inviting  is this where glenn laywhen he was sick queried carley  yes replied flo gravely and a shadow darkened her eyes i ought to tell you all about it i will some day but you must not be made unhappy now glenn nearly died here mother or i never left his sidefor a while therewhen life was so bad  she showed carley how to open the little stove and put the short billets of wood inside and work the damper and cautioning her to keep an eye on it so that it would not get too hot she left carley to herself  carley found herself in an unfamiliar mood there came a leap of her heart every time she thought of the meeting with glenn so soon now to be but it was not that which was unfamiliar she seemed to have a difficult approach to undefined and unusual thoughts all this was so different from her regular life besides she was tired but these explanations did not suffice there was a pang in her breast which must owe its origin to the fact that glenn kilbourne had been ill in this little room and some other girl than carley burch had nursed him am i jealous she whispered no but she knew in her heart that she lied a woman could no more help being jealous under such circumstances than she could help the beat and throb of her blood nevertheless carley was glad flo hutter had been there and always she would be grateful to her for that kindness  carley disrobed and donning her dressing gown she unpacked her bags and hung her things upon pegs under the curtained shelves then she lay down to rest with no intention of slumber but there was a strange magic in the fragrance of the room like the piny tang outdoors and in the feel of the bed and especially in the low dreamy hum and murmur of the waterfall she fell asleep when she awakened it was five oclock the fire in the stove was out but the water was still warm she bathed and dressed not without care yet as swiftly as was her habit at home and she wore white because glenn had always liked her best in white but it was assuredly not a gown to wear in a country house where draughts of cold air filled the unheated rooms and halls so she threw round her a warm sweatershawl with colorful bars becoming to her dark eyes and hair  all the time that she dressed and thought her very being seemed to be permeated by that soft murmuring sound of falling water no moment of waking life there at lolomi lodge or perhaps of slumber hours could be wholly free of that sound it vaguely tormented carley yet was not uncomfortable she went out upon the porch the small alcove space held a bed and a rustic chair above her the peeled poles of the roof descended to within a few feet of her head she had to lean over the rail of the porch to look up the green and red rock wall sheered ponderously near the waterfall showed first at the notch of a fissure where the cliff split and down over smooth places the water gleamed to narrow in a crack with little drops and suddenly to leap into a thin white sheet  out from the porch the view was restricted to glimpses between the pines and beyond to the opposite wall of the canyon how shutin how walled in this home  in summer it might be good to spend a couple of weeks here soliloquized carley but to live here heavens a person might as well be buried  heavy footsteps upon the porch below accompanied by a mans voice quickened carleys pulse did they belong to glenn after a strained second she decided not nevertheless the acceleration of her blood and an unwonted glow of excitement long a stranger to her persisted as she left the porch and entered the boarded hall how gray and barnlike this upper part of the house from the head of the stairway however the big living room presented a cheerful contrast there were warm colors some comfortable rockers a lamp that shed a bright light and an open fire which alone would have dispelled the raw gloom of the day  a large man in corduroys and top boots advanced to meet carley he had a cleanshaven face that might have been hard and stern but for his smile and one look into his eyes revealed their resemblance to flos  im tom hutter an im shore glad to welcome you to lolomi miss carley he said his voice was deep and slow there were ease and force in his presence and the grip he gave carleys hand was that of a man who made no distinction in handshaking carley quick in her perceptions instantly liked him and sensed in him a strong personality she greeted him in turn and expressed her thanks for his goodness to glenn naturally carley expected him to say something about her fiance but he did not  well miss carley if you dont mind ill say youre prettier than your picture said hutter an that is shore sayin a lot all the sheep herders in the country have taken a peep at your picture without permission you understand  im greatly flattered laughed carley  were glad youve come replied hutter simply i just got back from the east myself chicago an kansas city i came to arizona from illinois over thirty years ago an this was my first trip since reckon ive not got back my breath yet times have changed miss carley times an people  mrs hutter bustled in from the kitchen where manifestly she had been importantly engaged for the lands sakes she exclaimed fervently as she threw up her hands at sight of carley her expression was indeed a compliment but there was a suggestion of shock in it then flo came in she wore a simple gray gown that reached the top of her high shoes  carley dont mind mother said flo she means your dress is lovely which is my say too but listen i just saw glenn comin up the road  carley ran to the open door with more haste than dignity she saw a tall man striding along something about him appeared familiar it was his walkan erect swift carriage with a swing of the march still visible she recognized glenn and all within her seemed to become unstable she watched him cross the road face the house how changed nothis was not glenn kilbourne this was a bronzed man wide of shoulder roughly garbed heavy limbed quite different from the glenn she remembered he mounted the porch steps and carley still unseen herself saw his face yesglenn hot blood seemed to be tingling liberated in her veins wheeling away she backed against the wall behind the door and held up a warning finger to flo who stood nearest strange and disturbing then to see something in flo hutters eyes that could be read by a woman in only one way  a tall form darkened the doorway it strode in and halted  flowhowhere he began breathlessly  his voice so well remembered yet deeper huskier fell upon carleys ears as something unconsciously longed for his frame had so filled out that she did not recognize it his face too had unbelievably changednot in the regularity of feature that had been its chief charm but in contour of cheek and vanishing of pallid hue and tragic line carleys heart swelled with joy beyond all else she had hoped to see the sad fixed hopelessness the havoc gone from his face therefore the restraint and nonchalance upon which carley prided herself sustained eclipse  glenn lookwhoshere she called in voice she could not have steadied to save her life this meeting was more than she had anticipated  glenn whirled with an inarticulate cry he saw carley thenno matter how unreasonable or exacting had been carleys longings they were satisfied  you he cried and leaped at her with radiant face  carley not only did not care about the spectators of this meeting but forgot them utterly more than the joy of seeing glenn more than the allsatisfying assurance to her womans heart that she was still beloved welled up a deep strange profound something that shook her to her depths it was beyond selfishness it was gratitude to god and to the west that had restored him  carley i couldnt believe it was you he declared releasing her from his close embrace yet still holding her  yes glennits iall youve left of me she replied tremulously and she sought with unsteady hands to put up her dishevelled hair youyou big sheep herder you goliath  i never was so knocked off my pins he said a lady to see mefrom new york of course it had to be you but i couldnt believe carley you were good to come  somehow the soft warm look of his dark eyes hurt her new and strange indeed it was to her as were other things about him why had she not come west sooner she disengaged herself from his hold and moved away striving for the composure habitual with her flo hutter was standing before the fire looking down mrs hutter beamed upon carley  now lets have supper she said  reckon miss carley cant eat now after that hug glenn gave her drawled tom hutter i was some worried you see glenn has gained seventy pounds in six months an he doesnt know his strength  seventy pounds exclaimed carley gayly i thought it was more  carley you must excuse my violence said glenn ive been hugging sheep that is when i shear a sheep i have to hold him  they all laughed and so the moment of readjustment passed presently carley found herself sitting at table directly across from flo a pearly whiteness was slowly warming out of the girls face her frank clear eyes met carleys and they had nothing to hide carleys first requisite for character in a woman was that she be a thoroughbred she lacked it often enough herself to admire it greatly in another woman and that moment saw a birth of respect and sincere liking in her for this western girl if flo hutter ever was a rival she would be an honest one  not long after supper tom hutter winked at carley and said he reckoned on general principles it was his hunch to go to bed mrs hutter suddenly discovered tasks to perform elsewhere and flo said in her cool sweet drawl somehow audacious and tantalizing shore you two will want to spoon  now flo eastern girls are no longer oldfashioned enough for that declared glenn  too bad reckon i cant see how love could ever be oldfashioned good night glenn good night carley  flo stood an instant at the foot of the dark stairway where the light from the lamp fell upon her face it seemed sweet and earnest to carley it expressed unconscious longing but no envy then she ran up the stairs to disappear  glenn is that girl in love with you asked carley bluntly  to her amaze glenn laughed when had she heard him laugh it thrilled her yet nettled her a little  if that isnt like you he ejaculated your very first words after we are left alone it brings back the east carley  probably recall to memory will be good for you returned carley but tell me is she in love with you  why no certainly not replied glenn anyway how could i answer such a question it just made me laugh thats all  humph i can remember when you were not above making love to a pretty girl you certainly had me worn to a frazzlebefore we became engaged said carley  old times how long ago they seem carley its sure wonderful to see you  how do you like my gown asked carley pirouetting for his benefit  well what little there is of it is beautiful he replied with a slow smile i always liked you best in white did you remember  yes i got the gown for you and ill never wear it except for you  same old coquettesame old eternal feminine he said half sadly you know when you look stunning but carley the cut of thator rather the abbreviation of itinclines me to think that style for womens clothes has not changed for the better in fact its worse than two years ago in paris and later in new york where will you women draw the line  women are slaves to the prevailing mode rejoined carley i dont imagine women who dress would ever draw a line if fashion went on dictating  but would they care so muchif they had to workplenty of workand children inquired glenn wistfully  glenn work and children for modern women why you are dreaming said carley with a laugh  she saw him gaze thoughtfully into the glowing embers of the fire and as she watched him her quick intuition grasped a subtle change in his mood it brought a sternness to his face she could hardly realize she was looking at the glenn kilbourne of old  come close to the fire he said and pulled up a chair for her then he threw more wood upon the red coals you must be careful not to catch cold out here the altitude makes a cold dangerous and that gown is no protection  glenn one chair used to be enough for us she said archly standing beside him  but he did not respond to her hint and a little affronted she accepted the proffered chair then he began to ask questions rapidly he was eager for news from homefrom his peoplefrom old friends however he did not inquire of carley about her friends she talked unremittingly for an hour before she satisfied his hunger but when her turn came to ask questions she found him reticent  he had fallen upon rather hard days at first out here in the west then his health had begun to improve and as soon as he was able to work his condition rapidly changed for the better and now he was getting along pretty well carley felt hurt at his apparent disinclination to confide in her the strong cast of his face as if it had been chiseled in bronze the stern set of his lips and the jaw that protruded lean and square cut the quiet masked light of his eyes the coarse roughness of his brown hands mute evidence of strenuous laborsthese all gave a different impression from his brief remarks about himself lastly there was a little gray in the lightbrown hair over his temples glenn was only twentyseven yet he looked ten years older studying him so with the memory of earlier years in her mind she was forced to admit that she liked him infinitely more as he was now he seemed proven something had made him a man had it been his love for her or the army service or the war in france or the struggle for life and health afterwards or had it been this rugged uncouth west carley felt insidious jealousy of this last possibility she feared this west she was going to hate it she had womanly intuition enough to see in flo hutter a girl somehow to be reckoned with still carley would not acknowledge to herself that his simple unsophisticated western girl could possibly be a rival carley did not need to consider the fact that she had been spoiled by the attention of men it was not her vanity that precluded flo hutter as a rival  gradually the conversation drew to a lapse and it suited carley to let it be so she watched glenn as he gazed thoughtfully into the amber depths of the fire what was going on in his mind carleys old perplexity suddenly had rebirth and with it came an unfamiliar fear which she could not smother every moment that she sat there beside glenn she was realizing more and more a yearning passionate love for him the unmistakable manifestation of his joy at sight of her the strong almost rude expression of his love had called to some responsive but hitherto unplumbed deeps of her if it had not been for these undeniable facts carley would have been panicstricken they reassured her yet only made her state of mind more dissatisfied  carley do you still go in for dancing glenn asked presently with his thoughtful eyes turning to her  of course i like dancing and its about all the exercise i get she replied  have the dances changedagain  its the music perhaps that changes the dancing jazz is becoming popular and about all the crowd dances now is an infinite variation of foxtrot  no waltzing  i dont believe i waltzed once this winter  jazz thats a sort of tinpanning jiggly stuff isnt it  glenn its the fever of the public pulse replied carley the graceful waltz like the stately minuet flourished back in the days when people rested rather than raced  mores the pity said glenn then after a moment in which his gaze returned to the fire he inquired rather too casually does morrison still chase after you  glenn im neither oldnor married she replied laughing  no thats true but if you were married it wouldnt make any difference to morrison  carley could not detect bitterness or jealousy in his voice she would not have been averse to hearing either she gathered from his remark however that he was going to be harder than ever to understand what had she said or done to make him retreat within himself aloof impersonal unfamiliar he did not impress her as loverlike what irony of fate was this that held her there yearning for his kisses and caresses as never before while he watched the fire and talked as to a mere acquaintance and seemed sad and far away or did she merely imagine that only one thing could she be sure of at that moment and it was that pride would never be her ally  glenn look here she said sliding her chair close to his and holding out her left hand slim and white with its glittering diamond on the third finger  he took her hand in his and pressed it and smiled at her yes carley its a beautiful soft little hand but i think id like it better if it were strong and brown and coarse on the insidefrom useful work  like flo hutters queried carley  yes  carley looked proudly into his eyes people are born in different stations i respect your little western friend glenn but could i wash and sweep milk cows and chop wood and all that sort of thing  i suppose you couldnt he admitted with a blunt little laugh  would you want me to she asked  well thats hard to say he replied knitting his brows i hardly know i think it depends on you but if you did do such work wouldnt you be happier  happier why glenn id be miserable but listen it wasnt my beautiful and useless hand i wanted you to see it was my engagement ring  ohwell he went on slowly  ive never had it off since you left new york she said softly you gave it to me four years ago do you remember it was on my twentysecond birthday you said it would take two months salary to pay the bill  it sure did he retorted with a hint of humor  glenn during the war it was not soso very hard to wear this ring as an engagement ring should be worn said carley growing more earnest but after the warespecially after your departure west it was terribly hard to be true to the significance of this betrothal ring there was a letdown in all women oh no one need tell me there was and men were affected by that and the chaotic condition of the times new york was wild during the year of your absence prohibition was a jokewell i gadded danced dressed drank smoked motored just the same as the other women in our crowd something drove me to i never rested excitement seemed to be happinessglenn i am not making any plea to excuse all that but i want you to knowhow under trying circumstancesi was absolutely true to you understand me i mean true as regards love through it all i loved you just the same and now im with you it seems oh so much more your last letter hurt me i dont know just how but i came west to see youto tell you thisand to ask you do you want this ring back  certainly not he replied forcibly with a dark flush spreading over his face  thenyou love me she whispered  yesi love you he returned deliberately and in spite of all you sayvery probably more than you love me but you like all women make love and its expression the sole object of life carley i have been concerned with keeping my body from the grave and my soul from hell  butdearyoure well now she returned with trembling lips  yes ive almost pulled out  then what is wrong  wrongwith me or you he queried with keen enigmatical glance upon her  what is wrong between us there is something  carley a man who has been on the vergeas i have beenseldom or never comes back to happiness but perhaps  you frighten me cried carley and rising she sat upon the arm of his chair and encircled his neck with her arms how can i help if i do not understand am i so miserably little glenn must i tell you no woman can live without love i need to be loved thats all thats wrong with me  carley you are still an imperious mushy girl replied glenn taking her into his arms i need to be loved too but thats not what is wrong with me youll have to find it out yourself  youre a dear old sphinx she retorted  listen carley he said earnestly about this lovemaking stuff please dont misunderstand me i love you im starved for your kisses butis it right to ask them  right arent we engaged and dont i want to give them  if i were only sure wed be married he said in low tense voice as if speaking more to himself  married cried carley convulsively clasping him of course well be married glenn you wouldnt jilt me  carley what i mean is that you might never really marry me he answered seriously  oh if thats all you need be sure of glenn kilbourne you may begin to make love to me now   it was late when carley went up to her room and she was in such a softened mood so happy and excited and yet disturbed in mind that the coldness and the darkness did not matter in the least she undressed in pitchy blackness stumbling over chair and bed feeling for what she needed and in her mood this unusual proceeding was fun when ready for bed she opened the door to take a peep out through the dense blackness the waterfall showed dimly opaque carley felt a soft mist wet her face the low roar of the falling water seemed to envelop her under the cliff wall brooded impenetrable gloom but out above the treetops shone great stars wonderfully white and radiant and cold with a piercing contrast to the deep clear blue of sky the waterfall hummed into an absolutely dead silence it emphasized the silence not only cold was it that made carley shudder how lonely how lost how hidden this canyon  then she hurried to bed grateful for the warm woolly blankets relaxation and thought brought consciousness of the heat of her blood the beat and throb and swell of her heart of the tumult within her in the lonely darkness of her room she might have faced the truth of her strangely renewed and augmented love for glenn kilbourne but she was more concerned with her happiness she had won him back her presence her love had overcome his restraint she thrilled in the sweet consciousness of her womans conquest how splendid he was to hold back physical tenderness the simple expressions of love because he had feared they might unduly influence her he had grown in many ways she must be careful to reach up to his ideals that about flo hutters toilhardened hands was that significance somehow connected with the rift in the lute for carley admitted to herself that there was something amiss something incomprehensible something intangible that obtruded its menace into her dream of future happiness still what had she to fear so long as she could be with glenn  and yet there were forced upon her insistent and perplexing the questionswas her love selfish was she considering him was she blind to something he could see tomorrow and next day and the days to come held promise of joyous companionship with glenn yet likewise they seemed full of a portent of trouble for her or fight and ordeal of lessons that would make life significant for her    chapter iii  carley was awakened by rattling sounds in her room the raising of sleepy eyelids disclosed flo on her knees before the little stove in the act of lighting a fire  mawnin carley she drawled its shore cold reckon itll snow today worse luck just because youre here take my hunch and stay in bed till the fire burns up  i shall do no such thing declared carley heroically  were afraid youll take cold said flo this is desert country with high altitude spring is here when the sun shines but its only shinin in streaks these days that means winter really please be good  well it doesnt require much selfdenial to stay here awhile longer replied carley lazily  flo left with a parting admonition not to let the stove get redhot and carley lay snuggled in the warm blankets dreading the ordeal of getting out into that cold bare room her nose was cold when her nose grew cold it being a faithful barometer as to temperature carley knew there was frost in the air she preferred summer steamheated rooms with hothouse flowers lending their perfume had certainly not trained carley for primitive conditions she had a spirit however that was waxing a little rebellious to all this intimation as to her susceptibility to colds and her probable weakness under privation carley got up her bare feet landed upon the board floor instead of the navajo rug and she thought she had encountered cold stone stove and hot water notwithstanding by the time she was half dressed she was also half frozen some actor fellow once said wwhen you wwent west you were ccamping out chattered carley believe me he said something  the fact was carley had never camped out her set played golf rode horseback motored and houseboated but they had never gone in for uncomfortable trips the camps and hotels in the adirondacks were as warm and luxurious as carleys own home carley now missed many things and assuredly her flesh was weak it cost her effort of will and real pain to finish lacing her boots as she had made an engagement with glenn to visit his cabin she had donned an outdoor suit she wondered if the cold had anything to do with the perceptible diminishing of the sound of the waterfall perhaps some of the water had frozen like her fingers  carley went downstairs to the living room and made no effort to resist a rush to the open fire flo and her mother were amused at carleys impetuosity youll like that stingin of the air after you get used to it said mrs hutter carley had her doubts when she was thoroughly thawed out she discovered an appetite quite unusual for her and she enjoyed her breakfast then it was time to sally forth to meet glenn  its pretty sharp this mawnin said flo youll need gloves and sweater  having fortified herself with these carley asked how to find west fork canyon  its down the road a little way replied flo a great narrow canyon opening on the right side you cant miss it  flo accompanied her as far as the porch steps a queerlooking individual was slouching along with ax over his shoulder  theres charley said flo hell show you then she whispered hes sort of dotty sometimes a horse kicked him once but mostly hes sensible  at flos call the fellow halted with a grin he was long lean loose jointed dressed in blue overalls stuck into the tops of muddy boots and his face was clear olive without beard or line his brow bulged a little and from under it peered out a pair of wistful brown eyes that reminded carley of those of a dog she had once owned  wal it aint agoin to be a nice day remarked charley as he tried to accommodate his strides to carleys steps  how can you tell asked carley it looks clear and bright  naw this is a dark mawnin thets a cloudy sun well hev snow on an off  do you mind bad weather  me all the same to me reckon though i like it cold so i can loaf round a big fire at night  i like a big fire too  ever camped out he asked  not what youd call the real thing replied carley  wal thets too bad reckon itll be tough fer you he went on kindly there was a gurl tenderfoot heah two years ago an she had a hell of a time they all joked her cept me an played tricks on her an on her side she was always puttin her foot in it i was shore sorry fer her  you were very kind to be an exception murmured carley  you look out fer tom hutter an i reckon flo aint so darn above layin traps fer you specially as shes sweet on your beau i seen them together a lot  yes interrogated carley encouragingly  kilbourne is the best fellar thet ever happened along oak creek i helped him build his cabin weve hunted some together did you ever hunt  no  wal youve shore missed a lot of fun he said turkey huntin thets what fetches the gurls i reckon because turkeys are so good to eat the old gobblers hev begun to gobble now ill take you gobbler huntin if youd like to go  im sure i would  theres good trout fishin along heah a little later he said pointing to the stream cricks too high now i like west fork best ive ketched some lammin big ones up there  carley was amused and interested she could not say that charley had shown any indication of his mental peculiarity to her it took considerable restraint not to lead him to talk more about flo and glenn presently they reached the turn in the road opposite the cottage carley had noticed yesterday and here her loquacious escort halted  you take the trail heah he said pointing it out an foller it into west fork so long an dont forget were goin huntin turkeys  carley smiled her thanks and taking to the trail she stepped out briskly now giving attention to her surroundings the canyon had widened and the creek with its deep thicket of green and white had sheered to the left on her right the canyon wall appeared to be lifting higherand higher she could not see it well owing to intervening treetops the trail led her through a grove of maples and sycamores out into an open parklike bench that turned to the right toward the cliff suddenly carley saw a break in the red wall it was the intersecting canyon west fork what a narrow redwalled gateway huge pine trees spread wide gnarled branches over her head the wind made soft rush in their tops sending the brown needles lightly on the air carley turned the bulging corner to be halted by a magnificent spectacle it seemed a mountain wall loomed over her it was the western side of this canyon so lofty that carley had to tip back her head to see the top she swept her astonished gaze down the face of this tremendous red mountain wall and then slowly swept it upward again this phenomenon of a cliff seemed beyond the comprehension of her sight it looked a mile high the few trees along its bold rampart resembled short spearpointed bushes outlined against the steel gray of sky ledges caves seams cracks fissures beetling red brows yellow crumbling crags benches of green growths and niches choked with brush and bold points where single lonely pine trees grew perilously and blank walls a thousand feet across their shadowed facesthese features gradually took shape in carleys confused sight until the colossal mountain front stood up before her in all its strange wild magnificent ruggedness and beauty  arizona perhaps this is what he meant murmured carley i never dreamed of anything like this but oh it overshadows mebears me down i could never have a moments peace under it  it fascinated her there were inaccessible ledges that haunted her with their remote fastnesses how wonderful would it be to get there rest there if that were possible but only eagles could reach them there were places then that the desecrating hands of man could not touch the dark caves were mystically potent in their vacant staring out at the world beneath them the crumbling crags the toppling ledges the leaning rocks all threatened to come thundering down at the breath of wind how deep and soft the red color in contrast with the green how splendid the sheer bold uplift of gigantic steps carley found herself marveling at the forces that had so rudely violently and grandly left this monument to nature  well old fifth avenue gadder called a gay voice if the back wall of my yard so halts youwhat will you ever do when you see the painted desert or climb sunset peak or look down into the grand canyon  oh glenn where are you cried carley gazing everywhere near at hand but he was farther away the clearness of his voice had deceived her presently she espied him a little distance away across a creek she had not before noticed  come on he called i want to see you cross the stepping stones  carley ran ahead down a little slope of clean red rock to the shore of the green water it was clear swift deep in some places and shallow in others with white wreathes or ripples around the rocks evidently placed there as a means to cross carley drew back aghast  glenn i could never make it she called  come on my alpine climber he taunted will you let arizona daunt you  do you want me to fall in and catch cold she cried desperately  carley big women might even cross the bad places of modern life on stepping stones of their dead selves he went on with something of mockery surely a few physical steps are not beyond you  say are you mangling tennyson or just kidding me she demanded slangily  my love flo could cross here with her eyes shut  that thrust spurred carley to action his words were jest yet they held a hint of earnest with her heart at her throat carley stepped on the first rock and poising she calculated on a running leap from stone to stone once launched she felt she was falling downhill she swayed she splashed she slipped and clearing the longest leap from the last stone to shore she lost her balance and fell into glenns arms his kisses drove away both her panic and her resentment  by jove i didnt think youd even attempt it he declared manifestly pleased i made sure id have to pack you overin fact rather liked the idea  i wouldnt advise you to employ any such means againto dare me she retorted  thats a nifty outdoor suit youve on he said admiringly i was wondering what youd wear i like short outing skirts for women rather than trousers the service sort of made the fair sex dippy about pants  it made them dippy about more than that she replied you and i will never live to see the day that women recover their balance  i agree with you replied glenn  carley locked her arm in his honey i want to have a good time today cut out all the other women stuff take me to see your little gray home in the west or is it gray  he laughed why yes its gray just about the logs have bleached some  glenn led her away up a trail that climbed between bowlders and meandered on over piny mats of needles under great silent spreading pines and closer to the impondering mountain wall where at the base of the red rock the creek murmured strangely with hollow gurgle where the sun had no chance to affect the cold damp gloom and on through sweetsmelling woods out into the sunlight again and across a wider breadth of stream and up a slow slope covered with stately pines to a little cabin that faced the west  here we are sweetheart said glenn now we shall see what you are made of  carley was noncommittal as to that her intense interest precluded any humor at this moment not until she actually saw the log cabin glenn had erected with his own hands had she been conscious of any great interest but sight of it awoke something unaccustomed in carley as she stepped into the cabin her heart was not acting normally for a young woman who had no illusions about love in a cottage  glenns cabin contained one room about fifteen feet wide by twenty long between the peeled logs were lines of red mud hard dried there was a small window opposite the door in one corner was a couch of poles with green tips of pine boughs peeping from under the blankets the floor consisted of flat rocks laid irregularly with many spaces of earth showing between the open fireplace appeared too large for the room but the very bigness of it as well as the blazing sticks and glowing embers appealed strongly to carley a roughhewn log formed the mantel and on it carleys picture held the place of honor above this a rifle lay across deer antlers carley paused here in her survey long enough to kiss glenn and point to her photograph  you couldnt have pleased me more  to the left of the fireplace was a rude cupboard of shelves packed with boxes cans bags and utensils below the cupboard hung upon pegs were blackened pots and pans a longhandled skillet and a bucket glenns table was a masterpiece there was no danger of knocking it over it consisted of four poles driven into the ground upon which had been nailed two wide slabs this table showed considerable evidence of having been scrubbed scrupulously clean there were two low stools made out of boughs and the seats had been covered with woolly sheep hide in the righthand corner stood a neat pile of firewood cut with an ax and beyond this hung saddle and saddle blanket bridle and spurs an old sombrero was hooked upon the pommel of the saddle upon the wall higher up hung a lantern resting in a coil of rope that carley took to be a lasso under a shelf upon which lay a suitcase hung some rough wearing apparel  carley noted that her picture and the suit case were absolutely the only physical evidences of glenns connection with his eastern life that had an unaccountable effect upon carley what had she expected then after another survey of the room she began to pester glenn with questions he had to show her the spring outside and the little bench with basin and soap sight of his soiled towel made her throw up her hands she sat on the stools she lay on the couch she rummaged into the contents of the cupboard she threw wood on the fire then finally having exhausted her search and inquiry she flopped down on one of the stools to gaze at glenn in awe and admiration and incredulity  glennyouve actually lived here she ejaculated  since last fall before the snow came he said smiling  snow did it snow she inquired  well i guess i was snowed in for a week  why did you choose this lonely placeway off from the lodge she asked slowly  i wanted to be by myself he replied briefly  you mean this is a sort of campout place  carley i call it my home he replied and there was a low strong sweetness in his voice she had never heard before  that silenced her for a while she went to the door and gazed up at the towering wall more wonderful than ever and more fearful too in her sight presently tears dimmed her eyes she did not understand her feeling she was ashamed of it she hid it from glenn indeed there was something terribly wrong between her and glenn and it was not in him this cabin he called home gave her a shock which would take time to analyze at length she turned to him with gay utterance upon her lips she tried to put out of her mind a dawning sense that this closetotheearth habitation this primitive dwelling held strange inscrutable power over a self she had never divined she possessed the very stones in the hearth seemed to call out from some remote past and the strong sweet smell of burnt wood thrilled to the marrow of her bones how little she knew of herself but she had intelligence enough to understand that there was a woman in her the female of the species and through that the sensations from logs and stones and earth and fire had strange power to call up the emotions handed down to her from the ages the thrill the queer heartbeat the vague haunting memory of something as of a dim childhood adventure the strange prickling sense of dreadthese abided with her and augmented while she tried to show glenn her pride in him and also how funny his cabin seemed to her  once or twice he hesitatingly and somewhat appealingly she imagined tried to broach the subject of his work there in the west but carley wanted a little while with him free of disagreeable argument it was a foregone conclusion that she would not like his work her intention at first had been to begin at once to use all persuasion in her power toward having him go back east with her or at the latest some time this year but the rude log cabin had checked her impulse she felt that haste would be unwise  glenn kilbourne i told you why i came west to see you she said spiritedly well since you still swear allegiance to your girl from the east you might entertain her a little bit before getting down to business talk  all right carley he replied laughing what do you want to do the day is at your disposal i wish it were june then if you didnt fall in love with west fork youd be no good  glenn i love people not places she returned  so i remember and thats one thing i dont like but lets not quarrel whatll we do  suppose you tramp with me all around until im good and hungry then well come back hereand you can cook dinner for me  fine oh i know youre just bursting with curiosity to see how ill do it well you may be surprised miss  lets go she urged  shall i take my gun or fishing rod  you shall take nothing but me retorted carley what chance has a girl with a man if he can hunt or fish  so they went out hand in hand half of the belt of sky above was obscured by swiftly moving gray clouds the other half was blue and was being slowly encroached upon by the dark stormlike pall how cold the air carley had already learned that when the sun was hidden the atmosphere was cold glenn led her down a trail to the brook where he calmly picked her up in his arms quite easily it appeared and leisurely packed her across kissing her half a dozen times before he deposited her on her feet  glenn you do this sort of thing so well that it makes me imagine you have practice now and then she said  no but you are pretty and sweet and like the girl you were four years ago that takes me back to those days  i thank you thats dear of you i think i am something of a cat ill be glad if this walk leads us often to the creek  spring might have been fresh and keen in the air but it had not yet brought much green to the brown earth or to the trees the cottonwoods showed a light feathery verdure the long grass was a bleached white and low down close to the sod fresh tiny green blades showed the great fern leaves were sear and ragged and they rustled in the breeze small gray sheathbarked trees with clumpy foliage and snags of dead branches glenn called cedars and grotesque as these were carley rather liked them they were approachable not majestic and lofty like the pines and they smelled sweetly wild and best of all they afforded some protection from the bitter wind carley rested better than she walked the huge sections of red rock that had tumbled from above also interested carley especially when the sun happened to come out for a few moments and brought out their color she enjoyed walking on the fallen pines with glenn below keeping pace with her and holding her hand carley looked in vain for flowers and birds the only living things she saw were rainbow trout that glenn pointed out to her in the beautiful clear pools the way the great gray bowlders trooped down to the brook as if they were cattle going to drink the dark caverns under the shelving cliffs where the water murmured with such hollow mockery the low spearpointed gray plants resembling century plants and which glenn called mescal cactus each with its single straight dead stalk standing on high with fluted head the narrow gorges perpendicularly walled in red where the constricted brook plunged in amber and white cascades over fall after fall tumbling rushing singing its water melodythese all held singular appeal for carley as aspects of the wild land fascinating for the moment symbolic of the lonely red man and his forbears and by their raw contrast making more necessary and desirable and elevating the comforts and conventions of civilization the cave man theory interested carley only as mythology  lonelier wilder grander grew glenns canyon carley was finally forced to shift her attention from the intimate objects of the canyon floor to the aloof and unattainable heights singular to feel the difference that which she could see close at hand touch if she willed seemed to become part of her knowledge could be observed and so possessed and passed by but the goldred ramparts against the sky the crannied cliffs the crags of the eagles the lofty distant blank walls where the winds of the gods had written their warsthese haunted because they could never be possessed carley had often gazed at the alps as at celebrated pictures she admired she appreciatedthen she forgot but the canyon heights did not affect her that way they vaguely dissatisfied and as she could not be sure of what they dissatisfied she had to conclude that it was in herself to see to watch to dream to seek to strive to endure to find was that what they meant they might make her thoughtful of the vast earth and its endless age and its staggering mystery but what more  the storm that had threatened blackened the sky and gray scudding clouds buried the canyon rims and long veils of rain and sleet began to descend the wind roared through the pines drowning the roar of the brook quite suddenly the air grew piercingly cold carley had forgotten her gloves and her pockets had not been constructed to protect hands glenn drew her into a sheltered nook where a rock jutted out from overhead and a thicket of young pines helped break the onslaught of the wind there carley sat on a cold rock huddled up close to glenn and wearing to a state she knew would be misery glenn not only seemed content he was happy this is great he said his coat was open his hands uncovered and he watched the storm and listened with manifest delight carley hated to betray what a weakling she was so she resigned herself to her fate and imagined she felt her fingers numbing into ice and her sensitive nose slowly and painfully freezing  the storm passed however before carley sank into abject and open wretchedness she managed to keep pace with glenn until exercise warmed her blood at every little ascent in the trail she found herself laboring to get her breath there was assuredly evidence of abundance of air in this canyon but somehow she could not get enough of it glenn detected this and said it was owing to the altitude when they reached the cabin carley was wet stiff cold exhausted how welcome the shelter the open fireplace seeing the cabin in new light carley had the grace to acknowledge to herself that after all it was not so bad  now for a good fire and then dinner announced glenn with the air of one who knew his ground  can i help queried carley  not today i do not want you to spring any domestic science on me now carley was not averse to withholding her ignorance she watched glenn with surpassing curiosity and interest first he threw a quantity of wood upon the smoldering fire  i have ham and mutton of my own raising announced glenn with importance which would you prefer  of your own raising what do you mean queried carley  my dear youve been so steeped in the fog of the crowd that you are blind to the homely and necessary things of living i mean i have here meat of both sheep and hog that i raised myself that is to say mutton and ham which do you like  ham cried carley incredulously  without more ado glenn settled to brisk action every move of which carley watched with keen eyes the usurping of a womans province by a man was always an amusing thing but for glenn kilbournewhat more would it be he evidently knew what he wanted for every movement was quick decisive one after another he placed bags cans sacks pans utensils on the table then he kicked at the roaring fire settling some of the sticks he strode outside to return with a bucket of water a basin towel and soap then he took down two queer little iron pots with heavy lids to each pot was attached a wire handle he removed the lids then set both the pots right on the fire or in it pouring water into the basin he proceeded to wash his hands next he took a large pail and from a sack he filled it half full of flour to this he added baking powder and salt it was instructive for carley to see him run his skillful fingers all through that flour as if searching for lumps after this he knelt before the fire and lifting off one of the iron pots with a forked stick he proceeded to wipe out the inside of the pot and grease it with a piece of fat his next move was to rake out a pile of the red coals a feat he performed with the stick and upon these he placed the pot also he removed the other pot from the fire leaving it however quite close  well all eyes he bantered suddenly staring at her didnt i say id surprise you  dont mind me this is about the happiest and most bewildered momentof my life replied carley  returning to the table glenn dug at something in a large red can he paused a moment to eye carley  girl do you know how to make biscuits he queried  i might have known in my school days but ive forgotten she replied  can you make apple pie he demanded imperiously  no rejoined carley  how do you expect to please your husband  whyby marrying him i suppose answered carley as if weighing a problem  that has been the universal feminine point of view for a good many years replied glenn flourishing a flourwhitened hand but it never served the women of the revolution or the pioneers and they were the builders of the nation it will never serve the wives of the future if we are to survive  glenn you rave ejaculated carley not knowing whether to laugh or be grave you were talking of humble housewifely things  precisely the humble things that were the foundation of the great nation of americans i meant work and children  carley could only stare at him the look he flashed at her the sudden intensity and passion of his ringing words were as if he gave her a glimpse into the very depths of him he might have begun in fun but he had finished otherwise she felt that she really did not know this man had he arraigned her in judgment a flush seemingly hot and cold passed over her then it relieved her to see that he had returned to his task  he mixed the shortening with the flour and adding water he began a thorough kneading when the consistency of the mixture appeared to satisfy him he took a handful of it rolled it into a ball patted and flattened it into a biscuit and dropped it into the oven he had set aside on the hot coals swiftly he shaped eight or ten other biscuits and dropped them as the first then he put the heavy iron lid on the pot and with a rude shovel improvised from a flattened tin can he shoveled red coals out of the fire and covered the lid with them his next move was to pare and slice potatoes placing these aside in a pan a small black coffeepot half full of water was set on a glowing part of the fire then he brought into use a huge heavy knife a murderouslooking implement it appeared to carley with which he cut slices of ham these he dropped into the second pot which he left uncovered next he removed the flour sack and other inpedimenta from the table and proceeded to set places for twoblueenamel plate and cup with plain substantiallooking knives forks and spoons he went outside to return presently carrying a small crock of butter evidently he had kept the butter in or near the spring it looked dewy and cold and hard after that he peeped under the lid of the pot which contained the biscuits the other pot was sizzling and smoking giving forth a delicious savory odor that affected carley most agreeably the coffeepot had begun to steam with a long fork glenn turned the slices of ham and stood a moment watching them next he placed cans of three sizes upon the table and these carley conjectured contained sugar salt and pepper carley might not have been present for all the attention he paid to her again he peeped at the biscuits at the edge of the hot embers he placed a tin plate upon which he carefully deposited the slices of ham carley had not needed sight of them to know she was hungry they made her simply ravenous that done he poured the pan of sliced potatoes into the pot carley judged the heat of that pot to be extreme next he removed the lid from the other pot exposing biscuits slightly browned and evidently satisfied with these he removed them from the coals he stirred the slices of potatoes round and round he emptied two heaping tablespoonfuls of coffee into the coffeepot  carley he said at last turning to her with a warm smile out here in the west the cook usually yells come and get it draw up your stool  and presently carley found herself seated across the crude table from glenn with the background of chinked logs in her sight and the smart of wood smoke in her eyes in years past she had sat with him in the soft subdued goldgreen shadows of the astor or in the sumptuous atmosphere of the st regis but this event was so different so striking that she felt it would have limitless significance for one thing the look of glenn when had he ever seemed like this wonderfully happy to have her there consciously proud of this dinner he had prepared in half an hour strangely studying her as one on trial this might have had its effect upon carleys reaction to the situation making it sweet trenchant with meaning but she was hungry enough and the dinner was good enough to make this hour memorable on that score alone she ate until she was actually ashamed of herself she laughed heartily she talked she made love to glenn then suddenly an idea flashed into her quick mind  glenn did this girl flo teach you to cook she queried sharply  no i always was handy in camp then out here i had the luck to fall in with an old fellow who was a wonderful cook he lived with me for a while  why what difference would it have madehad flo taught me  carley felt the heat of blood in her face i dont know that it would have made a difference onlyim glad she didnt teach you id rather no girl could teach you what i couldnt  you think im a pretty good cook then he asked  ive enjoyed this dinner more than any ive ever eaten  thanks carley thatll help a lot he said gayly but his eyes shone with earnest glad light i hoped id surprise you ive found out here that i want to do things well the west stirs something in a man it must be an unwritten law you stand or fall by your own hands back east you know meals are just occasionsto hurry throughto dress forto meet somebodyto eat because you have to eat but out here they are different i dont know how in the city producers merchants waiters serve you for money the meal is a transaction it has no significance it is money that keeps you from starvation but in the west money doesnt mean much you must work to live  carley leaned her elbows on the table and gazed at him curiously and admiringly old fellow youre a wonder i cant tell you how proud i am of you that you could come west weak and sick and fight your way to health and learn to be selfsufficient it is a splendid achievement it amazes me i dont grasp it i want to think nevertheless i  what he queried as she hesitated  oh never mind now she replied hastily averting her eyes   the day was far spent when carley returned to the lodgeand in spite of the discomfort of cold and sleet and the bitter wind that beat in her face as she struggled up the trailit was a day never to be forgotten nothing had been wanting in glenns attention or affection he had been comrade lover all she craved for and but for his few singular words about work and children there had been no serious talk only a play day in his canyon and his cabin yet had she appeared at her best something vague and perplexing knocked at the gate of her consciousness    chapter iv  two warm sunny days in early may inclined mr hutter to the opinion that pleasant spring weather was at hand and that it would be a propitious time to climb up on the desert to look after his sheep interests glenn of course would accompany him  carley and i will go too asserted flo  reckon thatll be good said hutter with approving nod  his wife also agreed that it would be fine for carley to see the beautiful desert country round sunset peak but glenn looked dubious  carley itll be rather hard he said youre soft and riding and lying out will stove you up you ought to break in gradually  i rode ten miles today rejoined carley and didnt mind itmuch this was a little deviation from stern veracity  shore carleys well and strong protested flo shell get sore but that wont kill her  glenn eyed flo with rather penetrating glance i might drive carley round about in the car he said  but you cant drive over those lava flats or go round either wed have to send horses in some cases miles to meet you its horseback if you go at all  shore well go horseback spoke up flo carley has got it all over that spencer girl who was here last summer  i think so too i am sure i hope so because you remember what the ride to long valley did to miss spencer rejoined glenn  what inquired carley  bad cold peeled nose skinned shin saddle sores she was in bed two days she didnt show much pep the rest of her stay here and she never got on another horse  oh is that all glenn returned carley in feigned surprise why i imagined from your tone that miss spencers ride must have occasioned her discomfort see here glenn i may be a tenderfoot but im no mollycoddle  my dear i surrender replied glenn with a laugh really im delighted but if anything happensdont you blame me im quite sure that a long horseback ride in spring on the desert will show you a good many things about yourself  that was how carley came to find herself the afternoon of the next day astride a selfwilled and unmanageable little mustang riding in the rear of her friends on the way through a cedar forest toward a place called deep lake  carley had not been able yet during the several hours of their journey to take any pleasure in the scenery or in her mount for in the first place there was nothing to see but scrubby little gnarled cedars and drablooking rocks and in the second this indian pony she rode had discovered she was not an adept horsewoman and had proceeded to take advantage of the fact it did not help carleys predicament to remember that glenn had decidedly advised her against riding this particular mustang to be sure flo had approved of carleys choice and mr hutter with a hearty laugh had fallen in line shore let her ride one of the broncs if she wants so this animal she bestrode must have been a bronc for it did not take him long to elicit from carley a muttered i dont know what bronc means but it sounds like this pony acts  carley had inquired the animals name from the young herder who had saddled him for her  wal i reckon he aint got much of a name replied the lad with a grin as he scratched his head for us boys always called him spillbeans  humph what a beautiful cognomen ejaculated carley but according to shakespeare any name will serve ill ride him oror  so far there had not really been any necessity for the completion of that sentence but five miles of riding up into the cedar forest had convinced carley that she might not have much farther to go spillbeans had ambled along well enough until he reached level ground where a long bleached grass waved in the wind here he manifested hunger then a contrary nature next insubordination and finally direct hostility carley had urged pulled and commanded in vain then when she gave spillbeans a kick in the flank he jumped stiff legged propelling her up out of the saddle and while she was descending he made the queer jump again coming up to meet her the jolt she got seemed to dislocate every bone in her body likewise it hurt moreover along with her idea of what a spectacle she must have presented it quickly decided carley that spillbeans was a horse that was not to be opposed whenever he wanted a mouthful of grass he stopped to get it therefore carley was always in the rear a fact which in itself did not displease her despite his contrariness however spillbeans had apparently no intention of allowing the other horses to get completely out of sight  several times flo waited for carley to catch up hes loafing on you carley you ought to have on a spur break off a switch and beat him some then she whipped the mustang across the flank with her bridle rein which punishment caused spillbeans meekly to trot on with alacrity carley had a positive belief that he would not do it for her and after flos repeated efforts assisted by chastisement from glenn had kept spillbeans in a trot for a couple of miles carley began to discover that the trotting of a horse was the most uncomfortable motion possible to imagine it grew worse it became painful it gradually got unendurable but pride made carley endure it until suddenly she thought she had been stabbed in the side this strange piercing pain must be what glenn had called a stitch in the side something common to novices on horseback carley could have screamed she pulled the mustang to a walk and sagged in her saddle until the pain subsided what a blessed relief carley had keen sense of the difference between riding in central park and in arizona she regretted her choice of horses spillbeans was attractive to look at but the pleasure of riding him was a delusion flo had said his gait resembled the motion of a rocking chair this western girl according to charley the sheep herder was not above playing arizona jokes be that as it might spillbeans now manifested a desire to remain with the other horses and he broke out of a walk into a trot carley could not keep him from trotting hence her state soon wore into acute distress  her left ankle seemed broken the stirrup was heavy and as soon as she was tired she could no longer keep its weight from drawing her foot in the inside of her right knee was as sore as a boil besides she had other pains just as severe and she stood momentarily in mortal dread of that terrible stitch in her side if it returned she knew she would fall off but fortunately just when she was growing weak and dizzy the horses ahead slowed to a walk on a descent the road wound down into a wide deep canyon carley had a respite from her severest pains never before had she known what it meant to be so grateful for relief from anything  the afternoon grew far advanced and the sunset was hazily shrouded in gray hutter did not like the looks of those clouds reckon were in for weather he said carley did not care what happened weather or anything else that might make it possible to get off her horse glenn rode beside her inquiring solicitously as to her pleasure ride of my life she lied heroically and it helped some to see that she both fooled and pleased him  beyond the canyon the cedared desert heaved higher and changed its aspect the trees grew larger bushier greener and closer together with patches of bleached grass between and russetlichened rocks everywhere small cactus plants bristled sparsely in open places and here and there bright red flowersindian paintbrush flo called themadded a touch of color to the gray glenn pointed to where dark banks of cloud had massed around the mountain peaks the scene to the west was somber and compelling  at last the men and the packhorses ahead came to a halt in a level green forestland with no high trees far ahead a chain of soft gray round hills led up to the dark heaved mass of mountains carley saw the gleam of water through the trees probably her mustang saw or scented it because he started to trot carley had reached a limit of strength endurance and patience she hauled him up short when spillbeans evinced a stubborn intention to go on carley gave him a kick then it happened  she felt the reins jerked out of her hands and the saddle propel her upward when she descended it was to meet that beforeexperienced jolt  look cried flo that bronc is going to pitch  hold on carley yelled glenn  desperately carley essayed to do just that but spillbeans jolted her out of the saddle she came down on his rump and began to slide back and down frightened and furious carley tried to hang to the saddle with her hands and to squeeze the mustang with her knees but another jolt broke her hold and then helpless and bewildered with her heart in her throat and a terrible sensation of weakness she slid back at each upheave of the muscular rump until she slid off and to the ground in a heap whereupon spillbeans trotted off toward the water  carley sat up before glenn and flo reached her manifestly they were concerned about her but both were ready to burst with laughter carley knew she was not hurt and she was so glad to be off the mustang that on the moment she could almost have laughed herself  that beast is well named she said he spilled me all right and i presume i resembled a sack of beans  carleyyourenot hurt asked glenn choking as he helped her up  not physically but my feelings are  then glenn let out a hearty howl of mirth which was seconded by a loud guffaw from hutter flo however appeared to be able to restrain whatever she felt to carley she looked queer  pitch you called it that said carley  oh he didnt really pitch he just humped up a few times replied flo and then when she saw how carley was going to take it she burst into a merry peal of laughter charley the sheep herder was grinning and some of the other men turned away with shaking shoulders  laugh you wild and woolly westerners ejaculated carley it must have been funny i hope i can be a good sport but i bet you i ride him tomorrow  shore you will replied flo  evidently the little incident drew the party closer together carley felt a warmth of good nature that overcame her first feeling of humiliation they expected such things from her and she should expect them too and take them if not fearlessly or painlessly at least without resentment  carley walked about to ease her swollen and sore joints and while doing so she took stock of the camp ground and what was going on at second glance the place had a certain attraction difficult for her to define she could see far and the view north toward those strange graycolored symmetrical hills was one that fascinated while it repelled her near at hand the ground sloped down to a large rockbound lake perhaps a mile in circumference in the distance along the shore she saw a white conical tent and blue smoke and moving gray objects she took for sheep  the men unpacked and unsaddled the horses and hobbling their forefeet together turned them loose twilight had fallen and each man appeared to be briskly set upon his own task glenn was cutting around the foot of a thickly branched cedar where he told carley he would make a bed for her and flo all that carley could see that could be used for such purpose was a canvascovered roll presently glenn untied a rope from round this unrolled it and dragged it under the cedar then he spread down the outer layer of canvas disclosing a considerable thickness of blankets from under the top of these he pulled out two flat little pillows these he placed in position and turned back some of the blankets  carley you crawl in here pile the blankets up and the tarp over them directed glenn if it rains pull the tarp up over your headand let it rain  this direction sounded in glenns cheery voice a good deal more pleasurable than the possibilities suggested surely that cedar tree could not keep off rain or snow  glenn how aboutabout animalsand crawling things you know queried carley  oh there are a few tarantulas and centipedes and sometimes a scorpion but these dont crawl around much at night the only thing to worry about are the hydrophobia skunks  what on earth are they asked carley quite aghast  skunks are polecats you know replied glenn cheerfully sometimes one gets bitten by a coyote that has rabies and then hes a dangerous customer he has no fear and he may run across you and bite you in the face queer how they generally bite your nose two men have been bitten since ive been here one of them died and the other had to go to the pasteur institute with a welldeveloped case of hydrophobia  good heavens cried carley horrified  you neednt be afraid said glenn ill tie one of the dogs near your bed  carley wondered whether glenns casual easy tone had been adopted for her benefit or was merely an assimilation from this western life not improbably glenn himself might be capable of playing a trick on her carley endeavored to fortify herself against disaster so that when it befell she might not be wholly ludicrous  with the coming of twilight a cold keen wind moaned through the cedars carley would have hovered close to the fire even if she had not been too tired to exert herself despite her aches she did justice to the supper it amazed her that appetite consumed her to the extent of overcoming a distaste for this strong coarse cooking before the meal ended darkness had fallen a windy raw darkness that enveloped heavily like a blanket presently carley edged closer to the fire and there she stayed alternately turning back and front to the welcome heat she seemingly roasted hands face and knees while her back froze the wind blew the smoke in all directions when she groped around with blurred smarting eyes to escape the hot smoke it followed her the other members of the party sat comfortably on sacks or rocks without much notice of the smoke that so exasperated carley twice glenn insisted that she take a seat he had fixed for her but she preferred to stand and move around a little  by and by the camp tasks of the men appeared to be ended and all gathered near the fire to lounge and smoke and talk glenn and hutter engaged in interested conversation with two mexicans evidently sheep herders if the wind and cold had not made carley so uncomfortable she might have found the scene picturesque how black the night she could scarcely distinguish the sky at all the cedar branches swished in the wind and from the gloom came a low sound of waves lapping a rocky shore presently glenn held up a hand  listen carley he said  then she heard strange wild yelps staccato piercing somehow infinitely lonely they made her shudder  coyotes said glenn youll come to love that chorus hear the dogs bark back  carley listened with interest but she was inclined to doubt that she would ever become enamoured of such wild cries  do coyotes come near camp she queried  shore sometimes they pull your pillow out from under your head replied flo laconically  carley did not ask any more questions natural history was not her favorite study and she was sure she could dispense with any firsthand knowledge of desert beasts she thought however she heard one of the men say big varmint prowlin round the sheep to which hutter replied reckon it was a bear and glenn said i saw his fresh track by the lake some bear  the heat from the fire made carley so drowsy that she could scarcely hold up her head she longed for bed even if it was out there in the open presently flo called her come lets walk a little before turning in  so carley permitted herself to be led to and fro down an open aisle between some cedars the far end of that aisle dark gloomy with the bushy secretive cedars all around caused carley apprehension she was ashamed to admit flo talked eloquently about the joys of camp life and how the harder any outdoor task was and the more endurance and pain it required the more pride and pleasure one had in remembering it carley was weighing the import of these words when suddenly flo clutched her arm whats that she whispered tensely  carley stood stockstill they had reached the furthermost end of that aisle but had turned to go back the flare of the camp fire threw a wan light into the shadows before them there came a rustling in the brush a snapping of twigs cold tremors chased up and down carleys back  shore its a varmint all right lets hurry whispered flo  carley needed no urging it appeared that flo was not going to run she walked fast peering back over her shoulder and hanging to carleys arm she rounded a large cedar that had obstructed some of the firelight the gloom was not so thick here and on the instant carley espied a low moving object somehow furry and gray in color she gasped she could not speak her heart gave a mighty throb and seemed to stop  whatdo you see cried flo sharply peering ahead oh come carley run  flos cry showed she must nearly be strangled with terror but carley was frozen in her tracks her eyes were riveted upon the gray furry object it stopped then it came faster it magnified it was a huge beast carley had no control over mind heart voice or muscle her legs gave way she was sinking a terrible panic icy sickening rending possessed her whole body  the huge gray thing came at her into the rushing of her ears broke thudding sounds the thing leaped up a horrible petrifaction suddenly made stone of carley then she saw a gray mantlelike object cast aside to disclose the dark form of a man glenn  carley doggone it you dont scare worth a cent he laughingly complained  she collapsed into his arms the liberating shock was as great as had been her terror she began to tremble violently her hands got back a sense of strength to clutch heart and blood seemed released from that icebanded vise  say i believe you were scared went on glenn bending over her  scared she gasped ohtheres no wordto tellwhat i was  flo came running back giggling with joy glenn she shore took you for a bear why i felt her go stiff as a post ha ha ha carley now how do you like the wild and woolly  oh you put up a trick on me ejaculated carley glenn how could you  such a terrible trick i wouldnt have minded something reasonable but that oh ill never forgive you  glenn showed remorse and kissed her before flo in a way that made some little amends maybe i overdid it he said but i thought youd have a momentary start you know enough to make you yell and then youd see through it i only had a sheepskin over my shoulders as i crawled on hands and knees  glenn for me you were a prehistoric monstera dinosaur or something replied carley  it developed upon their return to the campfire circle that everybody had been in the joke and they all derived hearty enjoyment from it  reckon that makes you one of us said hutter genially weve all had our scares  carley wondered if she were not so constituted that such trickery alienated her deep in her heart she resented being made to show her cowardice but then she realized that no one had really seen any evidence of her state it was fun to them  soon after this incident hutter sounded what he called the rollcall for bed following flos instructions carley sat on their bed pulled off her boots folded coat and sweater at her head and slid down under the blankets how strange and hard a bed yet carley had the most delicious sense of relief and rest she had ever experienced she straightened out on her back with a feeling that she had never before appreciated the luxury of lying down  flo cuddled up to her in quite sisterly fashion saying now dont cover your head if it rains ill wake and pull up the tarp good night carley and almost immediately she seemed to fall asleep  for carley however sleep did not soon come she had too many aches the aftermath of her shock of fright abided with her and the blackness of night the cold whip of wind over her face and the unprotected helplessness she felt in this novel bed were too entirely new and disturbing to be overcome at once so she lay wide eyed staring at the dense gray shadow at the flickering lights upon the cedar at length her mind formed a conclusion that this sort of thing might be worth the hardship once in a lifetime anyway what a concession to glenns west in the secret seclusion of her mind she had to confess that if her vanity had not been so assaulted and humiliated she might have enjoyed herself more it seemed impossible however to have thrills and pleasures and exaltations in the face of discomfort privation and an uneasy halfacknowledged fear no woman could have either a good or a profitable time when she was at her worst carley thought she would not be averse to getting flo hutter to new york into an atmosphere wholly strange and difficult and see how she met situation after situation unfamiliar to her and so carleys mind drifted on until at last she succumbed to drowsiness   a voice pierced her dreams of home of warmth and comfort something sharp cold and fragrant was scratching her eyes she opened them glenn stood over her pushing a sprig of cedar into her face  carley the day is far spent he said gayly we want to roll up your bedding will you get out of it  hello glenn what time is it she replied  its nearly six  what do you expect me to get up at that ungodly hour  were all up flos eating breakfast its going to be a bad day im afraid and we want to get packed and moving before it starts to rain  why do girls leave home she asked tragically  to make poor devils happy of course he replied smiling down upon her  that smile made up to carley for all the clamoring sensations of stiff sore muscles it made her ashamed that she could not fling herself into this adventure with all her heart carley essayed to sit up oh im afraid my anatomy has become disconnected glenn do i look a sight she never would have asked him that if she had not known she could bear inspection at such an inopportune moment  you look great he asserted heartily youve got color and as for your hairi like to see it mussed that way you were always one to have it dressedjust so come carley rustle now  thus adjured carley did her best under adverse circumstances and she was gritting her teeth and complimenting herself when she arrived at the task of pulling on her boots they were damp and her feet appeared to have swollen moreover her ankles were sore but she accomplished getting into them at the expense of much pain and sundry utterances more forcible than elegant glenn brought her warm water a mitigating circumstance the morning was cold and thought of that biting desert water had been trying  shore youre doing fine was flos greeting come and get it before we throw it out  carley made haste to comply with the western mandate and was once again confronted with the singular fact that appetite did not wait upon the troubles of a tenderfoot glenn remarked that at least she would not starve to death on the trip  come climb the ridge with me he invited i want you to take a look to the north and east  he led her off through the cedars up a slow redearth slope away from the lake a green moundlike eminence topped with flat red rock appeared near at hand and not at all a hard climb nevertheless her eyes deceived her as she found to the cost of her breath it was both far away and high  i like this location said glenn if i had the money id buy this section of landsix hundred and forty acresand make a ranch of it just under this bluff is a fine open flat bench for a cabin you could see away across the desert clear to sunset peak theres a good spring of granite water id run water from the lake down into the lower flats and id sure raise some stock  what do you call this place asked carley curiously  deep lake its only a watering place for sheep and cattle but theres fine grazing and its a wonder to me no one has ever settled here  looking down carley appreciated his wish to own the place and immediately there followed in her a desire to get possession of this tract of land before anyone else discovered its advantages and to hold it for glenn but this would surely conflict with her intention of persuading glenn to go back east as quickly as her impulse had been born it died  suddenly the scene gripped carley she looked from near to far trying to grasp the illusive something wild lonely arizona land she saw ragged dumpy cedars of gray and green lines of red earth and a round space of water gleaming pale under the lowering clouds and in the distance isolated hills strangely curved wandering away to a black uplift of earth obscured in the sky  these appeared to be mere steps leading her sight farther and higher to the cloudnavigated sky where rosy and golden effulgence betokened the sun and the east carley held her breath a transformation was going on before her eyes  carley its a stormy sunrise said glenn  his words explained but they did not convince was this suddenbursting glory only the sun rising behind storm clouds she could see the clouds moving while they were being colored the universal gray surrendered under some magic paint brush the rifts widened and the gloom of the palegray world seemed to vanish beyond the billowy rolling creamy edges of clouds white and pink shone the soft exquisite fresh blue sky and a blaze of fire a burst of molten gold sheered up from behind the rim of cloud and suddenly poured a sea of sunlight from east to west it transfigured the round foothills they seemed bathed in ethereal light and the silver mists that overhung them faded while carley gazed and a rosy flush crowned the symmetrical domes southward along the horizon line downdropping veils of rain just touched with the sunrise tint streamed in drifting slow movement from cloud to earth to the north the range of foothills lifted toward the majestic dome of sunset peak a volcanic upheaval of red and purple cinders bare as rock round as the lower hills and wonderful in its color full in the blaze of the rising sun it flaunted an unchangeable front carley understood now what had been told her about this peak volcanic fires had thrown up a colossal mound of cinders burned forever to the hues of the setting sun in every light and shade of day it held true to its name farther north rose the bold bulk of the san francisco peaks that half lost in the clouds still dominated the desert scene then as carley gazed the rifts began to close another transformation began the reverse of what she watched the golden radiance of sunrise vanished and under a gray lowering coalescing pall of cloud the round hills returned to their bleak somberness and the green desert took again its cold sheen  wasnt it fine carley asked glenn but nothing to what you will experience i hope you stay till the weather gets warm i want you to see a summer dawn on the painted desert and a noon with the great white clouds rolling up from the horizon and a sunset of massed purple and gold if they do not get you then ill give up  carley murmured something of her appreciation of what she had just seen part of his remark hung on her ear thoughtprovoking and disturbing he hoped she would stay until summer that was kind of him but her visit must be short and she now intended it to end with his return east with her if she did not persuade him to go he might not want to go for a while as he had writtenjust yet carley grew troubled in mind such mental disturbance however lasted no longer than her return with glenn to camp where the mustang spillbeans stood ready for her to mount he appeared to put one ear up the other down and to look at her with mild surprise as if to say whathellotenderfoot are you going to ride me again  carley recalled that she had avowed she would ride him there was no alternative and her misgivings only made matters worse nevertheless once in the saddle she imagined she had the hallucination that to ride off so with the long open miles ahead was really thrilling this remarkable state of mind lasted until spillbeans began to trot and then another day of misery beckoned to carley with gray stretches of distance  she was to learn that misery as well as bliss can swallow up the hours she saw the monotony of cedar trees but with blurred eyes she saw the ground clearly enough for she was always looking down hoping for sandy places or rocky places where her mustang could not trot  at noon the cavalcade ahead halted near a cabin and corral which turned out to be a sheep ranch belonging to hutter here glenn was so busy that he had no time to devote to carley and flo who was more at home on a horse than on the ground rode around everywhere with the men most assuredly carley could not pass by the chance to get off spillbeans and to walk a little she found however that what she wanted most was to rest the cabin was deserted a dark damp place with a rank odor she did not stay long inside  rain and snow began to fall adding to what carley felt to be a disagreeable prospect the immediate present however was cheered by a cup of hot soup and some bread and butter which the herder charley brought her by and by glenn and hutter returned with flo and all partook of some lunch  all too soon carley found herself astride the mustang again glenn helped her don the slicker an abominable sticky rubber coat that bundled her up and tangled her feet round the stirrups she was glad to find though that it served well indeed to protect her from raw wind and rain  where do we go from here carley inquired ironically  glenn laughed in a way which proved to carley that he knew perfectly well how she felt again his smile caused her selfreproach plain indeed was it that he had really expected more of her in the way of complaint and less of fortitude carley bit her lips  thus began the afternoon ride as it advanced the sky grew more threatening the wind rawer the cold keener and the rain cut like little bits of sharp ice it blew in carleys face enough snow fell to whiten the open patches of ground in an hour carley realized that she had the hardest task of her life to ride to the end of the days journey no one could have guessed her plight glenn complimented her upon her adaptation to such unpleasant conditions flo evidently was on the lookout for the tenderfoots troubles but as spillbeans had taken to lagging at a walk carley was enabled to conceal all outward sign of her woes it rained hailed sleeted snowed and grew colder all the time carleys feet became lumps of ice every step the mustang took sent acute pains ramifying from bruised and raw places all over her body  once finding herself behind the others and out of sight in the cedars she got off to walk awhile leading the mustang this would not do however because she fell too far in the rear mounting again she rode on beginning to feel that nothing mattered that this trip would be the end of carley burch how she hated that dreary cold flat land the road bisected without end it felt as if she rode hours to cover a mile in open stretches she saw the whole party straggling along separated from one another and each for himself they certainly could not be enjoying themselves carley shut her eyes clutched the pommel of the saddle trying to support her weight how could she endure another mile alas there might be many miles suddenly a terrible shock seemed to rack her but it was only that spillbeans had once again taken to a trot frantically she pulled on the bridle he was not to be thwarted opening her eyes she saw a cabin far ahead which probably was the destination for the night carley knew she would never reach it yet she clung on desperately what she dreaded was the return of that stablike pain in her side it came and life seemed something abject and monstrous she rode stiff legged with her hands propping her stiffly above the pommel but the stabbing pain went right on and in deeper when the mustang halted his trot beside the other horses carley was in the last extremity yet as glenn came to her offering a hand she still hid her agony then flo called out gayly carley youve done twentyfive miles on as rotten a day as i remember shore we all hand it to you and im confessing i didnt think youd ever stay the ride out spillbeans is the meanest nag weve got and he has the hardest gait    chapter v  later carley leaned back in a comfortable seat before a blazing fire that happily sent its acrid smoke up the chimney pondering ideas in her mind  there could be a relation to familiar things that was astounding in its revelation to get off a horse that had tortured her to discover an almost insatiable appetite to rest weary aching body before the genial warmth of a beautiful firethese were experiences which carley found to have been hitherto unknown delights it struck her suddenly and strangely that to know the real truth about anything in life might require infinite experience and understanding how could one feel immense gratitude and relief or the delight of satisfying acute hunger or the sweet comfort of rest unless there had been circumstances of extreme contrast she had been compelled to suffer cruelly on horseback in order to make her appreciate how good it was to get down on the ground otherwise she never would have known she wondered then how true that principle might be in all experience it gave strong food for thought there were things in the world never before dreamed of in her philosophy  carley was wondering if she were narrow and dense to circumstances of life differing from her own when a remark of flos gave pause to her reflections  shore the worst is yet to come flo had drawled  carley wondered if this distressing statement had to do in some way with the rest of the trip she stifled her curiosity painful knowledge of that sort would come quickly enough  flo are you girls going to sleep here in the cabin inquired glenn  shore its cold and wet outside replied flo  well felix the mexican herder told me some navajos had been bunking here  navajos you mean indians interposed carley with interest  shore do said flo i knew that but dont mind glenn hes full of tricks carley hed give us a hunch to lie out in the wet  hutter burst into his hearty laugh wal id rather get some things any day than a bad cold  shore ive had both replied flo in her easy drawl and id prefer the cold but for carleys sake  pray dont consider me said carley the rather crude drift of the conversation affronted her  well my dear put in glenn its a bad night outside well all make our beds here  glenn you shore are a nervy fellow drawled flo  long after everybody was in bed carley lay awake in the blackness of the cabin sensitively fidgeting and quivering over imaginative contact with creeping things the fire had died out a cold air passed through the room on the roof pattered gusts of rain carley heard a rustling of mice it did not seem possible that she could keep awake yet she strove to do so but her pangs of body her extreme fatigue soon yielded to the quiet and rest of her bed engendering a drowsiness that proved irresistible  morning brought fair weather and sunshine which helped to sustain carley in her effort to brave out her pains and woes another disagreeable day would have forced her to humiliating defeat fortunately for her the business of the men was concerned with the immediate neighborhood in which they expected to stay all morning  flo after a while persuade carley to ride with you to the top of this first foothill said glenn its not far and its worth a good deal to see the painted desert from there the day is clear and the air free from dust  shore leave it to me i want to get out of camp anyhow that conceited hombre lee stanton will be riding in here answered flo laconically  the slight knowing smile on glenns face and the grinning disbelief on mr hutters were facts not lost upon carley and when charley the herder deliberately winked at carley she conceived the idea that flo like many women only ran off to be pursued in some manner carley did not seek to analyze the purported advent of this lee stanton pleased her but she did admit to her consciousness that women herself included were both as deep and mysterious as the sea yet as transparent as an inch of crystal water  it happened that the expected newcomer rode into camp before anyone left before he dismounted he made a good impression on carley and as he stepped down in lazy graceful action a tall lithe figure she thought him singularly handsome he wore black sombrero flannel shirt blue jeans stuffed into high boots and long bigroweled spurs  how are youall was his greeting  from the talk that ensued between him and the men carley concluded that he must be overseer of the sheep hands carley knew that hutter and glenn were not interested in cattle raising and in fact they were especially hutter somewhat inimical to the dominance of the range land by cattle barons of flagstaff  whens ryan goin to dip asked hutter  today or tomorrow replied stanton  reckon we ought to ride over went on hutter say glenn do you reckon miss carley could stand a sheepdip  this was spoken in a low tone scarcely intended for carley but she had keen ears and heard distinctly not improbably this sheepdip was what flo meant as the worst to come carley adopted a listless posture to hide her keen desire to hear what glenn would reply to hutter  i should say not whispered glenn fiercely  cut out that talk shell hear you and want to go  whereupon carley felt mount in her breast an intense and rebellious determination to see a sheepdip she would astonish glenn what did he want anyway had she not withstood the torturing trot of the hardestgaited horse on the range carley realized she was going to place considerable store upon that feat it grew on her  when the consultation of the men ended lee stanton turned to flo and carley did not need to see the young man look twice to divine what ailed him he was caught in the toils of love but seeing through flo hutter was entirely another matter  howdy lee she said coolly with her clear eyes on him a tiny frown knitted her brow she did not at the moment entirely approve of him  shore am glad to see you flo he said with rather a heavy expulsion of breath he wore a cheerful grin that in no wise deceived flo or carley either the young man had a furtive expression of eye  ahuh returned flo  i was shore sorry aboutabout that he floundered in low voice  about what  aw you know flo  carley strolled out of hearing sure of two thingsthat she felt rather sorry for stanton and that his course of love did not augur well for smooth running what queer creatures were women carley had seen several million coquettes she believed and assuredly flo hutter belonged to the species  upon carleys return to the cabin she found stanton and flo waiting for her to accompany them on a ride up the foothill she was so stiff and sore that she could hardly mount into the saddle and the first mile of riding was something like a nightmare she lagged behind flo and stanton who apparently forgot her in their quarrel  the riders soon struck the base of a long incline of rocky ground that led up to the slope of the foothill here rocks and gravel gave place to black cinders out of which grew a scant bleached grass this desert verdure was what lent the soft gray shade to the foothill when seen from a distance the slope was gentle so that the ascent did not entail any hardship carley was amazed at the length of the slope and also to see how high over the desert she was getting she felt lifted out of a monotonous level a greengray leaguelong cedar forest extended down toward oak creek behind her the magnificent bulk of the mountains reached up into the stormy clouds showing white slopes of snow under the gray pall  the hoofs of the horses sank in the cinders a fine choking dust assailed carleys nostrils presently when there appeared at least a third of the ascent still to be accomplished and flo dismounted to walk leading their horses carley had no choice but to do likewise at first walking was a relief soon however the soft yielding cinders began to drag at her feet at every step she slipped back a few inches a very annoying feature of climbing when her legs seemed to grow dead carley paused for a little rest the last of the ascent over a few hundred yards of looser cinders taxed her remaining strength to the limit she grew hot and wet and out of breath her heart labored an unreasonable antipathy seemed to attend her efforts only her ridiculous vanity held her to this task she wanted to please glenn but not so earnestly that she would have kept on plodding up this ghastly bare mound of cinders carley did not mind being a tenderfoot but she hated the thought of these westerners considering her a weakling so she bore the pain of raw blisters and the miserable sensation of staggering on under a leaden weight  several times she noted that flo and stanton halted to face each other in rather heated argument at least stantons red face and forceful gestures attested to heat on his part flo evidently was weary of argument and in answer to a sharp reproach she retorted shore i was different after he came to which stanton responded by a quick passionate shrinking as if he had been stung  carley had her own reaction to this speech she could not help hearing and inwardly at least her feeling must have been similar to stantons she forgot the object of this climb and looked off to her right at the green level without really seeing it a vague sadness weighed upon her soul was there to be a tangle of fates here a conflict of wills a crossing of loves flos terse confession could not be taken lightly did she mean that she loved glenn carley began to fear it only another reason why she must persuade glenn to go back east but the closer carley came to what she divined must be an ordeal the more she dreaded it this raw crude west might have confronted her with a situation beyond her control and as she dragged her weighted feet through the cinders kicking up little puffs of black dust she felt what she admitted to be an unreasonable resentment toward these westerners and their barren isolated and boundless world  carley called flo comelooksee as the indians say here is glenns painted desert and i reckon its shore worth seeing  to carleys surprise she found herself upon the knob of the foothill and when she looked out across a suddenly distinguishable void she seemed struck by the immensity of something she was unable to grasp she dropped her bridle she gazed slowly as if drawn hearing flos voice  that thin green line of cottonwoods down there is the little colorado river flo was saying reckon its sixty miles all down hill the painted desert begins there and also the navajo reservation you see the white strips the red veins the yellow bars the black lines they are all desert steps leading up and up for miles that sharp black peak is called wildcat its about a hundred miles you see the desert stretching away to the right growing dimlost in distance we dont know that country but that north country we know as landmarks anyway look at that sawtooth range the indians call it echo cliffs at the far end it drops off into the colorado river lees ferry is thereabout one hundred and sixty miles that ragged black rent is the grand canyon looks like a thread doesnt it but carley its some hole believe me away to the left you see the tremendous wall rising and turning to come this way thats the north wall of the canyon it ends at the great bluffgreenland point see the black fringe above the bar of gold thats a belt of pine trees its about eighty miles across this ragged old stone washboard of a desert  now turn and look straight and strain your sight over wildcat see the rim purple dome you must look hard im glad its clear and the sun is shining we dont often get this view that purple dome is navajo mountain two hundred miles and more away  carley yielded to some strange drawing power and slowly walked forward until she stood at the extreme edge of the summit  what was it that confounded her sight desert slopedown and downcolordistancespace the wind that blew in her face seemed to have the openness of the whole world back of it cold sweet dry exhilarating it breathed of untainted vastness carleys memory pictures of the adirondacks faded into pastorals her vaunted images of european scenery changed to operetta settings she had nothing with which to compare this illimitable space  ohamerica was her unconscious tribute  stanton and flo had come on to places beside her the young man laughed wal now miss carley you couldnt say more when i was in camp trainin for service overseas i used to remember how this looked an it seemed one of the things i was goin to fight for reckon i didnt the idea of the germans havin my painted desert i didnt get across to fight for it but i shore was willin  you see carley this is our america said flo softly  carley had never understood the meaning of the word the immensity of the west seemed flung at her what her vision beheld so farreaching and boundless was only a dot on the map  does any one liveout there she asked with slow sweep of hand  a few white traders and some indian tribes replied stanton but you can ride all day an next day an never see a livin soul  what was the meaning of the gratification in his voice did westerners court loneliness carley wrenched her gaze from the desert void to look at her companions stantons eyes were narrowed his expression had changed lean and hard and still his face resembled bronze the careless humor was gone as was the heated flush of his quarrel with flo the girl too had subtly changed had responded to an influence that had subdued and softened her she was mute her eyes held a light comprehensive and allembracing she was beautiful then for carley quick to read emotion caught a glimpse of a strong steadfast soul that spiritualized the brown freckled face  carley wheeled to gaze out and down into this incomprehensible abyss and on to the far upflung heights white and red and yellow and so on to the wonderful mystic haze of distance the significance of flos designation of miles could not be grasped by carley she could not estimate distance but she did not need that to realize her perceptions were swallowed up by magnitude hitherto the power of her eyes had been unknown how splendid to see afar she could seeyesbut what did she see space first annihilating space dwarfing her preconceived images and then wondrous colors what had she known of color no wonder artists failed adequately and truly to paint mountains let alone the desert space the toiling millions of the crowded cities were ignorant of this terrible beauty and sublimity would it have helped them to see but just to breathe that untainted air just to see once the boundless open of colored sand and rockto realize what the freedom of eagles meant would not that have helped anyone  and with the thought there came to carleys quickened and struggling mind a conception of freedom she had not yet watched eagles but she now gazed out into their domain what then must be the effect of such environment on people whom it encompassed the idea stunned carley would such people grow in proportion to the nature with which they were in conflict hereditary influence could not be comparable to such environment in the shaping of character  shore i could stand here all day said flo but its beginning to cloud over and this high wind is cold so wed better go carley  i dont know what i am but its not cold replied carley  wal miss carley i reckon youll have to come again an again before you get a comfortable feelin here said stanton  it surprised carley to see that this young westerner had hit upon the truth he understood her indeed she was uncomfortable she was oppressed vaguely unhappy but why the thing therethe infinitude of open sand and rockwas beautiful wonderful even glorious she looked again  steep blackcindered slope with its soft gray patches of grass sheered down and down and out in rolling slope to merge upon a cedardotted level nothing moved below but a redtailed hawk sailed across her vision how stillhow gray the desert floor as it reached away losing its black dots and gaining bronze spots of stone by plain and prairie it fell away each inch of gray in her sight magnifying into its leaguelong roll on and on and down across dark lines that were steppes and at last blocked and changed by the meandering green thread which was the verdure of a desert river beyond stretched the white sand where whirlwinds of dust sent aloft their funnelshaped spouts and it led up to the horizonwide ribs and ridges of red and walls of yellow and mountains of black to the dim mound of purple so ethereal and mystic against the deepblue cloudcurtained band of sky  and on the moment the sun was obscured and that world of colorful flame went out as if a blaze had died  deprived of its fire the desert seemed to retreat to fade coldly and gloomily to lose its great landmarks in dim obscurity closer around to the north the canyon country yawned with innumerable gray jaws ragged and hard and the riven earth took on a different character it had no shadows it grew flat and like the sea seemed to mirror the vast gray cloud expanse the sublime vanished but the desolate remained no warmthno movementno life dead stone it was cut into a million ruts by ruthless ages carley felt that she was gazing down into chaos  at this moment as before a hawk had crossed her vision so now a raven sailed by black as coal uttering a hoarse croak  quoth the raven murmured carley with a halfbitter laugh as she turned away shuddering in spite of an effort of selfcontrol maybe he meant this wonderful and terrible west is never for such as i come let us go  carley rode all that afternoon in the rear of the caravan gradually succumbing to the cold raw wind and the aches and pains to which she had subjected her flesh nevertheless she finished the days journey and sorely as she needed glenns kindly hand she got off her horse without aid  camp was made at the edge of the devastated timber zone that carley had found so dispiriting a few melancholy pines were standing and everywhere as far as she could see southward were blackened fallen trees and stumps it was a dreary scene the few cattle grazing on the bleached grass appeared as melancholy as the pines the sun shone fitfully at sunset and then sank leaving the land to twilight and shadows  once in a comfortable seat beside the camp fire carley had no further desire to move she was so far exhausted and weary that she could no longer appreciate the blessing of rest appetite too failed her this meal time darkness soon settled down the wind moaned through the pines she was indeed glad to crawl into bed and not even the thought of skunks could keep her awake  morning disclosed the fact that gray clouds had been blown away the sun shone bright upon a whitefrosted land the air was still carley labored at her task of rising and brushing her hair and pulling on her boots and it appeared her former sufferings were as naught compared with the pangs of this morning how she hated the cold the bleak denuded forest land the emptiness the roughness the crudeness if this sort of feeling grew any worse she thought she would hate glenn yet she was nonetheless set upon going on and seeing the sheepdip and riding that fiendish mustang until the trip was ended  getting in the saddle and on the way this morning was an ordeal that made carley actually sick glenn and flo both saw how it was with her and they left her to herself carley was grateful for this understanding it seemed to proclaim their respect she found further matter for satisfaction in the astonishing circumstance that after the first dreadful quarter of an hour in the saddle she began to feel easier and at the end of several hours of riding she was not suffering any particular pain though she was weaker  at length the cutover land ended in a forest of straggling pines through which the road wound southward and eventually down into a wide shallow canyon through the trees carley saw a stream of water open fields of green log fences and cabins and blue smoke she heard the chug of a gasoline engine and the baabaa of sheep glenn waited for her to catch up with him and he said carley this is one of hutters sheep camps its not aa very pleasant place you wont care to see the sheepdip so im suggesting you wait here  nothing doing glenn she interrupted im going to see what there is to see  but dearthe menthe way they handle sheeptheyllreally its no sight for you he floundered  why not she inquired eying him  because carleyyou know how you hate thethe seamy side of things and the stenchwhy itll make you sick  glenn be on the level she said suppose it does wouldnt you think more of me if i could stand it  why yes he replied reluctantly smiling at her i would but i wanted to spare you this trip has been hard im sure proud of you and carleyyou can overdo it spunk is not everything you simply couldnt stand this  glenn how little you know a woman she exclaimed come along and show me your old sheepdip  they rode out of the woods into an open valley that might have been picturesque if it had not been despoiled by the work of man a log fence ran along the edge of open ground and a mud dam held back a pool of stagnant water slimy and green as carley rode on the baabaa of sheep became so loud that she could scarcely hear glenn talking  several log cabins rough hewn and gray with age stood down inside the inclosure and beyond there were large corrals from the other side of these corrals came sounds of rough voices of men a trampling of hoofs heavy splashes the beat of an engine and the incessant baaing of the sheep  at this point the members of hutters party dismounted and tied their horses to the top log of the fence when carley essayed to get off glenn tried to stop her saying she could see well enough from there but carley got down and followed flo she heard hutter call to glenn say ryan is short of men well lend a hand for a couple of hours  presently carley reached flos side and the first corral that contained sheep they formed a compact woolly mass rather white in color with a tinge of pink when flo climbed up on the fence the flock plunged as one animal and with a trampling roar ran to the far side of the corral several old rams with wide curling horns faced around and some of the ewes climbed up on the densely packed mass carley rather enjoyed watching them she surely could not see anything amiss in this sight  the next corral held a like number of sheep and also several mexicans who were evidently driving them into a narrow lane that led farther down carley saw the heads of men above other corral fences and there was also a thick yellowish smoke rising from somewhere  carley are you game to see the dip asked flo with good nature that yet had a touch of taunt in it  thats my middle name retorted carley flippantly  both glenn and this girl seemed to be bent upon bringing out carleys worst side and they were succeeding flo laughed the ready slang pleased her  she led carley along that log fence through a huge open gate and across a wide pen to another fence which she scaled carley followed her not particularly overanxious to look ahead some thick odor had begun to reach carleys delicate nostrils flo led down a short lane and climbed another fence and sat astride the top log carley hurried along to clamber up to her side but stood erect with her feet on the second log of the fence  then a horrible stench struck carley almost like a blow in the face and before her confused sight there appeared to be drifting smoke and active men and running sheep all against a background of mud but at first it was the odor that caused carley to close her eyes and press her knees hard against the upper log to keep from reeling never in her life had such a sickening nausea assailed her it appeared to attack her whole body the forerunning qualm of seasickness was as nothing to this carley gave a gasp pinched her nose between her fingers so she could not smell and opened her eyes  directly beneath her was a small pen open at one end into which sheep were being driven from the larger corral the drivers were yelling the sheep in the rear plunged into those ahead of them forcing them on two men worked in this small pen one was a brawny giant in undershirt and overalls that appeared filthy he held a cloth in his hand and strode toward the nearest sheep folding the cloth round the neck of the sheep he dragged it forward with an ease which showed great strength and threw it into a pit that yawned at the side souse went the sheep into a murky muddy pool and disappeared but suddenly its head came up and then its shoulders and it began half to walk and half swim down what appeared to be a narrow boxlike ditch that contained other floundering sheep then carley saw men on each side of this ditch bending over with poles that had crooks at the end and their work was to press and pull the sheep along to the end of the ditch and drive them up a boarded incline into another corral where many other sheep huddled now a dirty muddy color like the liquid into which they had been emersed souse splash in went sheep after sheep occasionally one did not go under and then a man would press it under with the crook and quickly lift its head the work went on with precision and speed in spite of the yells and trampling and baabaas and the incessant action that gave an effect of confusion  carley saw a pipe leading from a huge boiler to the ditch the dark fluid was running out of it from a rusty old engine with big smokestack poured the strangling smoke a man broke open a sack of yellow powder and dumped it into the ditch then he poured an acidlike liquid after it  sulphur and nicotine yelled flo up at carley the dips poison if a sheep opens his mouth hes usually a goner but sometimes they save one  carley wanted to tear herself away from this disgusting spectacle but it held her by some fascination she saw glenn and hutter fall in line with the other men and work like beavers these two pacemakers in the small pen kept the sheep coming so fast that every worker below had a task cut out for him suddenly flo squealed and pointed  there that sheep didnt come up she cried shore he opened his mouth  then carley saw glenn energetically plunge his hooked pole in and out and around until he had located the submerged sheep he lifted its head above the dip the sheep showed no sign of life down on his knees dropped glenn to reach the sheep with strong brown hands and to haul it up on the ground where it flopped inert glenn pummeled it and pressed it and worked on it much as carley had seen a lifeguard work over a halfdrowned man but the sheep did not respond to glenns active administrations  no use glenn yelled hutter hoarsely that ones a goner  carley did not fail to note the state of glenns hands and arms and overalls when he returned to the ditch work then back and forth carleys gaze went from one end to the other of that scene and suddenly it was arrested and held by the huge fellow who handled the sheep so brutally every time he dragged one and threw it into the pit he yelled ho ho carley was impelled to look at his face and she was amazed to meet the rawest and boldest stare from evil eyes that had ever been her misfortune to incite she felt herself stiffen with a shock that was unfamiliar this man was scarcely many years older than glenn yet he had grizzled hair a seamed and scarred visage coarse thick lips and beetling brows from under which peered gleaming light eyes at every turn he flashed them upon carleys face her neck the swell of her bosom it was instinct that caused her hastily to close her riding coat she felt as if her flesh had been burned like a snake he fascinated her the intelligence in his bold gaze made the beastliness of it all the harder to endure all the stronger to arouse  come carley lets rustle out of this stinkin mess cried flo  indeed carley needed flos assistance in clambering down out of the choking smoke and horrid odor  adios pretty eyes called the big man from the pen  well ejaculated flo when they got out ill bet i call glenn good and hard for letting you go down there  it wasmyfault panted carley i said id stand it  oh youre game all right i didnt mean the dip that sheepslinger is haze ruff the toughest hombre on this range shore now wouldnt i like to take a shot at him im going to tell dad and glenn  please dont returned carley appealingly  i shore am dad needs hands these days thats why hes lenient but glenn will cowhide ruff and i want to see him do it  in flo hutter then carley saw another and a different spirit of the west a violence unrestrained and fierce that showed in the girls even voice and in the piercing light of her eyes  they went back to the horses got their lunches from the saddlebags and finding comfortable seats in a sunny protected place they ate and talked carley had to force herself to swallow it seemed that the horrid odor of dip and sheep had permeated everything glenn had known her better than she had known herself and he had wished to spare her an unnecessary and disgusting experience yet so stubborn was carley that she did not regret going through with it  carley i dont mind telling you that youve stuck it out better than any tenderfoot we ever had here said flo  thank you that from a western girl is a compliment ill not soon forget replied carley  i shore mean it weve had rotten weather and to end the little trip at this sheepdip hole why glenn certainly wanted you to stack up against the real thing  flo he did not want me to come on the trip and especially here protested carley  shore i know but he let you  neither glenn nor any other man could prevent me from doing what i wanted to do  well if youll excuse me drawled flo ill differ with you i reckon glenn kilbourne is not the man you knew before the war  no he is not but that does not alter the case  carley were not well acquainted went on flo more carefully feeling her way and im not your kind i dont know your eastern ways but i know what the west does to a man the war ruined your friendboth his body and mind how sorry mother and i were for glenn those days when it looked hed sure go west for good did you know hed been gassed and that he had five hemorrhages  oh i knew his lungs had been weakened by gas but he never told me about having hemorrhages  well he shore had them the last one ill never forget every time hed cough it would fetch the blood i could tell oh it was awful i begged him not to cough he smiledlike a ghost smilingand he whispered ill quit and he did the doctor came from flagstaff and packed him in ice glenn sat propped up all night and never moved a muscle never coughed again and the bleeding stopped after that we put him out on the porch where he could breathe fresh air all the time theres something wonderfully healing in arizona air its from the dry desert and here its full of cedar and pine anyway glenn got well and i think the west has cured his mind too  of what queried carley in an intense curiosity she could scarcely hide  oh god only knows exclaimed flo throwing up her gloved hands i never could understand but i hated what the war did to him  carley leaned back against the log quite spent flo was unwittingly torturing her carley wanted passionately to give in to jealousy of this western girl but she could not do it flo hutter deserved better than that and carleys baser nature seemed in conflict with all that was noble in her the victory did not yet go to either side this was a bad hour for carley her strength had about played out and her spirit was at low ebb  carley youre all in declared flo you neednt deny it im shore youve made good with me as a tenderfoot who stayed the limit but theres no sense in your killing yourself nor in me letting you so im going to tell dad we want to go home  she left carley there the word home had struck strangely into carleys mind and remained there suddenly she realized what it was to be homesick the comfort the ease the luxury the rest the sweetness the pleasure the cleanliness the gratification to eye and earto all the senseshow these thoughts came to haunt her all of carleys will power had been needed to sustain her on this trip to keep her from miserably failing she had not failed but contact with the west had affronted disgusted shocked and alienated her in that moment she could not be fair minded she knew it she did not care  carley gazed around her only one of the cabins was in sight from this position evidently it was a home for some of these men on one side the peaked rough roof had been built out beyond the wall evidently to serve as a kind of porch on that wall hung the motliest assortment of things carley had ever seenutensils sheep and cow hides saddles harness leather clothes ropes old sombreros shovels stove pipe and many other articles for which she could find no name the most striking characteristic manifest in this collection was that of service how they had been used they had enabled people to live under primitive conditions somehow this fact inhibited carleys sense of repulsion at their rude and uncouth appearance had any of her forefathers ever been pioneers carley did not know but the thought was disturbing it was thoughtprovoking many times at home when she was dressing for dinner she had gazed into the mirror at the graceful lines of her throat and arms at the proud poise of her head at the alabaster whiteness of her skin and wonderingly she had asked of her image can it be possible that i am a descendant of cavemen she had never been able to realize it yet she knew it was true perhaps somewhere not far back along her line there had been a greatgreatgrandmother who had lived some kind of a primitive life using such implements and necessaries as hung on this cabin wall and thereby helped some man to conquer the wilderness to live in it and reproduce his kind like flashes glenns words came back to carleywork and children  some interpretation of his meaning and how it related to this hour held aloof from carley if she would ever be big enough to understand it and broad enough to accept it the time was far distant just now she was sore and sick physically and therefore certainly not in a receptive state of mind yet how could she have keener impressions than these she was receiving it was all a problem she grew tired of thinking but even then her mind pondered on a stream of consciousness over which she had no control this dreary woods was deserted no birds no squirrels no creatures such as fancy anticipated in another direction across the canyon she saw cattle gaunt ragged lumbering and stolid and on the moment the scent of sheep came on the breeze time seemed to stand still here and what carley wanted most was for the hours and days to fly so that she would be home again  at last flo returned with the men one quick glance at glenn convinced carley that flo had not yet told him about the sheep dipper haze ruff  carley youre a real sport declared glenn with the rare smile she loved its a dreadful mess and to think you stood it why old fifth avenue if you needed to make another hit with me youve done it  his warmth amazed and pleased carley she could not quite understand why it would have made any difference to him whether she had stood the ordeal or not but then every day she seemed to drift a little farther from a real understanding of her lover his praise gladdened her and fortified her to face the rest of this ride back to oak creek  four hours later in a twilight so shadowy that no one saw her distress carley half slipped and half fell from her horse and managed somehow to mount the steps and enter the bright living room a cheerful red fire blazed on the hearth glenns hound moze trembled eagerly at sight of her and looked up with humble dark eyes the whiteclothed dinner table steamed with savory dishes flo stood before the blaze warming her hands lee stanton leaned against the mantel with eyes on her and every line of his lean hard face expressed his devotion to her hutter was taking his seat at the head of the table come an get ityouall he called heartily mrs hutters face beamed with the spirit of that home and lastly carley saw glenn waiting for her watching her come true in this very moment to his stern hope for her and pride in her as she dragged her weary spent body toward him and the bright fire  by these signs or the effect of them carley vaguely realized that she was incalculably changing that this carley burch had become a vastly bigger person in the sight of her friends and strangely in her own a lesser creature    chapter vi  if spring came at all to oak creek canyon it warmed into summer before carley had time to languish with the fever characteristic of early june in the east  as if by magic it seemed the green grass sprang up the green buds opened into leaves the bluebells and primroses bloomed the apple and peach blossoms burst exquisitely white and pink against the blue sky oak creek fell to a transparent beautiful brook leisurely eddying in the stone walled nooks hurrying with murmur and babble over the little falls the mornings broke clear and fragrantly cool the noon hours seemed to lag under a hot sun the nights fell like dark mantles from the melancholy starsown sky  carley had stubbornly kept on riding and climbing until she killed her secret doubt that she was really a thoroughbred until she satisfied her own insistent vanity that she could train to a point where this outdoor life was not too much for her strength she lost flesh despite increase of appetite she lost her pallor for a complexion of goldbrown she knew her eastern friends would admire she wore out the blisters and aches and pains she found herself growing firmer of muscle lither of line deeper of chest and in addition to these physical manifestations there were subtle intimations of a delight in a freedom of body she had never before known of an exhilaration in action that made her hot and made her breathe of a sloughing off of numberless petty and fussy and luxurious little superficialities which she had supposed were necessary to her happiness what she had undertaken in vain conquest of glenns pride and flo hutters western tolerance she had found to be a boomerang she had won glenns admiration she had won the western girls recognition but her passionate stubborn desire had been ignoble and was proved so by the rebound of her achievement coming home to her with a sweetness she had not the courage to accept she forced it from her this west with its rawness its ruggedness she hated  nevertheless the june days passed growing dreamily swift growing more incomprehensibly full and still she had not broached to glenn the main object of her visitto take him back east yet a little while longer she hated his work and had not talked of that yet an honest consciousness told her that as time flew by she feared more and more to tell him that he was wasting his life there and that she could not bear it still was he wasting it once in a while a timid and unfamiliar carley burch voiced a pregnant query perhaps what held carley back most was the happiness she achieved in her walks and rides with glenn she lingered because of them every day she loved him more and yetthere was something was it in her or in him she had a womans assurance of his love and sometimes she caught her breathso sweet and strong was the tumultuous emotion it stirred she preferred to enjoy while she could to dream instead of think but it was not possible to hold a blank dreamy lulled consciousness all the time thought would return and not always could she drive away a feeling that glenn would never be her slave she divined something in his mind that kept him gentle and kindly restrained always sometimes melancholy and aloof as if he were an impassive destiny waiting for the iron consequences he knew inevitably must fall what was this that he knew which she did not know the idea haunted her perhaps it was that which compelled her to use all her womans wiles and charms on glenn still though it thrilled her to see she made him love her more as the days passed she could not blind herself to the truth that no softness or allurement of hers changed this strange restraint in him how that baffled her was it resistance or knowledge or nobility or doubt  flo hutters twentieth birthday came along the middle of june and all the neighbors and range hands for miles around were invited to celebrate it  for the second time during her visit carley put on the white gown that had made flo gasp with delight and had stunned mrs hutter and had brought a reluctant compliment from glenn carley liked to create a sensation what were exquisite and expensive gowns for if not that  it was twilight on this particular june night when she was ready to go downstairs and she tarried a while on the long porch the evening star so lonely and radiant so cold and passionless in the dusky blue had become an object she waited for and watched the same as she had come to love the dreaming murmuring melody of the waterfall she lingered there what had the sights and sounds and smells of this wild canyon come to mean to her she could not say but they had changed her immeasurably  her soft slippers made no sound on the porch and as she turned the corner of the house where shadows hovered thick she heard lee stantons voice  but flo you loved me before kilbourne came  the content the pathos of his voice chained carley to the spot some situations like fate were beyond resisting  shore i did replied flo dreamily this was the voice of a girl who was being confronted by happy and sad thoughts on her birthday  dont youlove mestill he asked huskily  why of course lee i dont change she said  but then why there for the moment his utterance or courage failed  lee do you want the honest to gods truth  i reckoni do  well i love you just as i always did replied flo earnestly but lee i love him more than you or anybody  my heaven floyoull ruin us all he exclaimed hoarsely  no i wont either you cant say im not level headed i hated to tell you this lee but you made me  flo you love me an himtwo men queried stanton incredulously  i shore do she drawled with a soft laugh and its no fun  reckon i dont cut much of a figure alongside kilbourne said stanton disconsolately  lee you could stand alongside any man replied flo eloquently youre western and youre steady and loyal and youllwell some day youll be like dad could i say more but lee this man is different he is wonderful i cant explain it but i feel it he has been through hells fire oh will i ever forget his ravings when he lay so ill he means more to me than just one man hes american youre american too lee and you trained to be a soldier and you would have made a grand oneif i know old arizona but you were not called to france glenn kilbourne went god only knows what that means but he went and theres the difference i saw the wreck of him i did a little to save his life and his mind i wouldnt be an american girl if i didnt love him oh lee cant you understand  i reckon so im not begrudging glenn whatwhat you care im only afraid ill lose you  i never promised to marry you did i  not in words but kisses ought to  yes kisses mean a lot she replied and so far i stand committed i suppose ill marry you some day and be blamed lucky ill be happy toodont you overlook that hunch you neednt worry glenn is in love with carley shes beautiful richand of his class how could he ever see me  flo you can never tell replied stanton thoughtfully i didnt like her at first but im comin round the thing is flo does she love him as you love him  oh i think soi hope so answered flo as if in distress  im not so shore but then i cant savvy her lord knows i hope so too if she doesntif she goes back east an leaves him herei reckon my case  hush i know shes out here to take him back lets go downstairs now  aw waitflo he begged whats your hurry comegive me  there thats all you get birthday or no birthday replied flo gayly  carley heard the soft kiss and stantons deep breath and then footsteps as they walked away in the gloom toward the stairway carley leaned against the log wall she felt the rough woodsmelled the rusty pine rosin her other hand pressed her bosom where her heart beat with unwonted vigor footsteps and voices sounded beneath her twilight had deepened into night the low murmur of the waterfall and the babble of the brook floated to her strained ears  listeners never heard good of themselves but stantons subtle doubt of any depth to her though it hurt was not so conflicting as the ringing truth of flo hutters love for glenn this unsought knowledge powerfully affected carley she was forewarned and forearmed now it saddened her yet did not lessen her confidence in her hold on glenn but it stirred to perplexing pitch her curiosity in regard to the mystery that seemed to cling round glenns transformation of character this western girl really knew more about glenn than his fiancee knew carley suffered a humiliating shock when she realized that she had been thinking of herself of her love her life her needs her wants instead of glenns it took no keen intelligence or insight into human nature to see that glenn needed her more than she needed him  thus unwontedly stirred and upset and flung back upon pride of herself carley went downstairs to meet the assembled company and never had she shown to greater contrast never had circumstance and state of mind contrived to make her so radiant and gay and unbending she heard many remarks not intended for her farreaching ears an old grizzled westerner remarked to hutter wall shes shore an unbroke filly another of the companya womanremarked sweet an pretty as a columbine but id like her better if she was dressed decent and a gaunt range rider who stood with others at the porch door looking on asked a comrade do you reckon thats style back east to which the other replied mebbe but id gamble theyre short on silk back east an likewise sheriffs  carley received some meed of gratification out of the sensation she created but she did not carry her craving for it to the point of overshadowing flo on the contrary she contrived to have flo share the attention she received she taught flo to dance the foxtrot and got glenn to dance with her then she taught it to lee stanton and when lee danced with flo to the infinite wonder and delight of the onlookers carley experienced her first sincere enjoyment of the evening  her moment came when she danced with glenn it reminded her of days long past and which she wanted to return again despite war tramping and western labors glenn retained something of his old grace and lightness but just to dance with him was enough to swell her heart and for once she grew oblivious to the spectators  glenn would you like to go to the plaza with me again and dance between dinner courses as we used to she whispered up to him  sure i wouldunless morrison knew you were to be there he replied  glenn i would not even see him  any old time you wouldnt see morrison he exclaimed half mockingly  his doubt his tone grated upon her pressing closer to him she said come back and ill prove it  but he laughed and had no answer for her at her own daring words carleys heart had leaped to her lips if he had responded even teasingly she could have burst out with her longing to take him back but silence inhibited her and the moment passed  at the end of that dance hutter claimed glenn in the interest of neighboring sheep men and carley crossing the big living room alone passed close to one of the porch doors some one indistinct in the shadow spoke to her in low voice hello pretty eyes  carley felt a little cold shock go tingling through her but she gave no sign that she had heard she recognized the voice and also the epithet passing to the other side of the room and joining the company there carley presently took a casual glance at the door several men were lounging there one of them was the sheep dipper haze ruff his bold eyes were on her now and his coarse face wore a slight meaning smile as if he understood something about her that was a secret to others carley dropped her eyes but she could not shake off the feeling that wherever she moved this mans gaze followed her the unpleasantness of this incident would have been nothing to carley had she at once forgotten it most unaccountably however she could not make herself unaware of this ruffians attention it did no good for her to argue that she was merely the cynosure of all eyes this ruffs tone and look possessed something heretofore unknown to carley once she was tempted to tell glenn but that would only cause a fight so she kept her counsel she danced again and helped flo entertain her guests and passed that door often and once stood before it deliberately with all the strange and contrary impulse so inscrutable in a woman and never for a moment wholly lost the sense of the mans boldness it dawned upon her at length that the singular thing about this boldness was its difference from any which had ever before affronted her the fools smile meant that he thought she saw his attention and understanding it perfectly had secret delight in it many and various had been the masculine egotisms which had come under her observation but quite beyond carley was this brawny sheep dipper haze ruff once the party broke up and the guests had departed she instantly forgot both man and incident  next day late in the afternoon when carley came out on the porch she was hailed by flo who had just ridden in from down the canyon  hey carley come down i shore have something to tell you she called  carley did not use any time pattering down that rude porch stairway flo was dusty and hot and her chaps carried the unmistakable scent of sheepdip  been over to ryans camp an shore rode hard to beat glenn home drawled flo  why queried carley eagerly  reckon i wanted to tell you something glenn swore he wouldnt let me tell  he makes me tired he thinks you cant stand things  oh has he beenhurt  hes skinned an bruised up some but i reckon hes not hurt  flowhat happened demanded carley anxiously  carley do you know glenn can fight like the devil asked flo  no i dont but i remember he used to be athletic flo you make me nervous did glenn fight  i reckon he did drawled flo  with whom  nobody else but that big hombre haze ruff  oh gasped carley with a violent start thatthat ruffian flo did you seewere you there  i shore was an next to a horse race i like a fight replied the western girl carley why didnt you tell me haze ruff insulted you last night  why flohe only said hello pretty eyes and i let it pass said carley lamely  you never want to let anything pass out west because next time youll get worse this turn your other cheek doesnt go in arizona but we shore thought ruff said worse than that though from him thats aplenty  how did you know  well charley told it he was standing out here by the door last night an he heard ruff speak to you charley thinks a heap of you an i reckon he hates ruff besides charley stretches things he shore riled glenn an i want to say my dear you missed the best thing thats happened since you got here  hurrytell me begged carley feeling the blood come to her face  i rode over to ryans place for dad an when i got there i knew nothing about what ruff said to you began flo and she took hold of carleys hand neither did dad you see glenn hadnt got there yet well just as the men had finished dipping a bunch of sheep glenn came riding down lickety cut  now what the hells wrong with glenn said dad getting up from where we sat  shore i knew glenn was mad though i never before saw him that way he looked sort of grim an black well he rode right down on us an piled off dad yelled at him an so did i but glenn made for the sheep pen you know where we watched haze ruff an lorenzo slinging the sheep into the dip ruff was just about to climb out over the fence when glenn leaped up on it  say ruff he said sort of hard charley an ben tell me they heard you speak disrespectfully to miss burch last night  dad an i ran to the fence but before we could catch hold of glenn hed jumped down into the pen  im not carin much for what them herders say replied ruff  do you deny it demanded glenn  i aint denyin nothin kilbourne growled ruff i might argue against me bein disrespectful thats a matter of opinion  youll apologize for speaking to miss burch or ill beat you up an have hutter fire you  wal kilbourne i never eat my words replied ruff  then glenn knocked him flat you ought to have heard that crack sounded like charley hitting a steer with a club dad yelled look out glenn he packs a gunruff got up mad clear through i reckon then they mixed it ruff got in some swings but he couldnt reach glenns face an glenn batted him right an left every time in his ugly mug ruff got all bloody an he cussed something awful glenn beat him against the fence an then we all saw ruff reach for a gun or knife all the men yelled an shore i screamed but glenn saw as much as we saw he got fiercer he beat ruff down to his knees an swung on him hard deliberately knocked ruff into the dip ditch what a splash it wet all of us ruff went out of sight then he rolled up like a huge hog we were all scared now that dips rank poison you know reckon ruff knew that he floundered along an crawled up at the end anyone could see that he had mouth an eyes tight shut he began to grope an feel around trying to find the way to the pond one of the men led him out it was great to see him wade in the water an wallow an souse his head under when he came out the men got in front of him any stopped him he shore looked bad an glenn called to him ruff that sheepdip wont go through your tough hide but a bullet will   not long after this incident carley started out on her usual afternoon ride having arranged with glenn to meet her on his return from work  toward the end of june carley had advanced in her horsemanship to a point where flo lent her one of her own mustangs this change might not have had all to do with a wonderful difference in riding but it seemed so to carley there was as much difference in horses as in people this mustang she had ridden of late was of navajo stock but he had been born and raised and broken at oak creek carley had not yet discovered any objection on his part to do as she wanted him to he liked what she liked and most of all he liked to go his color resembled a pattern of calico and in accordance with western ways his name was therefore calico left to choose his own gait calico always dropped into a gentle pace which was so easy and comfortable and swinging that carley never tired of it moreover he did not shy at things lying in the road or rabbits darting from bushes or at the upwhirring of birds carley had grown attached to calico before she realized she was drifting into it and for carley to care for anything or anybody was a serious matter because it did not happen often and it lasted she was exceedingly tenacious of affection  june had almost passed and summer lay upon the lonely land such perfect and wonderful weather had never before been carleys experience the dawns broke cool fresh fragrant sweet and rosy with a breeze that seemed of heaven rather than earth and the air seemed tremulously full of the murmur of falling water and the melody of mocking birds at the solemn noontides the great white sun glared down hotso hot that it burned the skin yet strangely was a pleasant burn the waning afternoons were carleys especial torment when it seemed the sounds and winds of the day were tiring and all things were seeking repose and life must soften to an unthinking happiness these hours troubled carley because she wanted them to last and because she knew for her this changing and transforming time could not last so long as she did not think she was satisfied  maples and sycamores and oaks were in full foliage and their bright greens contrasted softly with the dark shine of the pines through the spaces between brown tree trunks and the whitespotted holes of the sycamores gleamed the amber water of the creek always there was murmur of little rills and the musical dash of little rapids on the surface of still shady pools trout broke to make everwidening ripples indian paintbrush so brightly carmine in color lent touch of fire to the green banks and under the oaks in cool dark nooks where mossy bowlders lined the stream there were stately nodding yellow columbines and high on the rock ledges shot up the wonderful mescal stalks beginning to blossom some with tints of gold and others with tones of red  riding along down the canyon under its looming walls carley wondered that if unawares to her these physical aspects of arizona could have become more significant than she realized the thought had confronted her before here as always she fought it and denied it by the simple defense of elimination yet refusing to think of a thing when it seemed ever present was not going to do forever insensibly and subtly it might get a hold on her never to be broken yet it was infinitely easier to dream than to think  but the thought encroached upon her that it was not a dreamful habit of mind she had fallen into of late when she dreamed or mused she lived vaguely and sweetly over past happy hours or dwelt in enchanted fancy upon a possible future carley had been told by a columbia professor that she was a type of the present agea modern young woman of materialistic mind be that as it might she knew many things seemed loosening from the narrowness and tightness of her character sloughing away like scales exposing a new and strange and susceptible softness of fiber and this blank habit of mind when she did not think and now realized that she was not dreaming seemed to be the body of carley burch and her heart and soul stripped of a shell nerve and emotion and spirit received something from her surroundings she absorbed her environment she felt it was a delightful state but when her own consciousness caused it to elude her then she both resented and regretted anything that approached permanent attachment to this crude and untenanted west carley would not tolerate for a moment reluctantly she admitted it had bettered her health quickened her blood and quite relegated florida and the adirondacks to little consideration  well as i told glenn soliloquized carley every time im almost won over a little to arizona she gives me a hard jolt im getting near being mushy today now lets see what ill get i suppose thats my pessimism or materialism funny how glenn keeps saying its the jolts the hard knocks the fights that are best to remember afterward i dont get that at all  five miles below west fork a road branched off and climbed the left side of the canyon it was a rather steep road long and zigzaging and full of rocks and ruts carley did not enjoy ascending it but she preferred the going up to coming down it took half an hour to climb  once up on the flat cedardotted desert she was met full in the face by a hot dusty wind coming from the south carley searched her pockets for her goggles only to ascertain that she had forgotten them nothing except a freezing sleety wind annoyed and punished carley so much as a hard puffy wind full of sand and dust somewhere along the first few miles of this road she was to meet glenn if she turned back for any cause he would be worried and what concerned her more vitally he would think she had not the courage to face a little dust so carley rode on  the wind appeared to be gusty it would blow hard awhile then lull for a few moments on the whole however it increased in volume and persistence until she was riding against a gale she had now come to a bare flat gravelly region scant of cedars and brush and far ahead she could see a dull yellow pall rising high into the sky it was a duststorm and it was sweeping down on the wings of that gale carley remembered that somewhere along this flat there was a log cabin which had before provided shelter for her and flo when they were caught in a rainstorm it seemed unlikely that she had passed by this cabin  resolutely she faced the gale and knew she had a task to find that refuge if there had been a big rock or bushy cedar to offer shelter she would have welcomed it but there was nothing when the hard dusty gusts hit her she found it absolutely necessary to shut her eyes at intervals less windy she opened them and rode on peering through the yellow gloom for the cabin thus she got her eyes full of dustan alkali dust that made them sting and smart the fiercer puffs of wind carried pebbles large enough to hurt severely then the dust clogged her nose and sand got between her teeth added to these annoyances was a heat like a blast from a furnace carley perspired freely and that caked the dust on her face she rode on gradually growing more uncomfortable and miserable yet even then she did not utterly lose a sort of thrilling zest in being thrown upon her own responsibility she could hate an obstacle yet feel something of pride in holding her own against it  another mile of buffeting this increasing gale so exhausted carley and wrought upon her nerves that she became nearly panicstricken it grew harder and harder not to turn back at last she was about to give up when right at hand through the flying dust she espied the cabin riding behind it she dismounted and tied the mustang to a post then she ran around to the door and entered  what a welcome refuge she was all right now and when glenn came along she would have added to her already considerable list another feat for which he would commend her with aid of her handkerchief and the tears that flowed so copiously carley presently freed her eyes of the blinding dust but when she essayed to remove it from her face she discovered she would need a towel and soap and hot water  the cabin appeared to be enveloped in a soft swishing hollow sound it seeped and rustled then the sound lulled only to rise again carley went to the door relieved and glad to see that the duststorm was blowing by the great skyhigh pall of yellow had moved on to the north puffs of dust were whipping along the road but no longer in one continuous cloud in the west low down the sun was sinking a dull magenta in hue quite weird and remarkable  i knew id get the jolt all right soliloquized carley wearily as she walked to a rude couch of poles and sat down upon it she had begun to cool off and there feeling dirty and tired and slowly wearing to the old depression she composed herself to wait  suddenly she heard the clipclop of hoofs there thats glenn she cried gladly and rising she ran to the door  she saw a big bay horse bearing a burly rider he discovered her at the same instant and pulled his horse  ho ho if it aint pretty eyes he called out in gay coarse voice  carley recognized the voice and then the epithet before her sight established the man as haze ruff a singular stultifying shock passed over her  wal by all thets lucky he said dismounting i knowed wed meet some day i cant say i just laid fer you but i kept my eyes open  manifestly he knew she was alone for he did not glance into the cabin  im waiting forglenn she said with lips she tried to make stiff  shore i reckoned thet he replied genially but he wont be along yet awhile  he spoke with a cheerful inflection of tone as if the fact designated was one that would please her and his swarthy seamy face expanded into a goodhumored meaning smile then without any particular rudeness he pushed her back from the door into the cabin and stepped across the threshold  how dareyou cried carley a hot anger that stirred in her seemed to be beaten down and smothered by a cold shaking internal commotion threatening collapse this man loomed over her huge somehow monstrous in his brawny uncouth presence and his knowing smile and the hard glinting twinkle of his light eyes devilishly intelligent and keen in no wise lessened the sheer brutal force of him physically sight of his bulk was enough to terrorize carley  me aw im a darin hombre an a devil with the wimmin he said with a guffaw  carley could not collect her wits the instant of his pushing her back into the cabin and following her had shocked her and almost paralyzed her will if she saw him now any the less fearful she could not so quickly rally her reason to any advantage  let me out of here she demanded  nope im agoin to make a little love to you he said and he reached for her with great hairy hands  carley saw in them the strength that had so easily swung the sheep she saw too that they were dirty greasy hands and they made her flesh creep  glenn will killyou she panted  what fer he queried in real or pretended surprise aw i know wimmin youll never tell him  yes i will  wal mebbe i reckon youre lyin pretty eyes he replied with a grin anyhow ill take a chance  i tell youhell kill you repeated carley backing away until her weak knees came against the couch  what fer i ask you he demanded  for thisthis insult  huh id like to know whos insulted you cant a man take an invitation to kiss an hug a girlwithout insultin her  invitation are you crazy queried carley bewildered  nope im not crazy an i shore said invitation i meant thet white shimmy dress you wore the night of flos party thets my invitation to get a little fresh with you pretty eyes  carley could only stare at him his words seemed to have some peculiar unanswerable power  wal if it wasnt an invitation what was it he asked with another step that brought him within reach of her he waited for her answer which was not forthcoming  wal youre gettin kinda pale around the gills he went on derisively i reckoned you was a real sport come here  he fastened one of his great hands in the front of her coat and gave her a pull so powerful was it that carley came hard against him almost knocking her breathless there he held her a moment and then put his other arm round her it seemed to crush both breath and sense out of her suddenly limp she sank strengthless she seemed reeling in darkness then she felt herself thrust away from him with violence she sank on the couch and her head and shoulders struck the wall  say if youre agoin to keel over like thet i pass declared ruff in disgust cant you eastern wimmin stand nothin  carleys eyes opened and beheld this man in an attitude of supremely derisive protest  you look like a sick kitten he added when i get me a sweetheart or wife i want her to be a wild cat  his scorn and repudiation of her gave carley intense relief she sat up and endeavored to collect her shattered nerves ruff gazed down at her with great disapproval and even disappointment  say did you have some fool idee i was agoin to kill you he queried gruffly  im afraidi did faltered carley her relief was a release it was so strange that it was gratefulness  wal i reckon i wouldnt have hurt you none of these flopover janes for me an ill give you a hunch pretty eyes you might have run acrost a fellar thet was no gentleman  of all the amazing statements that had ever been made to carley this one seemed the most remarkable  whatd you wear thet onnatural white dress fer he demanded as if he had a right to be her judge  unnatural echoed carley  shore thets what i said any womans dress without top or bottom is onnatural its not right why you looked likelikehere he floundered for adequate expressionlike one of the devils angels an i want to hear why you wore it  for the same reason id wear any dress she felt forced to reply  pretty eyes thets a lie an you know its a lie you wore thet white dress to knock the daylights out of men only you aint honest enough to say so even me or my kind even us whore dirt under your little feet but all the same were men an mebbe better men than you think if you had to put that dress on why didnt you stay in your room naw you had to come down an strut around an show off your beauty an i ask youif youre a nice girl like flo hutterwhatd you wear it fer  carley not only was mute she felt rise and burn in her a singular shame and surprise  im only a sheep dipper went on ruff but i aint no fool a fellar doesnt have to live east an wear swell clothes to have sense mebbe youll learn thet the west is biggern you think a mans a man east or west but if your eastern men stand for such dresses as thet white one theyd do well to come out west awhile like your lover glenn kilbourne ive been rustlin round here ten years an i never before seen a dress like yoursan i never heerd of a girl bein insulted either mebbe you think i insulted you wal i didnt fer i reckon nothin could insult you in thet dress an my last hunch is this pretty eyes youre not what a hombre like me calls either square or game adios  his bulky figure darkened the doorway passed out and the light of the sky streamed into the cabin again carley sat staring she heard ruffs spurs tinkle then the ring of steel on stirrup a sodden leathery sound as he mounted and after that a rapid pound of hoofs quickly dying away  he was gone she had escaped something raw and violent dazedly she realized it with unutterable relief and she sat there slowly gathering the nervous force that had been shattered every word that he had uttered was stamped in startling characters upon her consciousness but she was still under the deadening influence of shock this raw experience was the worst the west had yet dealt her it brought back former states of revulsion and formed them in one whole irrefutable and damning judgment that seemed to blot out the vaguely dawning and growing happy susceptibilities it was perhaps just as well to have her mind reverted to realistic fact the presence of haze ruff the astounding truth of the contact with his huge sheepdefiled hands had been profanation and degradation under which she sickened with fear and shame yet hovering back of her shame and rising anger seemed to be a pale monstrous and indefinable thought insistent and accusing with which she must sooner or later reckon it might have been the voice of the new side of her nature but at that moment of outraged womanhood and of revolt against the west she would not listen it might too have been the still small voice of conscience but decision of mind and energy coming to her then she threw off the burden of emotion and perplexity and forced herself into composure before the arrival of glenn  the dust had ceased to blow although the wind had by no means died away sunset marked the west in old rose and gold a vast flare carley espied a horseman far down the road and presently recognized both rider and steed he was coming fast she went out and mounting her mustang she rode out to meet glenn it did not appeal to her to wait for him at the cabin besides hoof tracks other than those made by her mustang might have been noticed by glenn presently he came up to her and pulled his loping horse  hello i sure was worried was his greeting as his gloved hand went out to her did you run into that sandstorm  it ran into me glenn and buried me she laughed  his fine eyes lingered on her face with glad and warm glance and the keen apprehensive penetration of a lover  well under all that dust you look scared he said  scared i was worse than that when i first ran into the flying dirt i was only afraid id lose my wayand my complexion but when the worst of the storm hit methen i feared id lose my breath  did you face that sand and ride through it all he queried  no not all but enough i went through the worst of it before i reached the cabin she replied  wasnt it great  yesgreat bother and annoyance she said laconically  whereupon he reached with long arm and wrapped it round her as they rocked side by side demonstrations of this nature were infrequent with glenn despite losing one foot out of a stirrup and her seat in the saddle carley rather encouraged it he kissed her dusty face and then set her back  by george carley sometimes i think youve changed since youve been here he said with warmth to go through that sandstorm without one kickone knock at my west  glenn i always think of what flo saysthe worst is yet to come replied carley trying to hide her unreasonable and tumultuous pleasure at words of praise from him  carley burch you dont know yourself he declared enigmatically  what woman knows herself but do you know me  not i yet sometimes i see depths in youwonderful possibilitiessubmerged under your poiseunder your fixed complacent idle attitude toward life  this seemed for carley to be dangerously skating near thin ice but she could not resist a retort  depths in me why i am a shallow transparent stream like your west fork  and as for possibilitiesmay i ask what of them you imagine you see  as a girl before you were claimed by the world you were earnest at heart you had big hopes and dreams and you had intellect too but you have wasted your talents carley having money and spending it living for pleasure you have not realized your powers now dont look hurt im not censuring you its just the way of modern life and most of your friends have been more careless thoughtless useless than you the aim of their existence is to be comfortable free from work worry pain they want pleasure luxury and what a pity it is the best of you girls regard marriage as an escape instead of responsibility you dont marry to get your shoulders square against the old wheel of american progressto help some man make goodto bring a troop of healthy american kids into the world you bare your shoulders to the gaze of the multitude and like it best if you are strung with pearls  glenn you distress me when you talk like this replied carley soberly you did not use to talk so it seems to me you are bitter against women  oh no carley i am only sad he said i only see where once i was blind american women are the finest on earth but as a race if they dont change theyre doomed to extinction  how can you say such things demanded carley with spirit  i say them because they are true carley on the level now tell me how many of your immediate friends have children  put to a test carley rapidly went over in mind her circle of friends with the result that she was somewhat shocked and amazed to realize how few of them were even married and how the babies of her acquaintance were limited to three it was not easy to admit this to glenn  my dear replied he if that does not show you the handwriting on the wall nothing ever will  a girl has to find a husband doesnt she asked carley roused to defense of her sex and if shes anybody she has to find one in her set well husbands are not plentiful marriage certainly is not the end of existence these days we have to get along somehow the high cost of living is no inconsderable factor today do you know that most of the betterclass apartment houses in new york will not take children women are not all to blame take the speed mania men must have automobiles i know one girl who wanted a baby but her husband wanted a car they couldnt afford both  carley im not blaming women more than men returned glenn i dont know that i blame them as a class but in my own mind i have worked it all out every man or woman who is genuinely american should read the signs of the times realize the crisis and meet it in an american way otherwise we are done as a race money is god in the older countries but it should never become god in america if it does we will make the fall of rome pale into insignificance  glenn lets put off the argument appealed carley im notjust up to fighting you today ohyou neednt smile im not showing a yellow streak as flo puts it ill fight you some other time  youre right carley he assented here we are loafing six or seven miles from home lets rustle along  riding fast with glenn was something carley had only of late added to her achievements she had greatest pride in it so she urged her mustang to keep pace with glenns horse and gave herself up to the thrill of the motion and feel of wind and sense of flying along at a good swinging lope calico covered ground swiftly and did not tire carley rode the two miles to the rim of the canyon keeping alongside of glenn all the way indeed for one long level stretch she and glenn held hands when they arrived at the descent which necessitated slow and careful riding she was hot and tingling and breathless worked by the action into an exuberance of pleasure glenn complimented her riding as well as her rosy cheeks there was indeed a sweetness in working at a task as she had worked to learn to ride in western fashion every turn of her mind seemed to confront her with sobering antitheses of thought why had she come to love to ride down a lonely desert road through ragged cedars where the wind whipped her face with fragrant wild breath if at the same time she hated the west could she hate a country however barren and rough if it had saved the health and happiness of her future husband verily there were problems for carley to solve  early twilight purple lay low in the hollows and clefts of the canyon over the western rim a pale ghost of the evening star seemed to smile at carley to bid her look and look like a strain of distant music the dreamy hum of falling water the murmur and melody of the stream came again to carleys sensitive ear  do you love this asked glenn when they reached the greenforested canyon floor with the yellow road winding away into the purple shadows  yes both the rideand you flashed carley contrarily she knew he had meant the deepwalled canyon with its brooding solitude  but i want you to love arizona he said  glenn im a faithful creature you should be glad of that i love new york  very well then arizona to new york he said lightly brushing her cheek with his lips and swerving back into his saddle he spurred his horse and called back over his shoulder that mustang and flo have beaten me many a time come on  it was not so much his words as his tone and look that roused carley had he resented her loyalty to the city of her nativity always there was a little rift in the lute had his tone and look meant that flo might catch him if carley could not absurd as the idea was it spurred her to recklessness her mustang did not need any more than to know she wanted him to run the road was of soft yellow earth flanked with green foliage and overspread by pines in a moment she was racing at a speed she had never before half attained on a horse down the winding road glenns big steed sped his head low his stride tremendous his action beautiful but carley saw the distance between them diminishing calico was overtaking the bay she cried out in the thrilling excitement of the moment glenn saw her gaining and pressed his mount to greater speed still he could not draw away from calico slowly the little mustang gained it seemed to carley that riding him required no effort at all and at such fast pace with the wind roaring in her ears the walls of green vague and continuous in her sight the sting of pine tips on cheek and neck the yellow road streaming toward her under her there rose out of the depths of her out of the tumult of her breast a sense of glorious exultation she closed in on glenn from the flying hoofs of his horse shot up showers of damp sand and gravel that covered carleys riding habit and spattered in her face she had to hold up a hand before her eyes perhaps this caused her to lose something of her confidence or her swing in the saddle for suddenly she realized she was not riding well the pace was too fast for her inexperience but nothing could have stopped her then no fear or awkwardness of hers should be allowed to hamper that thoroughbred mustang carley felt that calico understood the situation or at least he knew he could catch and pass this big bay horse and he intended to do it carley was hard put to it to hang on and keep the flying sand from blinding her  when calico drew alongside the bay horse and brought carley breast to breast with glenn and then inch by inch forged ahead of him carley pealed out an exultant cry either it frightened calico or inspired him for he shot right ahead of glenns horse then he lost the smooth wonderful action he seemed hurtling through space at the expense of tremendous muscular action carley could feel it she lost her equilibrium she seemed rushing through a blurred green and black aisle of the forest with a gale in her face then with a sharp jolt a break calico plunged to the sand carley felt herself propelled forward out of the saddle into the air and down to strike with a sliding stunning force that ended in sudden dark oblivion  upon recovering consciousness she first felt a sensation of oppression in her chest and a dull numbness of her whole body when she opened her eyes she saw glenn bending over her holding her head on his knee a wet cold reviving sensation evidently came from the handkerchief with which he was mopping her face  carley you cant be hurtreally he was ejaculating in eager hope it was some spill but you lit on the sand and slid you cant be hurt  the look of his eyes the tone of his voice the feel of his hands were such that carley chose for a moment to pretend to be very badly hurt indeed it was worth taking a header to get so much from glenn kilbourne but she believed she had suffered no more than a severe bruising and scraping  glenndear she whispered very low and very eloquently i thinkmy backis broken youll be freesoon  glenn gave a terrible start and his face turned a deathly white he burst out with quavering inarticulate speech  carley gazed up at him and then closed her eyes she could not look at him while carrying on such deceit yet the sight of him and the feel of him then were inexpressibly blissful to her what she needed most was assurance of his love she had it beyond doubt beyond morbid fancy the truth had proclaimed itself filling her heart with joy  suddenly she flung her arms up around his neck ohglenn it was too good a chance to miss im not hurt a bit    chapter vii  the day came when carley asked mrs hutter will you please put up a nice lunch for glenn and me im going to walk down to his farm where hes working and surprise him  thats a downright fine idea declared mrs hutter and forthwith bustled away to comply with carleys request  so presently carley found herself carrying a bountiful basket on her arm faring forth on an adventure that both thrilled and depressed her long before this hour something about glenns work had quickened her pulse and given rise to an inexplicable admiration that he was big and strong enough to do such labor made her proud that he might want to go on doing it made her ponder and brood  the morning resembled one of the rare eastern days in june when the air appeared flooded by rich thick amber light only the sun here was hotter and the shade cooler  carley took to the trail below where west fork emptied its goldengreen waters into oak creek the red walls seemed to dream and wait under the blaze of the sun the heat lay like a blanket over the still foliage the birds were quiet only the murmuring stream broke the silence of the canyon never had carley felt more the isolation and solitude of oak creek canyon far indeed from the madding crowd only carleys stubbornness kept her from acknowledging the sense of peace that enveloped herthat and the consciousness of her own discontent what would it be like to come to this canyonto give up to its enchantments that like many another disturbing thought had to go unanswered to be driven into the closed chambers of carleys mind there to germinate subconsciously and stalk forth some day to overwhelm her  the trail led along the creek threading a maze of bowlders passing into the shade of cottonwoods and crossing sunflecked patches of sand carleys every step seemed to become slower regrets were assailing her long indeed had she overstayed her visit to the west she must not linger there indefinitely and mingled with misgiving was a surprise that she had not tired of oak creek in spite of all and of the dislike she vaunted to herself the truth stared at hershe was not tired  the longdelayed visit to see glenn working on his own farm must result in her talking to him about his work and in a way not quite clear she regretted the necessity for it to disapprove of glenn she received faint intimations of wavering of uncertainty of vague doubt but these were cried down by the dominant and habitable voice of her personality  presently through the shaded and shadowed breadth of the belt of forest she saw gleams of a sunlit clearing and crossing this space to the border of trees she peered forth hoping to espy glenn at his labors she saw an old shack and irregular lines of rude fence built of poles of all sizes and shapes and several plots of bare yellow ground leading up toward the west side of the canyon wall could this clearing be glenns farm surely she had missed it or had not gone far enough this was not a farm but a slash in the forested level of the canyon floor bare and somehow hideous dead trees were standing in the lots they had been ringed deeply at the base by an ax to kill them and so prevent their foliage from shading the soil carley saw a long pile of rocks that evidently had been carried from the plowed ground there was no neatness no regularity although there was abundant evidence of toil to clear that rugged space to fence it and plow it appeared at once to carley an extremely strenuous and useless task carley persuaded herself that this must be the plot of ground belonging to the herder charley and she was about to turn on down the creek when far up under the bluff she espied a man he was stalking along and bending down stalking along and bending down she recognized glenn he was planting something in the yellow soil  curiously carley watched him and did not allow her mind to become concerned with a somewhat painful swell of her heart what a stride he had how vigorous he looked and earnest he was as intent upon this job as if he had been a rustic he might have been failing to do it well but he most certainly was doing it conscientiously once he had said to her that a man should never be judged by the result of his labors but by the nature of his effort a man might strive with all his heart and strength yet fail carley watched him striding along and bending down absorbed in his task unmindful of the glaring hot sun and somehow to her singularly detached from the life wherein he had once moved and to which she yearned to take him back suddenly an unaccountable flashing query assailed her conscience how dare she want to take him back she seemed as shocked as if some stranger had accosted her what was this dimming of her eye this inward tremulousness this dammed tide beating at an unknown and riveted gate of her intelligence she felt more then than she dared to face she struggled against something in herself the old habit of mind instinctively resisted the new the strange but she did not come off wholly victorious the carley burch whom she recognized as of old passionately hated this life and work of glenn kilbournes but the rebel self an unaccountable and defiant carley loved him all the better for them  carley drew a long deep breath before she called glenn this meeting would be momentous and she felt no absolute surety of herself  manifestly he was surprised to hear her call and dropping his sack and implement he hurried across the tilled ground sending up puffs of dust he vaulted the rude fence of poles and upon sight of her called out lustily how big and virile he looked yet he was gaunt and strained it struck carley that he had not looked so upon her arrival at oak creek had she worried him the query gave her a pang  sir tiller of the fields said carley gayly see your dinner i brought it and i am going to share it  you old darling he replied and gave her an embrace that left her cheek moist with the sweat of his he smelled of dust and earth and his body was hot i wish to god it could be true for always  his loving bearish onslaught and his words quite silenced carley how at critical moments he always said the thing that hurt her or inhibited her she essayed a smile as she drew back from him  its sure good of you he said taking the basket i was thinking id be through work sooner today and was sorry i had not made a date with you come well find a place to sit  whereupon he led her back under the trees to a halfsunny halfshady bench of rock overhanging the stream great pines overshadowed a still eddying pool a number of brown butterflies hovered over the water and small trout floated like spotted feathers just under the surface drowsy summer enfolded the sylvan scene  glenn knelt at the edge of the brook and plunging his hands in he splashed like a huge dog and bathed his hot face and head and then turned to carley with gay words and laughter while he wiped himself dry with a large red scarf carley was not proof against the virility of him then and at the moment no matter what it was that had made him the man he looked she loved it  ill sit in the sun he said designating a place when youre hot you mustnt rest in the shade unless youve coat or sweater but you sit here in the shade  glenn thatll put us too far apart complained carley ill sit in the sun with you  the delightful simplicity and happiness of the ensuing hour was something carley believed she would never forget  there weve licked the platter clean she said what starved bears we were i wonder if i shall enjoy eatingwhen i get home i used to be so finnicky and picky  carley dont talk about home said glenn appealingly  you dear old farmer id love to stay here and just dreamforever replied carley earnestly but i came on purpose to talk seriously  oh you did about what he returned with some quick indefinable change of tone and expression  well first about your work i know i hurt your feelings when i wouldnt listen but i wasnt ready i wanted toto just be gay with you for a while dont think i wasnt interested i was and now im ready to hear all about itand everything  she smiled at him bravely and she knew that unless some unforeseen shock upset her composure she would be able to conceal from him anything which might hurt his feelings  you do look serious he said with keen eyes on her  just what are your business relations with hutter she inquired  im simply working for him replied glenn my aim is to get an interest in his sheep and i expect to some day we have some plans and one of them is the development of that deep lake section you rememberyou were with us the day spillbeans spilled you  yes i remember it was a pretty place she replied  carley did not tell him that for a month past she had owned the deep lake section of six hundred and forty acres she had in fact instructed hutter to purchase it and to keep the transaction a secret for the present carley had never been able to understand the impulse that prompted her to do it but as hutter had assured her it was a remarkably good investment on very little capital she had tried to persuade herself of its advantages back of it all had been an irresistible desire to be able some day to present to glenn this ranch site he loved she had concluded he would never wholly dissociate himself from this west and as he would visit it now and then she had already begun forming plans of her own she could stand a month in arizona at long intervals  hutter and i will go into cattle raising some day went on glenn and that deep lake place is what i want for myself  what work are you doing for hutter asked carley  anything from building fence to cutting timber laughed glenn ive not yet the experience to be a foreman like lee stanton besides i have a little business all my own i put all my money in that  you mean herethisthis farm  yes and the stock im raisin you see i have to feed corn and believe me carley those cornfields represent some job  i can well believe that replied carley youyou looked it  oh the hard work is over all i have to do now it to plant and keep the weeds out  glenn do sheep eat corn  i plant corn to feed my hogs  hogs she echoed vaguely  yes hogs he said with quiet gravity the first day you visited my cabin i told you i raised hogs and i fried my own ham for your dinner  is that what youput your money in  yes and hutter says ive done well  hogs ejaculated carley aghast  my dear are you growin dull of comprehension retorted glenn hogs he spelled the word out im in the hograising business and pretty blamed well pleased over my success so far  carley caught herself in time to quell outwardly a shock of amaze and revulsion she laughed and exclaimed against her stupidity the look of glenn was no less astounding than the content of his words he was actually proud of his work moreover he showed not the least sign that he had any idea such information might be startlingly obnoxious to his fiancee  glenn its soso queer she ejaculated that youglenn kilbourneshould ever go in forfor hogs its unbelievable howd you everever happen to do it  by heaven youre hard on me he burst out in sudden dark fierce passion howd i ever happen to do it what was there left for me i gave my soul and heart and body to the governmentto fight for my country i came home a wreck what did my government do for me what did my employers do for me what did the people i fought for do for me nothingso help me godnothing i got a ribbon and a bouqueta little applause for an hourand then the sight of me sickened my countrymen i was broken and used i was absolutely forgotten but my body my life my soul meant all to me my future was ruined but i wanted to live i had killed men who never harmed mei was not fit to die i tried to live so i fought out my battle alone alone no one understood no one cared i came west to keep from dying of consumption in sight of the indifferent mob for whom i had sacrificed myself i chose to die on my feet away off alone somewhere but i got well and what made me welland saved my soulwas the first work that offered raising and tending hogs  the dead whiteness of glenns face the lightning scorn of his eyes the grim stark strangeness of him then had for carley a terrible harmony with this passionate denunciation of her of her kind of the america for whom he had lost all  oh glennforgiveme she faltered i was onlytalking what do i know oh i am blindblind and little  she could not bear to face him for a moment and she hung her head her intelligence seemed concentrating swift wild thoughts round the shock to her consciousness by that terrible expression of his face by those thundering words of scorn would she come to realize the mighty truth of his descent into the abyss and his rise to the heights vaguely she began to see an awful sense of her deadness of her soulblighting selfishness began to dawn upon her as something monstrous out of dim gray obscurity she trembled under the reality of thoughts that were not new how she had babbled about glenn and the crippled soldiers how she had imagined she sympathized but she had only been a vain worldly complacent effusive little fool she had here the shock of her life and she sensed a greater one impossible to grasp  carley that was coming to you said glenn presently with deep heavy expulsion of breath  i only know i love youmoremore she cried wildly looking up and wanting desperately to throw herself in his arms  i guess you doa little he replied sometimes i feel you are a kid then again you represent the worldyour world with its ageold customits unalterable but carley lets get back to my work  yesyes exclaimed carley gladly im ready toto go pet your hogsanything  by george ill take you up he declared ill bet you wont go near one of my hogpens  lead me to it she replied with a hilarity that was only a nervous reversion of her state  well maybe id better hedge on the bet he said laughing again you have more in you than i suspect you sure fooled me when you stood for the sheepdip but come on ill take you anyway  so that was how carley found herself walking arm in arm with glenn down the canyon trail a few moments of action gave her at least an appearance of outward composure and the state of her emotion was so strained and intense that her slightest show of interest must deceive glenn into thinking her eager responsive enthusiastic it certainly appeared to loosen his tongue but carley knew she was farther from normal than ever before in her life and that the subtle inscrutable womans intuition of her presaged another shock just as she had seemed to change so had the aspects of the canyon undergone some illusive transformation the beauty of green foliage and amber stream and brown tree trunks and gray rocks and red walls was there and the summer drowsiness and languor lay as deep and the loneliness and solitude brooded with its same eternal significance but some nameless enchantment perhaps of hope seemed no longer to encompass her a blow had fallen upon her the nature of which only time could divulge  glenn led her around the clearing and up to the base of the west wall where against a shelving portion of the cliff had been constructed a rude fence of poles it formed three sides of a pen and the fourth side was solid rock a bushy cedar tree stood in the center water flowed from under the cliff which accounted for the boggy condition of the red earth this pen was occupied by a huge sow and a litter of pigs  carley climbed on the fence and sat there while glenn leaned over the top pole and began to wax eloquent on a subject evidently dear to his heart today of all days carley made an inspiring listener even the shiny muddy suspicious old sow in no wise daunted her fictitious courage that filthy pen of mud a foot deep and of odor rancid had no terrors for her with an arm round glenns shoulder she watched the rooting and squealing little pigs and was amused and interested as if they were far removed from the vital issue of the hour but all the time as she looked and laughed and encouraged glenn to talk there seemed to be a strange solemn oppressive knocking at her heart was it only the beatbeatbeat of blood  there were twelve pigs in that litter glenn was saying and now you see there are only nine ive lost three mountain lions bears coyotes wild cats are all likely to steal a pig and at first i was sure one of these varmints had been robbing me but as i could not find any tracks i knew i had to lay the blame on something else so i kept watch pretty closely in daytime and at night i shut the pigs up in the corner there where you see ive built a pen yesterday i heard squealingand by george i saw an eagle flying off with one of my pigs say i was mad a great old baldheaded eaglethe regal bird you see with americas stars and stripes had degraded himself to the level of a coyote i ran for my rifle and i took some quick shots at him as he flew up tried to hit him too but i failed and the old rascal hung on to my pig i watched him carry it to that sharp crag way up there on the rim  poor little piggy exclaimed carley to think of our american emblemour stately bird of noble warlike mienour symbol of lonely grandeur and freedom of the heightsthink of him being a robber of pigpensglenn i begin to appreciate the manysidedness of things even my hidebound narrowness is susceptible to change its never too late to learn this should apply to the society for the preservation of the american eagle  glenn led her along the base of the wall to three other pens in each of which was a fat old sow with a litter and at the last enclosure that owing to dry soil was not so dirty glenn picked up a little pig and held it squealing out to carley as she leaned over the fence it was fairly white and clean a little pink and fuzzy and certainly cute with its curled tall  carley burch take it in your hands commanded glenn  the feat seemed monstrous and impossible of accomplishment for carley yet such was her temper at the moment that she would have undertaken anything  why shore i will as flo says replied carley extending her ungloved hands come here piggy i christen you pinky and hiding an almost insupportable squeamishness from glenn she took the pig in her hands and fondled it  by george exclaimed glenn in huge delight i wouldnt have believed it carley i hope you tell your fastidious and immaculate morrison that you held one of my pigs in your beautiful hands  wouldnt it please you more to tell him yourself asked carley  yes it would declared glenn grimly  this incident inspired glenn to a homeric narration of his hograising experience in spite of herself the content of his talk interested her and as for the effect upon her of his singular enthusiasm it was deep and compelling the littleboned berkshire razorback hogs grew so large and fat and heavy that their bones broke under their weight the duroc jerseys were the best breed in that latitude owing to their larger and stronger bones that enabled them to stand up under the greatest accumulation of fat  glenn told of his droves of pigs running wild in the canyon below in summertime they fed upon vegetation and at other seasons on acorns roots bugs and grubs acorns particularly were good and fattening feed they ate cedar and juniper berries and pinyon nuts and therefore they lived off the land at little or no expense to the owner the only loss was from beasts and birds of prey glenn showed carley how a profitable business could soon be established he meant to fence off side canyons and to segregate droves of his hogs and to raise abundance of corn for winter feed at that time there was a splendid market for hogs a condition hutter claimed would continue indefinitely in a growing country in conclusion glenn eloquently told how in his necessity he had accepted gratefully the humblest of labors to find in the hard pursuit of it a rejuvenation of body and mind and a promise of independence and prosperity  when he had finished and excused himself to go repair a weak place in the corral fence carley sat silent wrapped in strange meditation  whither had faded the vulgarity and ignominy she had attached to glenns raising of hogs gonelike other miasmas of her narrow mind partly she understood him now she shirked consideration of his sacrifice to his country that must wait but she thought of his work and the more she thought the less she wondered  first he had labored with his hands what infinite meaning lay unfolding to her vision somewhere out of it all came the conception that man was intended to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow but there was more to it than that by that toil and sweat by the friction of horny palms by the expansion and contraction of muscle by the acceleration of blood something great and enduring something physical and spiritual came to a man she understood then why she would have wanted to surrender herself to a man made manly by toil she understood how a woman instinctively leaned toward the protection of a man who had used his handswho had strength and red blood and virility who could fight like the progenitors of the race any toil was splendid that served this end for any man it all went back to the survival of the fittest and suddenly carley thought of morrison he could dance and dangle attendance upon her and amuse herbut how would he have acquitted himself in a moment of peril she had her doubts most assuredly he could not have beaten down for her a ruffian like haze ruff what then should be the significance of a man for a woman  carleys querying and answering mind reverted to glenn he had found a secret in this seeking for something through the labor of hands all development of body must come through exercise of muscles the virility of cell in tissue and bone depended upon that thus he had found in toil the pleasure and reward athletes had in their desultory training but when a man learned this secret the need of work must become permanent did this explain the law of the persians that every man was required to sweat every day  carley tried to picture to herself glenns attitude of mind when he had first gone to work here in the west resolutely she now denied her shrinking cowardly sensitiveness she would go to the root of this matter if she had intelligence enough crippled ruined in health wrecked and broken by an inexplicable war soulblighted by the heartless callous neglect of government and public on the verge of madness at the insupportable facts he had yet been wonderful enough true enough to himself and god to fight for life with the instinct of a man to fight for his mind with a noble and unquenchable faith alone indeed he had been alone and by some miracle beyond the power of understanding he had found day by day in his painful efforts some hope and strength to go on he could not have had any illusions for glenn kilbourne the health and happiness and success most men held so dear must have seemed impossible his slow daily tragic and terrible task must have been something he owed himself not for carley burch she like all the others had failed him how carley shuddered in confession of that not for the country which had used him and cast him off carley divined now as if by a flash of lightning the meaning of glenns strange cold scornful and aloof manner when he had encountered young men of his station as capable and as strong as he who had escaped the service of the army for him these men did not exist they were less than nothing they had waxed fat on lucrative jobs they had basked in the presence of girls whose brothers and lovers were in the trenches or on the turbulent sea exposed to the ceaseless dread and almost ceaseless toil of war if glenns spirit had lifted him to endurance of war for the sake of others how then could it fail him in a precious duty of fidelity to himself carley could see him day by day toiling in his lonely canyonplodding to his lonely cabin he had been playing the gamefighting it out alone as surely he knew his brothers of like misfortune were fighting  so glenn kilbourne loomed heroically in carleys transfigured sight he was one of carleys battlescarred warriors out of his travail he had climbed on steppingstones of his dead self resurgam that had been his unquenchable cry who had heard it only the solitude of his lonely canyon only the waiting dreaming watching walls only the silent midnight shadows only the white blinking passionless stars only the wild creatures of his haunts only the moaning wind in the pinesonly these had been with him in his agony how near were these things to god  carleys heart seemed full to bursting not another single moment could her mounting love abide in a heart that held a double purpose how bitter the assurance that she had not come west to help him it was self self all self that had actuated her unworthy indeed was she of the love of this man only a lifetime of devotion to him could acquit her in the eyes of her better self sweetly and madly raced the thrill and tumult of her blood there must be only one outcome to her romance yet the next instant there came a dull throbbingan oppression which was painan impondering vague thought of catastrophe only the fearfulness of love perhaps  she saw him complete his task and wipe his brown moist face and stride toward her coming nearer tall and erect with something added to his soldierly bearing with a light in his eyes she could no longer bear  the moment for which she had waited more than two months had come at last  glennwhen will you go back east she asked tensely and low  the instant the words were spent upon her lips she realized that he had always been waiting and prepared for this question that had been so terrible for her to ask  carley he replied gently though his voice rang i am never going back east  an inward quivering hindered her articulation  never she whispered  never to live or stay any while he went on i might go some time for a little visit but never to live  ohglenn she gasped and her hands fluttered out to him the shock was driving home no amaze no incredulity succeeded her reception of the fact it was a slow stab carley felt the cold blanch of her skin thenthis is itthe something i felt strange between us  yes i knewand you never asked me he replied  that was it all the time you knew she whispered huskily you knew  id nevermarry younever live out here  yes carley i knew youd never be woman enoughamerican enoughto help me reconstruct my broken life out here in the west he replied with a sad and bitter smile  that flayed her an insupportable shame and wounded vanity and clamoring love contended for dominance of her emotions love beat down all else  dearesti beg of youdont break my heart she implored  i love you carley he answered steadily with piercing eyes on hers  then come backhomehome with me  no if you love me you will be my wife  love you glenn i worship you she broke out passionately but i could not live herei could not  carley did you ever read of the woman who said whither thou goest there will i go  oh dont be ruthless dont judge me i never dreamed of this i came west to take you back  my dear it was a mistake he said gently softening to her distress im sorry i did not write you more plainly but carley i could not ask you to share thisthis wilderness home with me i dont ask it now i always knew you couldnt do it yet youve changed sothat i hoped against hope love makes us blind even to what we see  dont try to spare me im slight and miserable i stand abased in my own eyes i thought i loved you but i must love best the crowdpeopleluxuryfashionthe damned round of things i was born to  carley you will realize their insufficiency too late he replied earnestly the things you were born to are love work children happiness  dont dont they are hollow mockery for me she cried passionately glenn it is the end it must comequickly you are free  i do not ask to be free wait go home and look at it again with different eyes think things over remember what came to me out of the west i will always love youand i will be herehoping  ii cannot listen she returned brokenly and she clenched her hands tightly to keep from wringing them ii cannot face you here isyour ring youarefree dont stop medont come oh glenn goodby  with breaking heart she whirled away from him and hurried down the slope toward the trail the shade of the forest enveloped her peering back through the trees she saw glenn standing where she had left him as if already stricken by the loneliness that must be his lot a sob broke from carleys throat she hated herself she was in a terrible state of conflict decision had been wrenched from her but she sensed unending strife she dared not look back again stumbling and breathless she hurried on how changed the atmosphere and sunlight and shadow of the canyon the looming walls had pitiless eyes for her flight when she crossed the mouth of west fork an almost irresistible force breathed to her from under the stately pines  an hour later she had bidden farewell to the weeping mrs hutter and to the whitefaced flo and lolomi lodge and the murmuring waterfall and the haunting loneliness of oak creek canyon    chapter viii  at flagstaff where carley arrived a few minutes before train time she was too busily engaged with tickets and baggage to think of herself or of the significance of leaving arizona but as she walked into the pullman she overheard a passenger remark regular old arizona sunset and that shook her heart suddenly she realized she had come to love the colorful sunsets to watch and wait for them and bitterly she thought how that was her way to learn the value of something when it was gone  the jerk and start of the train affected her with singular depressing shock she had burned her last bridge behind her had she unconsciously hoped for some incredible reversion of glenns mind or of her own a sense of irreparable loss flooded over herthe first check to shame and humiliation  from her window she looked out to the southwest somewhere across the cedar and pinegreened uplands lay oak creek canyon going to sleep in its purple and gold shadows of sunset banks of broken clouds hung to the horizon like continents and islands and reefs set in a turquoise sea shafts of sunlight streaked down through creamyedged and purplecentered clouds vast flare of gold dominated the sunset background  when the train rounded a curve carleys strained vision became filled with the upheaved bulk of the san francisco mountains ragged gray grass slopes and green forests on end and black fringed sky lines all pointed to the sharp clear peaks spearing the sky and as she watched the peaks slowly flushed with sunset hues and the sky flared golden and the strength of the eternal mountains stood out in sculptured sublimity every day for two months and more carley had watched these peaks at all hours in every mood and they had unconsciously become a part of her thought the train was relentlessly whirling her eastward soon they must become a memory tears blurred her sight poignant regret seemed added to the anguish she was suffering why had she not learned sooner to see the glory of the mountains to appreciate the beauty and solitude why had she not understood herself  the next day through new mexico she followed magnificent ranges and valleysso different from the country she had seen coming westso supremely beautiful that she wondered if she had only acquired the harvest of a seeing eye  but it was at sunset of the following day when the train was speeding down the continental slope of prairie land beyond the rockies that the west took its ruthless revenge  masses of strange cloud and singular light upon the green prairie and a luminosity in the sky drew carley to the platform of her car which was the last of the train there she stood gripping the iron gate feeling the wind whip her hair and the irontracked ground speed from under her spellbound and stricken at the sheer wonder and glory of the firmament and the mountain range that it canopied so exquisitely  a rich and mellow light singularly clear seemed to flood out of some unknown source for the sun was hidden the clouds just above carley hung low and they were like thick heavy smoke mushrooming coalescing forming and massing of strange yellow cast of nature it shaded westward into heliotrope and this into a purple so royal so matchless and rare that carley understood why the purple of the heavens could never be reproduced in paint here the cloud mass thinned and paled and a tint of rose began to flush the billowy flowery creamy white then came the surpassing splendor of this cloud pageanta vast canopy of shell pink a sunfired surface like an opal sea rippled and webbed with the exquisite texture of an oriental fabric pure delicate lovelyas no work of human hands could be it mirrored all the warm pearly tints of the inside whorl of the tropic nautilus and it ended abruptly a rounded depth of bank on a broad stream of clear sky intensely blue transparently blue as if through the lambent depths shone the infinite firmament the lower edge of this stream took the golden lightning of the sunset and was notched for all its horizonlong length by the wondrous white glisteningpeaked range of the rockies far to the north standing aloof from the range loomed up the grand black bulk and noble white dome of pikes peak  carley watched the sunset transfiguration of cloud and sky and mountain until all were cold and gray and then she returned to her seat thoughtful and sad feeling that the west had mockingly flung at her one of its transient moments of loveliness  nor had the west wholly finished with her next day the mellow gold of the kansas wheat fields endless and boundless as a sunny sea rich waving in the wind stretched away before her aching eyes for hours and hours here was the promise fulfilled the bountiful harvest of the land the strength of the west the great middle state had a heart of gold  east of chicago carley began to feel that the long days and nights of riding the ceaseless turning of the wheels the constant and wearing stress of emotion had removed her an immeasurable distance of miles and time and feeling from the scene of her catastrophe many days seemed to have passed many had been the hours of her bitter regret and anguish  indiana and ohio with their green pastoral farms and numberless villages and thriving cities denoted a country far removed and different from the west and an approach to the populous east carley felt like a wanderer coming home she was restlessly and impatiently glad but her weariness of body and mind and the close atmosphere of the car rendered her extreme discomfort summer had laid its hot hand on the low country east of the mississippi  carley had wired her aunt and two of her intimate friends to meet her at the grand central station this reunion soon to come affected carley in recurrent emotions of relief gladness and shame she did not sleep well and arose early and when the train reached albany she felt that she could hardly endure the tedious hours the majestic hudson and the palatial mansions on the wooded bluffs proclaimed to carley that she was back in the east how long a time seemed to have passed either she was not the same or the aspect of everything had changed but she believed that as soon as she got over the ordeal of meeting her friends and was home again she would soon see things rationally  at last the train sheered away from the broad hudson and entered the environs of new york carley sat perfectly still to all outward appearances a calm superblypoised new york woman returning home but inwardly raging with contending tides in her own sight she was a disgraceful failure a prodigal sneaking back to the ease and protection of loyal friends who did not know her truly every familiar landmark in the approach to the city gave her a thrill yet a vague unsatisfied something lingered after each sensation  then the train with rush and roar crossed the harlem river to enter new york city as one waking from a dream carley saw the blocks and squares of gray apartment houses and red buildings the miles of roofs and chimneys the long hot glaring streets full of playing children and cars then above the roar of the train sounded the high notes of a hurdygurdy indeed she was home next to startle her was the dark tunnel and then the slowing of the train to a stop as she walked behind a porter up the long incline toward the station gate her legs seemed to be dead  in the circle of expectant faces beyond the gate she saw her aunts eager and agitated then the handsome pale face of eleanor harmon and beside her the sweet thin one of beatrice lovell as they saw her how quick the change from expectancy to joy it seemed they all rushed upon her and embraced her and exclaimed over her together carley never recalled what she said but her heart was full  oh how perfectly stunning you look cried eleanor backing away from carley and gazing with glad surprised eyes  carley gasped beatrice you wonderful goldenskinned goddess youre young again like you were in our school days  it was before aunt marys shrewd penetrating loving gaze that carley quailed  yes carley you look wellbetter than i ever saw you butbut  but i dont look happy interrupted carley i am happy to get hometo see you all butmymy heart is broken  a little shocked silence ensued then carley found herself being led across the lower level and up the wide stairway as she mounted to the vastdomed cathedrallike chamber of the station a strange sensation pierced her with a pang not the old thrill of leaving new york or returning nor was it the welcome sight of the hurrying welldressed throng of travelers and commuters nor the stately beauty of the station carley shut her eyes and then she knew the dim light of vast space above the looming gray walls shadowy with tracery of figures the lofty dome like the blue sky brought back to her the walls of oak creek canyon and the great caverns under the ramparts as suddenly as she had shut her eyes carley opened them to face her friends  let me get it overquickly she burst out with hot blood surging to her face ii hated the west it was so rawso violentso big i think i hate it morenow but it changed memade me over physicallyand did something to my soulgod knows what and it has saved glenn oh he is wonderful you would never know him for long i had not the courage to tell him i came to bring him back east i kept putting it off and i rode i climbed i camped i lived outdoors at first it nearly killed me then it grew bearable and easier until i forgot i wouldnt be honest if i didnt admit now that somehow i had a wonderful time in spite of all glenns business is raising hogs he has a hog ranch doesnt it sound sordid but things are not always what they soundor seem glenn is absorbed in his work i hated iti expected to ridicule it but i ended by infinitely respecting him i learned through his hograising the real nobility of work well at last i found courage to ask him when he was coming back to new york he said never i realized then my blindness my selfishness i could not be his wife and live there i could not i was too small too miserable too comfortlovingtoo spoiled and all the time he knew thisknew id never be big enough to marry him that broke my heart i left him freeand here i am i beg youdont ask me any moreand never to mention it to meso i can forget  the tender unspoken sympathy of women who loved her proved comforting in that trying hour with the confession ruthlessly made the hard compression in carleys breast subsided and her eyes cleared of a hateful dimness when they reached the taxi stand outside the station carley felt a rush of hot devitalized air from the street she seemed not to be able to get air into her lungs  isnt it dreadfully hot she asked  this is a cool spell to what we had last week replied eleanor  cool exclaimed carley as she wiped her moist face i wonder if you easterners know the real significance of words  then they entered a taxi to be whisked away apparently through a labyrinthine maze of cars and streets where pedestrians had to run and jump for their lives a congestion of traffic at fifth avenue and fortysecond street halted their taxi for a few moments and here in the thick of it carley had full assurance that she was back in the metropolis her sore heart eased somewhat at sight of the streams of people passing to and fro how they rushed where were they going what was their story and all the while her aunt held her hand and beatrice and eleanor talked as fast as their tongues could wag then the taxi clattered on up the avenue to turn down a side street and presently stop at carleys home it was a modest threestory brownstone house carley had been so benumbed by sensations that she did not imagine she could experience a new one but peering out of the taxi she gazed dubiously at the brownishred stone steps and front of her home  im going to have it painted she muttered as if to herself  her aunt and her friends laughed glad and relieved to hear such a practical remark from carley how were they to divine that this brownishred stone was the color of desert rocks and canyon walls  in a few more moments carley was inside the house feeling a sense of protection in the familiar rooms that had been her home for seventeen years once in the sanctity of her room which was exactly as she had left it her first action was to look in the mirror at her weary dusty heated face neither the brownness of it nor the shadow appeared to harmonize with the image of her that haunted the mirror  now she whispered low its done im home the old lifeor a new life how to meet either now  thus she challenged her spirit and her intelligence rang at her the imperative necessity for action for excitement for effort that left no time for rest or memory or wakefulness she accepted the issue she was glad of the stern fight ahead of her she set her will and steeled her heart with all the pride and vanity and fury of a woman who had been defeated but who scorned defeat she was what birth and breeding and circumstance had made her she would seek what the old life held  what with unpacking and chatting and telephoning and lunching the day soon passed carley went to dinner with friends and later to a roof garden the color and light the gayety and music the news of acquaintances the humor of the actorsall in fact except the unaccustomed heat and noise were most welcome and diverting that night she slept the sleep of weariness  awakening early she inaugurated a habit of getting up at once instead of lolling in bed and breakfasting there and reading her mail as had been her wont before going west then she went over business matters with her aunt called on her lawyer and banker took lunch with rose maynard and spent the afternoon shopping strong as she was the unaccustomed heat and the hard pavements and the jostle of shoppers and the continual rush of sensations wore her out so completely that she did not want any dinner she talked to her aunt a while then went to bed  next day carley motored through central park and out of town into westchester county finding some relief from the stiffing heat but she seemed to look at the dusty trees and the worn greens without really seeing them in the afternoon she called on friends and had dinner at home with her aunt and then went to a theatre the musical comedy was good but the almost unbearable heat and the vitiated air spoiled her enjoyment that night upon arriving home at midnight she stepped out of the taxi and involuntarily without thought looked up to see the stars but there were no stars a murky yellowtinged blackness hung low over the city carley recollected that stars and sunrises and sunsets and untainted air and silence were not for city dwellers she checked any continuation of the thought  a few days sufficed to swing her into the old life many of carleys friends had neither the leisure nor the means to go away from the city during the summer some there were who might have afforded that if they had seen fit to live in less showy apartments or to dispense with cars other of her best friends were on their summer outings in the adirondacks carley decided to go with her aunt to lake placid about the first of august meanwhile she would keep going and doing  she had been a week in town before morrison telephoned her and added his welcome despite the gay gladness of his voice it irritated her really she scarcely wanted to see him but a meeting was inevitable and besides going out with him was in accordance with the plan she had adopted so she made an engagement to meet him at the plaza for dinner when with slow and pondering action she hung up the receiver it occurred to her that she resented the idea of going to the plaza she did not dwell on the reason why  when carley went into the reception room of the plaza that night morrison was waiting for herthe same slim fastidious elegant sallowfaced morrison whose image she had in mind yet somehow different he had what carley called the new york masculine face blase and lined with eyes that gleamed yet had no fire but at sight of her his face lighted up  by jove but youve come back a peach he exclaimed clasping her extended hand eleanor told me you looked great its worth missing you to see you like this  thanks larry she replied i must look pretty well to win that compliment from you and how are you feeling you dont seem robust for a golfer and horseman but then im used to husky westerners  oh im fagged with the daily grind he said ill be glad to get up in the mountains next month lets go down to dinner  they descended the spiral stairway to the grillroom where an orchestra was playing jazz and dancers gyrated on a polished floor and diners in evening dress looked on over their cigarettes  well carley are you still finicky about the eats he queried consulting the menu  no but i prefer plain food she replied  have a cigarette he said holding out his silver monogrammed case  thanks larry ii guess ill not take up smoking again you see while i was west i got out of the habit  yes they told me you had changed he returned how about drinking  why i thought new york had gone dry she said forcing a laugh  only on the surface underneath its wetter than ever  well ill obey the law  he ordered a rather elaborate dinner and then turning his attention to carley gave her closer scrutiny carley knew then that he had become acquainted with the fact of her broken engagement it was a relief not to need to tell him  hows that big stiff kilbourne asked morrison suddenly is it true he got well  ohyes hes fine replied carley with eyes cast down a hot knot seemed to form deep within her and threatened to break and steal along her veins but if you pleasei do not care to talk of him  naturally but i must tell you that one mans loss is anothers gain  carley had rather expected renewed courtship from morrison she had not however been prepared for the beat of her pulse the quiver of her nerves the uprising of hot resentment at the mere mention of kilbourne it was only natural that glenns former rivals should speak of him and perhaps disparagingly but from this man carley could not bear even a casual reference morrison had escaped the army service he had been given a highsalaried post at the shipyardsthe duties of which if there had been any he performed wherever he happened to be morrisons father had made a fortune in leather during the war and carley remembered glenn telling her he had seen two whole blocks in paris piled twenty feet deep with leather army goods that were never used and probably had never been intended to be used morrison represented the not inconsiderable number of young men in new york who had gained at the expense of the valiant legion who had lost but what had morrison gained carley raised her eyes to gaze steadily at him he looked wellfed indolent rich effete and supremely selfsatisfied she could not see that he had gained anything she would rather have been a crippled ruined soldier  larry i fear gain and loss are mere words she said the thing that counts with me is what you are  he stared in wellbred surprise and presently talked of a new dance which had lately come into vogue and from that he passed on to gossip of the theatres once between courses of the dinner he asked carley to dance and she complied the music would have stimulated an egyptian mummy carley thought and the subdued rose lights the murmur of gay voices the glide and grace and distortion of the dancers were exciting and pleasurable morrison had the suppleness and skill of a dancingmaster but he held carley too tightly and so she told him and added i imbibed some fresh pure air while i was out westsomething you havent hereand i dont want it all squeezed out of me   the latter days of july carley made busyso busy that she lost her tan and appetite and something of her splendid resistance to the dragging heat and late hours seldom was she without some of her friends she accepted almost any kind of an invitation and went even to coney island to baseball games to the motion pictures which were three forms of amusement not customary with her at coney island which she visited with two of her younger girl friends she had the best time since her arrival home what had put her in accord with ordinary people the baseball games likewise pleased her the running of the players and the screaming of the spectators amused and excited her but she hated the motion pictures with their salacious and absurd misrepresentations of life in some cases capably acted by skillful actors and in others a silly series of scenes featuring some dollfaced girl  but she refused to go horseback riding in central park she refused to go to the plaza and these refusals she made deliberately without asking herself why  on august 1st she accompanied her aunt and several friends to lake placid where they established themselves at a hotel how welcome to carleys strained eyes were the green of mountains the soft gleam of amber water how sweet and refreshing a breath of cool pure air the change from new yorks glare and heat and dirt and ironred insulating walls and thronging millions of people and ceaseless roar and rush was tremendously relieving to carley she had burned the candle at both ends but the beauty of the hills and vales the quiet of the forest the sight of the stars made it harder to forget she had to rest and when she rested she could not always converse or read or write  for the most part her days held variety and pleasure the place was beautiful the weather pleasant the people congenial she motored over the forest roads she canoed along the margin of the lake she played golf and tennis she wore exquisite gowns to dinner and danced during the evenings but she seldom walked anywhere on the trails and never alone and she never climbed the mountains and never rode a horse  morrison arrived and added his attentions to those of other men carley neither accepted nor repelled them she favored the association with married couples and older people and rather shunned the pairing off peculiar to vacationists at summer hotels she had always loved to play and romp with children but here she found herself growing to avoid them somehow hurt by sound of pattering feet and joyous laughter she filled the days as best she could and usually earned quick slumber at night she staked all on present occupation and the truth of flying time    chapter ix  the latter part of september carley returned to new york  soon after her arrival she received by letter a formal proposal of marriage from elbert harrington who had been quietly attentive to her during her sojourn at lake placid he was a lawyer of distinction somewhat older than most of her friends and a man of means and fine family carley was quite surprised harrington was really one of the few of her acquaintances whom she regarded as somewhat behind the times and liked him the better for that but she could not marry him and replied to his letter in as kindly a manner as possible then he called personally  carley ive come to ask you to reconsider he said with a smile in his gray eyes he was not a tall or handsome man but he had what women called a nice strong face  elbert you embarrass me she replied trying to laugh it out indeed i feel honored and i thank you but i cant marry you  why not he asked quietly  because i dont love you she replied  i did not expect you to he said i hoped in time you might come to care ive known you a good many years carley forgive me if i tell you i see you are breakingwearing yourself down maybe it is not a husband you need so much now but you do need a home and children you are wasting your life  all you say may be true my friend replied carley with a helpless little upflinging of hands yet it does not alter my feelings  but you will marry sooner or later he queried persistently  this straightforward question struck carley as singularly as if it was one she might never have encountered it forced her to think of things she had buried  i dont believe i ever will she answered thoughtfully  that is nonsense carley he went on youll have to marry what else can you do with all due respect to your feelingsthat affair with kilbourne is endedand youre not the wishywashy heartbreak kind of a girl  you can never tell what a woman will do she said somewhat coldly  certainly not thats why i refuse to take no carley be reasonable you like merespect me do you not  why of course i do  im only thirtyfive and i could give you all any sensible woman wants he said lets make a real american home have you thought at all about that carley something is wrong today men are not marrying wives are not having children of all the friends i have not one has a real american home why it is a terrible fact but carley you are not a sentimentalist or a melancholiac nor are you a waster you have fine qualities you need something to do some one to care for  pray do not think me ungrateful elbert she replied nor insensible to the truth of what you say but my answer is no  when harrington had gone carley went to her room and precisely as upon her return from arizona she faced her mirror skeptically and relentlessly i am such a liar that ill do well to look at myself she meditated here i am again now the world expects me to marry but what do i expect  there was a raw unheated wound in carleys heart seldom had she permitted herself to think about it let alone to probe it with hard materialistic queries but custom to her was as inexorable as life if she chose to live in the world she must conform to its customs for a woman marriage was the aim and the end and the all of existence nevertheless for carley it could not be without love before she had gone west she might have had many of the conventional modern ideas about women and marriage but because out there in the wilds her love and perception had broadened now her arraignment of herself and her sex was bigger sterner more exacting the months she had been home seemed fuller than all the months of her life she had tried to forget and enjoy she had not succeeded but she had looked with farseeing eyes at her world glenn kilbournes tragic fate had opened her eyes  either the world was all wrong or the people in it were but if that were an extravagant and erroneous supposition there certainly was proof positive that her own small individual world was wrong the women did not do any real work they did not bear children they lived on excitement and luxury they had no ideals how greatly were men to blame carley doubted her judgment here but as men could not live without the smiles and comradeship and love of women it was only natural that they should give the women what they wanted indeed they had no choice it was give or go without how much of real love entered into the marriages among her acquaintances before marriage carley wanted a girl to be sweet proud aloof with a heart of golden fire not attainable except through love it would be better that no children be born at all unless born of such beautiful love perhaps that was why so few children were born natures balance and revenge in arizona carley had learned something of the ruthlessness and inevitableness of nature she was finding out she had learned this with many other staggering facts  i love glenn still she whispered passionately with trembling lips as she faced the tragiceyed image of herself in the mirror i love him moremore oh my god if i were honest id cry out the truth it is terrible  i will always love him how then could i marry any other man i would be a lie a cheat if i could only forget himonly kill that love then i might love another manand if i did love himno matter what i had felt or done before i would be worthy i could feel worthy i could give him just as much but without such love id give only a huska body without soul  love then was the sacred and holy flame of life that sanctioned the begetting of children marriage might be a necessity of modern time but it was not the vital issue carleys anguish revealed strange and hidden truths in some inexplicable way nature struck a terrible balancerevenged herself upon a people who had no children or who brought into the world children not created by the divinity of love unyearned for and therefore somehow doomed to carry on the blunders and burdens of life  carley realized how right and true it might be for her to throw herself away upon an inferior man even a fool or a knave if she loved him with that great and natural love of woman likewise it dawned upon her how false and wrong and sinful it would be to marry the greatest or the richest or the noblest man unless she had that supreme love to give him and knew it was reciprocated  what am i going to do with my life she asked bitterly and aghast i have beeni am a waster ive lived for nothing but pleasurable sensation im utterly useless i do absolutely no good on earth  thus she saw how harringtons words rang truehow they had precipitated a crisis for which her unconscious brooding had long made preparation  why not give up ideals and be like the rest of my kind she soliloquized  that was one of the things which seemed wrong with modern life she thrust the thought from her with passionate scorn if poor broken ruined glenn kilbourne could cling to an ideal and fight for it could not she who had all the world esteemed worth while be woman enough to do the same the direction of her thought seemed to have changed she had been ready for rebellion three months of the old life had shown her that for her it was empty vain farcical without one redeeming feature the naked truth was brutal but it cut clean to wholesome consciousness such socalled social life as she had plunged into deliberately to forget her unhappiness had failed her utterly if she had been shallow and frivolous it might have done otherwise stripped of all guise her actions must have been construed by a penetrating and impartial judge as a mere parading of her decorated person before a number of males with the purpose of ultimate selection  ive got to find some work she muttered soberly  at the moment she heard the postmans whistle outside and a little later the servant brought up her mail the first letter large soiled thick bore the postmark flagstaff and her address in glenn kilbournes writing  carley stared at it her heart gave a great leap her hand shook she sat down suddenly as if the strength of her legs was inadequate to uphold her  glenn haswritten me she whispered in slow halting realization for what oh why  the other letters fell off her lap to lie unnoticed this big thick envelope fascinated her it was one of the stamped envelopes she had seen in his cabin it contained a letter that had been written on his rude table before the open fire in the light of the doorway in that little logcabin under the spreading pines of west ford canyon dared she read it the shock to her heart passed and with mounting swell seemingly too full for her breast it began to beat and throb a wild gladness through all her being she tore the envelope apart and read   dear carley  im surely glad for a good excuse to write you  once in a blue moon i get a letter and today hutter brought me one from a soldier pard of mine who was with me in the argonne his name is virgil rustqueer name dont you thinkand hes from wisconsin just a roughdiamond sort of chap but fairly well educated he and i were in some pretty hot places and it was he who pulled me out of a shell crater id gone west sure then if it hadnt been for rust  well he did all sorts of big things during the war was down several times with wounds he liked to fight and he was a holy terror we all thought hed get medals and promotion but he didnt get either these muchdesired things did not always go where they were best deserved  rust is now lying in a hospital in bedford park his letter is pretty blue all he says about why hes there is that hes knocked out but he wrote a heap about his girl it seems he was in love with a girl in his home towna pretty bigeyed lass whose picture ive seenand while he was overseas she married one of the chaps who got out of fighting evidently rust is deeply hurt he wrote id not care so if shed thrown me down to marry an old man or a boy who couldnt have gone to war you see carley service men feel queer about that sort of thing its something we got over there and none of us will ever outlive it now the point of this is that i am asking you to go see rust and cheer him up and do what you can for the poor devil its a good deal to ask of you i know especially as rust saw your picture many a time and knows you were my girl but you neednt tell him that youwe couldnt make a go of it  and as i am writing this to you i see no reason why i shouldnt go on in behalf of myself  the fact is carley i miss writing to you more than i miss anything of my old life ill bet you have a trunkful of letters from meunless youve destroyed them im not going to say how i miss your letters but i will say you wrote the most charming and fascinating letters of anyone i ever knew quite aside from any sentiment you knew of course that i had no other girl correspondent well i got along fairly well before you came west but id be an awful liar if i denied i didnt get lonely for you and your letters its different now that youve been to oak creek im alone most of the time and i dream a lot and im afraid i see you here in my cabin and along the brook and under the pines and riding calicowhich you came to do welland on my hogpen fenceand oh everywhere i dont want you to think im down in the mouth for im not ill take my medicine but carley you spoiled me and i miss hearing from you and i dont see why it wouldnt be all right for you to send me a friendly letter occasionally  it is autumn now i wish you could see arizona canyons in their gorgeous colors we have had frost right along and the mornings are great theres a broad zigzag belt of gold halfway up the san francisco peaks and that is the aspen thickets taking on their fall coat here in the canyon youd think there was blazing fire everywhere the vines and the maples are red scarlet carmine cerise magenta all the hues of flame the oak leaves are turning russet gold and the sycamores are yellow green up on the desert the other day i rode across a patch of asters lilac and lavender almost purple i had to get off and pluck a handful and then what do you think i dug up the whole bunch roots and all and planted them on the sunny side of my cabin i rather guess your love of flowers engendered this remarkable susceptibility in me  im home early most every afternoon now and i like the couple of hours loafing around guess its bad for me though you know i seldom hunt and the trout in the pool here are so tame now theyll almost eat out of my hand i havent the heart to fish for them the squirrels too have grown tame and friendly theres a red squirrel that climbs up on my table and theres a chipmunk who lives in my cabin and runs over my bed ive a new petthe little pig you christened pinky after he had the wonderful good fortune to be caressed and named by you i couldnt think of letting him grow up in an ordinary piglike manner so i fetched him home my dog moze was jealous at first and did not like this intrusion but now they are good friends and sleep together flo has a kitten shes going to give me and then as hutter says ill be jake  my occupation during these leisure hours perhaps would strike my old friends east as idle silly mawkish but i believe you will understand me  i have the pleasure of doing nothing and of catching now and then a glimpse of supreme joy in the strange state of thinking nothing tennyson came close to this in his lotus eaters only to seeonly to feel is enough  sprawled on the warm sweet pine needles i breathe through them the breath of the earth and am somehow no longer lonely i cannot of course see the sunset but i watch for its coming on the eastern wall of the canyon i see the shadow slowly creep up driving the gold before it until at last the canyon rim and pines are turned to golden fire i watch the sailing eagles as they streak across the gold and swoop up into the blue and pass out of sight i watch the golden flush fade to gray and then the canyon slowly fills with purple shadows this hour of twilight is the silent and melancholy one seldom is there any sound save the soft rush of the water over the stones and that seems to die away for a moment perhaps i am hiawatha alone in his forest home or a more primitive savage feeling the great silent pulse of nature happy in unconsciousness like a beast of the wild but only for an instant do i ever catch this fleeting state next i am glenn kilbourne of west fork doomed and haunted by memories of the past the great looming walls then become no longer blank they are vast pages of the history of my life with its past and present and alas its future everything time does is written on the stones and my stream seems to murmur the sad and ceaseless flow of human life with its music and its misery  then descending from the sublime to the humdrum and necessary i heave a sigh and pull myself together and go in to make biscuits and fry ham but i should not forget to tell you that before i do go in very often my looming wonderful walls and crags weave in strange shadowy characters the beautiful and unforgettable face of carley burch  i append what little news oak creek affords  that blamed old bald eagle stole another of my pigs  i am doing so well with my hograising that hutter wants to come in with me giving me an interest in his sheep  it is rumored some one has bought the deep lake section i wanted for a ranch i dont know who hutter was rather noncommittal  charley the herder had one of his queer spells the other day and swore to me he had a letter from you he told the blamed lie with a sincere and placid eye and even a smile of pride queer guy that charley  flo and lee stanton had another quarrelthe worst yet lee tells me flo asked a girl friend out from flag and threw her in lees way so to speak and when lee retaliated by making love to the girl flo got mad funny creatures you girls flo rode with me from high falls to west fork and never showed the slightest sign of trouble in fact she was delightfully gay she rode calico and beat me bad in a race  adios carley wont you write me  glenn   no sooner had carley read the letter through to the end than she began it all over again and on this second perusal she lingered over passagesonly to reread them that suggestion of her face sculptured by shadows on the canyon walls seemed to thrill her very soul  she leaped up from the reading to cry out something that was unutterable all the intervening weeks of shame and anguish and fury and strife and pathos and the endless striving to forget were as if by the magic of a letter made nothing but vain oblations  he loves me still she whispered and pressed her breast with clenching hands and laughed in wild exultance and paced her room like a caged lioness it was as if she had just awakened to the assurance she was beloved that was the shibboleththe cry by which she sounded the closed depths of her love and called to the stricken life of a womans insatiate vanity  then she snatched up the letter to scan it again and suddenly grasping the import of glenns request she hurried to the telephone to find the number of the hospital in bedford park a nurse informed her that visitors were received at certain hours and that any attention to disabled soldiers was most welcome  carley motored out there to find the hospital merely a long onestory frame structure a barracks hastily thrown up for the care of invalided men of the service the chauffeur informed her that it had been used for that purpose during the training period of the army and later when injured soldiers began to arrive from france  a nurse admitted carley into a small bare anteroom carley made known her errand  im glad its rust you want to see replied the nurse some of these boys are going to die and some will be worse off if they live but rust may get well if hell only behave you are a relativeor friend  i dont know him answered carley but i have a friend who was with him in france  the nurse led carley into a long narrow room with a line of single beds down each side a stove at each end and a few chairs each bed appeared to have an occupant and those nearest carley lay singularly quiet at the far end of the room were soldiers on crutches wearing bandages on their beads carrying their arms in slings their merry voices contrasted discordantly with their sad appearance  presently carley stood beside a bed and looked down upon a gaunt haggard young man who lay propped up on pillows  rusta lady to see you announced the nurse  carley had difficulty in introducing herself had glenn ever looked like this what a face its healed scar only emphasized the pallor and furrows of pain that assuredly came from present wounds he had unnaturally bright dark eyes and a flush of fever in his hollow cheeks  how do he said with a wan smile whore you  im glenn kilbournes fiancee she replied holding out her hand  say i ought tove known you he said eagerly and a warmth of light changed the gray shade of his face youre the girl carley youre almost like mymy own girl by golly youre some looker it was good of you to come tell me about glenn  carley took the chair brought by the nurse and pulling it close to the bed she smiled down upon him and said ill be glad to tell you all i knowpresently but first you tell me about yourself are you in pain what is your trouble you must let me do everything i can for you and these other men  carley spent a poignant and depthstirring hour at the bedside of glenns comrade at last she learned from loyal lips the nature of glenn kilbournes service to his country how carley clasped to her sore heart the praise of the man she lovedthe simple proofs of his noble disregard of self rust said little about his own service to country or to comrade but carley saw enough in his face he had been like glenn by these two carley grasped the compelling truth of the spirit and sacrifice of the legion of boys who had upheld american traditions their children and their childrens children as the years rolled by into the future would hold their heads higher and prouder some things could never die in the hearts and the blood of a race these boys and the girls who had the supreme glory of being loved by them must be the ones to revive the americanism of their forefathers nature and god would take care of the slackers the cowards who cloaked their shame with bland excuses of home service of disability and of dependence  carley saw two forces in lifethe destructive and constructive on the one side greed selfishness materialism on the other generosity sacrifice and idealism which of them builded for the future she saw men as wolves sharks snakes vermin and opposed to them men as lions and eagles she saw women who did not inspire men to fare forth to seek to imagine to dream to hope to work to fight she began to have a glimmering of what a woman might be   that night she wrote swiftly and feverishly page after page to glenn only to destroy what she had written she could not keep her heart out of her words nor a hint of what was becoming a sleepless and eternal regret she wrote until a late hour and at last composed a letter she knew did not ring true so stilted and restrained was it in all passages save those concerning news of glenns comrade and of her own friends ill nevernever write him again she averred with stiff lips and next moment could have laughed in mockery at the bitter truth if she had ever had any courage glenns letter had destroyed it but had it not been a kind of selfish false courage roused to hide her hurt to save her own future courage should have a thought of others yet shamed one moment at the consciousness she would write glenn again and again and exultant the next with the clamouring love she seemed to have climbed beyond the self that had striven to forget she would remember and think though she died of longing  carley like a drowning woman caught at straws what a relief and joy to give up that endless nagging at her mind for months she had kept ceaselessly active by associations which were of no help to her and which did not make her happy in her determination to forget suddenly then she gave up to remembrance she would cease trying to get over her love for glenn and think of him and dream about him as much as memory dictated this must constitute the only happiness she could have  the change from strife to surrender was so novel and sweet that for days she felt renewed it was augmented by her visits to the hospital in bedford park through her bountiful presence virgil rust and his comrades had many dull hours of pain and weariness alleviated and brightened interesting herself in the condition of the seriously disabled soldiers and possibility of their future took time and work carley gave willingly and gladly at first she endeavored to get acquaintances with means and leisure to help the boys but these overtures met with such little success that she quit wasting valuable time she could herself devote to their interests  thus several weeks swiftly passed by several soldiers who had been more seriously injured than rust improved to the extent that they were discharged but rust gained little or nothing the nurse and doctor both informed carley that rust brightened for her but when she was gone he lapsed into somber indifference he did not care whether he ate or not or whether he got well or died  if i do pull out wherell i go and whatll i do he once asked the nurse  carley knew that rusts hurt was more than loss of a leg and she decided to talk earnestly to him and try to win him to hope and effort he had come to have a sort of reverence for her so biding her time she at length found opportunity to approach his bed while his comrades were asleep or out of hearing he endeavored to laugh her off and then tried subterfuge and lastly he cast off his mask and let her see his naked soul  carley i dont want your money or that of your kind friendswhoever they areyou say will help me to get into business he said god knows i thank you and it warms me inside to find some one who appreciates what ive given but i dont want charity and i guess im pretty sick of the game im sorry the boches didnt do the job right  rust that is morbid talk replied carley youre ill and you just cant see any hope you must cheer upfight yourself and look at the brighter side its a horrible pity you must be a cripple but rust indeed life can be worth living if you make it so  how could there be a brighter side when a mans only half a man he queried bitterly  you can be just as much a man as ever persisted carley trying to smile when she wanted to cry  could you care for a man with only one leg he asked deliberately  what a question why of course i could  well maybe you are different glenn always swore even if he was killed no slacker or no rich guy left at home could ever get you maybe you havent any idea how much it means to us fellows to know there are true and faithful girls but ill tell you carley we fellows who went across got to see things strange when we came home the good old u s needs a lot of faithful girls just now believe me  indeed thats true replied carley its a hard time for everybody and particularly you boys who have lost soso much  i lost all except my lifeand i wish to god id lost that he replied gloomily  oh dont talk so implored carley in distress forgive me rust if i hurt you but i must tell youthatthat glenn wrote meyoud lost your girl oh im sorry it is dreadful for you now but if you got welland went to workand took up life where you left itwhy soon your pain would grow easier and youd find some happiness yet  never for me in this world  but why rust why youre nonooh i mean you have intelligence and courage why isnt there anything left for you  because something heres been killed he replied and put his hand to his heart  your faith your love ofof everything did the war kill it  id gotten over that maybe he said drearily with his somber eyes on space that seemed lettered for him but she half murdered itand they did the rest  they whom do you mean rust  why carley i mean the people i lost my leg for he replied with terrible softness  the british the french she queried in bewilderment  no he cried and turned his face to the wall  carley dared not ask him more she was shocked how helplessly impotent all her earnest sympathy no longer could she feel an impersonal however kindly interest in this man his last ringing word had linked her also to his misfortune and his suffering suddenly he turned away from the wall she saw him swallow laboriously how tragic that thin shadowed face of agony carley saw it differently but for the beautiful softness of light in his eyes she would have been unable to endure gazing longer  carley im bitter he said but im not rancorous and callous like some of the boys i know if youd been my girl youd have stuck to me  yes carley whispered  that makes a difference he went on with a sad smile you see we soldiers all had feelings and in one thing we all felt alike that was we were going to fight for our homes and our women i should say women first no matter what we read or heard about standing by our allies fighting for liberty or civilization the truth was we all felt the same even if we never breathed it glenn fought for you i fought for nell we were not going to let the huns treat you as they treated french and belgian girls and think nell was engaged to meshe loved meand by god she married a slacker when i lay half dead on the battlefield  she was not worth loving or fighting for said carley with agitation  ah now youve said something he declared if i can only hold to that truth what does one girl amount to i do not count it is the sum that counts we love americaour homesour women carley ive had comfort and strength come to me through you glenn will have his reward in your love somehow i seem to share it a little poor glenn he got his too why carley that guy wouldnt let you do what he could do for you he was cut to pieces  pleaserustdont say any more i am unstrung she pleaded  why not its due you to know how splendid glenn was i tell you carley all the boys here love you for the way youve stuck to glenn some of them knew him and ive told the rest we thought hed never pull through but he has and we know how you helped going west to see him he didnt write it to me but i know im wise im happy for himthe lucky dog next time you go west  hush cried carley she could endure no more she could no longer be a lie  youre whiteyoure shaking exclaimed rust in concern oh iwhat did i say forgive me  rust i am no more worth loving and fighting for than your nell  what he ejaculated  i have not told you the truth she said swiftly i have let you believe a lie i shall never marry glenn i broke my engagement to him  slowly rust sank back upon the pillow his large luminous eyes piercingly fixed upon her as if he would read her soul  i went westyes continued carley but it was selfishly i wanted glenn to come back here he had suffered as you have he nearly died but he foughthe foughtoh he went through hell and after a long slow horrible struggle he began to mend he worked he went to raising hogs he lived alone he worked harder and harder the west and his work saved him body and soul he had learned to love both the west and his work i did not blame him but i could not live out there he needed me but i was too littletoo selfish i could not marry him i gave him up  i lefthimalone  carley shrank under the scorn in rusts eyes  and theres another man he said a clean straight unscarred fellow who wouldnt fight  oh noii swear theres not whispered carley  you too he replied thickly then slowly he turned that worn dark face to the wall his frail breast heaved and his lean hand made her a slight gesture of dismissal significant and imperious  carley fled she could scarcely see to find the car all her internal being seemed convulsed and a deadly faintness made her sick and cold    chapter x  carleys edifice of hopes dreams aspirations and struggles fell in ruins about her it had been built upon false sands it had no ideal for foundation it had to fall  something inevitable had forced her confession to rust dissimulation had been a habit of her mind it was more a habit of her class than sincerity but she had reached a point in her mental strife where she could not stand before rust and let him believe she was noble and faithful when she knew she was neither would not the next step in this painful metamorphosis of her character be a fierce and passionate repudiation of herself and all she represented  she went home and locked herself in her room deaf to telephone and servants there she gave up to her shame scorneddespiseddismissed by that poor crippled flamespirited virgil rust he had reverenced her and the truth had earned his hate would she ever forget his lookincredulousshockedbitterand blazing with unutterable contempt carley burch was only another nella jilta mocker of the manhood of soldiers would she ever cease to shudder at memory of rusts slight movement of hand go get out of my sight leave me to my agony as you left glenn kilbourne alone to fight his men such as i am do not want the smile of your face the touch of your hand we gave for womanhood pass on to lesser men who loved the fleshpots and who would buy your charms so carley interpreted that slight gesture and writhed in her abasement  rust threw a white illuminating light upon her desertion of glenn she had betrayed him she had left him alone dwarfed and stunted was her narrow soul to a man who had given all for her she had returned nothing stone for bread betrayal for love cowardice for courage  the hours of contending passions gave birth to vague slowforming revolt  she became haunted by memory pictures and sounds and smells of oak creek canyon as from afar she saw the great sculptured rent in the earth green and red and brown with its shining flashing ribbons of waterfalls and streams the mighty pines stood up magnificent and stately the walls loomed high shadowed under the shelves gleaming in the sunlight and they seemed dreaming waiting watching for what for her return to their serene fastnessesto the little gray log cabin the thought stormed carleys soul  vivid and intense shone the images before her shut eyes she saw the winding forest floor green with grass and fern colorful with flower and rock a thousand aisles glades nooks and caverns called her to come nature was every womans mother the populated city was a delusion disease and death and corruption stalked in the shadows of the streets but her canyon promised hard work playful hours dreaming idleness beauty health fragrance loneliness peace wisdom love children and long life in the hateful shutin isolation of her room carley stretched forth her arms as if to embrace the vision pale close walls gleaming placid stretches of brook churning amber and white rapids mossy banks and pinematted ledges the towers and turrets and ramparts where the eagles wheeledshe saw them all as beloved images lost to her save in anguished memory  she heard the murmur of flowing water soft low now loud and again lulling hollow and eager tinkling over rocks bellowing into the deep pools washing with silky seep of windswept waves the hanging willows shrill and piercing and faraloft pealed the scream of the eagle and she seemed to listen to a mocking bird while he mocked her with his melody of many birds the bees hummed the wind moaned the leaves rustled the waterfall murmured then came the sharp rare note of a canyon swift most mysterious of birds significant of the heights  a breath of fragrance seemed to blow with her shifting senses the dry sweet tangy canyon smells returned to herof freshcut timber of wood smoke of the cabin fire with its steaming pots of flowers and earth and of the wet stones of the redolent pines and the pungent cedars  and suddenly clearly amazingly carley beheld in her minds sight the hard features the bold eyes the slight smile the coarse face of haze ruff she had forgotten him but he now returned and with memory of him flashed a revelation as to his meaning in her life he had appeared merely a clout a ruffian an animal with mans shape and intelligence but he was the embodiment of the raw crude violence of the west he was the eyes of the natural primitive man believing what he saw he had seen in carley burch the paraded charm the unashamed and serene front the woman seeking man haze ruff had been neither vile nor base nor unnatural it had been her subjection to the decadence of feminine dress that had been unnatural but ruff had found her a lie she invited what she did not want and his scorn had been commensurate with the falsehood of her so might any man have been justified in his insult to her in his rejection of her haze ruff had found her unfit for his idea of dalliance virgil rust had found her false to the ideals of womanhood for which he had sacrificed all but life itself what then had glenn kilbourne found her he possessed the greatness of noble love he had loved her before the dark and changeful tide of war had come between them how had he judged her that last sight of him standing alone leaning with head bowed a solitary figure trenchant with suggestion of tragic resignation and strength returned to flay carley he had loved trusted and hoped she saw now what his hope had beenthat she would have instilled into her blood the subtle red and revivifying essence of calling life in the open the strength of the wives of earlier years an emanation from canyon desert mountain forest of health of spirit of forwardgazing natural love of the mysterious saving instinct he had gotten out of the west and she had been too little too steeped in the indulgence of luxurious life too slightnatured and paleblooded and suddenly there pierced into the black storm of carleys mind a blazing whitestreaked thoughtshe had left glenn to the western girl flo hutter humiliated and abased in her own sight carley fell prey to a fury of jealousy  she went back to the old life but it was in a bitter restless critical spirit conscious of the fact that she could derive neither forgetfulness nor pleasure from it nor see any release from the habit of years  one afternoon late in the fall she motored out to a long island club where the last of the seasons golf was being enjoyed by some of her most intimate friends carley did not play aimlessly she walked around the grounds finding the autumn colors subdued and drab like her mind the air held a promise of early winter she thought that she would go south before the cold came always trying to escape anything rigorous hard painful or disagreeable later she returned to the clubhouse to find her party assembled on an inclosed porch chatting and partaking of refreshment morrison was there he had not taken kindly to her late habit of denying herself to him  during a lull in the idle conversation morrison addressed carley pointedly well carley hows your arizona hograiser he queried with a little gleam in his usually lusterless eyes  i have not heard lately she replied coldly  the assembled company suddenly quieted with a portent inimical to their leisurely content of the moment carley felt them all looking at her and underneath the exterior she preserved with extreme difficulty there burned so fierce an anger that she seemed to have swelling veins of fire  queer how kilbourne went into raising hogs observed morrison such a lowdown sort of work you know  he had no choice replied carley glenn didnt have a father who made tainted millions out of the war he had to work and i must differ with you about its being lowdown no honest work is that it is idleness that is low down  but so foolish of glenn when he might have married money rejoined morrison sarcastcally  the honor of soldiers is beyond your ken mr morrison  he flushed darkly and bit his lip  you women make a man sick with this rot about soldiers he said the gleam in his eye growing ugly a uniform goes to a womans head no matter whats inside it i dont see where your vaunted honor of soldiers comes in considering how they accepted the letdown of women during and after the war  how could you see when you stayed comfortably at home retorted carley  all i could see was women falling into soldiers arms he said sullenly  certainly could an american girl desire any greater happinessor opportunity to prove her gratitude flashed carley with proud uplift of head  it didnt look like gratitude to me returned morrison  well it was gratitude declared carley ringingly if women of america did throw themselves at soldiers it was not owing to the moral lapse of the day it was womans instinct to save the race always in every war women have sacrificed themselves to the future not vile but noble you insult both soldiers and women mr morrison i wonderdid any american girls throw themselves at you  morrison turned a dead white and his mouth twisted to a distorted checking of speech disagreeable to see  no you were a slacker went on carley with scathing scorn you let the other men go fight for american girls do you imagine one of them will ever marry you all your life mr morrison you will be a marked manoutside the pale of friendship with real american men and the respect of real american girls  morrison leaped up almost knocking the table over and he glared at carley as he gathered up his hat and cane she turned her back upon him from that moment he ceased to exist for carley she never spoke to him again   next day carley called upon her dearest friend whom she had not seen for some time  carley dear you dont look so very well said eleanor after greetings had been exchanged  oh what does it matter how i look queried carley impatiently  you were so wonderful when you got home from arizona  if i was wonderful and am now commonplace you can thank your old new york for it  carley dont you care for new york any more asked eleanor  oh new york is all right i suppose its i who am wrong  my dear you puzzle me these days youve changed im sorry im afraid youre unhappy  me oh impossible im in a seventh heaven replied carley with a hard little laugh what re you doing this afternoon lets go outridingor somewhere  im expecting the dressmaker  where are you going tonight  dinner and theater its a party or id ask you  what did you do yesterday and the day before and the days before that  eleanor laughed indulgently and acquainted carley with a record of her social wanderings during the last few days  the same old thingsover and over again eleanor dont you get sick of it queried carley  oh yes to tell the truth returned eleanor thoughtfully but theres nothing else to do  eleanor im no better than you said carley with disdain im as useless and idle but im beginning to see myselfand youand all this rotten crowd of ours were no good but youre married eleanor youre settled in life you ought to do something im single and at loose ends oh im in revolt think eleanor just think your husband works hard to keep you in this expensive apartment you have a car he dresses you in silks and satins you wear diamonds you eat your breakfast in bed you loll around in a pink dressing gown all morning you dress for lunch or tea you ride or golf or worse than waste your time on some lounge lizard dancing till time to come home to dress for dinner you let other men make love to you oh dont get sore you do and so goes the round of your life what good on earth are you anyhow youre just aa gratification to the senses of your husband and at that you dont see much of him  carley how you rave exclaimed her friend what has gotten into you lately why everybody tells me youreyoure queer the way you insulted morrisonhow unlike you carley  im glad i found the nerve to do it what do you think eleanor  oh i despise him but you cant say the things you feel  youd be bigger and truer if you did some day ill break out and flay you and your friends alive  but carley youre my friend and youre just exactly like we are or you were quite recently  of course im your friend ive always loved you eleanor went on carley earnestly im as deep in thisthis damned stagnant muck as you or anyone but im no longer blind theres something terribly wrong with us women and its not what morrison hinted  carley the only thing wrong with you is that you jilted poor glennand are breaking your heart over him still  dontdont cried carley shrinking god knows that is true but theres more wrong with me than a blighted love affair  yes you mean the modern feminine unrest  eleanor i positively hate that phrase modern feminine unrest it smacks of ultraultraoh i dont know what that phrase ought to be translated by a western acquaintance of mineone haze ruff id not like to hurt your sensitive feelings with what hed say but this unrest means speedmad excitementmad fadmad dressmad or i should say undressmad culturemad and heaven only knows what else the women of our set are idle luxurious selfish pleasurecraving lazy useless workandchildren shirking absolutely no good  well if we are whos to blame rejoined eleanor spiritedly now carley burch you listen to me i think the twentiethcentury girl in america is the most wonderful female creation of all the ages of the universe i admit it that is why we are a prey to the evils attending greatness listen here is a crying sinan infernal paradox take this twentiethcentury girl this american girl who is the finest creation of the ages a young and healthy girl the most perfect type of culture possible to the freest and greatest city on earthnew york she holds absolutely an unreal untrue position in the scheme of existence surrounded by parents relatives friends suitors and instructive schools of every kind colleges institutions is she really happy is she really living  eleanor interrupted carley earnestly she is not and ive been trying to tell you why  my dear let me get a word in will you complained eleanor you dont know it all there are as many different points of view as there are people well if this girl happened to have a new frock and a new beau to show it to shed say im the happiest girl in the world but she is nothing of the kind only she doesnt know that she approaches marriage or for that matter a more matured life having had too much having been too well taken care of knowing too much her masculine satellitesfather brothers uncles friends loversall utterly spoil her mind you i mean girls like us of the middle classwhich is to say the largest and best class of americans we are spoiled this girl marries and life goes on smoothly as if its aim was to exclude friction and effort her husband makes it too easy for her she is an ornament or a toy to be kept in a luxurious cage to soil her pretty hands would be disgraceful even if she cant afford a maid the modern devices of science make the care of her fourroom apartment a farce electric dishwasher clotheswasher vacuumcleaner and the nearby delicatessen and the caterer simply rob a young wife of her housewifely heritage if she has a babywhich happens occasionally carley in spite of your assertionit very soon goes to the kindergarten then what does she find to do with hours and hours if she is not married what on earth can she find to do  she can work replied carley bluntly  oh yes she can but she doesnt went on eleanor you dont work i never did we both hated the idea youre calling spades spades carley but you seem to be riding a morbid impractical thesis well our young american girl or bride goes in for being rushed or she goes in for fads the ultra stuff you mentioned new york city gets all the great artists lecturers and surely the great fakirs the new york women support them the men laugh but they furnish the money they take the women to the theaters but they cut out the reception to a polish princess a lecture by an indian magician and mystic or a benefit luncheon for a home for friendless cats the truth is most of our young girls or brides have a wonderful enthusiasm worthy of a better cause what is to become of their surplus energy the bottledlightning spirit so characteristic of modern girls where is the outlet for intense feelings what use can they make of education or of gifts they just cant thats all im not taking into consideration the newwoman species the faddist or the reformer i mean normal girls like you and me just think carley a girls every wish every need is almost instantly satisfied without the slightest effort on her part to obtain it no struggle let alone work if women crave to achieve something outside of the arts you know something universal and helpful which will make men acknowledge her worth if not the equality where is the opportunity  opportunities should be made replied carley  there are a million sides to this question of the modern young womanthe findesiecle girl im for her  how about the extreme of style in dress for this remarkablytobepitied american girl you champion so eloquently queried carley sarcastically  immoral exclaimed eleanor with frank disgust  you admit it  to my shame i do  why do women wear extreme clothes why do you and i wear openwork silk stockings skirts to our knees gowns without sleeves or bodices  were slaves to fashion replied eleanor thats the popular excuse  bah exclaimed carley  eleanor laughed in spite of being half nettled are you going to stop wearing what all the other women wearand be looked at askance are you going to be dowdy and frumpy and oldfashioned  no but ill never wear anything again that can be called immoral i want to be able to say why i wear a dress you havent answered my question yet why do you wear what you frankly admit is disgusting  i dont know carley replied eleanor helplessly how you harp on things we must dress to make other women jealous and to attract men to be a sensation perhaps the word immoral is not what i mean a woman will be shocking in her obsession to attract but hardly more than that if she knows it  ah so few women realize how they actually do look haze ruff could tell them  haze ruff who in the world is he or she asked eleanor  haze ruff is a he all right replied carley grimly  well who is he  a sheepdipper in arizona answered carley dreamily  humph and what can mr ruff tell us  he told me i looked like one of the devils angelsand that i dressed to knock the daylights out of men  well carley burch if that isnt rich exclaimed eleanor with a peal of laughter i dare say you appreciate that as an original compliment  no i wonder what ruff would say about jazzi just wonder murmured carley  well i wouldnt care what he said and i dont care what you say returned eleanor the preachers and reformers and bishops and rabbis make me sick they rave about jazz jazzthe discordant note of our decadence jazzthe harmonious expression of our musicless mindless soulless materialismthe idiots if they could be women for a while they would realize the error of their ways but they will never never abolish jazznever for it is the grandest the most wonderful the most absolutely necessary thing for women in this terrible age of smotheration  all right eleanor we understand each other even if we do not agree said carley you leave the future of women to chance to life to materialism not to their own conscious efforts i want to leave it to free will and idealism  carley you are getting a little beyond me declared eleanor dubiously  what are you going to do it all comes home to each individual woman her attitude toward life  ill drift along with the current carley and be a good sport replied eleanor smiling  you dont care about the women and children of the future youll not deny yourself now and think and work and suffer a little in the interest of future humanity  how you put things carley exclaimed eleanor wearily of course i carewhen you make me think of such things but what have i to do with the lives of people in the years to come  everything america for americans while you dawdle the life blood is being sucked out of our great nation it is a mans job to fight it is a womans to save i think youve made your choice though you dont realize it im praying to god that ill rise to mine   carley had a visitor one morning earlier than the usual or conventional time for calls  he wouldnt give no name said the maid he wears soldier clothes maam and hes pale and walks with a cane  tell him ill be right down replied carley  her hands trembled while she hurriedly dressed could this caller be virgil rust she hoped so but she doubted  as she entered the parlor a tall young man in worn khaki rose to meet her at first glance she could not name him though she recognized the pale face and lightblue eyes direct and steady  good morning miss burch he said i hope youll excuse so early a call you remember me dont you im george burton who had the bunk next to rusts  surely i remember you mr burton and im glad to see you replied carley shaking hands with him please sit down your being here must mean youre discharged from the hospital  yes i was discharged all right he said  which means youre well again that is fine im very glad  i was put out to make room for a fellow in bad shape im still shaky and weak he replied but im glad to go ive pulled through pretty good and itll not be long until im strong again it was the flu that kept me down  you must be careful may i ask where youre going and what you expect to do  yes thats what i came to tell you he replied frankly i want you to help me a little im from illinois and my people arent so badly off but i dont want to go back to my home town down and out you know besides the winters are cold there the doctor advises me to go to a little milder climate you see i was gassed and got the flu afterward but i know ill be all right if im careful well ive always had a leaning toward agriculture and i want to go to kansas southern kansas i want to travel around till i find a place i like and there ill get a job not too hard a job at firstthats why ill need a little money i know what to do i want to lose myself in the wheat country and forget thethe war ill not be afraid of work presently now miss burch youve been so kindim going to ask you to lend me a little money ill pay it back i cant promise just when but some day will you  assuredly i will she replied heartily im happy to have the opportunity to help you how much will you need for immediate use five hundred dollars  oh no not so much as that he replied just railroad fare home and then to kansas and to pay board while i get well you know and look around  well make it five hundred anyway she replied and rising she went toward the library excuse me a moment she wrote the check and returning gave it to him  youre very good he said rather low  not at all replied carley you have no idea how much it means to me to be permitted to help you before i forget i must ask you can you cash that check here in new york  not unless you identify me he said ruefully i dont know anyone i could ask  well when you leave here go at once to my bankits on thirtyfourth streetand ill telephone the cashier so youll not have any difficulty will you leave new york at once  i surely will its an awful place two years ago when i came here with my company i thought it was grand but i guess i lost something over there  i want to be where its quiet where i wont see many people  i think i understand returned carley then i suppose youre in a hurry to get home of course you have a girl youre just dying to see  no im sorry to say i havent he replied simply i was glad i didnt have to leave a sweetheart behind when i went to france but it wouldnt be so bad to have one to go back to now  dont you worry exclaimed carley you can take your choice presently you have the open sesame to every real american girls heart  and what is that he asked with a blush  your service to your country she said gravely  well he said with a singular bluntness considering i didnt get any medals or bonuses id like to draw a nice girl  you will replied carley and made haste to change the subject by the way did you meet glenn kilbourne in france  not that i remember rejoined burton as he got up rising rather stiffly by aid of his cane i must go miss burch really i cant thank you enough and ill never forget it  will you write me how you are getting along asked carley offering her hand  yes  carley moved with him out into the hall and to the door there was a question she wanted to ask but found it strangely difficult of utterance at the door burton fixed a rather penetrating gaze upon her  you didnt ask me about rust he said  no ii didnt think of himuntil now in fact carley lied  of course then you couldnt have heard about him i was wondering  i have heard nothing  it was rust who told me to come to you said burton we were talking one day and hewell he thought you were true blue he said he knew youd trust me and lend me money i couldnt have asked you but for him  true blue he believed that im glad has he spoken of me to you since i was last at the hospital  hardly replied burton with the straight strange glance on her again  carley met this glance and suddenly a coldness seemed to envelop her it did not seem to come from within though her heart stopped beating burton had not changedthe warmth the gratitude still lingered about him but the light of his eyes carley had seen it in glenns in rustsa strange questioning faroff light infinitely aloof and unutterably sad then there came a lift of her heart that released a pang she whispered with dread with a tremor with an instinct of calamity  how aboutrust  hes dead   the winter came with its bleak sea winds and cold rains and blizzards of snow carley did not go south she read and brooded and gradually avoided all save those true friends who tolerated her  she went to the theater a good deal showing preference for the drama of strife and she did not go anywhere for amusement distraction and amusement seemed to be dead issues for her but she could become absorbed in any argument on the good or evil of the present day socialism reached into her mind to be rejected she had never understood it clearly but it seemed to her a state of mind where dissatisfied men and women wanted to share what harder working or more gifted people possessed there were a few who had too much of the worlds goods and many who had too little a readjustment of such inequality and injustice must come but carley did not see the remedy in socialism  she devoured books on the war with a morbid curiosity and hope that she would find some illuminating truth as to the uselessness of sacrificing young men in the glory and prime of their lives to her war appeared a matter of human nature rather than politics hate really was an effect of war in her judgment future wars could be avoided only in two waysby men becoming honest and just or by women refusing to have children to be sacrificed as there seemed no indication whatever of the former she wondered how soon all women of all races would meet on a common height with the mounting spirit that consumed her own heart such time must come she granted every argument for war and flung against it one ringing passionate truthagony of mangled soldiers and agony of women and children there was no justification for offensive war it was monstrous and hideous if nature and evolution proved the absolute need of strife war blood and death in the progress of animal and man toward perfection then it would be better to abandon this christless code and let the race of man die out  all through these weeks she longed for a letter from glenn but it did not come had he finally roused to the sweetness and worth and love of the western girl flo hutter carley knew absolutely through both intelligence and intuition that glenn kilbourne would never love flo yet such was her intensity and stress at times especially in the darkness of waking hours that jealousy overcame her and insidiously worked its havoc peace and a strange kind of joy came to her in dreams of her walks and rides and climbs in arizona of the lonely canyon where it always seemed afternoon of the tremendous colored vastness of that painted desert but she resisted these dreams now because when she awoke from them she suffered such a yearning that it became unbearable then she knew the feeling of the loneliness and solitude of the hills then she knew the sweetness of the murmur of falling water the wind in the pines the song of birds the white radiance of the stars the break of day and its goldflushed close but she had not yet divined their meaning it was not all love for glenn kilbourne had city life palled upon her solely because of the absence of her lover so carley plodded on like one groping in the night fighting shadows  one day she received a card from an old schoolmate a girl who had married out of carleys set and had been ostracized she was living down on long island at a little country place named wading river her husband was an electriciansomething of an inventor he worked hard a baby boy had just come to them would not carley run down on the train to see the youngster  that was a strong and trenchant call carley went she found indeed a country village and on the outskirts of it a little cottage that must have been pretty in summer when the green was on vines and trees her old schoolmate was rosy plump brighteyed and happy she saw in carley no changea fact that somehow rebounded sweetly on carleys consciousness elsie prattled of herself and her husband and how they had worked to earn this little home and then the baby  when carley saw the adorable darkeyed pinktoed curlyfisted baby she understood elsies happiness and reveled in it when she felt the soft warm living little body in her arms against her breast then she absorbed some incalculable and mysterious strength what were the trivial sordid and selfish feelings that kept her in tumult compared to this welling emotion had she the secret in her arms babies and carley had never become closely acquainted in those infrequent meetings that were usually the result of chance but elsies baby nestled to her breast and cooed to her and clung to her finger when at length the youngster was laid in his crib it seemed to carley that the fragrance and the soul of him remained with her  a real american boy she murmured  you can just bet he is replied elsie carley you ought to see his dad  id like to meet him said carley thoughtfully elsie was he in the service  yes he was on one of the navy transports that took munitions to france think of me carrying this baby with my husband on a boat full of explosives and with german submarines roaming the ocean oh it was horrible  but he came back and now alls well with you said carley with a smile of earnestness im very glad elsie  yesbut i shudder when i think of a possible war in the future im going to raise boys and girls too i hopeand the thought of war is torturing  carley found her return train somewhat late and she took advantage of the delay to walk out to the wooded headlands above the sound  it was a raw march day with a steely sun going down in a palegray sky patches of snow lingered in sheltered brushy places this bit of woodland had a floor of soft sand that dragged at carleys feet there were sere and brown leaves still fluttering on the scruboaks at length carley came out on the edge of the bluff with the gray expanse of sea beneath her and a long wandering shore line ragged with wreckage or driftwood the surge of water rolled ina long low white creeping line that softly roared on the beach and dragged the pebbles gratingly back there was neither boat nor living creature in sight  carley felt the scene ease a clutching hand within her breast here was loneliness and solitude vastly different from that of oak creek canyon yet it held the same intangible power to soothe the swish of the surf the moan of the wind in the evergreens were voices that called to her how many more miles of lonely land than peopled cities then the seahow vast and over that the illimitable and infinite sky and beyond the endless realms of space it helped her somehow to see and hear and feel the eternal presence of nature in communion with nature the significance of life might be realized she remembered glenn quoting the world is too much with us  getting and spending we lay waste our powers what were our powers what did god intend men to do with hands and bodies and gifts and souls she gazed back over the bleak land and then out across the broad sea only a millionth part of the surface of the unsubmerged earth knew the populous abodes of man and the lonely sea inhospitable to stable homes of men was thrice the area of the land were men intended then to congregate in few places to squabble and to bicker and breed the discontents that led to injustice hatred and war what a mystery it all was but nature was neither false nor little however cruel she might be   once again carley fell under the fury of her ordeal wavering now restless and sleepless given to violent starts and slow spells of apathy she was wearing to defeat  that spring day one year from the day she had left new york for arizona she wished to spend alone but her thoughts grew unbearable she summed up the endless year could she live another like it something must break within her  she went out the air was warm and balmy carrying that subtle current which caused the mild madness of spring fever in the park the greening of the grass the opening of buds the singing of birds the gladness of children the light on the water the warm sunall seemed to reproach her carley fled from the park to the home of beatrice lovell and there unhappily she encountered those of her acquaintance with whom she had least patience they forced her to think too keenly of herself they appeared carefree while she was miserable  over teacups there were waging gossip and argument and criticism when carley entered with beatrice there was a sudden hush and then a murmur  hello carley now say it to our faces called out geralda conners a fair handsome young woman of thirty exquisitely gowned in the latest mode and whose brilliantly tinted complexion was not the natural one of health  say what geralda asked carley i certainly would not say anything behind your backs that i wouldnt repeat here  eleanor has been telling us how you simply burned us up  we did have an argument and im not sure i said all i wanted to  say the rest here drawled a lazy mellow voice for heavens sake stir us up if i could get a kick out of anything id bless it  carley go on the stage advised another youve got elsie ferguson tied to the mast for looks and lately youre surely tragic enough  i wish youd go somewhere far off observed a third my husband is dippy about you  girls do you know that you actually have not one sensible idea in your heads retorted carley  sensible i should hope not who wants to be sensible  geralda battered her teacup on a saucer listen she called i wasnt kidding carley i am good and sore she goes around knocking everybody and saying new york backs sodom off the boards i want her to come out with it right here  i dare say ive talked too much returned carley its been a rather hard winter on me perhaps indeed ive tried the patience of my friends  see here carley said geralda deliberately just because youve had life turn to bitter ashes in your mouth youve no right to poison it for us we all find it pretty sweet youre an unsatisfied woman and if you dont marry somebody youll end by being a reformer or fanatic  id rather end that way than rot in a shell retorted carley  i declare you make me see red carley flashed geralda angrily no wonder morrison roasts you to everybody he says glenn kilbourne threw you down for some western girl if thats true its pretty small of you to vent your spleen on us  carley felt the gathering of a mighty resistless force but geralda conners was nothing to her except the target for a thunderbolt  i have no spleen she replied with a dignity of passion i have only pity i was as blind as you if heartbreak tore the scales from my eyes perhaps that is well for me for i see something terribly wrong in myself in you in all of us in the life of today  you keep your pity to yourself you need it answered geralda with heat theres nothing wrong with me or my friends or life in good old new york  nothing wrong cried carley listen nothing wrong in you or life todaynothing for you women to make right you are blind as batsas dead to living truth as if you were buried nothing wrong when thousands of crippled soldiers have no homesno moneyno friendsno workin many cases no food or bed splendid young men who went away in their prime to fight for you and came back ruined suffering nothing wrong when sane women with the vote might rid politics of partisanship greed crookedness nothing wrong when prohibition is mocked by womenwhen the greatest boon ever granted this country is derided and beaten down and cheated nothing wrong when there are half a million defective children in this city nothing wrong when there are not enough schools and teachers to educate our boys and girls when those teachers are shamefully underpaid nothing wrong when the mothers of this great country let their youngsters go to the dark motion picture halls and night after night in thousands of towns over all this broad land see pictures that the juvenile court and the educators and keepers of reform schools say make burglars crooks and murderers of our boys and vampires of our girls nothing wrong when these young adolescent girls ape you and wear stockings rolled under their knees below their skirts and use a lip stick and paint their faces and darken their eyes and pluck their eyebrows and absolutely do not know what shame is nothing wrong when you may find in any city women standing at street corners distributing booklets on birth control nothing wrong when great magazines print no page or picture without its sex appeal nothing wrong when the automobile so convenient for the innocent little run out of town presents the greatest evil that ever menaced american girls nothing wrong when money is godwhen luxury pleasure excitement speed are the striven for nothing wrong when some of your husbands spend more of their time with other women than with you nothing wrong with jazzwhere the lights go out in the dance hall and the dancers jiggle and toddle and wiggle in a frenzy nothing wrong in a country where the greatest college cannot report birth of one child to each graduate in ten years nothing wrong with race suicide and the incoming horde of foreigners nothing wrong with you women who cannot or will not stand childbirth nothing wrong with most of you when if you did have a child you could not nurse it oh my god theres nothing wrong with america except that she staggers under a titanic burden that only mothers of sons can remove you doll women you parasites you toys of men you silkenwrapped geisha girls you painted idle purring cats you parody of the females of your speciesfind brains enough if you can to see the doom hanging over you and revolt before it is too late    chapter xi  carley burst in upon her aunt  look at me aunt mary she cried radiant and exultant im going back out west to marry glenn and live his life  the keen old eyes of her aunt softened and dimmed dear carley ive known that for a long time youve found yourself at last  then carley breathlessly babbled her hastily formed plans every word of which seemed to rush her onward  youre going to surprise glenn again queried aunt mary  oh i must i want to see his face when i tell him  well i hope he wont surprise you declared the old lady when did you hear from him last  in january it seems agesbutaunt mary you dont imagine glenn  i imagine nothing interposed her aunt it will turn out happily and ill have some peace in my old age but carley whats to become of me  oh i never thought replied carley blankly it will be lonely for you auntie ill come back in the fall for a few weeks glenn will let me  let you ye gods so youve come to that imperious carley burch thank heaven youll now be satisfied to be let do things  idid crawl for him breathed carley  well child as you cant be practical ill have to be replied aunt mary seriously fortunately for you i am a woman of quick decision listen ill go west with you i want to see the grand canyon then ill go on to california where i have old friends ive not seen for years when you get your new home all fixed up ill spend awhile with you and if i want to come back to new york now and then ill go to a hotel it is settled i think the change will benefit me  auntie you make me very happy i could ask no more said carley   swiftly as endless tasks could make them the days passed but those on the train dragged interminably  carley sent her aunt through to the canyon while she stopped off at flagstaff to store innumerable trunks and bags the first news she heard of glenn and the hutters was that they had gone to the tonto basin to buy hogs and would be absent at least a month this gave birth to a new plan in carleys mind she would doubly surprise glenn wherefore she took council with some flagstaff business men and engaged them to set a force of men at work on the deep lake property making the improvements she desired and hauling lumber cement bricks machinery suppliesall the necessaries for building construction also she instructed them to throw up a tent house for her to live in during the work and to engage a reliable mexican man with his wife for servants when she left for the canyon she was happier than ever before in her life  it was near the coming of sunset when carley first looked down into the grand canyon she had forgotten glenns tribute to this place in her rapturous excitement of preparation and travel the canyon had been merely a name but now she saw it and she was stunned  what a stupendous chasm gorgeous in sunset color on the heights purpling into mystic shadows in the depths there was a wonderful brightness of all the millions of red and yellow and gray surfaces still exposed to the sun carley did not feel a thrill because feeling seemed inhibited she looked and looked yet was reluctant to keep on looking she possessed no image in mind with which to compare this grand and mystic spectacle a transformation of color and shade appeared to be going on swiftly as if gods were changing the scenes of a titanic stage as she gazed the dark fringed line of the north rim turned to burnished gold and she watched that with fascinated eyes it turned rose it lost its fire it faded to quiet cold gray the sun had set  then the wind blew cool through the pinyons on the rim there was a sweet tang of cedar and sage on the air and that indefinable fragrance peculiar to the canyon country of arizona how it brought back to carley remembrance of oak creek in the west across the purple notches of the abyss a dull gold flare showed where the sun had gone down  in the morning at eight oclock there were great irregular black shadows under the domes and peaks and escarpments bright angel canyon was all dark showing dimly its ragged lines at noon there were no shadows and all the colossal gorge lay glaring under the sun in the evening carley watched the canyon as again the sun was setting  deep darkblue shadows like purple sails of immense ships in wonderful contrast with the bright sunlit slopes grew and rose toward the east down the canyons and up the walls that faced the west for a long while there was no red color and the first indication of it was a dull bronze carley looked down into the void at the sailing birds at the precipitous slopes and the dwarf spruces and the weathered old yellow cliffs when she looked up again the shadows out there were no longer dark they were clear the slopes and depths and ribs of rock could be seen through them then the tips of the highest peaks and domes turned bright red far to the east she discerned a strange shadow slowly turning purple one instant it grew vivid then began to fade soon after that all the colors darkened and slowly the pale gray stole over all  at night carley gazed over and into the black void but for the awful sense of depth she would not have known the canyon to be there a soundless movement of wind passed under her the chasm seemed a grave of silence it was as mysterious as the stars and as aloof and as inevitable it had held her senses of beauty and proportion in abeyance  at another sunrise the crown of the rim a broad belt of bare rock turned pale gold under its fringed dark line of pines the tips of the peak gleamed opal there was no sunrise red no fire the light in the east was a pale gold under a steely greenblue sky all the abyss of the canyon was soft gray transparent and the belt of gold broadened downward making shadows on the west slopes of the mesas and escarpments far down in the shadows she discerned the river yellow turgid palely gleaming by straining her ears carley heard a low dull roar as of distant storm she stood fearfully at the extreme edge of a stupendous cliff where it sheered dark and forbidding down and down into what seemed red and boundless depths of hades she saw gold spots of sunlight on the dark shadows proving that somewhere impossible to discover the sun was shining through windworn holes in the sharp ridges every instant carley grasped a different effect her studied gaze absorbed an endless changing and at last she realized that sun and light and stars and moon and night and shade all working incessantly and mutably over shapes and lines and angles and surfaces too numerous and too great for the sight of man to hold made an everchanging spectacle of supreme beauty and colorful grandeur  she talked very little while at the canyon it silenced her she had come to see it at the critical time of her life and in the right mood the superficialities of the world shrunk to their proper insignificance once she asked her aunt why did not glenn bring me here as if this canyon proved the nature of all things  but in the end carley found that the rending strife of the transformation of her attitude toward life had insensibly ceased it had ceased during the long watching of this cataclysm of nature this canyon of goldbanded blackfringed ramparts and redwalled mountains which sloped down to be lost in purple depths that was final proof of the strength of nature to soothe to clarify to stabilize the tried and weary and upwardgazing soul stronger than the recorded deeds of saints stronger than the eloquence of the gifted uplifters of men stronger than any words ever written was the grand brooding sculptured aspect of nature and it must have been so because thousands of years before the age of saints or preachersbefore the fret and symbol and figure were cut in stoneman must have watched with thoughtdeveloping sight the wonders of the earth the monuments of time the glooming of the darkblue sea the handiwork of god   in may carley returned to flagstaff to take up with earnest inspiration the labors of homebuilding in a primitive land  it required two trucks to transport her baggage and purchases out to deep lake the road was good for eighteen miles of the distance until it branched off to reach her land and from there it was desert rock and sand but eventually they made it and carley found herself and belongings dumped out into the windy and sunny open the moment was singularly thrilling and full of transport she was free she had shaken off the shackles she faced lonely wild barren desert that must be made habitable by the genius of her direction and the labor of her hands always a thought of glenn hovered tenderly dreamily in the back of her consciousness but she welcomed the opportunity to have a few weeks of work and activity and solitude before taking up her life with him she wanted to adapt herself to the metamorphosis that had been wrought in her  to her amazement and delight a very considerable progress had been made with her plans under a sheltered red cliff among the cedars had been erected the tents where she expected to live until the house was completed these tents were large with broad floors high off the ground and there were four of them her living tent had a porch under a wide canvas awning the bed was a boxlike affair raised off the floor two feet and it contained a great fragrant mass of cedar boughs upon which the blankets were to be spread at one end was a dresser with large mirror and a chiffonier there were table and lamp a low rocking chair a shelf for books a row of hooks upon which to hang things a washstand with its necessary accessories a little stove and a neat stack of cedar chips and sticks navajo rugs on the floor lent brightness and comfort  carley heard the rustling of cedar branches over her head and saw where they brushed against the tent roof it appeared warm and fragrant inside and protected from the wind and a subdued white light filtered through the canvas almost she felt like reproving herself for the comfort surrounding her for she had come west to welcome the hard knocks of primitive life  it took less than an hour to have her trunks stored in one of the spare tents and to unpack clothes and necessaries for immediate use carley donned the comfortable and somewhat shabby outdoor garb she had worn at oak creek the year before and it seemed to be the last thing needed to make her fully realize the glorious truth of the present  im here she said to her pale yet happy face in the mirror the impossible has happened i have accepted glenns life i have answered that strange call out of the west  she wanted to throw herself on the sunlit woolly blankets of her bed and hug them to think and think of the bewildering present happiness to dream of the future but she could not lie or sit still nor keep her mind from grasping at actualities and possibilities of this place nor her hands from itching to do things  it developed presently that she could not have idled away the time even if she had wanted to for the mexican woman came for her with smiling gesticulation and jabber that manifestly meant dinner carley could not understand many mexican words and herein she saw another task this swarthy woman and her sloeeyed husband favorably impressed carley  next to claim her was hoyle the superintendent miss burch he said in the early days we could run up a log cabin in a jiffy axes horses strong arms and a few pegsthat was all we needed but this house youve planned is different its good youve come to take the responsibility  carley had chosen the site for her home on top of the knoll where glenn had taken her to show her the magnificent view of mountains and desert carley climbed it now with beating heart and mingled emotions a thousand times already that day it seemed she had turned to gaze up at the noble whiteclad peaks they were closer now apparently looming over her and she felt a great sense of peace and protection in the thought that they would always be there but she had not yet seen the desert that had haunted her for a year when she reached the summit of the knoll and gazed out across the open space it seemed that she must stand spellbound how green the cedared foregroundhow gray and barren the downward slopehow wonderful the painted steppes the vision that had lived in her memory shrank to nothingness the reality was immense more than beautiful appalling in its isolation beyond comprehension with its lure and strength to uplift  but the superintendent drew her attention to the business at hand  carley had planned an lshaped house of one story some of her ideas appeared to be impractical and these she abandoned the framework was up and half a dozen carpenters were lustily at work with saw and hammer  wed made better progress if this house was in an ordinary place explained hoyle but you see the wind blows here so the framework had to be made as solid and strong as possible in fact its bolted to the sills  both living room and sleeping room were arranged so that the painted desert could be seen from one window and on the other side the whole of the san francisco mountains both rooms were to have open fireplaces carleys idea was for service and durability she thought of comfort in the severe winters of that high latitude but elegance and luxury had no more significance in her life  hoyle made his suggestions as to changes and adaptations and receiving her approval he went on to show her what had been already accomplished back on higher ground a reservoir of concrete was being constructed near an everflowing spring of snow water from the peaks this water was being piped by gravity to the house and was a matter of greatest satisfaction to hoyle for he claimed that it would never freeze in winter and would be cold and abundant during the hottest and driest of summers this assurance solved the most difficult and serious problem of ranch life in the desert  next hoyle led carley down off the knoll to the wide cedar valley adjacent to the lake he was enthusiastic over its possibilities two small corrals and a large one had been erected the latter having a low flat barn connected with it ground was already being cleared along the lake where alfalfa and hay were to be raised carley saw the blue and yellow smoke from burning brush and the fragrant odor thrilled her mexicans were chopping the cleared cedars into firewood for winter use  the day was spent before she realized it at sunset the carpenters and mechanics left in two old ford cars for town the mexicans had a camp in the cedars and the hoyles had theirs at the spring under the knoll where carley had camped with glenn and the hutters carley watched the golden rosy sunset and as the day ended she breathed deeply as if in unutterable relief supper found her with appetite she had long since lost twilight brought cold wind the staccato bark of coyotes the flicker of camp fires through the cedars she tried to embrace all her sensations but they were so rapid and many that she failed  the cold clear silent night brought back the charm of the desert how flaming white the stars the great spirepointed peaks lifted cold palegray outlines up into the deep starstudded sky carley walked a little to and fro loath to go to her tent though tired she wanted calm but instead of achieving calmness she grew more and more towards a strange state of exultation  westward only a matter of twenty or thirty miles lay the deep rent in the level desertoak creek canyon if glenn had been there this night would have been perfect yet almost unendurable she was again grateful for his absence what a surprise she had in store for him and she imagined his face in its change of expression when she met him if only he never learned of her presence in arizona until she made it known in person that she most longed for chances were against it but then her luck had changed she looked to the eastward where a pale luminosity of afterglow shone in the heavens far distant seemed the home of her childhood the friends she had scorned and forsaken the city of complaining and striving millions if only some miracle might illumine the minds of her friends as she felt that hers was to be illumined here in the solitude but she well realized that not all problems could be solved by a call out of the west any open and lonely land that might have saved glenn kilbourne would have sufficed for her it was the spirit of the thing and not the letter it was work of any kind and not only that of ranch life not only the raising of hogs  carley directed stumbling steps toward the light of her tent her eyes had not been used to such black shadow along the ground she had too squeamish feminine fears of hydrophobia skunks and nameless animals or reptiles that were imagined denizens of the darkness she gained her tent and entered the mexican gino as he called himself had lighted her lamp and fire carley was chilled through and the tent felt so warm and cozy that she could scarcely believe it she fastened the screen door laced the flaps across it except at the top and then gave herself up to the lulling and comforting heat  there were plans to perfect innumerable things to remember a car and accessories horses saddles outfits to buy carley knew she should sit down at her table and write and figure but she could not do it then  for a long time she sat over the little stove toasting her knees and hands adding some chips now and then to the red coals and her mind seemed a kaleidoscope of changing visions thoughts feelings at last she undressed and blew out the lamp and went to bed  instantly a thick blackness seemed to enfold her and silence as of a dead world settled down upon her drowsy as she was she could not close her eyes nor refrain from listening darkness and silence were tangible things she felt them and they seemed suddenly potent with magic charm to still the tumult of her to soothe and rest to create thoughts she had never thought before rest was more than selfish indulgence loneliness was necessary to gain consciousness of the soul already far back in the past seemed carleys other life  by and by the dead stillness awoke to faint sounds not before perceptible to hera low mournful sough of the wind in the cedars then the faint fardistant note of a coyote sad as the night and infinitely wild   days passed carley worked in the mornings with her hands and her brains in the afternoons she rode and walked and climbed with a double object to work herself into fit physical condition and to explore every nook and corner of her six hundred and forty acres  then what she had expected and deliberately induced by her efforts quickly came to pass just as the year before she had suffered excruciating pain from aching muscles and saddle blisters and walking blisters and a very rending of her bones so now she fell victim to them again in sunshine and rain she faced the desert sunburn and sting of sleet were equally to be endured and that abomination the hateful blinding sandstorm did not daunt her but the weary hours of abnegation to this physical torture at least held one consoling recompense as compared with her experience of last year and it was that there was no one interested to watch for her weaknesses and failures and blunders she could fight it out alone  three weeks of this selfimposed strenuous training wore by before carley was free enough from weariness and pain to experience other sensations her general health evidently had not been so good as when she had first visited arizona she caught cold and suffered other ills attendant upon an abrupt change of climate and condition but doggedly she kept at her task she rode when she should have been in bed she walked when she should have ridden she climbed when she should have kept to level ground and finally by degrees so gradual as not to be noticed except in the sum of them she began to mend  meanwhile the construction of her house went on with uninterrupted rapidity when the low slanting wideeaved roof was completed carley lost further concern about rainstorms let them come when the plumbing was all in and carley saw verification of hoyles assurance that it would mean a gravity supply of water ample and continual she lost her last concern as to the practicability of the work that and the earning of her endurance seemed to bring closer a wonderful reward still nameless and spiritual that had been unattainable but now breathed to her on the fragrant desert wind and in the brooding silence   the time came when each afternoons ride or climb called to carley with increasing delight but the fact that she must soon reveal to glenn her presence and transformation did not seem to be all the cause she could ride without pain walk without losing her breath work without blistering her hands and in this there was compensation the building of the house that was to become a home the development of water resources and land that meant the making of a ranchthese did not altogether constitute the anticipation of content to be active to accomplish things to recall to mind her knowledge of manual training of domestic science of designing and painting to learn to cookthese were indeed measures full of reward but they were not all in her wondering pondering meditation she arrived at the point where she tried to assign to her love the growing fullness of her life this too splendid and allpervading as it was she had to reject some exceedingly illusive and vital significance of life had insidiously come to carley  one afternoon with the sky full of white and black rolling clouds and a cold wind sweeping through the cedars she halted to rest and escape the chilling gale for a while in a sunny place under the lee of a gravel bank she sought refuge it was warm here because of the reflected sunlight and the absence of wind the sand at the bottom of the bank held a heat that felt good to her cold hands all about her and over her swept the keen wind rustling the sage seeping the sand swishing the cedars but she was out of it protected and insulated the sky above showed blue between the threatening clouds there were no birds or living creatures in sight certainly the place had little of color or beauty or grace nor could she see beyond a few rods lying there without any particular reason that she was conscious of she suddenly felt shot through and through with exhilaration  another day the warmest of the spring so far she rode a navajo mustang she had recently bought from a passing trader and at the farthest end of her section in rough wooded and ridged ground she had not explored she found a canyon with red walls and pine trees and gleaming streamlet and glades of grass and jumbles of rock it was a miniature canyon to be sure only a quarter of a mile long and as deep as the height of a lofty pine and so narrow that it seemed only the width of a lane but it had all the features of oak creek canyon and so sufficed for the exultant joy of possession she explored it the willow brakes and oak thickets harbored rabbits and birds she saw the white flags of deer running away down the open up at the head where the canyon boxed she flushed a flock of wild turkeys they ran like ostriches and flew like great brown chickens in a cavern carley found the den of a bear and in another place the bleached bones of a steer  she lingered here in the shaded depths with a feeling as if she were indeed lost to the world these big brown and seamybarked pines with their spreading gnarled arms and webs of green needles belonged to her as also the tiny brook the blue bells smiling out of the ferns the single stalk of mescal on a rocky ledge  never had sun and earth tree and rock seemed a part of her being until then she would become a sunworshiper and a lover of the earth that canyon had opened there to sky and light for millions of years and doubtless it had harbored sheep herders indians cliff dwellers barbarians she was a woman with white skin and a cultivated mind but the affinity for them existed in her she felt it and that an understanding of it would be good for body and soul  another day she found a little grove of jack pines growing on a flat mesalike bluff the highest point on her land the trees were small and close together mingling their green needles overhead and their discarded brown ones on the ground from here carley could see afar to all points of the compassthe slow green descent to the south and the climb to the blacktimbered distance the ridged and canyoned country to the west red vents choked with green and rimmed with gray to the north the grand upflung mountain kingdom crowned with snow and to the east the vastness of illimitable space the openness and wildness the chased and beaten mosaic of colored sands and rocks  again and again she visited this lookout and came to love its isolation its command of wondrous prospects its power of suggestion to her thoughts she became a creative being in harmony with the live things around her the great lifedispensing sun poured its rays down upon her as if to ripen her and the earth seemed warm motherly immense with its allembracing arms she no longer plucked the bluebells to press to her face but leaned to them every blade of gramma grass with its shining bronzetufted seed head had significance for her the scents of the desert began to have meaning for her she sensed within her the working of a great leveling process through which supreme happiness would come  june the rich thick amber light like a transparent reflection from some intense golden medium seemed to float in the warm air the sky became an azure blue in the still noontides when the bees hummed drowsily and the flies buzzed vast creamywhite columnar clouds rolled up from the horizon like colossal ships with bulging sails and summer with its rush of growing things was at hand  carley rode afar seeking in strange places the secret that eluded her only a few days now until she would ride down to oak creek canyon there was a low singing melody of wind in the cedars the earth became too beautiful in her magnified sight a great truth was dawning upon herthat the sacrifice of what she had held as necessary to the enjoyment of lifethat the strain of conflict the labor of hands the forcing of weary body the enduring of pain the contact with the earthhad served somehow to rejuvenate her blood quicken her pulse intensify her sensorial faculties thrill her very soul lead her into the realm of enchantment  one afternoon a dull leadblackcolored cinder knoll tempted her to explore its bare heights she rode up until her mustang sank to his knees and could climb no farther from there she essayed the ascent on foot it took labor but at last she gained the summit burning sweating panting  the cinder hill was an extinct crater of a volcano in the center of it lay a deep bowl wondrously symmetrical and of a dark lusterless hue not a blade of grass was there nor a plant carley conceived a desire to go to the bottom of this pit she tried the cinders of the edge of the slope they had the same consistency as those of the ascent she had overcome but here there was a steeper incline a tingling rush of daring seemed to drive her over the rounded rim and once started down it was as if she wore sevenleague boots fear left her only an exhilarating emotion consumed her if there were danger it mattered not she strode down with giant steps she plunged she started avalanches to ride them until they stopped she leaped and lastly she fell to roll over the soft cinders to the pit  there she lay it seemed a comfortable resting place the pit was scarcely six feet across she gazed upward and was astounded how steep was the rounded slope on all sides there were no sides it was a circle she looked up at a round lake of deep translucent sky such depth of blue such exquisite rare color carley imagined she could gaze through it to the infinite beyond  she closed her eyes and rested soon the laboring of heart and breath calmed to normal so that she could not hear them then she lay perfectly motionless with eyes shut she seemed still to look and what she saw was the sunlight through the blood and flesh of her eyelids it was red as rare a hue as the blue of sky so piercing did it grow that she had to shade her eyes with her arm  again the strange rapt glow suffused her body never in all her life had she been so absolutely alone she might as well have been in her grave she might have been dead to all earthy things and reveling in spirit in the glory of the physical that had escaped her in life and she abandoned herself to this influence  she loved these dry dusty cinders she loved the crater here hidden from all save birds she loved the desert the earthabove all the sun she was a product of the eartha creation of the sun she had been an infinitesimal atom of inert something that had quickened to life under the blazing magic of the sun soon her spirit would abandon her body and go on while her flesh and bone returned to dust this frame of hers that carried the divine spark belonged to the earth she had only been ignorant mindless feelingless absorbed in the seeking of gain blind to the truth she had to give she had been created a woman she belonged to nature she was nothing save a mother of the future she had loved neither glenn kilbourne nor life itself false education false standards false environment had developed her into a woman who imagined she must feed her body on the milk and honey of indulgence  she was abased nowwoman as animal though saved and uplifted by her power of immortality transcendental was her female power to link life with the future the power of the plant seed the power of the earth the heat of the sun the inscrutable creationspirit of nature almost the divinity of godthese were all hers because she was a woman that was the great secret aloof so long that was what had been wrong with lifethe woman blind to her meaning her power her mastery  so she abandoned herself to the woman within her she held out her arms to the blue abyss of heaven as if to embrace the universe she was nature she kissed the dusty cinders and pressed her breast against the warm slope her heart swelled to bursting with a glorious and unutterable happiness   that afternoon as the sun was setting under a goldwhite scroll of cloud carley got back to deep lake  a familiar lounging figure crossed her sight it approached to where she had dismounted charley the sheep herder of oak creek  howdy he drawled with his queer smile so it was youall who had this deep lake section  yes and how are you charley she replied shaking hands with him  me aw im tiptop im shore glad you got this ranch reckon ill hit you for a job  id give it to you but arent you working for the hutters  nope not any more me an stanton had a row with them  how droll and dry he was his lean olivebrown face with its guileless clear eyes and his lanky figure in blue jeans vividly recalled oak creek to carley  oh im sorry returned she haltingly somehow checked in her warm rush of thought stanton did he quit too  yep he sure did  what was the trouble  reckon because flo made up to kilbourne replied charley with a grin  ah ii see murmured carley a blankness seemed to wave over her it extended to the air without to the sense of the golden sunset it passed what should she askwhat out of a thousand sudden flashing queries areare the hutters back  sure been back several days i reckoned hoyle told you mebbe he didnt know though for nobodys been to town  how ishow are they all faltered carley there

eyes on carleys  husband she gasped  sure flos gone an went an done what i swore on  who whispered carley and the query was a terrible blade piercing her heart  now whod you reckon on asked charley with his slow grin  carleys lips were mute  wal it was your old beau thet you wouldnt have returned charley as he gathered up his long frame evidently to leave kilbourne he an flo came back from the tonto all hitched up    chapter xii  vague sense of movement of darkness and of cold attended carleys consciousness for what seemed endless time  a fall over rocks and a severe thrust from a sharp branch brought an acute appreciation of her position if not of her mental state night had fallen the stars were out she had stumbled over a low ledge evidently she had wandered around dazedly and aimlessly until brought to her senses by pain but for a gleam of campfires through the cedars she would have been lost it did not matter she was lost anyhow what was it that had happened  charley the sheep herder then the thunderbolt of his words burst upon her and she collapsed to the cold stones she lay quivering from head to toe she dug her fingers into the moss and lichen oh god to thinkafter allit happened she moaned there had been a rending within her breast as of physical violence from which she now suffered anguish there were a thousand stinging nerves there was a mortal sickness of horror of insupportable heartbreaking loss she could not endure it she could not live under it  she lay there until energy supplanted shock then she rose to rush into the darkest shadows of the cedars to grope here and there hanging her head wringing her hands beating her breast it cant be true she cried not after my strugglemy victorynot now but there had been no victory and now it was too late she was betrayed ruined lost that wonderful love had wrought transformation in herand now havoc once she fell against the branches of a thick cedar that upheld her the fragrance which had been sweet was now bitter life that had been bliss was now hateful she could not keep still for a single moment  black night cedars brush rocks washes seemed not to obstruct her in a frenzy she rushed on tearing her dress her hands her hair violence of some kind was imperative all at once a pale gleaming open space shimmering under the stars lay before her it was water deep lake and instantly a hideous terrible longing to destroy herself obsessed her she had no fear she could have welcomed the cold slimy depths that meant oblivion but could they really bring oblivion a year ago she would have believed so and would no longer have endured such agony she had changed a cursed strength had come to her and it was this strength that now augmented her torture she flung wide her arms to the pitiless white stars and looked up at them my hope my faith my love have failed me she whispered they have been a lie i went through hell for them and now ive nothing to live for oh let me end it all  if she prayed to the stars for mercy it was denied her passionlessly they blazed on but she could not kill herself in that hour death would have been the only relief and peace left to her stricken by the cruelty of her fate she fell back against the stones and gave up to grief nothing was left but fierce pain the youth and vitality and intensity of her then locked arms with anguish and torment and a cheated unsatisfied love strength of mind and body involuntarily resisted the ravages of this catastrophe will power seemed nothing but the flesh of her that medium of exquisite sensation so full of life so prone to joy refused to surrender the part of her that felt fought terribly for its heritage  all night long carley lay there the crescent moon went down the stars moved on their course the coyotes ceased to wail the wind died away the lapping of the waves along the lake shore wore to gentle splash the whispering of the insects stopped as the cold of dawn approached the darkest hour fellhour of silence solitude and melancholy when the desert lay tranced cold waiting mournful without light of moon or stars or sun  in the gray dawn carley dragged her bruised and aching body back to her tent and fastening the door she threw off wet clothes and boots and fell upon her bed slumber of exhaustion came to her  when she awoke the tent was light and the moving shadows of cedar boughs on the white canvas told that the sun was straight above carley ached as never before a deep pang seemed invested in every bone her heart felt swollen out of proportion to its space in her breast her breathing came slow and it hurt her blood was sluggish suddenly she shut her eyes she loathed the light of day what was it that had happened  then the brutal truth flashed over her again in aspect new with all the old bitterness for an instant she experienced a suffocating sensation as if the canvas had sagged under the burden of heavy air and was crushing her breast and heart then wave after wave of emotion swept over her the storm winds of grief and passion were loosened again and she writhed in her misery  some one knocked on her door the mexican woman called anxiously carley awoke to the fact that her presence was not solitary on the physical earth even if her soul seemed stricken to eternal loneliness even in the desert there was a world to consider vanity that had bled to death pride that had been crushed availed her not here but something else came to her support the lesson of the west had been to endure not to shirkto face an issue not to hide carley got up bathed dressed brushed and arranged her dishevelled hair the face she saw in the mirror excited her amaze and pity then she went out in answer to the call for dinner but she could not eat the ordinary functions of life appeared to be deadened  the day happened to be sunday and therefore the workmen were absent carley had the place to herself how the halfcompleted house mocked her she could not bear to look at it what use could she make of it now flo hutter had become the working comrade of glenn kilbourne the mistress of his cabin she was his wife and she would be the mother of his children  that thought gave birth to the darkest hour of carley burchs life she became possessed as by a thousand devils she became merely a female robbed of her mate reason was not in her nor charity nor justice all that was abnormal in human nature seemed coalesced in her dominant passionate savage terrible she hated with an incredible and insane ferocity in the seclusion of her tent crouched on her bed silent locked motionless she yet was the embodiment of all terrible strife and storm in nature her heart was a maelstrom and would have whirled and sucked down to hell all the beings that were men her soul was a bottomless gulf filled with the gales and the fires of jealousy superhuman to destroy  that fury consumed all her remaining strength and from the relapse she sank to sleep  morning brought the inevitable reaction however long her other struggles this monumental and final one would be brief she realized that yet was unable to understand how it could be possible unless shock or death or mental aberration ended the fight an eternity of emotion lay back between this awakening of intelligence and the hour of her fall into the clutches of primitive passion  that morning she faced herself in the mirror and asked nowwhat do i owe you it was not her voice that answered it was beyond her but it said go on you are cut adrift you are alone you owe none but yourself go on not backwardnot to the depthsbut upupward  she shuddered at such a decree how impossible for her all animal all woman all emotion how could she live on the cold pure heights yet she owed something intangible and inscrutable to herself was it the thing that woman lacked physically yet contained hidden in her soul an element of eternal spirit to rise because of heartbreak and ruin and irreparable loss must she fall was loss of love and husband and children only a test the present hour would be swallowed in the sum of lifes trials she could not go back she would not go down there was wrenched from her tried and sore heart an unalterable and unquenchable decisionto make her own soul prove the evolution of woman vessel of blood and flesh she might be doomed by nature to the reproduction of her kind but she had in her the supreme spirit and power to carry on the progress of the agesthe climb of woman out of the darkness  carley went out to the workmen the house should be completed and she would live in it always there was the stretching and illimitable desert to look at and the grand heave upward of the mountains hoyle was full of zest for the practical details of the building he saw nothing of the havoc wrought in her nor did the other workmen glance more than casually at her in this carley lost something of a shirking fear that her loss and grief were patent to all eyes  that afternoon she mounted the most spirited of the mustangs she had purchased from the indians to govern him and stick on him required all her energy and she rode him hard and far out across the desert across mile after mile of cedar forest clear to the foothills she rested there absorbed in gazing desertward and upon turning back again she ran him over the level stretches wind and branch threshed her seemingly to ribbons violence seemed good for her a fall had no fear for her now she reached camp at dusk hot as fire breathless and strengthless but she had earned something such action required constant use of muscle and mind if need be she could drive both to the very furthermost limit she could ride and rideuntil the future like the immensity of the desert there might swallow her she changed her clothes and rested a while the call to supper found her hungry in this fact she discovered mockery of her grief love was not the food of life exhausted natures need of rest and sleep was no respecter of a womans emotion  next day carley rode northward wildly and fearlessly as if this conscious activity was the initiative of an endless number of rides that were to save her as before the foothills called her and she went on until she came to a very high one  carley dismounted from her panting horse answering the familiar impulse to attain heights by her own effort  am i only a weakling she asked herself only a creature mined by the fever of the soul thrown from one emotion to another never the same yearning suffering sacrificing hoping and changingforever the same what is it that drives me a great city with all its attractions has failed to help me realize my life so have friends failed so has the world what can solitude and grandeur do all this obsession of mineall this strange feeling for simple elemental earthly things likewise will fail me yet i am driven they would call me a mad woman  it took carley a full hour of slow bodybending labor to climb to the summit of that hill high steep and rugged it resisted ascension but at last she surmounted it and sat alone on the heights with naked eyes and an unconscious prayer on her lips  what was it that had happened could there be here a different answer from that which always mocked her  she had been a girl not accountable for loss of mother for choice of home and education she had belonged to a class she had grown to womanhood in it she had loved and in loving had escaped the evil of her day if not its taint she had lived only for herself conscience had awakenedbut alas too late she had overthrown the sordid selfseeking habit of life she had awakened to real womanhood she had fought the insidious spell of modernity and she had defeated it she had learned the thrill of taking root in new soil the pain and joy of labor the bliss of solitude the promise of home and love and motherhood but she had gathered all these marvelous things to her soul too late for happiness  now it is answered she declared aloud that is what has happened and all that is past is there anything left if so what  she flung her query out to the winds of the desert but the desert seemed too gray too vast too remote too aloof too measureless it was not concerned with her little life then she turned to the mountain kingdom  it seemed overpoweringly near at hand it loomed above her to pierce the fleecy clouds it was only a stupendous upheaval of earthcrust grown over at the base by leagues and leagues of pine forest belted along the middle by vast slanting zigzag slopes of aspen rent and riven toward the heights into canyon and gorge bared above to cliffs and corners of craggy rock whitened at the skypiercing peaks by snow its beauty and sublimity were lost upon carley now she was concerned with its travail its age its endurance its strength and she studied it with magnified sight  what incomprehensible subterranean force had swelled those immense slopes and lifted the huge bulk aloft to the clouds cataclysm of naturethe expanding or shrinking of the earthvast volcanic action under the surface whatever it had been it had left its expression of the travail of the universe this mountain mass had been hot gas when flung from the parent sun and now it was solid granite what had it endured in the making what indeed had been its dimensions before the millions of years of its struggle  eruption earthquake avalanche the attrition of glacier the erosion of water the cracking of frost the weathering of rain and wind and snowthese it had eternally fought and resisted in vain yet still it stood magnificent frowning battlescarred and undefeated its skypiercing peaks were as cries for mercy to the infinite this old mountain realized its doom it had to go perhaps to make room for a newer and better kingdom but it endured because of the spirit of nature the great notched circular line of rock below and between the peaks in the body of the mountains showed where in ages past the heart of living granite had blown out to let loose on all the near surrounding desert the streams of black lava and the hills of black cinders despite its fringe of green it was hoary with age every looming grayfaced wall massive and sublime seemed a monument of its mastery over time every deepcut canyon showing the skeleton ribs the caverns and caves its avalanchecarved slides its long fanshaped spreading taluses carried conviction to the spectator that it was but a frail bit of rock that its life was little and brief that upon it had been laid the merciless curse of nature change change must unknit the very knots of the center of the earth so its strength lay in the sublimity of its defiance it meant to endure to the last rolling grain of sand it was a dead mountain of rock without spirit yet it taught a grand lesson to the seeing eye  life was only a part perhaps an infinitely small part of natures plan death and decay were just as important to her inscrutable design the universe had not been created for life ease pleasure and happiness of a man creature developed from lower organisms if natures secret was the developing of a spirit through all time carley divined that she had it within her so the present meant little  i have no right to be unhappy concluded carley i had no right to glenn kilbourne i failed him in that i failed myself neither life nor nature failed menor love it is no longer a mystery unhappiness is only a change happiness itself is only change so what does it matter the great thing is to see lifeto understandto feelto workto fightto endure it is not my fault i am here but it is my fault if i leave this strange old earth the poorer for my failure i will no longer be little i will find strength i will endure i still have eyes ears nose taste i can feel the sun the wind the nip of frost must i slink like a craven because ive lost the love of one man must i hate flo hutter because she will make glenn happy never all of this seems better so because through it i am changed i might have lived on a selfish clod  carley turned from the mountain kingdom and faced her future with the profound and sad and farseeing look that had come with her lesson she knew what to give sometime and somewhere there would be recompense she would hide her wound in the faith that time would heal it and the ordeal she set herself to prove her sincerity and strength was to ride down to oak creek canyon  carley did not wait many days strange how the old vanity held her back until something of the havoc in her face should be gone  one morning she set out early riding her best horse and she took a sheep trail across country the distance by road was much farther the june morning was cool sparkling fragrant mocking birds sang from the topmost twig of cedars doves cooed in the pines sparrow hawks sailed low over the open grassy patches desert primroses showed their rounded pink clusters in sunny places and here and there burned the carmine of indian paintbrush jack rabbits and cottontails bounded and scampered away through the sage the desert had life and color and movement this june day and as always there was the dry fragrance on the air  her mustang had been inured to long and consistent travel over the desert her weight was nothing to him and he kept to the swinging lope for miles as she approached oak creek canyon however she drew him to a trot and then a walk sight of the deep redwalled and greenfloored canyon was a shock to her  the trail came out on the road that led to ryans sheep camp at a point several miles west of the cabin where carley had encountered haze ruff she remembered the curves and stretches and especially the steep jumpoff where the road led down off the rim into the canyon here she dismounted and walked from the foot of this descent she knew every rod of the way would be familiar to her and womanlike she wanted to turn away and fly from them but she kept on and mounted again at level ground  the murmur of the creek suddenly assailed her earssweet sad memorable strangely powerful to hurt yet the sound seemed of long ago down here summer had advanced rich thick foliage overspread the winding road of sand then out of the shade she passed into the sunnier regions of isolated pines along here she had raced calico with glenns bay and here she had caught him and there was the place she had fallen she halted a moment under the pine tree where glenn had held her in his arms tears dimmed her eyes if only she had known then the truth the reality but regrets were useless  by and by a craggy red wall loomed above the trees and its pipeorgan conformation was familiar to carley she left the road and turned to go down to the creek sycamores and maples and great bowlders and mossy ledges overhanging the water and a huge sentinel pine marked the spot where she and glenn had eaten their lunch that last day her mustang splashed into the clear water and halted to drink beyond through the trees carley saw the sunny redearthed clearing that was glenns farm she looked and fought herself and bit her quivering lip until she tasted blood then she rode out into the open  the whole west side of the canyon had been cleared and cultivated and plowed but she gazed no farther she did not want to see the spot where she had given glenn his ring and had parted from him she rode on if she could pass west fork she believed her courage would rise to the completion of this ordeal places were what she feared places that she had loved while blindly believing she hated there the narrow gap of green and blue split the looming red wall she was looking into west fork up there stood the cabin how fierce a pang rent her breast she faltered at the crossing of the branch stream and almost surrendered the water murmured the leaves rustled the bees hummed the birds sangall with some sad sweetness that seemed of the past  then the trail leading up west fork was like a barrier she saw horse tracks in it next she descried boot tracks the shape of which was so wellremembered that it shook her heart there were fresh tracks in the sand pointing in the direction of the lodge ah that was where glenn lived now carley strained at her will to keep it fighting her memory the glory and the dream were gone  a touch of spur urged her mustang into a gallop the splashing ford of the creekthe still eddying pool beyondthe green orchardsthe white lacy waterfalland lolomi lodge  nothing had altered but carley seemed returning after many years slowly she dismountedslowly she climbed the porch steps was there no one at home yet the vacant doorway the silencesomething attested to the knowledge of carleys presence then suddenly mrs hutter fluttered out with flo behind her  you dear girlim so glad cried mrs hutter her voice trembling  im glad to see you too said carley bending to receive mrs hutters embrace carley saw dim eyesthe stress of agitation but no surprise  oh carley burst out the western girl with voice rich and full yet tremulous  flo ive come to wish you happiness replied carley very low  was it the same flo this seemed more of a womanstrange nowwhite and strainedbeautiful eager questioning a cry of gladness burst from her carley felt herself enveloped in strong close claspand then a warm quick kiss of joy it shocked her yet somehow thrilled sure was the welcome here sure was the strained situation also but the voice rang too glad a note for carley it touched her deeply yet she could not understand she had not measured the depth of western friendship  have youseen glenn queried flo breathlessly  oh no indeed not replied carley slowly gaining composure the nervous agitation of these women had stilled her own i just rode up the trail where is he  he was herea moment ago panted flo oh carley we sure are locoed  why we only heard an hour agothat you were at deep lake charley rode in he told us i thought my heart would break poor glenn when he heard it but never mind me jump your horse and run to west fork  the spirit of her was like the strength of her arms as she hurried carley across the porch and shoved her down the steps  climb on and run carley cried flo if you only knew how glad hell be that you came  carley leaped into the saddle and wheeled the mustang but she had no answer for the girls singular almost wild exultance then like a shot the spirited mustang was off down the lane carley wondered with swelling heart was her coming such a wondrous surpriseso unexpected and big in generositysomething that would make kilbourne as glad as it had seemed to make flo carley thrilled to this assurance  down the lane she flew the red walls blurred and the sweet wind whipped her face at the trail she swerved the mustang but did not check his gait under the great pines he sped and round the bulging wall at the rocky incline leading to the creek she pulled the fiery animal to a trot how low and clear the water as carley forded it fresh cool drops splashed into her face again she spurred her mount and again trees and walls rushed by up and down the yellow bits of trailon over the brown mats of pine needlesuntil there in the sunlight shone the little gray log cabin with a tall form standing in the door one instant the canyon tilted on end for carley and she was riding into the blue sky then some magic of soul sustained her so that she saw clearly reaching the cabin she reined in her mustang  hello glenn look whos here she cried not wholly failing of gayety  he threw up his sombrero  whoopee he yelled in stentorian voice that rolled across the canyon and bellowed in hollow echo and then clapped from wall to wall the unexpected western yell so strange from glenn disconcerted carley had he only answered her spirit of greeting had hers rung false  but he was coming to her she had seen the bronze of his face turn to white how gaunt and worn he looked older he appeared with deeper lines and whiter hair his jaw quivered  carley burch so it was you he queried hoarsely  glenn i reckon it was she replied i bought your deep lake ranch site i came back too late but it is never too late for some things ive come to wish you and flo all the happiness in the worldand to say we must be friends  the way he looked at her made her tremble he strode up beside the mustang and he was so tall that his shoulder came abreast of her he placed a big warm hand on hers as it rested ungloved on the pommel of the saddle  have you seen flo he asked  i just left her it was funnythe way she rushed me off after you as if there werent two  was it glenns eyes or the movement of his hand that checked her utterance his gaze pierced her soul his hand slid along her arm to her waistaround it her heart seemed to burst  kick your feet out of the stirrups he ordered  instinctively she obeyed then with a strong pull he hauled her half out of the saddle pellmell into his arms carley had no resistance she sank limp in an agony of amaze was this a dream swift and hard his lips met hersand againand again  oh my godglenn areyoumad she whispered almost swooning  surei reckon i am he replied huskily and pulled her all the way out of the saddle  carley would have fallen but for his support she could not think she was all instinct only the amazethe sudden horrordriftedfaded as before fires of her heart  kiss me he commanded  she would have kissed him if death were the penalty how his face blurred in her dimmed sight was that a strange smile then he held her back from him  carleyyou came to wish flo and me happiness he asked  oh yesyes pity me glennlet me go i meant well i shouldnever have come  do you love me he went on with passionate shaking clasp  god help mei doi do and now it will kill me  what did that damned fool charley tell you  the strange content of his query the trenchant force of it brought her upright with sight suddenly cleared was this giant the tragic glenn who had strode to her from the cabin door  charley told meyou and flowere married she whispered  you didnt believe him returned glenn  she could no longer speak she could only see her lover as if transfigured limned dark against the looming red wall  that was one of charleys queer jokes i told you to beware of him flo is married yesand very happy im unutterably happy toobut im not married lee stanton was the lucky bridegroom carley the moment i saw you i knew you had come back to me
