4601604	the english comédie humaine                              second series                                 vivian grey                                      by                         the earl of beaconsfield       publishers note  as a novelist benjamin disraeli belongs to the early part of the nineteenth century vivian grey 182627 and sybil 1845 mark the beginning and the end of his truly creative period for the two productions of his latest years lothair 1870 and endymion 1880 add nothing to the characteristics of his earlier volumes except the changes of feeling and power which accompany old age his period thus is that of bulwer dickens and thackeray and of the later years of sir walter scotta fact which his prominence as a statesman during the last decade of his life as well as the vogue of lothair and endymion has tended to obscure his style his material and his views of english character and life all date from that earlier time he was born in 1804 and died in 1881  disraeli was barely twentyone when he published vivian grey his first work of fiction and the young author was at once hailed as a master of his art by an almost unanimous press  in this as in his subsequent books it was not so much disraelis notable skill as a novelist but rather his portrayal of the social and political life of the day that made him one of the most popular writers of his generation and earned for him a lasting fame as a man of letters in vivian grey is narrated the career of an ambitious young man of rank and in this story the brilliant author has preserved to us the exact tone of the english drawingroom as he so well knew it sketching with sure and rapid strokes a whole portrait gallery of notables disguised in name may be but living characters nevertheless who charm us with their graceful manners and general air of being people of consequence vivian grey then though not a great novel is beyond question a marvelously true picture of the life and character of an interesting period of english history and made notable because of disraelis fine imagination and vivid descriptive powers     list of illustrations   is there anything you want sir  he distinctly beheld mrs felix lorraine open a small silver box  it was very slowly that the dark thought came over his mind     vivian grey   book i   chapter i   we are not aware that the infancy of vivian grey was distinguished by any extraordinary incident the solicitude of the most affectionate of mothers and the care of the most attentive of nurses did their best to injure an excellent constitution but vivian was an only child and these exertions were therefore excusable for the first five years of his life with his curly locks and his fancy dress he was the pride of his own and the envy of all neighbouring establishments but in process of time the spirit of boyism began to develop itself and vivian not only would brush his hair straight and rebel against his nurse but actually insisted upon beingbreeched at this crisis it was discovered that he had been spoiled and it was determined that he should be sent to school mr grey observed also that the child was nearly ten years old and did not know his alphabet and mrs grey remarked that he was getting ugly the fate of vivian was decided  i am told my dear observed mrs grey one day after dinner to her husband i am told my dear that dr flummerys would do very well for vivian nothing can exceed the attention which is paid to the pupils there are sixteen young ladies all the daughters of clergymen merely to attend to the morals and the linen terms moderate 100 guineas per annum for all under six years of age and few extras only for fencing pure milk and the guitar mrs metcalfe has both her boys there and she says their progress is astonishing percy metcalfe she assures me was quite as backward as vivian indeed backwarder and so was dudley who was taught at home on the new system by a pictorial alphabet and who persisted to the last notwithstanding all the exertions of miss barrett in spelling ape monkey merely because over the word there was a monster munching an apple  and quite right in the child my dear pictorial alphabet pictorial fools head  but what do you say to flummerys horace  my dear do what you like i never trouble myself you know about these matters and mr grey refreshed himself after this domestic attack with a glass of claret  mr grey was a gentleman who had succeeded when the heat of youth was over to the enjoyment of a life estate of some two thousand a year he was a man of lettered tastes and had hailed with no slight pleasure his succession to a fortune which though limited in its duration was still a great thing for a young lounger about town not only with no profession but with a mind unfitted for every species of business grey to the astonishment of his former friends the wits made an excellent domestic match and leaving the whole management of his household to his lady felt himself as independent in his magnificent library as if he had never ceased to be that true freeman a man of chambers  the young vivian had not by the cares which fathers are always heirs to yet reminded his parent that children were anything else but playthings the intercourse between father and son was of course extremely limited for vivian was as yet the mothers child mr greys parental duties being confined to giving his son a daily glass of claret pulling his ears with all the awkwardness of literary affection and trusting to god that the urchin would never scribble  i wont go to school mamma bawled vivian  but you must my love answered mrs grey all good boys go to school and in the plenitude of a mothers love she tried to make her offsprings hair curl  i wont have my hair curl mamma the boys will laugh at me rebawled the beauty  now who could have told the child that monologised mamma with all a mammas admiration  charles appleyard told me so his hair curled and the boys called him girl papa give me some more claret i wont go to school     chapter ii   three or four years passed over and the mind of vivian grey astonishingly developed itself he had long ceased to wear frills had broached the subject of boots three or four times made a sad inroad during the holidays in mr greys bottle of claret and was reported as having once sworn at the butler the young gentleman began also to hint during every vacation that the fellows at flummerys were somewhat too small for his companionship and first bud of puppyism the former advocate of straight hair now expended a portion of his infant income in the purchase of macassar and began to cultivate his curls mrs grey could not entertain for a moment the idea of her sons associating with children the eldest of whom to adopt his own account was not above eight years old so flummery it was determined he should leave but where to go mr grey was for eton but his lady was one of those women whom nothing in the world can persuade that a public school is anything else but a place where boys are roasted alive and so with tears and taunts and supplications the point of private education was conceded  at length it was resolved that the only hope should remain at home a season until some plan should be devised for the cultivation of his promising understanding during this year vivian became a somewhat more constant intruder into the library than heretofore and living so much among books he was insensibly attracted to those silent companions that speak so eloquently  how far the character of the parent may influence the character of the child the metaphysician must decide certainly the character of vivian grey underwent at this period of his life a sensible change doubtless constant communion with a mind highly refined severely cultivated and much experienced cannot but produce a beneficial impression even upon a mind formed and upon principles developed how infinitely more powerful must the influence of such communion be upon a youthful heart ardent innocent and unpractised as vivian was not to figure in the microcosm of a public school a place for which from his temper he was almost better fitted than any young genius whom the playing fields of eton or the hills of winton can remember there was some difficulty in fixing upon his future academus mr greys two axioms were first that no one so young as his son should settle in the metropolis and that vivian must consequently not have a private tutor and secondly that all private schools were quite worthless and therefore there was every probability of vivian not receiving any education whatever  at length an exception to axiom second started up in the establishment of mr dallas this gentleman was a clergyman a profound grecian and a poor man he had edited the alcestis and married his laundress lost money by his edition and his fellowship by his match in a few days the hall of mr greys london mansion was filled with all sorts of portmanteaus trunks and travelling cases directed in a boys sprawling hand to vivian grey esquire at the reverend everard dallas burnsley vicarage hants  god bless you my boy write to your mother soon and remember your journal     chapter iii   the rumour of the arrival of a new fellow circulated with rapidity through the inmates of burnsley vicarage and about fifty young devils were preparing to quiz the newcomer when the schoolroom door opened and mr dallas accompanied by vivian entered  a dandy by jove whispered st leger smith what a knowing set out squeaked johnson secundus mammysick growled barlow primus this last exclamation was however a scandalous libel for certainly no being ever stood in a pedagogues presence with more perfect sang froid and with a bolder front than did at this moment vivian grey  one principle in mr dallass system was always to introduce a newcomer in schoolhours he was thus carried immediately in medias res and the curiosity of his comates being in a great degree satisfied at the time when that curiosity could not personally annoy him the newcomer was of course much better prepared to make his way when the absence of the ruler became a signal for some oral communication with the arrival  however in the present instance the young savages at burnsley vicarage had caught a tartar and in a very few days vivian grey was decidedly the most popular fellow in the school he was so dashing so devilish goodtempered so completely up to everything the magnates of the land were certainly rather jealous of his success but their very sneers bore witness to his popularity cursed puppy whispered st leger smith thinks himself knowing squeaked johnson secundus thinks himself witty growled barlow primus  notwithstanding this cabal days rolled on at burnsley vicarage only to witness the increase of vivians popularity although more deficient than most of his own age in accurate classical attainments he found himself in talents and various acquirements immeasurably their superior and singular is it that at school distinction in such points is ten thousand times more admired by the multitude than the most profound knowledge of greek metres or the most accurate acquaintance with the value of roman coins vivian greys english verses and vivian greys english themes were the subject of universal commendation some young lads made copies of these productions to enrich at the christmas holidays their sisters albums while the whole school were scribbling embryo prizepoems epics of twenty lines on the ruins of paestum and the temple of minerva agrigentum and the cascade of terni vivians productions at this time would probably have been rejected by the commonest twopenny publication about town yet they turned the brain of the whole school while fellows who were writing latin dissertations and greek odes which might have made the fortune of the classical journal were looked on by the multitude as as great dunderheads as themselves such is the advantage which even in this artificial world everything that is genuine has over everything that is false and forced the dunderheads who wrote good latin and attic greek did it by a process by means of which the youngest fellow in the school was conscious he could if he chose attain the same perfection vivian greys verses were unlike anything which had yet appeared in the literary annals of burnsley vicarage and that which was quite novel was naturally thought quite excellent  there is no place in the world where greater homage is paid to talent than an english school at a public school indeed if a youth of great talents be blessed with an amiable and generous disposition he ought not to envy the minister of england if any captain of eton or praefect of winchester be reading these pages let him dispassionately consider in what situation of life he can rationally expect that it will be in his power to exercise such influence to have such opportunities of obliging others and be so confident of an affectionate and grateful return aye theres the rub bitter thought that gratitude should cease the moment we become men  and sure i am that vivian grey was loved as ardently and as faithfully us you might expect from innocent young hearts his slight accomplishments were the standard of all perfection his sayings were the soul of all good fellowship and his opinion the guide in any crisis which occurred in the monotonous existence of the little commonwealth and time flew gaily on  one winter evening as vivian with some of his particular cronies were standing round the schoolroom fire they began as all schoolboys do when it grows rather dark and they grow rather sentimental to talk of home  twelve weeks more said augustus etherege twelve weeks more and we are free the glorious day should be celebrated  a feast a feast exclaimed poynings  a feast is but the work of a night said vivian grey something more stirring for me what say you to private theatricals  the proposition was of course received with enthusiasm and it was not until they had unanimously agreed to act that they universally remembered that acting was not allowed and then they consulted whether they should ask dallas and then they remembered that dallas had been asked fifty times and then they supposed they must give it up and then vivian grey made a proposition which the rest were secretly sighing for but which they were afraid to make themselves he proposed that they should act without asking dallas well then well do it without asking him said vivian nothing is allowed in this life and everything is done in town there is a thing called the french play and that is not allowed yet my aunt has got a private box there trust me for acting but what shall we perform  this question was as usual the fruitful source of jarring opinions one proposed othello chiefly because it would be so easy to black a face with a burnt cork another was for hamlet solely because he wanted to act the ghost which he proposed doing in white shorts and a nightcap a third was for julius caesar because the murder scene would be such fun  no no said vivian tired at these various and varying proposals this will never do out upon tragedies lets have a comedy  a comedy a comedy oh how delightful     chapter iv   after an immense number of propositions and an equal number of repetitions dr hoadleys bustling drama was fixed upon vivian was to act ranger augustus etherege was to personate clarinda because he was a fair boy and always blushing and the rest of the characters found able representatives every halfholiday was devoted to rehearsals and nothing could exceed the amusement and thorough fun which all the preparations elicited all went well vivian wrote a pathetic prologue and a witty epilogue etherege got on capitally in the mask scene and poynings was quite perfect in jack maggot there was of course some difficulty in keeping all things in order but then vivian grey was such an excellent manager and then with infinite tact the said manager conciliated the classics for he allowed st leger smith to select a greek motto from the andromache for the front of the theatre and johnson secundus and barlow primus were complimented by being allowed to act the chairmen  but alas in the midst of all this sunshine the seeds of discord and dissension were fast flourishing mr dallas himself was always so absorbed in some freshlyimported german commentator that it was a fixed principle with him never to trouble himself with anything that concerned his pupils out of school hours the consequence was that certain powers were necessarily delegated to a certain set of beings called ushers  the usherian rule had however always been comparatively light at burnsley vicarage for the good dallas never for a moment entrusting the duties of tuition to a third person engaged these deputies merely as a sort of police to regulate the bodies rather than the minds of his youthful subjects one of the first principles of the new theory introduced into the establishment of burnsley vicarage by mr vivian grey was that the ushers were to be considered by the boys as a species of upper servants were to be treated with civility certainly as all servants are by gentlemen but that no further attention was to be paid them and that any fellow voluntarily conversing with an usher was to be cut dead by the whole school this pleasant arrangement was no secret to those whom it most immediately concerned and of course rendered vivian rather a favourite with them these men had not the tact to conciliate the boy and were notwithstanding too much afraid of his influence in the school to attack him openly so they waited with that patience which insulted beings can alone endure  one of these creatures must not be forgotten his name was mallett he was a perfect specimen of the genuine usher the monster wore a black coat and waistcoat the residue of his costume was of that mysterious colour known by the name of pepperandsalt he was a pallid wretch with a pug nose white teeth and marked with the smallpox long greasy black hair and small black beady eyes this daemon watched the progress of the theatrical company with eyes gloating with vengeance no attempt had been made to keep the fact of the rehearsal a secret from the police no objection on their part had as yet been made the twelve weeks diminished to six ranger had secretly ordered a dress from town and was to get a steelhandled sword from fentums for jack maggot and everything was proceeding with delightful success when one morning as mr dallas was apparently about to take his departure with a volume of beckers thucydides under his arm the respected dominie stopped and thus harangued i am informed that a great deal is going on in this family with which it is intended that i shall be kept unacquainted it is not my intention to name anybody or anything at present but i must say that of late the temper of this family has sadly changed whether there be any seditious stranger among you or not i shall not at present even endeavour to discover but i will warn my old friends of their new ones and so saying the dominie withdrew  all eyes were immediately fixed on vivian and the faces of the classics were triumphant with smiles those of the managers particular friends the romantics we may call them were clouded but who shall describe the countenance of mallett in a moment the school broke up with an agitated and tumultuous uproar no stranger shouted st leger smith no stranger vociferated a prepared gang vivians friends were silent for they hesitated to accept for their leader the insulting title those who were neither vivians friends nor in the secret weak creatures who side always with the strongest immediately swelled the insulting chorus of mr st leger smith that worthy emboldened by his success and the smiles of mallett contained himself no longer down with the manager he cried his satellites chorussed but now vivian rushed forward mr smith i thank you for being so definite take that and he struck smith with such force that the cleon staggered and fell but smith instantly recovered and a ring was instantly formed to a common observer the combatants were unequally matched for smith was a burly biglimbed animal alike superior to grey in years and strength but vivian though delicate in frame and more youthful was full his match in spirit and thanks to being a cockney ten times his match in science he had not built a white great coat or drunk blue ruin at ben burns for nothing  oh how beautifully he fought how admirably straight he hit and his stops quick as lightning and his followings up confounding his adversary with their painful celerity smith alike puzzled and punished yet proud in his strength hit round and wild and false and foamed like a furious elephant for ten successive rounds the result was dubious but in the eleventh the strength of smith began to fail him and the men were more fairly matched go it ranger go it ranger halloed the greyites no stranger no stranger eagerly bawled the more numerous party smiths floored by jove exclaimed poynings who was greys second at it again at it again exclaimed all and now when smith must certainly have given in suddenly stepped forward mr mallett accompanied bydallas  how mr grey no answer sir i understand that you have always an answer ready i do not quote scripture lightly mr grey but take heed that you offend not even with your tongue now sir to your room  when vivian grey again joined his companions he found himself almost universally shunned etherege and poynings were the only individuals who met him with their former frankness  a horrible row grey said the latter after you went the doctor harangued the whole school and swears you have seduced and ruined us all everything was happiness until you came c mallett is of course at the bottom of the whole business but what can we do dallas says you have the tongue of a serpent and that he will not trust himself to hear your defence infamous shame i swear and now every fellow has got a story against you some say you are a dandy others want to know whether the next piece performed at your theatre will be the stranger as for myself and etherege we shall leave in a few weeks and it does not signify to us but what the devil youre to do next half by jove i cant say if i were you i would not return  not return eh but that will i though and we shall see who in future can complain of the sweetness of my voice ungrateful fools     chapter v   the vacation was over and vivian returned to burnsley vicarage he bowed cavalierly to mr dallas on his arrival and immediately sauntered up into the schoolroom where he found a tolerable quantity of wretches looking as miserable as schoolboys who have left their pleasant homes generally do for some fourandtwenty hours how dye do grey how dye do grey burst from a knot of unhappy fellows who would have felt quite delighted had their newly arrived comate condescended to entertain them as usual with some capital good story fresh from town but they were disappointed  we can make room for you at the fire grey said theophilus  i thank you i am not cold  i suppose you know that poynings and etherege dont come back grey  everybody knew that last half and so he walked on  grey grey halloed king dont go into the diningroom mallett is there alone and told us not to disturb him by jove the fellow is going in there will be a greater row this half between grey and mallett than ever  days the heavy first days of the half rolled on and all the citizens of the little commonwealth had returned  what a dull half this will be said eardley how one misses greys set after all they kept the school alive poynings was a firstrate fellow and etherege so deuced goodnatured i wonder whom grey will crony with this half have you seen him and dallas speak together yet he cut the doctor quite dead at greek today  why eardley eardley there is grey walking round playing fields with mallett halloed a sawney who was killing the halfholiday by looking out of the window  the devil i say matthews whose flute is that it is a devilish handsome one  its greys i clean it for him squeaked a little boy he gives me sixpence a week  oh you sneak said one  cut him over  roast him cried a third  to whom are you going to take the flute asked a fourth  to mallett squeaked the little fellow grey lends his flute to mallett every day  grey lends his flute to mallett the deuce he does so grey and mallett are going to crony  a wild exclamation burst forth from the little party and away each of them ran to spread in all directions the astounding intelligence  if the rule of the ushers had hitherto been light at burnsley vicarage its character was materially changed during this halfyear the vexatious and tyrannical influence of mallett was now experienced in all directions meeting and interfering with the comforts of the boys in every possible manner his malice was accompanied too by a tact which could not have been expected from his vulgar mind and which at the same time could not have been produced by the experience of one in his situation it was quite evident to the whole community that his conduct was dictated by another mind and that that mind was one versed in all the secrets of a schoolboys life and acquainted with all the workings of a schoolboys mind a species of knowledge which no pedagogue in the world ever yet attained there was no difficulty in discovering whose was the power behind the throne vivian grey was the perpetual companion of mallett in his walks and even in the school he shunned also the converse of every one of the boys and did not affect to conceal that his quarrel was universal superior power exercised by a superior mind was for a long time more than a match even for the united exertions of the whole school if any one complained malletts written answer and such dallas always required was immediately ready explaining everything in the most satisfactory manner and refuting every complaint with the most triumphant spirit dallas of course supported his deputy and was soon equally detested this tyranny had continued through a great part of the long halfyear and the spirit of the school was almost broken when a fresh outrage occurred of such a nature that the nearly enslaved multitude conspired  the plot was admirably formed on the first bell ringing for school the door was to be immediately barred to prevent the entrance of dallas instant vengeance was then to be taken on mallett and his companionthe sneak the spy the traitor the bell rang the door was barred four stout fellows seized on mallett four rushed to vivian grey but stop he sprang upon his desk and placing his back against the wall held a pistol at the foremost not an inch nearer smith or i fire let me not however baulk your vengeance on yonder hound if i could suggest any refinements in torture they would be at your service vivian grey smiled while the horrid cries of mallett indicated that the boys were roasting him he then walked to the door and admitted the barredout dominie silence was restored there was an explanation and no defence and vivian grey was expelled     chapter vi   vivian was now seventeen and the system of private education having so decidedly failed it was resolved that he should spend the years antecedent to his going to oxford at home nothing could be a greater failure than the first weeks of his course of study he was perpetually violating the sanctity of the drawingroom by the presence of scapulas and hederics and outraging the propriety of morning visitors by bursting into his mothers boudoir with lexicons and slippers  vivian my dear said his father to him one day this will never do you must adopt some system for your studies and some locality for your reading have a room to yourself set apart certain hours in the day for your books and allow no consideration on earth to influence you to violate their sacredness and above all my dear boy keep your papers in order i find a dissertation on the commerce of carthage stuck in my large paper copy of dibdins decameron and an essay on the metaphysics of music pray my dear fellow beware of magazine scribbling cracking the back of montfaucons monarchie  vivian apologised promised protested and finally sat down to read he had laid the foundations of accurate classical knowledge under the tuition of the learned dallas and twelve hours a day and selfbanishment from society overcame in twelve months the ill effects of his imperfect education the result of this extraordinary exertion may be conceived at the end of twelve months vivian like many other young enthusiasts had discovered that all the wit and wisdom of the world were concentrated in some fifty antique volumes and he treated the unlucky moderns with the most sublime spirit of hauteur imaginable a chorus in the medea that painted the radiant sky of attica disgusted him with the foggy atmosphere of great britain and while mrs grey was meditating a visit to brighton her son was dreaming of the gulf of salamis the spectre in the persae was his only model for a ghost and the furies in the orestes were his perfection of tragical machinery  most ingenious and educated youths have fallen into the same error but few have ever carried such feelings to the excess that vivian grey did for while his mind was daily becoming more enervated under the beautiful but baneful influence of classic reverie the youth lighted upon plato  wonderful is it that while the whole soul of vivian grey seemed concentrated and wrapped in the glorious pages of the athenian while with keen and almost inspired curiosity he searched and followed up and meditated upon the definite mystery the indefinite development while his spirit alternately bowed in trembling and in admiration as he seemed to be listening to the secrets of the universe revealed in the glorious melodies of an immortal voice wonderful is it i say that the writer the study of whose works appeared to the young scholar in the revelling of his enthusiasm to be the sole object for which man was born and had his being was the cause by which vivian grey was saved from being all his life a dreaming scholar  determined to spare no exertions and to neglect no means by which he might enter into the very penetralia of his mighty masters meaning vivian determined to attack the latter platonists these were a race of men of whose existence he knew merely by the references to their productions which were sprinkled in the commentaries of his best editions in the pride of boyish learning vivian had limited his library to classics and the proud leaders of the later schools did not consequently grace his diminutive bookcase in this dilemma he flew to his father and confessed by his request that his favourites were not allsufficient  father i wish to make myself master of the latter platonists i want plotinus and porphyry and iamblichus and syrirnus and maximus tyrius and proclus and hierocles and sallustius and damascius  mr grey stared at his son and laughed  my dear vivian are you quite convinced that the authors you ask for are all pure platonists or have not some of them placed the great end rather in practical than theoretic virtue and thereby violated the first principles of your master which would be shocking are you sure too that these gentlemen have actually withdrawn the sacred veil which covers from profane eyes the luminous spectacles are you quite convinced that every one of these worthies lived at least five hundred years after the great master for i need not tell so profound a platonist as yourself that it was not till that period that even glimpses of the great masters meaning were discovered strange that time should alike favour the philosophy of theory and the philosophy of facts mr vivian grey benefiting i presume by the lapse of further centuries is about to complete the great work which proclus and porphyry commenced  my dear sir you are pleased to be amusing this morning  my dear boy i smile but not with joy sit down and let us have a little conversation together father and son and father and son on such terms as we are should really communicate oftener together than we do it has been perhaps my fault it shall not be so again  my dear sir  nay nay it shall be my fault now whose it shall be in future vivian time will show my dear vivian you have now spent upwards of a year under this roof and your conduct has been as correct as the most rigid parent might require i have not wished to interfere with the progress of your mind and i regret it i have been negligent but not wilfully so i do regret it because whatever may be your powers vivian i at least have the advantage of experience i see you smile at a word which i so often use well well were i to talk to you for ever you would not understand what i mean by that single word the time will come when you will deem that single word everything ardent youths in their closets vivian too often fancy that they are peculiar beings and i have no reason to believe that you are an exception to the general rule in passing one whole year of your life as you have done you doubtless imagine that you have been spending your hours in a manner which no others have done before trust me my boy thousands have done the same and what is of still more importance thousands are doing and will do the same take the advice of one who has committed as many ay more follies than yourself but who would bless the hour that he had been a fool if his experience might be of benefit to his beloved son  my father  nay dont agitate yourself we are consulting together let us see what is to be done try to ascertain when you are alone what may be the chief objects of your existence in this world i want you to take no theological dogmas for granted nor to satisfy your doubts by ceasing to think but whether we are in this world in a state of probation for another or whether we cease altogether when we cease to breathe human feelings tell me that we have some duties to perform to our fellow creatures to our friends to ourselves pray tell me my dear boy what possible good your perusal of the latter platonists can produce to either of these three interests i trust that my child is not one of those who look with a glazed eye on the welfare of their fellowmen and who would dream away an useless life by idle puzzles of the brain creatures who consider their existence as an unprofitable mystery and yet are afraid to die you will find plotinus in the fourth shelf of the next room vivian     chapter vii   in england personal distinction is the only passport to the society of the great whether this distinction arise from fortune family or talent is immaterial but certain it is to enter into high society a man must either have blood a million or a genius  the reputation of mr grey had always made him an honoured guest among the powerful and the great it was for this reason that he had always been anxious that his son should be at home as little as possible for he feared for a youth the fascination of london society although busied with his studies and professing not to visit vivian could not avoid occasionally finding himself in company in which boys should never be seen and what was still worse from a certain social spirit an indefinable tact with which nature had endowed him this boy of nineteen began to think this society delightful most persons of his age would have passed through the ordeal with perfect safety they would have entered certain rooms at certain hours with stiff cravats and nugee coats and black velvet waistcoats and after having annoyed all those who condescended to know of their existence with their red hands and their white gloves they would have retired to a corner of the room and conversationised with any stray fouryearolder not yet sent to bed  but vivian grey was a graceful lively lad with just enough of dandyism to preserve him from committing gaucheries and with a devil of a tongue all men will agree with me that the only rival to be feared by a man of spirit is a clever boy what makes them so popular with women it is difficult to explain however lady julia knighton and mrs frank delmington and half a score of dames of fashion were always patronising our hero who found an evening spent in their society not altogether dull for there is no fascination so irresistible to a boy as the smile of a married woman vivian had passed such a recluse life for the last two years and a half that he had quite forgotten that he was once considered an agreeable fellow and so determined to discover what right he ever had to such a reputation he dashed into all these amourettes in beautiful style  but vivian grey was a young and tender plant in a moral hothouse his character was developing itself too soon although his evenings were now generally passed in the manner we have alluded to this boy was during the rest of the day a hard and indefatigable student and having now got through an immense series of historical reading he had stumbled upon a branch of study certainly the most delightful in the world but for a boy as certainly the most perilous the study of politics  and now everything was solved the inexplicable longings of his soul which had so often perplexed him were at length explained the want the indefinable want which he had so constantly experienced was at last supplied the grand object on which to bring the powers of his mind to bear and work was at last provided he paced his chamber in an agitated spirit and panted for the senate  it may be asked what was the evil of all this and the reader will perhaps murmur something about an honourable spirit and youthful ambition the evil was great the time drew nigh for vivian to leave his home for oxford that is for him to commence his long preparation for entering on his career in life and now this person who was about to be a pupil this stripling who was going to begin his education had all the desires of a matured mind of an experienced man but without maturity and without experience he was already a cunning reader of human hearts and felt conscious that his was a tongue which was born to guide human beings the idea of oxford to such an individual was an insult     chapter viii   we must endeavour to trace if possible more accurately the workings of vivian greys mind at this period of his existence in the plenitude of his ambition he stopped one day to enquire in what manner he could obtain his magnificent ends  the bar pooh law and bad jokes till we are forty and then with the most brilliant success the prospect of gout and a coronet besides to succeed as an advocate i must be a great lawyer and to be a great lawyer i must give up my chance of being a great man the services in war time are fit only for desperadoes and that truly am i but in peace are fit only for fools the church is more rational let me see i should certainly like to act wolsey but the thousand and one chances against me and truly i feel my destiny should not be on a chance were i the son of a millionaire or a noble i might have all curse on my lot that the want of a few rascal counters and the possession of a little rascal blood should mar my fortunes  such was the general tenor of vivians thoughts until musing himself almost into madness he at last made as he conceived the grand discovery riches are power says the economist and is not intellect asks the philosopher and yet while the influence of the millionaire is instantly felt in all classes of society how is it that noble mind so often leaves us unknown and unhonoured why have there been statesmen who have never ruled and heroes who have never conquered why have glorious philosophers died in a garret and why have there been poets whose only admirer has been nature in her echoes it must be that these beings have thought only of themselves and constant and elaborate students of their own glorious natures have forgotten or disdained the study of all others yes we must mix with the herd we must enter into their feelings we must humour their weaknesses we must sympathise with the sorrows that we do not feel and share the merriment of fools oh yes to rule men we must be men to prove that we are strong we must be weak to prove that we are giants we must be dwarfs even as the eastern genie was hid in the charmed bottle our wisdom must be concealed under folly and our constancy under caprice  i have been often struck by the ancient tales of jupiters visits to the earth in these fanciful adventures the god bore no indication of the thunderers glory but was a man of low estate a herdsman a hind often even an animal a mighty spirit has in tradition times great moralist perused the wisdom of the ancients even in the same spirit i would explain joves terrestrial visitings for to govern man even the god appeared to feel as a man and sometimes as a beast was apparently influenced by their vilest passions mankind then is my great game  at this moment how many a powerful noble wants only wit to be a minister and what wants vivian grey to attain the same end that nobles influence when two persons can so materially assist each other why are they not brought together shall i because my birth baulks my fancy shall i pass my life a moping misanthrope in an old château supposing i am in contact with this magnifico am i prepared now let me probe my very soul does my cheek blanch i have the mind for the conception and i can perform right skilfully upon the most splendid of musical instruments the human voice to make those conceptions beloved by others there wants but one thing more courage pure perfect courage and does vivian grey know fear he laughed an answer of bitterest derision     chapter ix   is it surprising that vivian grey with a mind teeming with such feelings should view the approach of the season for his departure to oxford with sentiments of disgust after hours of bitter meditation he sought his father he made him acquainted with his feelings but concealed from him his actual views and dwelt on the misery of being thrown back in life at a period when society seemed instinct with a spirit peculiarly active and when so many openings were daily offered to the adventurous and the bold  vivian said mr grey beware of endeavouring to become a great man in a hurry one such attempt in ten thousand may succeed these are fearful odds admirer as you are of lord bacon you may perhaps remember a certain parable of his called memnon or a youth too forward i hope you are not going to be one of those sons of aurora who puffed up with the glittering show of vanity and ostentation attempt actions above their strength  you talk to me about the peculiarly active spirit of society if the spirit of society be so peculiarly active mr vivian grey should beware lest it outstrip him is neglecting to mature your mind my boy exactly the way to win the race this is an age of unsettled opinions and contested principles in the very measures of our administration the speculative spirit of the present day is to say the least not impalpable nay dont start my dear fellow and look the very prosopopeia of political economy i know exactly what you are going to say but if you please we will leave turgot and galileo to mr canning and the house of commons or your cousin hargrave and his debating society however jesting apart get your hat and walk with me as far as evanss where i have promised to look in to see the mazarin bible and we will talk this affair over as we go along  i am no bigot you know vivian i am not one of those who wish to oppose the application of refined philosophy to the common business of life we are i hope an improving race there is room i am sure for great improvement and the perfectibility of man is certainly a pretty dream how well that union club house comes out now since they have made the opening but although we may have steam kitchens human nature is i imagine much the same this moment that we are walking in pall mall east as it was some thousand years ago when as wise men were walking on the banks of the ilyssus when our moral powers increase in proportion to our physical ones then huzza for the perfectibility of man and respectable idle loungers like you and i vivian may then have a chance of walking in the streets of london without having their heels trodden upon a ceremony which i have this moment undergone in the present day we are all studying science and none of us are studying ourselves this is not exactly the socratic process and as for the greek gnothi seauton of the more ancient athenian that principle is quite out of fashion in the nineteenth century i believe thats the phrase self is the only person whom we know nothing about  but my dear vivian as to the immediate point of our consideration in my library uninfluenced and uncontrolled by passion or by party i cannot but see that it is utterly impossible that all that we are wishing and striving for can take place without some without much evil in ten years time perhaps or less the fever will have subsided and in ten years time or less your intellect will be matured mow my good sir instead of talking about the active spirit of the age and the opportunities offered to the adventurous and the bold ought you not rather to congratulate yourself that a great change is effecting at a period of your life when you need not individually be subjected to the possibility of being injured by its operation and when you are preparing your mind to take advantage of the system when that system is matured and organised  as to your request it assuredly is one of the most modest and the most rational that i have lately been favoured with although i would much rather that any influence which i may exercise over your mind should be the effect of my advice as your friend than of my authority as your father still i really feel it my duty parentally to protest against this crude proposition of yours however if you choose to lose a term or two do dont blame me you know if afterwards you repent it  here dashed by the gorgeous equipage of mrs ormolu the wife of a man who was working all the gold and silver mines in christendom ah my dear vivian said mr grey it is this which has turned all your brains in this age every one is striving to make an immense fortune and what is most terrific at the same time a speedy one this thirst for sudden wealth it is which engenders the extravagant conceptions and fosters that wild spirit of speculation which is now stalking abroad and which like the daemon in frankenstein not only fearfully wanders over the whole wide face of nature but grins in the imagined solitude of our secret chambers oh my son it is for the young men of the present day that i tremble seduced by the temporary success of a few children of fortune i observe that their minds recoil from the prospects which are held forth by the ordinary and mark me by the only modes of acquiring property fair trade and honourable professions it is for you and your companions that i fear god grant that there may not be a moral as well as a political disorganisation god grant that our youth the hope of our state may not be lost to us for oh my son the wisest has said he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent let us step into clarkes and take an ice     book ii   chapter i   the marquess of carabas started in life as the cadet of a noble family the earl his father like the woodman in the fairy tale was blessed with three sons the first was an idiot and was destined for the coronet the second was a man of business and was educated for the commons the third was a roué and was shipped to the colonies  the present marquess then the honourable sidney lorraine prospered in his political career he was servile and pompous and indefatigable and loquacious so whispered the world his friends hailed him as at once a courtier and a sage a man of business and an orator after revelling in his fair proportion of commissionerships and undersecretaryships and the rest of the milk and honey of the political canaan the apex of the pyramid of his ambition was at length visible for sidney lorraine became president of a board and wriggled into the adytum of the cabinet  at this moment his idiot brother died to compensate for his loss of office and to secure his votes the earl of carabas was promoted in the peerage and was presented with some magnificent office meaning nothing swelling with dignity and void of duties as years rolled on various changes took place in the administration of which his lordship was once a component part and the ministry to their surprise getting popular found that the command of the carabas interest was not of such vital importance to them as heretofore and so his lordship was voted a bore and got shelved not that his lordship was bereaved of his splendid office or that anything occurred indeed by which the uninitiated might have been led to suppose that the beams of his lordships consequence were shorn but the marquesss secret applications at the treasury were no longer listened to and pert undersecretaries settled their cravats and whispered that the carabas interest was gone by  the noble marquess was not insensible to his situation for he was what the world calls ambitious but the vigour of his faculties had vanished beneath the united influence of years and indolence and illhumour for his lordship to avoid ennui had quarrelled with his son and then having lost his only friend had quarrelled with himself  such was the distinguished individual who graced one day at the latter end of the season of 18 the classic board of horace grey esquire the reader will perhaps be astonished that such a man as his lordship should be the guest of such a man as our heros father but the truth is the marquess of carabas had just been disappointed in an attempt on the chair of the president of the royal society which for want of something better to do he was ambitious of filling and this was a conciliatory visit to one of the most distinguished members of that body and one who had voted against him with particular enthusiasm the marquess still a politician was now as he imagined securing his hosts vote for a future st andrews day  the cuisine of mr grey was superb for although an enthusiastic advocate for the cultivation of the mind he was an equally ardent supporter of the cultivation of the body indeed the necessary dependence of the sanity of the one on the good keeping of the other was one of his favourite theories and one which this day he was supporting with pleasant and facetious reasoning his lordship was delighted with his new friend and still more delighted with his new friends theory the marquess himself was indeed quite of the same opinion as mr grey for he never made a speech without previously taking a sandwich and would have sunk under the estimates a thousand times had it not been for the juicy friendship of the fruit of portugal  the guests were not numerous a regius professor of greek an officer just escaped from sockatoo a man of science and two mps with his lordship the host and mr vivian grey constituted the party oh no there were two others there was a mr john brown a fashionable poet and who ashamed of his own name published his melodies under the more euphonious and romantic title of clarence devonshire and there was a mr thomas smith a fashionable novelist that is to say a person who occasionally publishes three volumes one half of which contain the adventures of a young gentleman in the country and the other volume and a half the adventures of the same young gentleman in the metropolis a sort of writer whose constant tattle about beer and billiards and eating soup and the horribility of committing puns give truly an admirable and accurate idea of the conversation of the refined society of the refined metropolis of great britain these two last gentlemen were pets of mrs grey  the conversation may be conceived each person was of course prepared with a certain quota of information without which no man in london is morally entitled to dine out and when the quota was expended the amiable host took the burthen upon his own shoulders and endeavoured as the phrase goes to draw out his guests  o london dinners empty artificial nothings and that beings can be found and those too the flower of the land who day after day can act the same parts in the same dull dreary farce the officer had discoursed sufficiently about his intimate friend the soudan and about the chain armour of the sockatoo cuirassiers and one of the mps who was in the guards had been defeated in a ridiculous attempt to prove that the breastplates of the household troops of great britain were superior to those of the household troops of timtomtoo mrs grey to whose opinion both parties deferred gave it in favour of the soudan and the man of science had lectured about a machine which might destroy fifteen square feet of human beings in a second and yet be carried in the waistcoat pocket and the classic who for a professor was quite a man of the world had the latest news of the new herculaneum process and was of opinion that if they could but succeed in unrolling a certain suspiciouslooking scroll we might be so fortunate as to possess a minute treatise on c c c in short all had said their say there was a dead pause and mrs grey looked at her husband and rose  how singular it is that when this move takes place every one appears to be relieved and yet every one of any experience must be quite aware that the dead bore work is only about to commence howbeit all filled their glasses and the peer at the top of the table began to talk politics i am sure i cannot tell what the weighty subject was that was broached by the exminister for i did not dine with grey that day and had i done so i should have been equally ignorant for i am a dull man and always sleep at dinner however the subject was political the claret flew round and a stormy argument commenced the marquess was decidedly wrong and was sadly badgered by the civil mp and the professor the host who was of no party supported his guest as long as possible and then left him to his fate the military mp fled to the drawingroom to philander with mrs grey and the man of science and the african had already retired to the intellectual idiocy of a may fair at home the novelist was silent for he was studying a scene and the poet was absent for he was musing a sonnet  the marquess refuted had recourse to contradiction and was too acute a man to be insensible to the forlornness of his situation when at this moment a voice proceeded from the end of the table from a young gentleman who had hitherto preserved a profound silence but whose silence if the company were to have judged from the tones of his voice and the matter of his communication did not altogether proceed from a want of confidence in his own abilities in my opinion said mr vivian grey as he sat lounging in his fathers vacated seat in my opinion his lordship has been misunderstood and it is as is generally the case from a slight verbal misconception in the commencement of this argument that the whole of this difference arises  the eyes of the marquess sparkled and the mouth of the marquess was closed his lordship was delighted that his reputation might yet be saved but as he was not perfectly acquainted in what manner that salvation was to be effected he prudently left the battle to his youthful champion  mr vivian grey proceeded with the utmost sang froid he commented upon expressions split and subtilised words insinuated opinions and finally quoted a whole passage of bolingbroke to prove that the opinion of the most noble the marquess of carabas was one of the soundest wisest and most convincing of opinions that ever was promulgated by mortal man the tables were turned the guests looked astounded the marquess settled his ruffles and perpetually exclaimed exactly what i meant and his opponents full of wine and quite puzzled gave in  it was a rule with vivian grey never to advance any opinion as his own he had been too deep a student of human nature not to be aware that the opinions of a boy of twenty however sound and however correct stand but a poor chance of being adopted by his elder though feebler fellowcreatures in attaining any end it was therefore his system always to advance his opinion as that of some eminent and considered personage and when under the sanction of this name the opinion or advice was entertained and listened to vivian grey had no fear that he could prove its correctness and its expediency he possessed also the singular faculty of being able to improvise quotations that is he could unpremeditatedly clothe his conceptions in language characteristic of the style of any particular author and vivian grey was reputed in the world as having the most astonishing memory that ever existed for there was scarcely a subject of discussion in which he did not gain the victory by the great names he enlisted on his side of the argument his father was aware of the existence of this dangerous faculty and had often remonstrated with his son on the use of it on the present occasion when the buzz had somewhat subsided mr grey looked smiling to his son and said vivian my dear can you tell me in what work of bolingbroke i can find the eloquent passage you have just quoted  ask mr hargrave sir replied the son with perfect coolness then turning to the member you know mr hargrave you are reputed the most profound political student in the house and more intimately acquainted than any other person with the works of bolingbroke  mr hargrave knew no such thing but he was a weak man and seduced by the compliment he was afraid to prove himself unworthy of it by confessing his ignorance of the passage  coffee was announced  vivian did not let the peer escape him in the drawingroom he soon managed to enter into conversation with him and certainly the marquess of carabas never found a more entertaining companion vivian discoursed on a new venetian liqueur and taught the marquess how to mull moselle an operation of which the marquess had never heard as who has and then the flood of anecdotes and little innocent personalities and the compliments so exquisitely introduced that they scarcely appeared to be compliments and the voice so pleasant and conciliating and the quotation from the marquesss own speech and the wonderful art of which the marquess was not aware by which during all this time the lively chattering amusing elegant conversationist so full of scandal politics and cookery did not so much appear to be mr vivian grey as the marquess of carabas himself  well i must be gone said the fascinated noble i really have not felt in such spirits for some time i almost fear i have been vulgar enough to be amusing eh eh eh but you young men are sad fellows eh eh eh dont forget to call on me good evening and mr vivian grey mr vivian grey said his lordship returning you will not forget the receipt you promised me for making tomahawk punch  certainly not my lord said the young man only it must be invented first thought vivian as he took up his light to retire but never mind never mind       chapeau bas chapeau bas      glorie au marquis de carabas     chapter ii   a few days after the dinner at mr greys as the marquess of carabas was sitting in his library and sighing in the fulness of his ennui as he looked on his large library table once triply covered with official communications now thinly besprinkled with a stray parliamentary paper or two his stewards accounts and a few letters from some grumbling tenants mr vivian grey was announced  i fear i am intruding on your lordship but i really could not refrain from bringing you the receipt i promised  most happy to see ye most happy to see ye  this is exactly the correct receipt my lord to every two bottles of still champagne one pint of curaÇoa the peers eyes glistened and his companion proceeded one pint of curaÇoa catch the aroma of a pound of green tea and dash the whole with glenlivet  splendid ejaculated the marquess  the nice point however which it is impossible to define in a receipt is catching the aroma what sort of a genius is your lordships chêf  firstrate laporte is a genius  well my lord i shall be most happy to superintend the first concoction for you and remember particularly said vivian rising remember it must be iced  certainly my dear fellow but pray dont think of going yet  i am very sorry my lord but such a pressure of engagements your lordships kindness is so great and really i fear that at this moment especially your lordship can scarcely be in a humour for my trifling  why this moment especially mr vivian grey  oh my lord i am perfectly aware of your lordships talents for business but still i had conceived that the delicate situation in which your lordship is now placed requiring such anxious attention such  delicate situation anxious attention why man you speak riddles i certainly have a great deal of business to transact people are so obstinate or so foolish they will consult me certainly and certainly i feel it my duty mr vivian grey i feel it the duty sir of every peer in this happy country here his lordship got parliamentary yes sir i feel it due to my character to my family to to to assist with my advice all those who think fit to consult me splendid peroration  oh my lord carelessly remarked vivian i thought it was a mere on dit  thought what my dear sir you really quite perplex me  i mean to say my lord i i thought it was impossible the overtures had been made  overtures mr vivian grey  yes my lord overtures has not your lordship seen the post but i knew it was impossible i said so i  said what mr vivian grey  said that the whole paragraph was unfounded  paragraph what paragraph and his lordship rose and rang the library bell with vehemence sadler bring me the morning post  the servant entered with the paper mr vivian grey seized it from his hands before it reached the marquess and glancing his eye over it with the rapidity of lightning doubled up the sheet in a convenient readable form and pushing it into his lordships hands exclaimed there my lord there that will explain all  his lordship read  we are informed that some alteration in the composition of the present administration is in contemplation lord past century it is said will retire mr liberal principles will have the and mr charlatan gas the a noble peer whose practised talents have already benefited the nation and who on vacating his seat in the cabinet was elevated in the peerage is reported as having had certain overtures made him the nature of which may be conceived but which under present circumstances it would be indelicate in us to hint at  it would have been impossible for a hawk to watch its quarry with eyes of more fixed and anxious earnestness than did vivian grey the marquess of carabas as his lordships eyes wandered over the paragraph vivian drew his chair close to the table opposite to the marquess and when the paragraph was read their eyes met  utterly untrue whispered the peer with an agitated voice and with a countenance which for a moment seemed intellectual  but why mr vivian grey should deem the fact of such overtures having been made impossible i confess astonishes me  impossible my lord  ay mr grey impossible that was your word  oh my lord what should i know about these matters  nay nay mr grey something must have been floating in your mind why impossible why impossible did your father think so  my father oh no he never thinks about these matters ours is not a political family i am not sure that he ever looks at a newspaper  but my dear mr grey you would not have used the word without some meaning why did you think it impossible impossible is such a peculiar word and here the marquess looked up with great earnestness to a portrait of himself which hung over the fireplace it was one of sir thomass happiest efforts but it was not the happiness of the likeness or the beauty of the painting which now attracted his lordships attention he thought only of the costume in which he appeared in that portrait the court dress of a cabinet minister impossible mr grey you must confess is a very peculiar word reiterated his lordship  i said impossible my lord because i did conceive that had your lordship been of a disposition to which such overtures might have been made with any probability of success the marquess of carabas would have been in a situation which would have precluded the possibility of those overtures being made at all  hah and the marquess nearly started from his seat  yes my lord i am a young an inexperienced young man ignorant of the worlds ways doubtless i was wrong but i have much to learn and his voice faltered but i did conceive that having power at his command the marquess of carabas did not exercise it merely because he despised it but what should i know of such matters my lord  is power a thing so easily to be despised young man asked the marquess his eye rested on a vote of thanks from the merchants and bankers of london to the right honourable sydney lorraine president c c c which splendidly emblazoned and gilt and framed and glazed was suspended opposite the presidents portrait  oh no my lord you mistake me eagerly burst forth vivian i am no coldblooded philosopher that would despise that for which in my opinion men real men should alone exist power oh what sleepless nights what days of hot anxiety what exertions of mind and body what travel what hatred what fierce encounters what dangers of all possible kinds would i not endure with a joyous spirit to gain it but such my lord i thought were feelings peculiar to inexperienced young men and seeing you my lord so situated that you might command all and everything and yet living as you do i was naturally led to believe that the object of my adoration was a vain glittering bauble of which those who could possess it knew the utter worthlessness  the peer sat in a musing mood playing the devils tattoo on the library table at last he raised his eyes and said in a low whisper are you so certain that i can command all and everything  all and everything did i say all and everything really my lord you scan my expressions so critically but i see your lordship is smiling at my boyish nonsense and really i feel that i have already wasted too much of your lordships valuable time and displayed too much of my own ignorance  my dear sir i am not aware that i was smiling  oh your lordship is so very kind  but my dear sir you are really labouring under a great mistake i am desirous i am particularly desirous of having your opinion upon this subject  my opinion my lord what should my opinion be but an echo of the circle in which i live but a faithful representation of the feelings of general society  and mr grey i should be glad to know what can possibly be more interesting to me than a faithful representation of the feelings of general society on this subject  the many my lord are not always right  mr grey the many are not often wrong come my dear sir do me the favour of being frank and let me know why the public is of opinion that all and everything are in my power for such after all were your words  if i did use them my lord it was because i was thinking as i often do what after all in this country is public life is it not a race in which the swiftest must surely win the prize and is not that prize power has not your lordship treasure there is your moral steam which can work the world has not your lordships treasure most splendid consequence pure blood and aristocratic influence the millionaire has in his possession the seeds of everything but he must wait for half a century till his descendant finds himself in your lordships state till he is yclept noble and then he starts fair in the grand course all these advantages your lordship has apparently at hand with the additional advantage and one oh how great of having already proved to your country that you know how to rule  there was a dead silence which at length the marquess broke there is much in what you say but i cannot conceal it from myself i have no wish to conceal it from you i am not what i was o ambition art thou the parent of truth  ah my lord eagerly rejoined vivian here is the terrible error into which you great statesmen have always fallen think you not that intellect is as much a purchasable article as fine parks and fair castles with your lordships tried and splendid talents everything might be done but in my opinion if instead of a practised an experienced and wary statesman i was now addressing an idiot earl i should not see that the great end might not equally be consummated  say you so my merry man and how  why my lord but but i feel that i am trespassing on your lordships time otherwise i think i could show why society is of opinion that your lordship can do all and everything how indeed your lordship might in a very short time be prime minister  no mr grey this conversation must be finished i will just give orders that we may not be disturbed and then we shall proceed immediately come now your manner takes me and we shall converse in the spirit of the most perfect confidence  here as the marquess settled at the same time his chair and his countenance and looked as anxious as if majesty itself were consulting him on the formation of a ministry in burst the marchioness notwithstanding all the remonstrances entreaties threats and supplications of mr sadler  her ladyship had been what they style a splendid woman that was now past although with the aid of cashmeres diamonds and turbans her general appearance was still striking her ladyship was not remarkable for anything save a correct taste for poodles parrots and bijouterie and a proper admiration of theodore hook and john bull  oh marquess exclaimed her ladyship and a favourite green parrot which came flying in after its accustomed perch her ladyships left shoulder shrieked at the same time in concert oh marquess my poor julie you know we have noticed how nervous she has been for some days past and i had just given her a saucer of arrowroot and milk and she seemed a little easier and i said to miss graves i really do think she is a leetle better and miss graves said yes my lady i hope she is when just as we flattered ourselves that the dear little creature was enjoying a quiet sleep miss graves called out oh my lady my lady julies in a fit and when i turned round she was lying on her back kicking with her eyes shut and here the marchioness detected mr grey and gave him as sublime a stare as might be expected from a lady patroness of almacks  the marchioness mr vivian grey my love i assure you we are engaged in a most important a most  oh i would not disturb you for the world only if you will just tell me what you think ought to be done leeches or a warm bath or shall i send for doctor blue pill  the marquess looked a little annoyed as if he wished her ladyship in her own room again he was almost meditating a gentle reprimand vexed that his grave young friend should have witnessed this frivolous intrusion when that accomplished stripling to the astonishment of the future minister immediately recommended the warm bath and then lectured with equal rapidity and erudition on dogs and their diseases in general  the marchioness retired easier in her mind about julie than she had been for some days as vivian assured her that it was not apoplexy but only the first symptom of an epidemic and as she retired she murmured her gratitude gracefully to julies young physician  now mr grey said his lordship endeavouring to recover his dignity we were discussing the public sentiments you know on a certain point when this unfortunate interruption  vivian had not much difficulty in collecting his ideas and he proceeded not as displeased as his lordship with the domestic scene  i need not remind your lordship that the two great parties into which this state is divided are apparently very unequally proportioned your lordship well knows how the party to which your lordship is said to belong your lordship knows i imagine how that is constituted we have nothing to do with the other my lord i must speak out no thinking man and such i trust vivian grey is no thinking man can for a moment suppose that your lordships heart is very warm in the cause of a party which for i will not mince my words has betrayed you how is it it is asked by thinking men how is it that the marquess of carabas is the tool of a faction  the marquess breathed aloud they say so do they  why my lord listen even to your servants in your own hall need i say more how then is this opinion true let us look to your conduct to the party to which you are said to belong your votes are theirs your influence is theirs and for all this what return my lord marquess what return my lord i am not rash enough to suppose that your lordship alone and unsupported can make yourself the arbiter of this countrys destinies it would be ridiculous to entertain such an idea for a second the existence of such a man would not be endured by the nation for a second but my lord union is strength nay my lord start not i am not going to advise you to throw yourself into the arms of opposition leave such advice for greenhorns i am not going to adopt a line of conduct which would for a moment compromise the consistency of your high character leave such advice for fools my lord it is to preserve your consistency it is to vindicate your high character it is to make the marquess of carabas perform the duties which society requires from him that i vivian grey a member of that society and an humble friend of your lordship speak so boldly  my friend said the agitated peer you cannot speak too boldly my mind opens to you i have felt i have long felt that i was not what i ought to be that i was not what society requires me to be but where is your remedy what is the line of conduct that i should pursue  the remedy my lord i never conceived for a moment that there was any doubt of the existence of means to attain all and everything i think that was your lordships phrase i only hesitated as to the existence of the inclination on the part of your lordship  you cannot doubt it now said the peer in a low voice and then his lordship looked anxiously round the room as if he feared that there had been some mysterious witness to his whisper  my lord said vivian and he drew his chair close to the marquess the plan is shortly this there are others in a similar situation with yourself all thinking men know your lordship knows still better that there are others equally influential equally illtreated how is it that i see no concert among these individuals how is it that jealous of each other or each trusting that he may ultimately prove an exception to the system of which he is a victim how is it i say that you look with cold hearts on each others situation my lord marquess it is at the head of these that i would place you it is these that i would have act with you and this is the union which is strength  you are right you are right there is courtown but we do not speak there is beaconsfield but we are not intimate but much might be done  my lord you must not be daunted at a few difficulties or at a little exertion but as for courtown or beaconsfield or fifty other offended men if it can be shown to them that their interest is to be your lordships friend trust me that ere six months are over they will have pledged their troth leave all this to me give me your lordships name said vivian whispering most earnestly in the marquesss ear and laying his hand upon his lordships arm give me your lordships name and your lordships influence and i will take upon myself the whole organisation of the carabas party  the carabas party ah we must think more of this  the marquesss eyes smiled with triumph as he shook vivian cordially by the hand and begged him to call upon him on the morrow     chapter iii   the intercourse between the marquess and vivian after this interview was constant no dinnerparty was thought perfect at carabas house without the presence of the young gentleman and as the marchioness was delighted with the perpetual presence of an individual whom she could always consult about julie there was apparently no domestic obstacle to vivians remaining in high favour  the earl of eglamour the only child in whom were concentrated all the hopes of the illustrious house of lorraine was in italy the only remaining member of the domestic circle who was wanting was the honourable mrs felix lorraine the wife of the marquesss younger brother this lady exhausted by the gaiety of the season had left town somewhat earlier than she usually did and was inhaling fresh air and studying botany at the magnificent seat of the carabas family château desir at which splendid place vivian was to pass the summer  in the meantime all was sunshine with vivian grey his noble friend and himself were in perpetual converse and constantly engaged in deep consultation as yet the world knew nothing except that according to the marquess of carabas vivian grey was the most astonishingly clever and prodigiously accomplished fellow that ever breathed and as the marquess always added resembled himself very much when he was young  but it must not be supposed that vivian was to all the world the fascinating creature that he was to the marquess of carabas many complained that he was reserved silent satirical and haughty but the truth was vivian grey often asked himself who is to be my enemy tomorrow he was too cunning a master of the human mind not to be aware of the quicksands upon which all greenhorns strike he knew too well the danger of unnecessary intimacy a smile for a friend and a sneer for the world is the way to govern mankind and such was the motto of vivian grey     chapter iv   how shall we describe château desir that place fit for all princes in the midst of a park of great extent and eminent for scenery as varied as might please natures most capricious lover in the midst of green lawns and deep winding glens and cooling streams and wild forest and soft woodland there was gradually formed an elevation on which was situate a mansion of great size and of that bastard but picturesque style of architecture called the italian gothic the date of its erection was about the middle of the sixteenth century you entered by a noble gateway in which the pointed style still predominated but in various parts of which the ionic column and the prominent keystone and other creations of roman architecture intermingled with the expiring gothic into a large quadrangle to which the square casement windows and the triangular pediments or gable ends supplying the place of battlements gave a varied and italian feature in the centre of the court from a vast marble basin the rim of which was enriched by a splendidly sculptured lotus border rose a marble group representing amphitrite with her marine attendants whose sounding shells and coral sceptres sent forth their subject element in sparkling showers this work the chef doeuvre celebrated artist of vicenza had been purchased by valerian first lord carabas who having spent the greater part of his life as the representative of his monarch at the ducal court of venice at length returned to his native country and in the creation of château desir endeavoured to find some consolation for the loss of his beautiful villa on the banks of the adige  over the gateway there rose a turreted tower the small square window of which notwithstanding its stout stanchions illumined the muniment room of the house of carabas in the spandrils of the gateway and in many other parts of the building might be seen the arms of the family while the tall twisted stacks of chimneys which appeared to spring from all parts of the roof were carved and built in such curious and quaint devices that they were rather an ornament than an excrescence when you entered the quadrangle you found one side solely occupied by the old hall the huge carved rafters of whose oak roof rested on corbels of the family supporters against the walls these walls were of stone but covered halfway from the ground with a panelling of curiouslycarved oak whence were suspended in massy frames the family portraits painted by dutch and italian artists near the dais or upper part of the hall there projected an oriel window which as you beheld you scarcely knew what most to admire the radiancy of its painted panes or the fantastic richness of gothic ornament which was profusely lavished in every part of its masonry here too the gothic pendent and the gothic fanwork were intermingled with the italian arabesques which at the time of the building of the château had been recently introduced into england by hans holbein and john of padua  how wild and fanciful are those ancient arabesques here at château desir in the panelling of the old hall might you see fantastic scrolls separated by bodies ending in termini and whose heads supported the ionic volute while the arch which appeared to spring from these capitals had for a keystone heads more monstrous than those of the fabled animals of ctesias or so ludicrous that you forgot the classic griffin in the grotesque conception of the italian artist here was a gibbering monkey there a grinning pulcinello now you viewed a chattering devil which might have figured in the temptation of st anthony and now a mournful mystic bearded countenance which might have flitted in the back scene of a witches sabbath  a long gallery wound through the upper story of two other sides of the quadrangle and beneath were the show suite of apartments with a sight of which the admiring eyes of curious tourists were occasionally delighted  the grey stone walls of this antique edifice were in many places thickly covered with ivy and other parasitical plants the deep green of whose verdure beautifully contrasted with the scarlet glories of the pyrus japonica which gracefully clustered round the windows of the lower chambers the mansion itself was immediately surrounded by numerous ancient forest trees there was the elm with its rich branches bending down like clustering grapes there was the widespreading oak with its roots fantastically gnarled there was the ash with its smooth bark and elegant leaf and the silver beech and the gracile birch and the dark fir affording with its rough foliage a contrast to the trunks of its more beautiful companions or shooting far above their branches with the spirit of freedom worthy of a rough child of the mountains  around the castle were extensive pleasuregrounds which realised the romance of the gardens of verulam and truly as you wandered through their enchanting paths there seemed no end to their various beauties and no exhaustion of their perpetual novelty green retreats succeeded to winding walks from the shady berçeau you vaulted on the noble terrace and if for an instant you felt wearied by treading the velvet lawn you might rest in a mossy cell while your mind was soothed by the soft music of falling waters now your curious eyes were greeted by oriental animals basking in a sunny paddock and when you turned from the whitefooted antelope and the darkeyed gazelle you viewed an aviary of such extent that within its trellised walls the imprisoned songsters could build in the free branches of a tree their natural nests  o fair scene thought vivian grey as he approached on a fine summers afternoon the splendid château o fair scene doubly fair to those who quit for thee the thronged and agitated city and can it be that those who exist within this enchanted domain can think of anything but sweet air and do aught but revel in the breath of perfumed flowers and here he gained the gardengate so he stopped his soliloquy and gave his horse to his groom     chapter v   the marquess had preceded vivian in his arrival about three or four days and of course to use the common phrase the establishment was quite settled it was indeed to avoid the possibility of witnessing the domestic arrangements of a nobleman in any other point of view save that of perfection that vivian had declined accompanying his noble friend to the château mr grey junior was an epicurean and all epicureans will quite agree with me that his conduct on this head was extremely wise i am not very nice myself about these matters but there are we all know a thousand little things that go wrong on the arrivals of even the best regulated families and to mention no others for any rational being voluntarily to encounter the awful gaping of an english family who have travelled one hundred miles in ten successive hours appears to me to be little short of madness  grey my boy quite happy to see ye later than i expected first bell rings in five minutes sadler will show you your room your father i hope quite well  such was the salutation of the marquess and vivian accordingly retired to arrange his toilet  the first bell rang and the second bell rang and vivian was seated at the dinnertable he bowed to the marchioness and asked after her poodle and gazed with some little curiosity at the vacant chair opposite him  mrs felix lorraine mr vivian grey said the marquess as a lady entered the room  now although we are of those historians who are of opinion that the nature of the personages they celebrate should be developed rather by a recital of their conduct than by a set character on their introduction it is nevertheless incumbent upon us to devote a few lines to the lady who has just entered which the reader will be so good as to get through while she is accepting an offer of some white soup by this means he will lose none of the conversation  the honourable felix lorraine we have before described as a roué after having passed through a career with tolerable credit which would have blasted the character of any vulgar personage felix lorraine ended by pigeoning a young nobleman whom for that purpose he had made his intimate friend the affair got wind after due examination was proclaimed too bad and the guilty personage was visited with the heaviest vengeance of modern society he was expelled his club by this unfortunate exposure mr felix lorraine was obliged to give in a match which was on the tapis with the celebrated miss mexico on whose million he had determined to set up a character and a chariot and at the same time pension his mistress and subscribe to the society for the suppression of vice felix left england for the continent and in due time was made drummajor at barbadoes or fiscal at ceylon or something of that kind while he loitered in europe he made a conquest of the heart of the daughter of some german baron and after six weeks passed in the most affectionate manner the happy couple performing their respective duties with perfect propriety felix left germany for his colonial appointment and also left his lady behind him  mr lorraine had duly and dutifully informed his family of his marriage and they as amiably and affectionately had never answered his letters which he never expected they would profiting by their example he never answered his wifes who in due time to the horror of the marquess landed in england and claimed the protection of her beloved husbands family the marquess vowed he would never see her the lady however one morning gained admittance and from that moment she had never quitted her brotherinlaws roof and not only had never quitted it but now made the greatest favour of her staying  the extraordinary influence which mrs felix lorraine possessed was certainly not owing to her beauty for the lady opposite vivian grey had apparently no claims to admiration on the score of her personal qualifications her complexion was bad and her features were indifferent and these characteristics were not rendered less uninterestingly conspicuous by what makes an otherwise ugly woman quite the reverse namely a pair of expressive eyes for certainly this epithet could not be applied to those of mrs felix lorraine which gazed in all the vacancy of german listlessness  the lady did bow to mr grey and that was all and then she negligently spooned her soup and then after much parade sent it away untouched vivian was not under the necessity of paying any immediate courtesy to his opposite neighbour whose silence he perceived was for the nonce and consequently for him but the day was hot and vivian had been fatigued by his ride and the marquess champagne was excellent and so at last the floodgates of his speech burst and talk he did he complimented her ladyships poodle quoted german to mrs felix lorraine and taught the marquess to eat cabinet pudding with curaçoâ sauce a custom which bythebye i recommend to all and then his stories his scandal and his sentiment stories for the marquess scandal for the marchioness and sentiment for the marquess sister that lady who began to find out her man had no mind to be longer silent and although a perfect mistress of the english language began to articulate a horrible patois that she might not be mistaken for an englishwoman an occurrence which she particularly dreaded but now came her punishment for vivian saw the effect which he had produced on mrs felix lorraine and that mrs felix lorraine now wished to produce a corresponding effect upon him and this he was determined she should not do so new stories followed and new compliments ensued and finally he anticipated her sentences and sometimes her thoughts the lady sat silent and admiring at last the important meal was finished and the time came when good dull english dames retire but of this habit mrs felix lorraine did not approve and although she had not yet prevailed upon lady carabas to adopt her ideas on fielddays still when alone the goodnatured marchioness had given in and to save herself from hearing the din of male voices at a time at which during her whole life she had been unaccustomed to them the marchioness of carabas dozed her worthy spouse who was prevented by the presence of mrs felix lorraine from talking politics with vivian passed the bottle pretty briskly and then conjecturing that from the sunset we should have a fine day tomorrow fell back in his easychair and snored  mrs felix lorraine looked at her noble relatives and shrugged up her shoulders with an air which baffleth all description mr grey i congratulate you on this hospitable reception you see we treat you quite en famille come tis a fine evening you have seen as yet but little of château desir we may as well enjoy the fine air on the terrace     chapter vi   you must know mr grey that this is my favourite walk and i therefore expect that it will be yours  it cannot indeed fail to be such the favourite as it alike is of nature and mrs felix lorraine  on my word a very pretty sentence and who taught you young sir to bandy words so fairly  i never can open my mouth except in the presence of a woman observed vivian with impudent mendacity and he looked interesting and innocent  indeed and what do you know about such wicked work as talking to women and here mrs felix lorraine imitated vivians sentimental voice do you know she continued i feel quite happy that you have come down here i begin to think that we shall be great friends  nothing appears to me more evident said vivian  how delicious is friendship exclaimed mrs felix lorraine delightful sentiment that prevents life from being a curse have you a friend mr vivian grey  before i answer that question i should like to know what meaning mrs felix lorraine attaches to that important monosyllable friend  oh you want a definition i hate definitions and of all the definitions in the world the one i have been most unfortunate in has been a definition of friendship i might say and here her voice sunk i might say of all the sentiments in the world friendship is the one which has been must fatal to me but i must not inoculate you with my bad spirits bad spirits are not for young blood like yours leave them to old persons like myself  old said vivian in a proper tone of surprise  old ay old how old do you think i am  you may have seen twenty summers gallantly conjectured vivian  the lady looked pleased and almost insinuated that she had seen one or two more  a clever woman thought vivian but vain i hardly know what to think of her  mr grey i fear you find me in bad spirits today but alas ii have cause although we see each other today for the first time yet there is something in your manner something in the expression of your eyes that make me believe my happiness is not altogether a matter of indifference to you these words uttered in one of the sweetest voices by which ever human being was fascinated were slowly and deliberately spoken as if it were intended that they should rest on the ear of the object to whom they were addressed  my dearest madam it is impossible that i can have but one sentiment with regard to you that of  of what mr grey  of solicitude for your welfare  the lady gently took the arm of the young man and then with an agitated voice and a troubled spirit dwelt upon the unhappiness of her lot and the cruelty of her fortunes her husbands indifference was the sorrowful theme of her lamentations and she ended by asking mr vivian greys advice as to the line of conduct which she should pursue with regard to him first duly informing vivian that this was the only time and he the only person to whom this subject had been ever mentioned  and why should i mention it here and to whom the marquess is the best of men but and here she looked up in vivians face and spoke volumes and the marchioness is the most amiable of women at least i suppose her lapdog thinks so  the advice of vivian was concise he sent the husband to the devil in two seconds and insisted upon the wifes not thinking of him for another moment and then the lady dried her eyes and promised to do her best  and now said mrs felix lorraine i must talk about your own affairs i think your plan excellent  plan madam  yes plan sir the marquess has told me all i have no head for politics mr grey but if i cannot assist you in managing the nation i perhaps may in managing the family and my services are at your command believe me you will have enough to do there i pledge you my troth do you think it a pretty hand  vivian did think it a very pretty hand and he performed due courtesies in a becoming style  and now good even to you said the lady this little gate leads to my apartments you will have no difficulty in finding your way back so saying she disappeared     chapter vii   the first week at château desir passed pleasantly enough vivians morning was amply occupied in maturing with the marquess the grand principles of the new political system in weighing interests in balancing connections and settling what side was to be taken on the great questions o politics thou splendid juggle the whole business although so magnificent in its result appeared very easy to the two counsellors for it was one of the first principles of mr vivian grey that everything was possible men did fail in life to be sure and after all very little was done by the generality but still all these failures and all this inefficiency might be traced to a want of physical and mental courage some men were bold in their conceptions and splendid heads at a grand system but then when the day of battle came they turned out very cowards while others who had nerve enough to stand the brunt of the hottest fire were utterly ignorant of military tactics and fell before the destroyer like the brave untutored indians before the civilised european now vivian grey was conscious that there was at least one person in the world who was no craven either in body or in mind and so he had long come to the comfortable conclusion that it was impossible that his career could be anything but the most brilliant and truly employed as he now was with a peer of the realm in a solemn consultation on that realms most important interests at a time when creatures of his age were moping in halls and colleges is it to be wondered at that he began to imagine that his theory was borne out by experience and by fact not that it must be supposed even for a moment that vivian grey was what the world calls conceited oh no he knew the measure of his own mind and had fathomed the depth of his powers with equal skill and impartiality but in the process he could not but feel that he could conceive much and dare do more  we said the first week at château desir passed pleasantly enough and so it did for vivians soul revelled in the morning councils on his future fortunes with as much eager joy as a young courser tries the turf preliminary to running for the plate and then in the evening were moonlit walks with mrs felix lorraine and then the lady abused england so prettily and initiated her companion in all the secrets of german courts and sang beautiful french songs and told the legends of her native land in such an interesting semiserious tone that vivian almost imagined that she believed them and then she would take him beside the luminous lake in the park and now it looked just like the dark blue rhine and then she remembered germany and grew sad and abused her husband and then she taught vivian the guitar and some other fooleries besides     chapter viii   the second week of vivians visit had come round and the flag waved proudly on the proud tower of château desir indicating to the admiring county that the most noble sidney marquess of carabas held public days twice a week at his grand castle and now came the neighbouring peer full of grace and gravity and the mellow baronet with his hearty laugh and the jolly country squire and the middling gentry and the jobbing country attorney and the flourishing country surveyor some honouring by their presence some who felt the obligation equal and others bending before the noble host as if paying him adoration was almost an equal pleasure with that of guzzling his venison pasties and quaffing his bright wines  independently of all these periodical visitors the house was full of permanent ones there were the viscount and viscountess courtown and their three daughters and lord and lady beaconsfield and their three sons and sir berdmore and lady scrope and colonel delmington of the guards and lady louisa manvers and her daughter julia lady louisa was the only sister of the marquess a widow proud and penniless  to all these distinguished personages vivian was introduced by the marquess as a monstrous clever young man and his lordships most particular friend and then the noble carabas left the game in his young friends hands  and right well vivian did his duty in a weeks time it would have been hard to decide with whom of the family of the courtowns vivian was the greatest favourite he rode with the viscount who was a good horseman and was driven by his lady who was a good whip and when he had sufficiently admired the tout ensemble of her ladyships pony phaeton he entrusted her in confidence with some ideas of his own about martingales a subject which he assured her ladyship had been the object of his mature consideration the three honourable misses were the most difficult part of the business but he talked sentiment with the first sketched with the second and romped with the third  ere the beaconsfields could be jealous of the influence of the courtowns mr vivian grey had promised his lordship who was a collector of medals an unique which had never yet been heard of and her ladyship who was a collector of autographs the private letters of every man of genius that ever had been heard of in this division of the carabas guests he was not bored with a family for sons he always made it a rule to cut dead they are the members of a family who on an average are generally very uninfluential for on an average they are fools enough to think it very knowing to be very disagreeable so the wise man but little loves them but woe to the fool who neglects the daughters  sir berdmore scrope vivian found a more unmanageable personage for the baronet was confoundedly shrewd and without a particle of sentiment in his composition it was a great thing however to gain him for sir berdmore was a leading country gentleman and having quarrelled with ministers about the corn laws had been counted disaffected ever since the baronet however although a bold man to the world was luckily henpecked so vivian made love to the wife and secured the husband     chapter ix   i think that julia manvers was really the most beautiful creature that ever smiled in this fair world such a symmetrically formed shape such perfect features such a radiant complexion such luxuriant auburn hair and such blue eyes lit up by a smile of such mind and meaning have seldom blessed the gaze of admiring man vivian grey fresh as he was was not exactly the creature to lose his heart very speedily he looked upon marriage as a comedy in which sooner or later he was as a wellpaid actor to play his part and could it have advanced his views one jot he would have married the princess caraboo tomorrow but of all wives in the world a young and handsome one was that which he most dreaded and how a statesman who was wedded to a beautiful woman could possibly perform his duties to the public did most exceedingly puzzle him notwithstanding these sentiments however vivian began to think that there really could be no harm in talking to so beautiful a creature as julia and a little conversation with her would he felt be no unpleasing relief to the difficult duties in which he was involved  to the astonishment of the honourable buckhurst stanhope eldest son of lord beaconsfield mr vivian grey who had never yet condescended to acknowledge his existence asked him one morning with the most fascinating of smiles and with the most conciliating voice whether they should ride together the young heirapparent looked stiff and assented he arrived again at château desir in a couple of hours desperately enamoured of the eldest miss courtown the sacrifice of two mornings to the honourable dormer stanhope and the honourable gregory stanhope sent them home equally captivated by the remaining sisters having thus like a man of honour provided for the amusement of his former friends the three miss courtowns vivian left mrs felix lorraine to the colonel whose moustache bythebye that lady considerably patronised and then having excited an universal feeling of gallantry among the elders vivian found his whole day at the service of julia manvers  miss manvers i think that you and i are the only faithful subjects in this castle of indolence here am i lounging on an ottoman my ambition reaching only so far as the possession of a chibouque whose aromatic and circling wreaths i candidly confess i dare not here excite and you of course much too knowing to be doing anything on the first of august save dreaming of races archery feats and county balls the three most delightful things which the country can boast either for man woman or child  of course you except sporting for yourself shooting especially i suppose  shooting oh ah there is such a thing no i am no shot not that i have not hi my time cultivated a manton but the truth is having at an early age mistaken my intimate friend for a cock pheasant i sent a whole crowd of fours into his face and thereby spoilt one of the prettiest countenances in christendom so i gave up the field besides as tom moore says i have so much to do in the country that for my part i really have no time for killing birds and jumping over ditches good work enough for country squires who must like all others have their hours of excitement mine are of a different nature and boast a different locality and so when i come into the country tis for pleasant air and beautiful trees and winding streams things which of course those who live among them all the year round do not suspect to be lovely and adorable creations dont you agree with tom moore miss manvers  oh of course but i think it is very improper that habit which every one has of calling a man of such eminence as the author of lalla rookh tom moore  i wish he could but hear you but suppose i were to quote mr moore or mr thomas moore would you have the most distant conception whom i meant certainly not bythebye did you ever hear the pretty name they gave him at paris  no what was it  one day moore and rogers went to call on denon rogers gave their names to the swiss monsieur rogers et monsieur moore the swiss dashed open the library door and to the great surprise of the illustrious antiquary announced monsieur lamour while denon was doubting whether the god of love was really paying him a visit or not rogers entered i should like to have seen denons face  and monsieur denon did take a portrait of mr rogers as cupid i believe  come madam no scandal about queen elizabeth mr rogers is one of the most elegantminded men in the country  nay do not lecture me with such a laughing face or else your moral will be utterly thrown away  ah you have retschs faust there i did not expect on a drawingroom table at château desir to see anything so old and so excellent i thought the third edition of tremaine would be a very fair specimen of your ancient literature and major denhams hairbreadth escapes of your modern there was an excellent story about on the return of denham and clapperton the travellers took different routes in order to arrive at the same point of destination in his wanderings the major came unto an unheardof lake which with the spirit which they of the guards surely approved he christened lake waterloo clapperton arrived a few days after him and the pool was immediately rebaptized lake trafalgar there was a hot quarrel in consequence now if i had been there i would have arranged matters by proposing as a title to meet the views of all parties the united service lake  that would have been happy  how beautiful margaret is said vivian rising from his ottoman and seating himself on the sofa by the lady i always think that this is the only personification where art has not rendered innocence insipid  do you think so  why take una in the wilderness or goody two shoes these i believe were the most innocent persons that ever existed and i am sure you will agree with me they always look the most insipid nay perhaps i was wrong in what i said perhaps it is insipidity that always looks innocent not innocence always insipid  how can you refine so when the thermometer is at 100° pray tell me some more stories  i cannot i am in a refining humour i could almost lecture today at the royal institution you would not call these exactly prosopopeias of innocence said vivian turning over a bundle of stewart newtons beauties languishing and lithographed newton i suppose like lady wortley montague is of opinion that the face is not the most beautiful part of woman at least if i am to judge from these elaborate ankles now the countenance of this donna forsooth has a drowsy placidity worthy of the easychair she is lolling in and yet her ankle would not disgrace the contorted frame of the most pious faquir  well i am an admirer of newtons paintings  oh so am i he is certainly a cleverish fellow but rather too much among the blues a set of whom i would venture to say miss manvers knoweth little about  oh not the least mamma does not visit that way what are they  oh very powerful people though mamma does not visit that way their words are ukases as far as curzon street and very decretals in the general vicinity of may fair but you shall have a further description another time how those rooks bore i hate staying with ancient families you are always cawed to death if ever you write a novel miss manvers mind you have a rookery in it since tremaine and washington irving nothing will go down without  bythebye who is the author of tremaine  it is either mr ryder or mr spencer percival or mr dyson or miss dyson or mr bowles or the duke of buckingham or mr ward or a young officer in the guards or an old clergyman in the north of england or a middleaged barrister on the midland circuit  mr grey i wish you could get me an autograph of mr washington irving i want it for a particular friend  give me a pen and ink i will write you one immediately  ridiculous  there now you have made me blot faustus  at this moment the roomdoor suddenly opened and as suddenly shut  who was that  mephistopheles or mrs felix lorraine one or the other perhaps both  what  what do you think of mrs felix lorraine miss manvers  oh i think her a very amusing woman a very clever woman a verybut  but what  but i cannot exactly make her out  nor i she is a dark riddle and although i am a very oedipus i confess i have not yet unravelled it come there is washington irvings autograph for you read it is it not quite in character shall i write any more one of sir walters or mr southeys or mr milmans or mr disraelis or shall i sprawl a byron  i really cannot sanction such unprincipled conduct you may make me one of sir walters however  poor washington said vivian writing i knew him well be always slept at dinner one day as he was dining at mr hallams they took him when asleep to lady jerseys and to see the sieur geoffrey they say when he opened his eyes in the illumined saloons was really quite admirable quite an arabian tale  how delightful i should have so liked to have seen him he seems quite forgotten now in england how came we to talk of him  forgotten oh he spoilt his elegant talents in writing german and italian twaddle with all the rawness of a yankee he ought never to have left america at least in literature there was an uncontested and glorious field for him he should have been managing director of the hudson bay company and lived all his life among the beavers  i think there is nothing more pleasant than talking over the season in the country in august  nothing more agreeable it was dull though last season very dull i think the game cannot be kept going another year if it were not for the general election we really must have a war for varietys sake peace gets quite a bore everybody you dine with has a good cook and gives you a dozen different wines all perfect we cannot bear this any longer all the lights and shadows of life are lost the only good thing i heard this year was an ancient gentlewoman going up to gunter and asking him for the receipt for that white stuff pointing to his roman punch i who am a great man for receipts gave it her immediately one hod of mortar to one bottle of noyau  and did she thank you  thank me ay truly and pushed a card into my hand so thick and sharp that it cut through my glove i wore my arm in a sling for a month afterwards  and what was the card  oh you need not look so arch the old lady was not even a faithless duenna it was an invitation to an assembly or something of the kind at a place somewhere as theodore hook or mr croker would say between mesopotamia and russell square  pray mr grey is it true that all the houses in russell square are tenantless  quite true the marquess of tavistock has given up the county in consequence a perfect shame is it not let us write it up  an admirable plan but we will take the houses first at a peppercorn rent  what a pity miss manvers the fashion has gone out of selling oneself to the devil  good gracious mr grey  on my honour i am quite serious it does appear to me to be a very great pity what a capital plan for younger brothers it is a kind of thing i have been trying to do all my life and never could succeed i began at school with toasted cheese and a pitchfork and since then i have invoked with all the eloquence of goethe the evil one in the solitude of the hartz but without success i think i should make an excellent bargain with him of course i do not mean that ugly vulgar savage with a fiery tail oh no satan himself for me a perfect gentleman or belial belial would be the most delightful he is the fine genius of the inferno i imagine the beranger of pandemonium  i really cannot listen to such nonsense one moment longer what would you have if belial were here  let us see now you shall act the spirit and i vivian grey i wish we had a shorthand writer here to take down the incantation scene we would send it to arnold commençons spirit i will have a fair castle  the lady bowed  i will have a palace in town  the lady bowed  i will have a fair wife why miss manvers you forget to bow  i really beg your pardon  come this is a novel way of making an offer and i hope a successful one  julia my dear cried a voice in the veranda julia my dear i want you to walk with me  say you are engaged with the marchioness whispered vivian with a low but distinctvoice his eyes fixed on the table and his lips not appearing to move  mamma i am  i want you immediately and particularly julia cried lady louisa in an earnest voice  i am coming i am coming you see i must go     chapter x   confusion on that old hag her eye looked evil on me at the very moment although a pretty wife is really the destruction of a young mans prospects still in the present case the niece of my friend my patron high family perfectly unexceptionable c c c such blue eyes upon my honour this must be an exception to the general rule here a light step attracted his attention and on turning round he found mrs felix lorraine at his elbow  oh you are here mr grey acting the solitaire in the park i want your opinion about a passage in herman and dorothea  my opinion is always at your service but if the passage is not perfectly clear to mrs felix lorraine it will be perfectly obscure i am convinced to me  ah yes of course oh dear after all my trouble i have forgotten my book how mortifying well i will show it to you after dinner adieu and bythebye mr grey as i am here i may as well advise you not to spoil all the marquesss timber by carving a certain persons name on his park trees i think your plans in that quarter are admirable i have been walking with lady louisa the whole morning and you cannot think how i puffed you courage cavalier and we shall soon be connected not only in friendship but in blood  the next morning at breakfast vivian was surprised to find that the manvers party was suddenly about to leave the castle all were disconsolate at their departure for there was to be a grand entertainment at château desir that very day but particularly mrs felix lorraine and mr vivian grey the sudden departure was accounted for by the arrival of unexpected c c c there was no hope the green postchariot was at the door a feeble promise of a speedy return julias eyes were filled with tears vivian was springing forward to press her hand and bear her to the carriage when mrs felix lorraine seized his arm vowed she was going to faint and ere she could recover herself or loosen her grasp the manvers were gone     chapter xi   the gloom which the parting had diffused over all countenances was quite dispelled when the marquess entered  lady carabas said he you must prepare for many visitors today there are the amershams and lord alhambra and ernest clay and twenty other young heroes who duly informed that the miss courtowns were honouring us with their presence are pouring in from all quarters is it not so juliana gallantly asked the marquess of miss courtown but who do you think is coming besides  who who exclaimed all  nay you shall guess said the peer  the duke of waterloo guessed cynthia courtown the romp  prince hungary asked her sister laura  is it a gentleman asked mrs felix lorraine  no no you are all wrong and all very stupid it is mrs million  oh how delightful said cynthia  oh how annoying said the marchioness  you need not look so agitated my love said the marquess i have written to mrs million to say that we shall be most happy to see her but as the castle is very full she must not come with five carriagesandfour as she did last year  and will mrs million dine with us in the hall marquess asked cynthia courtown  mrs million will do what she likes i only know that i shall dine in the hall whatever happens and whoever comes and so i suppose will miss cynthia courtown  vivian rode out alone immediately after breakfast to cure his melancholy by a gallop  returning home he intended to look in at a pretty farmhouse where lived one john conyers a great friend of vivians this man had about a fortnight ago been of essential service to our hero when a vicious horse which he was endeavouring to cure of some ugly tricks had nearly terminated his mortal career  why are you crying so my boy asked vivian of a little conyers who was sobbing bitterly at the floor he was answered only with desperate sobs  oh tis your honour said a decentlooking woman who came out of the house i thought they had come back again  come back again why what is the matter dame  oh your honour were in sad distress theres been a seizure this morning and im mortal feard the good mans beside himself  good heavens why did not you come to the castle  oh your honour we ant his lordships tenants no longer theres been a change for purley mill and now were lord mounteneys people john conyers has been behindhand since he had the fever but mr sedgwick always gave time lord mounteneys gemman says the systems bad and so hell put an end to it and so alls gone your honour alls gone and im mortal feard the good mans beside himself  and who is lord mounteneys man of business  mr stapylton toad sobbed the good dame  here boy leave off crying and hold my horse keep your hold tight but give him rein hell be quiet enough then i will see honest john dame  im sure your honours very kind but im mortal feard the good mans beside himself and hes apt to do very violent things when the fits on him he hasnt been so bad since young barton behaved so wickedly to his sister  never mind there is nothing like a friends face in the hour of sorrow  i wouldnt advise your honour said the good dame its an awful hour when the fits on him he knows not friend or foe and scarcely knows me your honour  never mind ill see him  vivian entered the house but who shall describe the scene of desolation the room was entirely stripped there was nothing left save the bare whitewashed walls and the red tiled flooring the room was darkened and seated on an old block of wood which had been pulled out of the orchard since the bailiff had left was john conyers the fire was out but his feet were still among the ashes his head was buried in his hands and bowed down nearly to his knees the eldest girl a fine sensible child of about thirteen was sitting with two brothers on the floor in a corner of the room motionless their faces grave and still as death but tearless three young children of an age too tender to know grief were acting unmeaning gambols near the door  oh pray beware your honour earnestly whispered the poor dame as she entered the cottage with the visitor  vivian walked up with a silent step to the end of the room where conyers was sitting he remembered this little room when he thought it the very model of the abode of an english husbandman the neat row of plates and the wellscoured utensils and the fine old dutch clock and the ancient and amusing ballad purchased at some neighbouring fair or of some itinerant bibliopole and pinned against the wall all gone  conyers exclaimed vivian  there was no answer nor did the miserable man appear in the slightest degree to be sensible of vivians presence  my good john  the man raised his head from his restingplace and turned to the spot whence the voice proceeded there was such an unnatural fire in his eyes that vivians spirit almost quailed his alarm was not decreased when he perceived that the master of the cottage did not recognize him the fearful stare was however short and again the sufferers face was hid  the wife was advancing but vivian waved his hand to her to withdraw and she accordingly fell into the background but her fixed eye did not leave her husband for a second  john conyers it is your friend mr vivian grey who is here said vivian  grey moaned the husbandman grey who is he  your friend john conyers do you quite forget me said vivian advancing and with a tone which vivian grey could alone assume  i think i have seen you and you were kind and the face was again hid  and always will be kind john i have come to comfort you i thought that a friends voice would do you good come cheer up my man and vivian dared to touch him his hand was not repulsed do you remember what good service you did me when i rode whitefooted moll why i was much worse off then than you are now and yet you see a friend came and saved me you must not give way so my good fellow after all a little management will set everything right and he took the husbandmans sturdy hand  i do remember you he faintly cried you were always very kind  and always will be john always to friends like you come come cheer up and look about you and let the sunbeam enter your cottage and vivian beckoned to the wife to open the closed shutter  conyers stared around him but his eye rested only on bare walls and the big tear coursed down his hardy cheek  nay never mind man said vivian we will soon have chairs and tables again and as for the rent think no more about that at present  the husbandman looked up and then burst into weeping vivian could scarcely hold down his convulsed frame on the rugged seat but the wife advanced from the back of the room and her husbands head rested against her bosom vivian held his honest hand and the eldest girl rose unbidden from her silent sorrow and clung to her fathers knee  the fit is over whispered the wife there there theres a man all is now well and vivian left him resting on his wifes bosom  here you curlyheaded rascal scamper down to the village immediately and bring up a basket of something to eat and tell morgan price that mr grey says he is to send up a couple of beds and some chairs here immediately and some plates and dishes and everything else and dont forget some ale so saying vivian flung the urchin a sovereign  and now dame for heavens sake light the fire as for the rent john do not waste this trifle on that whispered vivian slipping his purse into his hand for i will see stapylton toad and get time why woman youll never strike a light if your tears drop so fast into the tinderbox here give it me you are not fit to work today and how is the trout in ravely mead john this hot weather you know you never kept your promise with me oh you are a sad fellow there theres a spark i wonder why old toad did not take the tinderbox it is a very valuable piece of property at least to us run and get me some wood thats a good boy and so whitefooted moll is past all recovery well she was a pretty creature there that will do famously said vivian fanning the flame with his hat see it mounts well and now god bless you all for i am an hour too late and must scamper for my very life     chapter xii   mrs million arrived and kept her promise only three carriagesandfour out of the first descended the mighty lady herself with some noble friends who formed the most distinguished part of her suite out of the second came her physician dr sly her toadeater miss gusset her secretary and her page the third carriage bore her groom of the chambers and three female attendants there were only two men servants to each equipage nothing could be more moderate or as miss gusser said in better taste  mrs million after having granted the marquess a private interview in her private apartments signified her imperial intention of dining in public which as she had arrived late she trusted she might do in her travelling dress the marquess kotooed like a firstrate mandarin and vowed that her will was his conduct  the whole suite of apartments were thrown open and were crowded with guests mrs million entered she was leaning on the marquess arm and in a travelling dress namely a crimson silk pelisse hat and feathers with diamond earrings and a rope of gold round her neck a train of about twelve persons consisting of her noble fellowtravellers toadeaters physicians secretaries c c c followed the entree of her majesty could not have created a greater sensation than did that of mrs million all fell back gartered peers and starred ambassadors and baronets with blood older than the creation and squires to the antiquity of whose veins chaos was a novelty all retreated with eyes that scarcely dared to leave the ground even sir plantagenet pure whose family had refused a peerage regularly every century now for the first time in his life seemed cowed and in an awkward retreat to make way for the approaching presence got entangled with the mameluke boots of my lord alhambra  at last a sofa was gained and the great lady was seated and the sensation having somewhat subsided conversation was resumed and the mighty mrs million was not slightly abused particularly by those who had bowed lowest at her entree and now the marquess of carabas as was wittily observed by mr septimus sessions a pert young barrister went the circuit that is to say made the grand tour of the suite of apartments making remarks to every one of his guests and keeping up his influence in the county  ah my lord alhambra this is too kind and how is your excellent father and my good friend sir plantagenet yours most sincerely we shall have no difficulty about that right of common mr leverton i hope you find the new plough work well your son sir will do the county honour sir godfrey i saw barton upon that point as i promised lady julia i am rejoiced to see ye at château desir more blooming than ever good mr stapylton toad so that little change was effected my lord devildrain this is a pleasure indeed  why ernest clay said mr buckhurst stanhope i thought alhambra wore a turban i am quite disappointed  not in the country stanhope here he only sits crosslegged on an ottoman and carves his venison with an ataghan  well i am glad he does not wear a turban that would be bad taste i think said fool stanhope have you read his poem  a little he sent me a copy and as i am in the habit of lighting my pipe or so occasionally with a leaf why i cannot help occasionally seeing a line it seems quite firstrate  indeed said fool stanhope i must get it  my dear puff i am quite glad to find you here said mr cayenne a celebrated reviewer to mr partenopex puff a small author and smaller wit have you seen middle ages lately  not very lately drawled mr partenopex i breakfasted with him before i left town and met a professor bopp there a very interesting man and principal of the celebrated university of heligoland the model of the london  ah indeed talking of the london is foaming fudge to come in for cloudland  doubtless oh he is a prodigious fellow what do you think booby says he says that foaming fudge can do more than any man in great britain that he had one day to plead in the kings bench spout at a tavern speak in the house and fight a duel and that he found time for everything but the last  excellent laughed mr cayenne  mr partenopex puff was reputed in a certain set a sayer of good things but he was a modest wit and generally fathered his bon mots on his valet booby his monkey or his parrot  i saw you in the last number said cayenne from the quotations from your own works i imagine the review of your own book was by yourself  what do you think booby said  mr puff allow me to introduce you to lord alhambra said ernest clay by which means mr puffs servants last good thing was lost  mr clay are you an archer asked cynthia courtown  no fair dian but i can act endymion  i dont know what you mean go away  aubrey vere welcome to shire have you seen prima donna  no is he here how did you like his last song in the age  his last song pooh pooh he only supplies the scandal  groves said sir hanway etherington have you seen the newspaper this morning baron crupper has tried fifteen men for horsestealing at york and acquitted every one  well then sir hanway i think his lordships remarkable wrong for when a man gets a horse to suit him if he loses it tisnt so easy to suit himself again thats the ground i stand upon  all this time the marquess of carabas had wanted vivian grey twenty times but that gentleman had not appeared the important moment arrived and his lordship offered his arm to mrs million who as the gotha almanack says takes precedence of all archduchesses grand duchesses duchesses princesses landgravines margravines palsgravines c c c     chapter xiii   in their passage to the hall the marquess and mrs million met vivian grey booted and spurred and covered with mud  oh mrs millionmr vivian grey how is this my dear fellow you will be too late  immense honour said vivian bowing to the ground to the lady oh my lord i was late and made a short cut over fearnley bog it has proved a very moscow expedition however i am keeping you i shall be in time for the guava and liqueurs and you know that is the only refreshment i ever take  who is that marquess asked mrs million  that is mr vivian grey the most monstrous clever young man and nicest fellow i know  he does indeed seem a very nice young man said mrs million  some steam process should be invented for arranging guests when they are above five hundred in the present instance all went wrong when they entered the hall but at last the arrangements which of course were of the simplest nature were comprehended and the guests were seated there were three tables each stretching down the hall the dais was occupied by a military band the number of guests the contrast between the antique chamber and their modern costumes the music the various liveried menials all combined to produce a whole which at the same time was very striking and in remarkable good taste  in process of time mr vivian grey made his entrance there were a few vacant seats at the bottom of the table luckily for him as kindly remarked mr grumbleton to the astonishment and indignation however of this worthy squire the late comer passed by the unoccupied position and proceeded onward with undaunted coolness until he came to about the middle of the middle table and which was nearly the best situation in the hall  beautiful cynthia said vivian grey softly and sweetly whispering in miss courtowns ear i am sure you will give up your place to me you have nerve enough you know for anything and would no more care for standing out than i for sitting in there is nothing like giving a romp credit for a little boldness to keep up her character she will outherod herod  oh grey is it you certainly you shall have my place immediately but i am not sure that we cannot make room for you dormer stanhope room must be made for grey or i shall leave the table immediately you men said the hoyden turning round to a set of surrounding servants push this form down and put a chair between  the men obeyed all who sat lower in the table on miss cynthia courtowns side than that lady were suddenly propelled downwards about the distance of two feet dr sly who was flourishing a carvingknife and fork preparatory to dissecting a gorgeous haunch had these fearful instruments suddenly precipitated into a trifle from whose sugared trelliswork he found great difficulty in extricating them while miss gusset who was on the point of cooling herself with some exquisite iced jelly found her frigid portion as suddenly transformed into a plate of peculiarly ardent curry the property but a moment before of old colonel rangoon everything however receives a civil reception from a toadeater so miss gusset burnt herself to death by devouring a composition which would have reduced anyone to ashes who had not fought against bundoolah  now that is what i call a sensible arrangement what could go off better said vivian  you may think so sir said mr boreall a sharpnosed and conceitedlooking man who having got among a set whom he did not the least understand was determined to take up dr slys quarrel merely for the sake of conversation you i say sir may think it so but i rather imagine that the ladies and gentlemen lower down can hardly think it a sensible arrangement and here boreall looked as if he had done his duty in giving a young man a proper reproof  vivian glanced a look of annihilation i had reckoned upon two deaths sir when i entered the hall and finding as i do that the whole business has apparently gone off without any fatal accident why i think the circumstances bear me out in my expression  mr boreall was one of those unfortunate men who always take things to the letter he consequently looked amazed and exclaimed two deaths sir  yes sir two deaths i reckoned of course on some corpulent parent being crushed to death in the scuffle and then i should have had to shoot his son through the head for his filial satisfaction dormer stanhope i never thanked you for exerting yourself send me that fricandeau you have just helped yourself to  dormer who was as vivian well knew something of an epicure looked rather annoyed but by this time he was accustomed to vivian grey and sent him the portion he had intended for himself could epicure do more  whom are we among bright cynthia asked vivian  oh an odd set said the lady looking dignified but you know we can be exclusive  exclusive pooh trash talk to everybody it looks as if you were going to stand for the county have we any of the millionaires near us  the doctor and toady are lower down  where is mrs felix lorraine  at the opposite table with ernest clay  oh there is alhambra next to dormer stanhope lord alhambra i am quite rejoiced to see you  ah mr grey i am quite rejoiced to see you how is your father  extremely well he is at paris i heard from him yesterday do you ever see the weimar literary gazette my lord  no why  there is an admirable review of your poem in the last number i have received  the young nobleman looked agitated i think by the style continued vivian that it is by goëthe it is really delightful to see the oldest poet in europe dilating on the brilliancy of a new star on the poetical horizon  this was uttered with a perfectly grave voice and now the young nobleman blushed who is gewter asked mr boreall who possessed such a thirst for knowledge that he never allowed an opportunity to escape him of displaying his ignorance  a celebrated german writer lisped the modest miss macdonald  i never heard his name persevered the indefatigable boreall how do you spell it  goethe relisped modesty  oh goty exclaimed the querist i know him well he wrote the sorrows of werter  did he indeed sir asked vivian with the most innocent and inquiring face  oh dont you know that said boreall and poor stuff it is  lord alhambra i will take a glass of johannisberg with you if the marquess wines are in the state they should be       the crescent warriors sipped their sherbet spiced      for christian men the various wines were iced  i always think that those are two of the best lines in your lordships poem said vivian  his lordship did not exactly remember them it would have been a wonder if he had but he thought vivian grey the most delightful fellow he ever met and determined to ask him to helicon castle for the christmas holidays  flat flat said vivian as he dwelt upon the flavour of the rhines glory not exactly from the favourite bin of prince metternich i think bythebye dormer stanhope you have a taste that way i will tell you two secrets which never forget decant your johannisberg and ice your maraschino ay do not stare my dear gastronome but do it  o vivian why did not you come and speak to me exclaimed a lady who was sitting at the side opposite vivian but higher in the table  ah adorable lady julia and so you were done on the grey filly  done said the sporting beauty with pouting lips but it is a long story and i will tell it you another time  ah do how is sir peter  oh he has had a fit or two since you saw him last  poor old gentleman let us drink his health do you know lady julia knighton asked vivian of his neighbour this hall is bearable to dine in but i once breakfasted here and i never shall forget the ludicrous effect produced by the sun through the oriel window such complexions every one looked like a prizefighter ten days after a battle after all painted glass is a bore i wish the marquess would have it knocked out and have it plated  knock out the painted glass said mr boreall well i must confess i cannot agree with you  i should have been extremely surprised if you could if you do not insult that man miss courtown in ten minutes i shall be no more i have already a nervous fever  may i have the honour of taking a glass of champagne with you mr grey said boreall  mr grey indeed muttered vivian sir i never drink anything but brandy  allow me to give you some champagne miss resumed boreall as he attacked the modest miss macdonald champagne you know continued he with a smile of agonising courtesy is quite the ladys wine  cynthia courtown whispered vivian with a sepulchral voice tis all over with me i have been thinking what would come next this is too much i am already dead have boreall arrested the chain of circumstantial evidence is very strong  baker said vivian turning to a servant go and inquire if mr stapylton toad dines at the castle today  a flourish of trumpets announced the rise of the marchioness of carabas and in a few minutes the most ornamental portion of the guests had disappeared the gentlemen made a general move up and vivian found himself opposite his friend mr hargrave  ah mr hargrave how dye do what do you think of the secretarys state paper  a magnificent composition and quite unanswerable i was just speaking of it to my friend here mr metternich scribe allow me to introduce you to mr metternich scribe  mr metternich scribe mr vivian grey and here mr hargrave introduced vivian to an effeminatelooking perfumed young man with a handsome unmeaning face and very white hands in short as dapper a little diplomatist as ever tattled about the congress of verona smirked at lady almacks supper after the opera or vowed that richmond terrace was a most convenient situation for official men  we have had it with us some time before the public received it said the future undersecretary with a look at once condescending and conceited  have you said vivian well it does your office credit it is a singular thing that canning and croker are the only official men who can write grammar  the dismayed young gentleman of the foreign office was about to mince a repartee when vivian left his seat for he had a great deal of business to transact mr leverton said he accosting a flourishing grazier i have received a letter from my friend m de noé he is desirous of purchasing some leicestershires for his estate in burgundy pray may i take the liberty of introducing his agent to you  mr leverton was delighted  i also wanted to see you about some other little business let me see what was it never mind i will take my wine here if you can make room for me i shall remember it i dare say soon oh bythebye ah that was it stapylton toad mr stapylton toad i want to know all about mr stapylton toad i dare say you can tell me a friend of mine intends to consult him on some parliamentary business and he wishes to know something about him before he calls  we will condense for the benefit of the reader the information of mr leverton  stapylton toad had not the honour of being acquainted with his fathers name but as the son found himself at an early age apprenticed to a solicitor of eminence he was of opinion that his parent must have been respectable respectable mysterious word stapylton was a diligent and faithful clerk but was not so fortunate in his apprenticeship as the celebrated whittington for his master had no daughter and many sons in consequence of which stapylton not being able to become his masters partner became his masters rival  on the door of one of the shabbiest houses in jermyn street the name of mr stapylton toad for a long time figured magnificently engraved on a broad brass plate there was nothing however otherwise in the appearance of the establishment which indicated that mr toads progress was very rapid or his professional career extraordinarily prosperous in an outward office one solitary clerk was seen oftener stirring his office fire than wasting his masters ink and mr toad was known by his brother attorneys as a gentleman who was not recorded in the courts as ever having conducted a single cause in a few years however a story was added to the jermyn street abode which new pointed and new painted began to assume a mansionlike appearance the housedoor was also thrown open for the solitary clerk no longer found time to answer the often agitated bell and the eyes of the entering client were now saluted by a gorgeous green baize office door the imposing appearance of which was only equalled by mr toads new private portal splendid with a brass knocker and patent varnish and now his brother attorneys began to wonder how toad got on and who toads clients were  a few more years rolled over and mr toad was seen riding in the park at a classical hour attended by a groom in a classical livery and now the profession wondered still more and significant looks were interchanged by the respectable houses and flourishing practitioners in the city shrugged up their shoulders and talked mysteriously of money business and some odd work in annuities in spite however of the charitable surmises of his brother lawyers it must be confessed that nothing of even an equivocal nature ever transpired against the character of the flourishing mr toad who to complete the mortification of his less successful rivals married and at the same time moved from jermyn street to cavendish square the new residence ofmr toad had previously been the mansion of a noble client and one whom as the world said mr toad had got out of difficulties this significant phrase will probably throw some light upon the nature of the mysterious business of our prosperous practitioner noble lords who have been in difficulties will not much wonder at the prosperity of those who get them out  about this time mr toad became acquainted with lord mounteney a nobleman in great distress with fifty thousand per annum his lordship really did not know how he had got involved he never gamed he was not married and his consequent expenses had never been unreasonable he was not extraordinarily negligent quite the reverse was something of a man of business remembered once looking over his accounts and yet in spite of his regular and correct career found himself quite involved and must leave england  the arrangement of the mounteney property was the crowning stroke of mr stapylton toads professional celebrity his lordship was not under the necessity of quitting england and found himself in the course of five years in the receipt of a clear rental of fiveandtwenty thousand per annum his lordship was in raptures and stapylton toad purchased an elegant villa in surrey and became a member of parliament goodburn park for such was the name of mr toads country residence in spite of its double lodges and patent park paling was not to mr toad a very expensive purchase for he took it off the hands of a distressed client who wanted an immediate supply merely to convenience him and consequently became the purchaser at about half its real value attorneys as bustle the auctioneer says have such opportunities  mr toads career in the house was as correct as his conduct out of it after ten years regular attendance the boldest conjecturer would not have dared to define his political principles it was a rule with stapylton toad never to commit himself once indeed he wrote an able pamphlet on the corn laws which excited the dire indignation of the political economy club but stapylton cared little for their subtle confutations and their loudly expressed contempt he had obliged the country gentlemen of england and ensured the return at the next election of lord mounteneys brother for the county at this general election also stapylton toads purpose in entering the house became rather more manifest for it was found to the surprise of the whole country that there was scarcely a place in england county town or borough in which mr stapylton toad did not possess some influence in short it was discovered that mr stapylton toad had a firstrate parliamentary business that nothing could be done without his cooperation and everything with it in spite of his prosperity stapylton had the good sense never to retire from business and even to refuse a baronetcy on condition however that it should be offered to his son  stapylton like the rest of mankind had his weak points the late marquess of almacks was wont to manage him very happily and toad was always introducing that ministers opinion of his importance my time is quite at your service general although the poor dear marquess used to say mr stapylton toad your time is mine he knew the business i had to get through the family portraits also in ostentatious frames now adorned the diningroom of his london mansion and it was amusing to hear the worthy mp dilate upon his likeness to his respected father  you see my lord stapylton would say pointing to a dark dingy picture of a gentleman in a rich court dress you see my lord it is not in a very good light and it certainly is a very dark picture by hudson all hudsons pictures were dark but if i were six inches taller and could hold the light just there i think your lordship would be astonished at the resemblance but its a dark picture certainly it is dark all hudsons pictures were     chapter xiv   the cavaliers have left the ancient hall and the old pictures frown only upon empty tables the marquess immediately gained a seat by mrs million and was soon engrossed in deep converse with that illustrious lady in one room the most eminent and exclusive headed by mrs felix lorraine were now winding through the soothing mazes of a slow waltz and now whirling with all the rapidity of eastern dervishes to true double wien time in another saloon the tedious tactics of quadrilles commanded the exertions of less civilised beings here liberal snake the celebrated political economist was lecturing to a knot of alarmed country gentlemen and there an italian improvisatore poured forth to an admiring audience all the dulness of his inspiration vivian grey was holding an earnest conversation in one of the recesses with mr stapylton toad he had already charmed that worthy by the deep interest which he took in everything relating to elections and the house of commons and now they were hard at work on the corn laws although they agreed upon the main points and vivians ideas upon this important subject had of course been adopted after studying mr toads most luminous and convincing pamphlet still there were a few minor points on which vivian was obliged to confess that he did not exactly see his way mr toad was astonished but argumentative and of course in due time had made a convert of his companion a young man as he afterwards remarked to lord mounteney in whom he knew not which most to admire the soundness of his own views or the candour with which he treated those of others if you wish to win a mans heart allow him to confute you  i think mr grey you must admit that my definition of labour is the correct one said mr toad looking earnestly in vivians face his finger just presuming to feel a button  that exertion of mind or body which is not the involuntary effect of the influence of natural sensations slowly repeated vivian as if his whole soul was concentrated in each monosyllable yes mr toad i do admit it  then my dear sir the rest follows of course triumphantly exclaimed the member dont you see it  although i admit the correctness of your definition mr toad i am not free to confess that i am exactly convinced of the soundness of your conclusion said vivian in a musing mood  but my dear sir i am surprised that you dont see that  stop mr toad eagerly exclaimed vivian i see my error i misconceived your meaning you are right sir your definition is correct  i was confident that i should convince you mr grey  this conversation i assure you mr toad has been to me a peculiarly satisfactory one indeed sir i have long wished to have the honour of making your acquaintance when but a boy i remember at my fathers table the late marquess of almacks  yes mr grey  one of the ablest men mr toad after all that this country ever produced  oh poor dear man  i remember his observing to a friend of mine who was at that time desirous of getting into the house hargrave said his lordship if you want any information upon points of practical politics that was his phrase you remember mr toad that his lordship was peculiar in his phrases  oh yes poor dear man but you were observing mr grey  ay ay if you want any information said his lordship on such points there is only one man in the kingdom whom you should consult and he is one of the soundest heads i know and that is stapylton toad the member for mounteney you know you were in for mounteney then mr toad  i was and accepted the chilterns to make room for augustus clay ernest clays brother who was so involved that the only way to keep him out of the house of correction was to get him into the house of commons but the marquess said so eh  ay and much more which i scarcely can remember and then followed a long dissertation on the character of the noble statesman and his views as to the agricultural interest and the importance of the agricultural interest and then a delicate hint was thrown out as to how delightful it would be to write a pamphlet together on this mighty agricultural interest and then came a panegyric on the character of country gentlemen and english yeomen and the importance of keeping up the old english spirit in the peasantry c c c c and then when vivian had led mr toad to deliver a splendid and patriotic oration on this point he just remembered quite apropos to the sentiments which mr toad had just delivered and which he did not hesitate to say did equal honour to his head and heart that there was a little point which if it was not trespassing too much on mr toads attention he would just submit to him and then he mentioned poor john conyers case although he felt convinced from mr toads wellknown benevolent character that it was quite unnecessary for him to do so as he felt assured that it would be remedied immediately it fell under his cognisance but then mr toad had really so much business to transact that perhaps these slight matters might occasionally not be submitted to him c c c  what could stapylton toad do but after a little amiable grumbling about bad system and bad precedent promise everything that vivian grey required  mr vivian grey said mrs felix lorraine i cannot understand why you have been talking to mr toad so long will you waltz  before vivian could answer a tittering so audible that it might almost be termed a shout burst forth from the whole room cynthia courtown had stolen behind lord alhambra as he was sitting on an ottoman a la turque and had folded a cashmere shawl round his head with a most oriental tie his lordship who notwithstanding his eccentricities was really a very amiable man bore his blushing honours with a gracious dignity worthy of a descendant of the abencerrages the sensation which this incident occasioned favoured vivians escape from mrs felix for he had not left mr stapylton toad with any intention of waltzing  but he had hardly escaped from the waltzers ere he found himself in danger of being involved in a much more laborious duty for now he stumbled on the political economist and he was earnestly requested by the contending theorists to assume the office of moderator emboldened by his success liberal snake had had the hardihood to attack a personage of whose character he was not utterly ignorant but on whom he was extremely desirous of making animpression this important person was sir christopher mowbray who upon the lecturer presuming to inform him what rent was damned himself several times from sheer astonishment at the impudence of the fellow i dont wish to be coarse but sir christopher is a great man and the sayings of great men particularly when they are representative of the sentiment of a species should not pass unrecorded  sir christopher mowbray is member for the county of  and member for the county he intends to be next election although he is in his seventyninth year for he can still follow a fox with as pluck a heart and with as stout a voice as any squire in christendom sir christopher it must be confessed is rather peculiar in his ideas his grandson peregrine mowbray who is as pert a genius as the applause of a commonroom ever yet spoiled and as sublime an orator as the cheerings of the union ever yet inspired says the baronet is not up to the nineteenth century and perhaps this phrase will give the reader a more significant idea of sir christopher mowbray than a character as long and as laboured as the most perfect of my lord clarendons the truth is the good baronet had no idea of liberal principles or anything else of that school his most peculiar characteristic is a singular habit which he has got of styling political economists french smugglers nobody has ever yet succeeded in extracting a reason from him for this singular appellation and even if you angle with the most exquisite skill for the desired definition sir christopher immediately salutes you with a volley of oaths and damns french wines bible societies and mr huskisson sir christopher for half a century has supported in the senate with equal sedulousness and silence the constitution and the corn laws he is perfectly aware of the present perilous state of the country and watches with great interest all the plans and plots of this enlightened age the only thing which he does not exactly comprehend is the london university this affair really puzzles the worthy gentleman who could as easily fancy a county member not being a freeholder as an university not being at oxford or cambridge indeed to this hour the old gentleman believes that the whole business is a hoax and if you tell him that far from the plan partaking of the visionary nature he conceives there are actually four acres of very valuable land purchased near white conduit house for the erection and that there is little apprehension that in the course of a century the wooden poles which are now stuck about the ground will not be as fair and flourishing as the most leafy bowers of new college gardens the old gentleman looks up to heaven as if determined not to be taken in and leaning back in his chair sends forth a sceptical and smiling no no no that wont do  vivian extricated himself with as much grace as possible from the toils of the economist and indeed like a skilful general turned this little rencontre to account in accomplishing the very end for the attainment of which he had declined waltzing with mrs felix lorraine  my dear lord said vivian addressing the marquess who was still by the side of mrs million i am going to commit a most ungallant act but you great men must pay a tax for your dignity i am going to disturb you you are wanted by half the county what could possibly induce you ever to allow a political economist to enter château desir there are at least three baronets and four squires in despair writhing under the tortures of liberal snake they have deputed me to request your assistance to save them from being defeated in the presence of half their tenantry and i think my lord said vivian with a serious voice if you could possibly contrive to interfere it would be desirable that lecturing knave never knows when to stop and he is actually insulting men before whom after all he ought not to dare open his lips i see that your lordship is naturally not very much inclined to quit your present occupation in order to act moderator to a set of brawlers but come you shall not be quite sacrificed to the county i will give up the waltz in which i was engaged and keep your seat until your return  the marquess who was always keeping up county influence was very shocked at the obstreperous conduct of liberal snake indeed he had viewed the arrival of this worthy with no smiling countenance but what could he say as he came in the suit of lord pert who was writing with the lecturers assistance a little pamphlet on the currency apologising to mrs million and promising to return as soon as possible and lead her to the musicroom the marquess retired with the determination of annihilating one of the stoutest members of the political economy club  vivian began by apologising to mrs million for disturbing her progress to the hall by his sudden arrival before dinner and then for a quarter of an hour poured forth the usual quantity of piquant anecdotes and insidious compliments mrs million found vivians conversation no disagreeable relief to the pompous prosiness of his predecessor  and now having succeeded in commanding mrs millions attention by that general art of pleasing which was for all the world and which was of course formed upon his general experience of human nature vivian began to make his advances to mrs millions feelings by a particular art of pleasing that is an art which was for the particular person alone whom he was at any time addressing and which was founded on his particular knowledge of that persons character  how beautiful the old hall looked today it is a scene which can only be met with in ancient families  ah there is nothing like old families remarked mrs million with all the awkward feelings of a parvenue  do you think so said vivian i once thought so myself but i confess that my opinion is greatly changed after all what is noble blood my eye is now resting on a crowd of nobles and yet being among them do we treat them in a manner differing in any way from that which we should employ to individuals of a lower caste who were equally uninteresting  certainly not said mrs million  the height of the ambition of the less exalted ranks is to be noble because they conceive to be noble implies to be superior associating in their minds as they always do a preeminence over then equals but to be noble among nobles where is the preeminence  where indeed said mrs million and she thought of herself sitting the most considered personage in this grand castle and yet with sufficiently base blood flowing in her veins  and thus in the highest circles continued vivian a man is of course not valued because he is a marquess or a duke but because he is a great warrior or a great statesman or very fashionable or very witty in all classes but the highest a peer however unbefriended by nature or by fortune becomes a man of a certain rate of consequence but to be a person of consequence in the highest class requires something else besides high blood  i quite agree with you in your sentiments mr grey now what character or what situation in life would you choose if you had the power of making your choice  that is really a most metaphysical question as is the custom of all young men i have sometimes in my reveries imagined what i conceived to be a lot of pure happiness and yet mrs million will perhaps be astonished that i was neither to be nobly born nor to acquire nobility that i was not to be a statesman or a poet or a warrior or a merchant nor indeed any profession not even a professional dandy  oh love in a cottage i suppose interrupted mrs million  neither love in a cottage nor science in a cell  oh pray tell me what it is  what if is oh lord mayor of london i suppose that is the only situation which answers to my oracular description  then you have been joking all this time  not at all come then let us imagine this perfect lot in the first place i would be born in the middle classes of society or even lower because i would wish my character to be impartially developed i would be born to no hereditary prejudices no hereditary passions my course in life should not be carved out by the example of a grandfather nor my ideas modelled to a preconceived system of family perfection do you like my first principle mrs million  i must hear everything before i give an opinion  when therefore my mind was formed i would wish to become the proprietor of a princely fortune  yes eagerly exclaimed mrs million  and now would come the moral singularity of my fate if i had gained this fortune by commerce or in any other similar mode my disposition before the creation of this fortune would naturally have been formed and been permanently developed and my mind would have been similarly affected had i succeeded to some ducal father for i should then in all probability have inherited some family line of conduct both moral and political but under the circumstances i have imagined the result would be far different i should then be in the singular situation of possessing at the same time unbounded wealth and the whole powers and natural feelings of my mind unoppressed and unshackled oh how splendid would be my career i would not allow the change in my condition to exercise any influence on my natural disposition i would experience the same passions and be subject to the same feelings only they should be exercised and influential in a wider sphere then would be seen the influence of great wealth directed by a disposition similar to that of the generality of men inasmuch as it had been formed like that of the generality of men and consequently one much better acquainted with their feelings their habits and their wishes such a lot would indeed be princely such a lot would infallibly ensure the affection and respect of the great majority of mankind and supported by them what should i care if i were misunderstood by a few fools and abused by a few knaves  here came the marquess to lead the lady to the concert as she quitted her seat a smile beaming with graciousness rewarded her youthful companion ah thought mrs million i go to the concert but leave sweeter music than can possibly meet me there what is the magic of these words it is not flattery such is not the language of miss gusset it is not a rifacimento of compliments such is not the style with which i am saluted by the duke of doze and the earl of leatherdale apparently i have heard a young philosopher delivering his sentiments upon an abstract point in human life and yet have i not listened to a brilliant apology for my own character and a triumphant defence of my own conduct of course it was unintentional and yet how agreeable to be unintentionally defended so mused mrs million and she made a thousand vows not to let a day pass over without obtaining a pledge from vivian grey to visit her on their return to the metropolis  vivian remained in his seat for some time after the departure of his companion on my honour i have half a mind to desert my embryo faction and number myself in her gorgeous retinue let me see what part should i act her secretary or her toadeater or her physician or her cook or shall i be her page methinks i should make a pretty page and hand a chased goblet as gracefully as any monkey that ever bent his knee in a ladys chamber well at any rate there is this chance to be kept back as the gambler does his last trump or the cunning fencer his last ruse  he rose to offer his arm to some stray fair one for crowds were now hurrying to pineapples and lobster salads that is to say supper was ready in the long gallery  in a moment vivians arm was locked in that of mrs felix lorraine  oh mr grey i have got a much better ghost story than even that of the leyden professor for you but i am so wearied with waltzing that i must tell it you tomorrow how came you to be so late this morning have you been paying many calls today i quite missed you at dinner do you think ernest clay handsome i dare not repeat what lady scrope said of you you are an admirer of lady julia knighton i believe i do not much like this plan of supping in the long gallery it is a favourite locale of mine and i have no idea of my private promenade being invaded by the uninteresting presence of trifles and italian creams have you been telling mrs million that she was very witty asked vivians companion with a significant look     chapter xv   sweet reader you know what a toadey is that agreeable animal which you meet every day in civilised society but perhaps you have not speculated very curiously upon this interesting race so much the worse for you cannot live many lustres without finding it of some service to be a little acquainted with their habits  the world in general is under a mistake as to the nature of these vermin they are by no means characterised by that similarity of disposition for which your common observer gives them credit there are toadeys of all possible natures  there is your commonplace toadey who merely echoes its feeders commonplace observations there is your playingup toadey who unconscious to its feeder is always playing up to its feeders weaknesses and as the taste of that feeder varies accordingly provides its cates and confitures a little bit of scandal for a dashing widow or a pious little hymn for a sainted one the secret history of a newly discovered gas for a may fair feeder and an interesting anecdote about a newgate bobcap or a penitentiary apron for a charitable one then there is your drawingout toadey who omits no opportunity of giving you a chance of being victorious in an argument where there is no contest and a dispute where there is no difference and then there isbut we detest essay writing so we introduce you at once to a party of these vermin if you wish to enjoy a curious sight you must watch the toadeys when they are unembarrassed by the almost perpetual presence of their breeders when they are animated by the spirit of freedom when like currans negro the chain bursts by the impulse of their swelling veins the great singularity is the struggle between their natural and their acquired feelings the eager opportunity which they seize of revenging their voluntary bondage by their secret taunts on their adopted taskmasters and the servility which they habitually mix up even with their scandal like veritable grimalkins they fawn upon their victims previous to the festival compliment them upon the length of their whiskers and the delicacy of their limbs prior to excoriating them and dwelling on the flavour of their crashed bones tis a beautiful scene and ten thousand times more piquant than the humours of a servants hall or the most grotesque and glorious moments of high life below stairs  dear miss graves said miss gusset you cant imagine how terrified i was at that horrible green parrot flying upon my head i declare it pulled out three locks of hair  horrible green parrot my dear madam why it was sent to my lady by prince xtmnprqtosklw and never shall i forget the agitation we were in about that parrot i thought it would never have got to the château for the prince could only send his carriage with it as far as toadcaster luckily my ladys youngest brother who was staying at desir happened to get drowned at the time and so davenport very clever of him sent her on in my lord dormers hearse  in the hearse good heavens miss graves how could you think of green parrots at such an awful moment i should have been in fits for three days eh dr sly  certainly you would madame your nerves are very delicate  well i for my part never could see much use in giving up to ones feelings it is all very well for commoners rather rudely exclaimed the marchioness toadey but we did not choose to expose ourselves to the servants when the old general died this year everything went on as usual her ladyship attended almacks my lord took his seat in the house and i looked in at lady doubtfuls where we do not visit but where the marchioness wishes to be civil  we do not visit lady doubtful either replied miss gusset she had not a card for our fête champêtre i was so sorry you were not in town it was so delightful  do tell me who was there i quite long to know all about it i saw some account of it everything seemed to go off so well do tell me who was there  oh there was plenty of royalty at the head of the list really i cannot go into particulars but everybody was there who is anybody eh dr sly  certainly madam the pines were most admirable there are few people for whom i entertain a higher esteem than mr gunter  the marchioness seems very fond of her parrot miss graves but she is a sweet woman  oh a dear amiable creature but i cannot think how she can bear the eternal screaming of that noisy bird  nor i indeed well thank goodness mrs million has no pets eh dr sly  certainly i am clearly of opinion that it cannot be wholesome to have so many animals about a house besides which i have noticed that the marchioness always selects the nicest morsels for that little poodle and i am also clearly of opinion miss graves that the fit it had the other day arose from repletion  i have no doubt of it in the world she consumes three pounds of arrowroot weekly and two pounds of the finest loaf sugar which i have the trouble of grating every monday morning mrs million appears to be a most amiable woman miss gusset  quite perfection so charitable so intellectual such a soul it is a pity though her manner is so abrupt she really does not appear to advantage sometimes eh dr sly  the toadeys toadey bowed assent as usual well rejoined miss graves that is rather a fault of the dear marchioness a little want of consideration for anothers feelings but she means nothing  oh no nor mrs million dear creature she means nothing though i dare say not knowing her so well as we do eh dr sly you were a little surprised at the way in which she spoke to me at dinner  all people have their oddities miss gusset i am sure the marchioness is not aware how she tries my patience about that little wretch julie i had to rub her with warm flannels for an hour and a half before the fire this morning that is that vivian greys doing  who is this mr grey miss graves  who indeed some young man the marquess has picked up and who comes lecturing here about poodles and parrots and thinking himself quite lord paramount i can assure you i am surprised that the marchioness who is a most sensible woman can patronise such conduct a moment but whenever she begins to see through him the young gentleman has always got a story about a bracelet or a bandeau and quite turns her head  very disagreeable i am sure  some people are so easily managed bythebye miss gusset who could have advised mrs million to wear crimson so large as she is it does not at all suit her i suppose its a favourite colour  dear miss graves you are always so insinuating what can miss graves mean eh dr sly  a lord burleigh shake of the head  cynthia courtown seems as lively as ever said miss gusset  yes lively enough but i wish her manner was less brusque  brusque indeed you may well say so she nearly pushed me down in the hall and when i looked as if i thought she might have given me a little more room she tossed her head and said beg pardon never saw you  i wonder what lord alhambra sees in that girl  oh those forward misses always take the men  well said miss graves i have no notion that it will come to anything i am sure i for one hope not added she with all a toadeys venom  the marquess seems to keep a remarkably good table said the physician there was a haunch today which i really think was the finest haunch i ever met with but that little move at dinner it was to say the least very illtimed  yes that was vivian grey again said miss graves very indignantly  so you have got the beaconsfields here miss graves nice unaffected quiet people  yes very quiet  as you say miss graves very quiet but a little heavy  yes heavy enough  if you had but seen the quantity of pineapples that boy dormer stanhope devoured at our fête champêtre but i have the comfort of knowing that they made him very ill eh dr sly  oh he learnt that from his uncle said miss graves it is quite disgusting to see how that vivian grey encourages him  what an elegant accomplished woman mrs felix lorraine seems to be miss graves i suppose the marchioness is very fond of her  oh yes the marchioness is so goodnatured that i dare say she thinks very well of mrs felix lorraine she thinks well of everyone but i believe mrs felix is rather a greater favourite with the marquess  oh drawled out miss gusset with a very significant tone i suppose she is one of your playingup ladies i think you told me she was only on a visit here  a pretty long visit though for a sisterinlaw if sisterinlaw she be as i was saying to the marchioness the other day when mrs felix offended her so violently by trampling on the dear little julie if it came into a court of justice i should like to see the proof thats all at any rate it is pretty evident that mr lorraine has had enough of his bargain  quite evident i think eh dr sly those german women never make good english wives continued miss gusset with all a toadeys patriotism  talking of wives did not you think lady julia spoke very strangely of sir peter after dinner today i hate that lady julia if it be only for petting vivian grey so  yes indeed it is quite enough to make one sick eh dr sly  the doctor shook his head mournfully remembering the haunch  they say ernest clay is in sad difficulties miss gusset  well i always expected his dash would end in that those wild harumscarum men are monstrous disagreeable i like a person of some reflection eh dr sly  before the doctor could bow his usual assent there entered a pretty little page very daintily attired in a fancy dress of green and silver twirling his richly chased dirk with one tiny white hand and at the same time playing with a pet curl which was picturesquely flowing over his forehead he advanced with ambling gait to miss gusset and in a mincing voice and courtly phrase summoned her to the imperial presence  the ladys features immediately assumed the expression which befitted the approaching interview and in a moment miss graves and the physician were left alone  very amiable young woman miss gusset appears to be dr sly  oh the most amiable being in the world i owe her the greatest obligations  so gentle in her manners  o yes so gentle  so considerate for everybody  oh yes so considerate echoed the aberdeen md  i am afraid though she must sometimes meet with people who do not exactly understand her character such extraordinary consideration for others is sometimes liable to misconstruction  very sensibly remarked miss graves i am sure miss gusset means well and that kind of thing is all very admirable in its way but but  but what dr sly  why i was merely going to hazard an observation that according to my feelings that is to my own peculiar view of the case i should prefer some people thinking more about their own business and and but i mean nothing  oh no of course not dr sly you know we always except our own immediate friends at least when we can be sure they are our friends but as you were saying or going to say those persons who are so very anxious about other peoples affairs are not always the most agreeable persons in the world to live with it certainly did strike me that that interference of miss gussets about julie today was to say the least very odd  oh my dear madam when you know her as well as i do you will see she is always ready to put in a word  well do you know dr sly between ourselves that was exactly my impression and she is then very very i do not exactly mean to say meddling or inquisitive but but you understand me dr sly  perfectly and if i were to speak my mind which i do not hesitate to do in confidence to you miss graves i really should say that she is the most jealous irritable malicious meddling and at the same time fawning disposition that i ever met with in the whole course of my life and i speak from experience  well do you know dr sly from all i have seen that was exactly my impression therefore i have been particularly careful not to commit myself to such a person  ah miss graves if all ladies were like you oh  my dear dr sly     chapter xvi   vivian had duly acquainted the marquess with the successful progress of his negotiations with their intended partisans and lord carabas had himself conversed with them singly on the important subject it was thought proper however in this stage of the proceedings that the persons interested should meet together and so the two lords and sir berdmore and vivian were invited to dine with the marquess alone and in his library  there was abundance of dumb waiters and other inventions by which the ease of the guests might be consulted without risking even their secret looks to the gaze of liveried menials the marquess gentleman sat in an antechamber in case human aid might be necessary and everything as his lordship averred was on the same system as the cabinet dinners  in the ancient kingdom of england it hath ever been the custom to dine previously to transacting business this habit is one of those few which are not contingent upon the mutable fancies of fashion and at this day we see cabinet dinners and vestry dinners alike proving the correctness of our assertion whether the custom really expedites the completion or the general progress of the business which gives rise to it is a grave question which we do not feel qualified to decide certain it is that very often after the dinner an appointment is made for the transaction of the business on the following morning at the same time it must be remembered that had it not been for the opportunity which the banquet afforded of developing the convivial qualities of the guests and drawing out by the assistance of generous wine their most kindly sentiments and most engaging feelings it is very probable that the appointment for the transaction of the business would never have been made at all  there certainly was every appearance that the great business as the marquess styled it would not be very much advanced by the cabinet dinner at château desir for in the first place the table was laden with every delicacy of the season and really when a man is either going to talk sense fight a duel or make his will nothing should be seen at dinner save cutlets and the lightest bordeaux and in the second place it must be confessed that when it came to the point of all the parties interested meeting the marquess courage somewhat misgave him not that any particular reason occurred to him which would have induced him to yield one jot of the theory of his sentiments but the putting them in practice rather made him nervous in short he was as convinced as ever that he was an illused man of great influence and abilities but then he remembered his agreeable sinecure and his dignified office and he might not succeed the thought did not please  but here they were all assembled receding was impossible and so the marquess took a glass of claret and felt more courageous  my lords and gentlemen he began although i have myself taken the opportunity of communicating to you singly my thoughts upon a certain subject and although if i am rightly informed my excellent young friend has communicated to you more fully upon that subject yet my lords and gentlemen i beg to remark that this is the first time that we have collectively assembled to consult on the possibility of certain views upon the propriety of their nature and the expediency of their adoption here the claret passed the present state of parties the marquess continued has doubtless for a long time engaged your attention it is very peculiar and although the result has been gradually arrived at it is nevertheless now that it is realised startling and not i apprehend very satisfactory there are few distinctions now between the two sides of the house of commons very different from the times in which most i believe all of us my lords and gentlemen were members of that assembly the question then naturally arises why a certain body of individuals who now represent no opinions should arrogate to themselves the entire government and control of the country a second question would occur how they contrive to succeed in such an assumption they succeed clearly because the party who placed them in power because they represented certain opinions still continue to them their support some of the most influential members of that party i am bold to say may be found in this room i dont know if the boroughs of lord courtown and lord beaconsfield were withdrawn at a critical division what might be the result i am quite sure that if the forty country gentlemen who follow i believe i am justified in saying our friend sir berdmore and wisely follow him were to declare their opposition to any particular tax the present men would be beaten as they have been beaten before i was myself a member of the government when so beaten and i know what lord liverpool said the next morning lord liverpool said the next morning forty country gentlemen if they choose might repeal every tax in the budget under these circumstances my lords and gentlemen it becomes us in my opinion to consider our situation i am far from wishing to witness any general change or indeed very wide reconstruction of the present administration i think the interests of the country require that the general tenor of their system should be supported but there are members of that administration whose claims to that distinction appear to me more than questionable while at the same time there are individuals excluded personages of great influence and recognised talents who ought no longer in my opinion to occupy a position in the background mr vivian grey a gentleman whom i have the honour to call my particular friend and who i believe has had already the pleasure of incidentally conversing with you on the matters to which i have referred has given great attention to this important subject he is a younger man than any of us and certainly has much better lungs than i have i will take the liberty therefore of requesting him to put the case in its completeness before us  a great deal of desultory conversation as it is styled relative to the great topic of debate now occurred when the blood of the party was tolerably warmed vivian addressed them the tenor of his oration may be imagined he developed the new political principles demonstrated the mistake under the baneful influence of which they had so long suffered promised them place and power and patronage and personal consideration if they would only act on the principles which he recommended in the most flowing language and the most melodious voice in which the glories of ambition were ever yet chaunted there was a buzz of admiration when the flattering music ceased the marquess smiled triumphantly as if to say didnt i tell you he was a monstrous clever fellow and the whole business seemed settled lord courtown gave in a bumper mr vivian grey and success to his maiden speech and vivian replied by proposing the new union at last sir berdmore the coolest of them all raised his voice he quite agreed with mr grey in the principles which he had developed and for his own part he was free to confess that he had perfect confidence in that gentlemans very brilliant abilities and augured from their exertion complete and triumphant success at the same time he felt it his duty to remark to their lordships and also to that gentleman that the house of commons was a new scene to him and he put it whether they were quite convinced that they were sufficiently strong as regarded talent in that assembly he could not take it upon himself to offer to become the leader of the party mr grey might be capable of undertaking that charge but still it must be remembered that in that assembly he was as yet untried he made no apology to mr grey for speaking his mind so freely he was sure that his motives could not be misinterpreted if their lordships on the whole were of opinion that this charge should be entrusted to him he sir berdmore having the greatest confidence in mr greys abilities would certainly support him to the utmost  he can do anything said the marquess  he is a surprising clever man said lord courtown  he is a surprising clever man echoed lord beaconsfield  stop my lords said vivian your good opinion deserves my gratitude but these important matters do indeed require a moments consideration i trust that sir berdmore scrope does not imagine that i am the vain idiot to be offended at his most excellent remarks even for a moment are we not met here for the common good and to consult for the success of the common cause whatever my talents are they are at your service and in your service will i venture anything but surely my lords you will not unnecessarily entrust this great business to a raw hand i need only aver that i am ready to follow any leader who can play his great part in a becoming manner  noble said the marquess  but who was the leader to be sir berdmore frankly confessed that he had none to propose and the viscount and the baron were quite silent  gentlemen exclaimed the marquess gentlemen there is a man who could do our bidding the eyes of every guest were fixed on the haranguing host  gentlemen fill your glasses i give you our leader mr frederick cleveland  cleveland every one exclaimed a glass of claret fell from lord courtowns hand lord beaconsfield stopped as he was about to fill his glass and stood gaping at the marquess with the decanter in his hand and sir berdmore stared on the table as men do when something unexpected and astounding has occurred at dinner which seems past all their management  cleveland exclaimed the guests  i should as soon have expected you to have given us lucifer said lord courtown  or the present secretary said lord beaconsfield  or yourself said sir berdmore  and does any one maintain that frederick cleveland is not capable of driving out a much stronger government than he will have to cope with demanded the marquess with a rather fierce air  we do not deny mr clevelands powers my lord we only humbly beg to suggest that it appears to us that of all the persons in the world the man with whom mr cleveland would be least inclined to coalesce would be the marquess of carabas  the marquess looked somewhat blank  gentlemen said vivian do not despair it is enough for me to know that there is a man who is capable of doing our work be he animate man or incarnate fiend provided he can be found within this realm i pledge myself that within ten days he is drinking my noble friends health at this very board  the marquess said bravo the rest smiled and rose from the table in some confusion little more was said on the great business the guests took refuge in coffee and a glass of liqueur the pledge was however apparently accepted and lord carabas and vivian were soon left alone the marquess seemed agitated by vivians offer and engagement this is a grave business he said you hardly know my dear vivian what you have undertaken but if anybody can succeed you will we must talk of this tomorrow there are some obstacles and i should once have thought invincible i cannot conceive what made me mention his name but it has been often in my mind since you first spoke to me you and he together we might carry everything before us but there are some obstacles no doubt there are some obstacles you heard what courtown said a man who does not make difficulties and beaconsfield a man who does not say much courtown called him lucifer he is lucifer but by jove you are the man to overcome obstacles we must talk of it tomorrow so now my dear fellow good night  what have i done thought vivian i am sure that lucifer may know for i do not this cleveland is i suppose after all but a man i saw the feeble fools were wavering and to save all made a leap in the dark well is my skull cracked nous verrons how hot either this room or my blood is come for some fresh air he opened the library window how fresh and soft it is just the night for the balcony hah music i cannot mistake that voice singular woman i will just walk on till i am beneath her window  vivian accordingly proceeded along the balcony which extended down one whole side of the château while he was looking at the moon he stumbled against some one it was colonel delmington he apologised to the militaire for treading on his toes and wondered how the devil he got there     book iii   chapter i   fredrick cleveland was educated at eton and at cambridge and after having proved both at the school and the university that he possessed talents of a high order he had the courage in order to perfect them to immure himself for three years in a german university it was impossible therefore for two minds to have been cultivated on more contrary systems than those of frederick cleveland and vivian grey the systems on which they had been educated were not however more discordant than the respective tempers of the pupils with that of vivian grey the reader is now somewhat acquainted it has been shown that he was one precociously convinced of the necessity of managing mankind by studying their tempers and humouring their weaknesses cleveland turned from the book of nature with contempt and although his was a mind of extraordinary acuteness he was at threeandthirty as ignorant of the workings of the human heart as when in the innocence of boyhood he first reached eton  although possessed of no fortune from his connections and the reputation of his abilities he entered parliament at an early age his success was eminent it was at this period that he formed a great intimacy with the present marquess of carabas then under secretary of state his exertions for the party to which mr under secretary lorraine belonged were unremitting and it was mainly through their influence that a great promotion took place in the official appointments of the party when the hour of reward came mr lorraine and his friends unfortunately forgot their youthful champion he remonstrated and they smiled he reminded them of private friendship and they answered him with political expediency mr cleveland went down to the house and attacked his old comates in a spirit of unexampled bitterness he examined in review the various members of the party that had deserted him they trembled on their seats while they writhed beneath the keenness of his satire but when the orator came to mr president lorraine he flourished the tomahawk on high like a wild indian chieftain and the attack was so awfully severe so overpowering so annihilating that even this hackneyed and hardened official trembled turned pale and quitted the house clevelands triumph was splendid but it was only for a night disgusted with mankind he scouted the thousand offers of political connections which crowded upon him and having succeeded in making an arrangement with his creditors he accepted the chiltern hundreds  by the interest of his friends he procured a judicial situation of sufficient emolument but of local duty and to fulfil this duty he was obliged to reside in north wales the locality indeed suited him well for he was sick of the world at nineandtwenty and carrying his beautiful and newlymarried wife from the world which without him she could not love mr cleveland enjoyed all the luxuries of a cottage ornée in the most romantic part of the principality here were born unto him a son and daughter beautiful children upon whom the father lavished all the affection which nature had intended for the world  four years had cleveland now passed in his solitude an unhappy man a thousand times during the first year of his retirement he cursed the moment of excitement which had banished him from the world for he found himself without resources and restless as a curbed courser like many men who are born to be orators like curran and like fox cleveland was not blessed or cursed with the faculty of composition and indeed had his pen been that of a ready writer pique would have prevented him from delighting or instructing a world whose nature he endeavoured to persuade himself was base and whose applause ought consequently to be valueless in the second year he endeavoured to while away his time by interesting himself in those pursuits which nature has kindly provided for country gentlemen farming kept him alive for a while but at length his was the prize ox and having gained a cup he got wearied of kine too prime for eating wheat too fine for the composition of the staff of life and ploughs so ingeniously contrived that the very ingenuity prevented them from being useful cleveland was now seen wandering over the moors and mountains with a gun over his shoulder and a couple of dogs at his heels but ennui returned in spite of his patent percussion and so at length tired of being a sportsman he almost became what he had fancied himself in an hour of passion a misanthrope  after having been closeted with lord carabas for a considerable time the morning after the cabinet dinner vivian left château desir  he travelled night and day until he arrived in the vicinity of mr clevelands abode what was he to do now after some deliberation he despatched a note to mr cleveland informing him that he mr grey was the bearer to mr cleveland of a communication of importance under the circumstances of the case he observed that he had declined bringing any letters of introduction he was quite aware therefore that he should have no right to complain if he had to travel back three hundred miles without having the honour of an interview but he trusted that this necessary breach of etiquette would be overlooked  the note produced the desired effect and an appointment was made for mr grey to call at kenrich lodge on the following morning  vivian as he entered the room took a rapid glance at its master mr cleveland was tall and distinguished with a fare which might have been a model for manly beauty he came forward to receive vivian with a newfoundland dog on one side and a large black greyhound on the other and the two animals after having elaborately examined the stranger divided between them the luxuries of the rug the reception which mr cleveland gave our hero was cold and constrained but it did not appear to be purposely uncivil and vivian flattered himself that his manner was not unusually stiff  i do not know whether i have the honour of addressing the son of mr horace grey said mr cleveland with a frowning countenance which was intended to be courteous  i have that honour  your father sir is a most amiable and able man i had the pleasure of his acquaintance when i was in london many years ago at a time when mr vivian grey was not entrusted i rather imagine with missions of importance although mr cleveland smiled when he said this his smile was anything but a gracious one the subdued satire of his keen eye burst out for an instant and he looked as if he would have said who is this yonker who is trespassing upon my retirement  vivian had unbidden seated himself by the side of mr clevelands library table and not knowing exactly how to proceed was employing himself by making a calculation whether there were more black than white spots on the body of the old newfoundland who was now apparently happily slumbering  well sir continued the newfoundlands master the nature of your communication i am fond of coming to the point  now this was precisely the thing which vivian had determined not to do and so he diplomatised in order to gain time in stating mr cleveland that the communication which i had to make was one of importance i beg to be understood that it was with reference merely to my opinion of its nature that that phrase was used and not as relative to the possible or allow me to say the probable opinion of mr cleveland  well sir said that gentleman with a somewhat disappointed air  as to the purport or nature of the communication it is said vivian with one of his sweetest cadences and looking up to mr clevelands face with an eye expressive of all kindness it is of a political nature  well sir again exclaimed cleveland looking very anxious and moving restlessly on his library chair  when we take into consideration mr cleveland the present aspect of the political world when we call to mind the present situation of the two great political parties you will not be surprised i feel confident when i mention that certain personages have thought that the season was at hand when a move might be made in the political world with very considerable effect  mr grey what am i to understand interrupted mr cleveland who began to suspect that the envoy was no greenhorn  i feel confident mr cleveland that i am doing very imperfect justice to the mission with which i am entrusted but sir you must be aware that the delicate nature of such disclosures and  mr grey i feel confident that you do not doubt my honour and as for the rest the world has i believe some foolish tales about me but believe me you shall be listened to with patience i am certain that whatever may be the communication mr vivian grey is a gentleman who will do its merits justice  and now vivian having succeeded in exciting clevelands curiosity and securing himself the certainty of a hearing and having also made a favourable impression dropped the diplomatist altogether and was explicit enough for a spartan  certain noblemen and gentlemen of eminence and influence hitherto considered as props of the  party are about to take a novel and decided course next session it is to obtain the aid and personal cooperation of mr cleveland that i am now in wales  mr grey i have promised to listen to you with patience you are too young a man to know much perhaps of the history of so insignificant a personage as myself otherwise you would have been aware that there is no subject in the world on which i am less inclined to converse than that of politics if i were entitled to take such a liberty i would recommend you to think of them as little as i do but enough of this who is the mover of the party  my lord courtown is a distinguished member of it  courtown courtown powerful enough but surely the good viscounts skull is not exactly the head for the chief of a cabal  there is my lord beaconsfield  powerful too but a dolt  well thought vivian it must out at last and so to it boldly and mr cleveland there is little fear that we may secure the great influence and tried talents of the marquess of carabas  the marquess of carabas almost shrieked mr cleveland as be started from his seat and paced the room with hurried steps and the greyhound and the newfoundland jumped up from the rug shook themselves growled and then imitated their master in promenading the apartment but with more dignified and stately paces the marquess of carabas now mr grey speak to me with the frankness which one gentleman should use to another is the marquess of carabas privy to this application  he himself proposed it  then he is baser than even i conceived mr grey i am a man spare of my speech to those with whom i am unacquainted and the world tails me a soured malicious man and yet when i think for a moment that one so young as you are endowed as i must suppose with no ordinary talents and actuated as i will believe with a pure and honourable spirit should be the dupe or tool or even present friend of such a creature as this perjured peer it gives me pang  mr cleveland said vivian i am grateful for your kindness and although we may probably part in a few hours never to meet again i will speak to you with the frankness which you have merited and to which i feel you are entitled i am not the dupe of the marquess of carabas i am not i trust the dupe or tool of any one whatever believe me sir there is that at work in england which taken at the tide may lead on to fortune i see this sir i a young man uncommitted in political principles unconnected in public life feeling some confidence i confess in my own abilities but desirous of availing myself at the same time of the powers of others thus situated i find myself working for the same end as my lord carabas and twenty other men of similar calibre mental and moral and sir am i to play the hermit in the drama of life because perchance my fellowactors may be sometimes fools and occasionally knaves if the marquess of carabas has done you the illservice which fame says he has your sweetest revenge will be to make him your tool your most perfect triumph to rise to power by his influence  i confess that i am desirous of finding in you the companion of my career your splendid talents have long commanded my admiration and as you have given me credit for something like good feeling i will say that my wish to find in you a colleague is greatly increased when i see that those splendid talents are even the least estimable points in mr clevelands character but sir perhaps all this time i am in error perhaps mr cleveland is as the world reports him no longer the ambitious being who once commanded the admiration of a listening senate perhaps convinced of the vanity of human wishes mr cleveland would rather devote his attention to the furtherance of the interests of his immediate circle and having schooled his intellect in the universities of two nations is probably content to pass the hours of his life in mediating in the quarrels of a country village  vivian ceased cleveland heard him with his head resting on both his arms he started at the last expression and something like a blush suffused his cheek but he did not reply at last he jumped up and rang the bell come mr grey said he i am in no humour for politics this morning you must not at any rate visit wales for nothing morris send down to the village for this gentlemans luggage even we cottagers have a bed for a friend mr grey come and i will introduce you to my wife     chapter ii   and vivian was now an inmate of kenrich lodge it would have been difficult to have conceived a life of more pure happiness than that which was apparently enjoyed by its gifted master a beautiful wife and lovely children and a romantic situation and an income sufficient not only for their own but for the wants of their necessitous neighbours what more could man wish answer me thou inexplicable myriad of sensations which the world calls human nature  three days passed over in delightful converse it was so long since cleveland had seen any one fresh from the former scenes of his life that the company of any one would have been agreeable but here was a companion who knew every one everything full of wit and anecdote and literature and fashion and then so engaging in his manners and with such a winning voice  the heart of cleveland relented his stern manner gave way all his former warm and generous feeling gained the ascendant he was in turn amusing communicative and engaging finding that he could please another he began to be pleased himself the nature of the business upon which vivian was his guest rendered confidence necessary confidence begets kindness in a few days vivian necessarily became more acquainted with mr clevelands disposition and situation than if they had been acquainted for as many years in short       they talked with open heart and tongue      affectionate and true      a pair of friends  vivian for some time dwelt upon everything but the immediate subject of his mission but when after the experience of a few days their hearts were open to each other and they had mutually begun to discover that there was a most astonishing similarity in their principles their tastes their feelings then the magician poured forth his incantation and raised the oncelaid ghost of clevelands ambition the recluse agreed to take the lead of the carabas party he was to leave wales immediately and resign his place in return for which the nephew of lord courtown was immediately to give up in his favour an office of considerable emolument and having thus provided some certainty for his family frederick cleveland prepared himself to combat for a more important office     chapter iii   is mr cleveland handsome asked mrs felix lorraine of vivian immediately on his return and what colour are his eyes  upon my honour i have not the least recollection of ever looking at them but i believe he is not blind  how foolish you are now tell me pray point de moquerie is he amusing  what does mrs felix lorraine mean by amusing asked vivian  oh you always tease me with your definitions go away i will quarrel with you  bythebye mrs felix lorraine how is colonel delmington  vivian redeemed his pledge mr cleveland arrived it was the wish of the marquess if possible not to meet his old friend till dinnertime he thought that surrounded by his guests certain awkward senatorial reminiscences might be got over but unfortunately mr cleveland arrived about an hour before dinner and as it was a cold autumnal day most of the visitors who were staying at château desir were assembled in the drawingroom the marquess sallied forward to receive his guest with a most dignified countenance and a most aristocratic step but before he got halfway his coronation pace degenerated into a strut and then into a shamble and with an awkward and confused countenance half impudent and half flinching he held forward his left hand to his newlyarrived visitor mr cleveland looked terrifically courteous and amiably arrogant he greeted the marquess with a smile at once gracious and grim and looked something like goliath as you see the philistine depicted in some old german painting looking down upon the pigmy fighting men of israel  as is generally the custom when there is a great deal to be arranged and many points to be settled days flew over and very little of the future system of the party was matured vivian made one or two ineffectual struggles to bring the marquess to a businesslike habit of mind but his lordship never dared to trust himself alone with cleveland and indeed almost lost the power of speech when in presence of the future leader of his party so in the morning the marquess played off the two lords and sir berdmore against his former friend and then to compensate for not meeting mr cleveland in the morning he was particularly courteous to him at dinnertime and asked him always how he liked his ride and invariably took wine with him as for the rest of the day he had particularly requested his faithful counsellor mrs felix lorraine for gods sake to take this man off his shoulders and so that lady with her usual kindness and merely to oblige his lordship was good enough to patronise mr cleveland and on the fourth day was taking a moonlit walk with him  mr cleveland had now been ten days at château desir and was to take his departure the next morning for wales in order to arrange everything for his immediate settlement in the metropolis every point of importance was postponed until their meeting in london mr cleveland only agreed to take the lead of the party in the commons and received the personal pledge of lord courtown as to the promised office  it was a september day and to escape from the excessive heat of the sun and at the same time to enjoy the freshness of the air vivian was writing his letters in the conservatory which opened into one of the drawingrooms the numerous party which then honoured the château with their presence were out as he conceived on a picnic excursion to the elfins well a beautiful spot about ten miles off and among the adventurers were as he imagined mrs felix lorraine and mr cleveland  vivian was rather surprised at hearing voices in the adjoining room and he was still more so when on looking round he found that the sounds proceeded from the very two individuals whom he thought were far away some tall american plants concealed him from their view but he observed all that passed distinctly and a singular scene it was mrs felix lorraine was on her knees at the feet of mr cleveland her countenance indicated the most contrary passions contending as it were for mastery supplication anger and shall i call it love her companions countenance was hid but it was evident that it was not wreathed with smiles there were a few hurried sentences uttered and then both quitted the room at different doors the lady in despair and the gentleman in disgust     chapter iv   and now château desir was almost deserted mrs million continued her progress northward the courtowns and the beaconsfields and the scropes quitted immediately after mr cleveland and when the families that form the material of the visiting corps retire the nameless nothings that are always lounging about the country mansions of the great such as artists tourists authors and other live stock soon disappear mr vivian grey agreed to stay another fortnight at the particular request of the marquess  very few days had passed ere vivian was exceedingly struck at the decided change which suddenly took place in his lordships general demeanour towards him  the marquess grew reserved and uncommunicative scarcely mentioning the great business which had previously been the sole subject of his conversation but to find fault with some arrangement and exhibiting whenever his name was mentioned a marked acrimony against mr cleveland this rapid change alarmed as much as it astonished vivian and he mentioned his feelings and observations to mrs felix lorraine that lady agreed with him that something certainly was wrong but could not unfortunately afford him any clue to the mystery she expressed the liveliest solicitude that any misunderstanding should be put an end to and offered her services for that purpose  in spite however of her wellexpressed anxiety vivian had his own ideas on the subject and determined to unravel the affair he had recourse to the marchioness  i hope your ladyship is well today i had a letter from count caumont this morning he tells me that he has got the prettiest poodle from paris that you can possibly conceive waltzes like an angel and acts proverbs on its hind feet  her ladyships eyes glistened with admiration  i have told caumont to send it me down immediately and i shall then have the pleasure of presenting it to your ladyship  her ladyships eyes sparkled with delight  i think continued vivian i shall take a ride today bythebye how is the marquess he seems in low spirits lately  oh mr grey i do not know what you have done to him said her ladyship settling at least a dozen bracelets but but  but what  he thinks he thinks  thinks what dear lady  that you have entered into a combination mr grey  entered into a combination  yes mr grey a conspiracy a conspiracy against the marquess with mr cleveland he thinks that you have made him serve your purpose and now you are going to get rid of him  well that is excellent and what else does he think  he thinks you talk too loud said the marchioness still working at her bracelets  well that is shockingly vulgar allow me to recommend your ladyship to alter the order of those bracelets and place the blue and silver against the maroon you may depend upon it that is the true vienna order and what else dues the marquess say  he thinks you are generally too authoritative not that i think so mr grey i am sure your conduct to me has been most courteous the blue and silver next to the maroon did you say yes certainly it does look better i have no doubt the marquess is quite wrong and i dare say you will set things right immediately you will remember the pretty poodle mr grey and you will not tell the marquess i mentioned anything  oh certainly not i will give orders for them to book an inside place for the poodle and send him down by the coach immediately i must be off now remember the blue and silver next to the maroon good morning to your ladyship  mrs felix lorraine i am your most obedient slave said vivian grey as he met that lady on the landingplace i can see no reason why i should not drive you this bright day to the elfins well we have long had an engagement to go there  the lady smiled a gracious assent the pony phaeton was immediately ordered  how pleasant lady courtown and i used to discourse about martingales i think i invented one did not i pray mrs felix lorraine can you tell me what a martingale is for upon my honour i have forgotten or never knew  if you found a martingale for the mother vivian it had been well if you had found a curb for the daughter poor cynthia i had intended once to advise the marchioness to interfere but one forgets these things  one does o mrs felix exclaimed vivian i told your admirable story of the leyden professor to mrs cleveland it is universally agreed to be the best ghoststory extant i think you said you knew the professor  well i have seen him often and heard the story from his own lips and as i mentioned before far from being superstitious he was an esprit fort do you know mr grey i have such an interesting packet from germany today from my cousin baron rodenstein but i must keep all the stories for the evening come to my boudoir and i will read them to you there is one tale which i am sure will make a convert even of you it happened to rodenstein himself and within these three months added the lady in a serious tone the rodensteins are a singular family my mother was a rodenstein do you think this beautiful said mrs felix showing vivian a small miniature which was attached to a chain round her neck it was the portrait of a youth habited in the costume of a german student his rich brown hair was flowing over his shoulders and his dark blue eyes beamed with such a look of mysterious inspiration that they might have befitted a young prophet  very very beautiful  tis max max rodenstein said the lady with a faltering voice he was killed at leipsic at the head of a band of his friends and fellowstudents o mr grey this is a fair work of art but if you had but seen the prototype you would have gazed on this as on a dim and washedout drawing there was one portrait indeed which did him more justice but then that portrait was not the production of mortal pencil  vivian looked at his companion with a somewhat astonished air but mrs felix lorraines countenance was as little indicative of jesting as that of the young student whose miniature rested on her bosom  did you say not the production of a mortal hand mrs felix lorraine  i am afraid i shall weary you with my stories but the one i am about to tell you is so well evidenced that i think even mr vivian grey will hear it without a sneer  a sneer o ladylove do i ever sneer  max rodenstein was the glory of his house a being so beautiful in body and in soul you cannot imagine and i will not attempt to describe this miniature has given you some faint idea of his image and yet this is only the copy of a copy the only wish of the baroness rodenstein which never could be accomplished was the possession of a portrait of her youngest son for no consideration could induce max to allow his likeness to be taken his old nurse had always told him that the moment his portrait was taken he would die the condition upon which such a beautiful being was allowed to remain in the world was she always said that his beauty should not be imitated about three months before the battle of leipsic when max was absent at the university which was nearly four hundred miles from rodenstein castle there arrived one morning a large case directed to the baroness on opening it it was found to contain a picture the portrait of her son the colouring was so vivid the general execution so miraculous that for some moments they forgot to wonder at the incident in their admiration of the work of art in one corner of the picture in small characters yet fresh was an inscription which on examining they found consisted of these words painted last night now lady thou hast thy wish my aunt sank into the barons arms  in silence and in trembling the wonderful portrait was suspended over the fireplace of my aunts favourite apartment the next day they received letters from max he was quite well but mentioned nothing of the mysterious painting  three months afterwards as a lady was sitting alone in the baronesss room and gazing on the portrait of him she loved right dearly she suddenly started from her seat and would have shrieked had not an indefinable sensation prevented her the eyes of the portrait moved the lady stood leaning on a chair pale and trembling like an aspen but gazing steadfastly on the animated portrait it was no illusion of a heated fancy again the eyelids trembled there was a melancholy smile and then they closed the clock of rodenstein castle struck three between astonishment and fear the lady was tearless three days afterwards came the news of the battle of leipsic and at the very moment that the eyes of the portrait closed max rodenstein had been pierced by a polish lancer  and who was this wonderful lady the witness of this wonderful incident asked vivian  that lady was myself  there was something so singular in the tone of mrs felix lorraines voice and so peculiar in the expression of her countenance as she uttered these words that the jest died on vivians tongue and for want of something better to do he lashed the little ponies which were already scampering at their full speed  the road to the elfins well ran through the wildest parts of the park and after an hour and a halfs drive they reached the fairy spot it was a beautiful and pellucid spring that bubbled up in a small wild dell which nurtured by the flowing stream was singularly fresh and green above the spring had been erected a gothic arch of grey stone round which grew a few fine birchtrees in short nature had intended the spot for picnics there was fine water and an interesting tradition and as the parties always bring or always should bring a trained punster champagne and cold pasties what more ought nature to have provided  come mrs lorraine i will tie gypsey to this ash and then you and i will rest ourselves beneath these birchtrees just where the fairies dance  oh delightful  now truly we should have some book of beautiful poetry to while away an hour you will blame me for not bringing one do not i would sooner listen to your voice and indeed there is a subject on which i wish to ask your particular advice  is there  i have been thinking that this is a somewhat rash step of the marquess this throwing himself into the arms of his former bitterest enemy cleveland  you really think so  why mrs lorraine does it appear to you to be the most prudent course of action which could have been conceived  certainly not  you agree with me then that there is if not cause for regret at this engagement at least for reflection on its probable consequences  i quite agree with you  i know you do i have had some conversation with the marquess upon this subject this very morning  have you eagerly exclaimed the lady and she looked pale and breathed short  ay and he tells me you have made some very sensible observations on the subject tis pity they were not made before mr cleveland left the mischief might then have been prevented  i certainly have made some observations  and very kind of you what a blessing for the marquess to have such a friend  i spoke to him said mrs felix with a more assured tone in much the same spirit as you have been addressing me it does indeed seem a most imprudent act and i thought it my duty to tell him so  ay no doubt but how came you lady fair to imagine that i was also a person to be dreaded by his lordship i vivian grey  did i say you asked the lady pale as death  did you not mrs felix lorraine have you not regardless of my interests in the most unwarrantable and unjustifiable manner have you not to gratify some private pique which you entertain against mr cleveland have you not i ask you poisoned the marquess mind against one who never did aught to you but what was kind and honourable  i have been imprudent i confess it i have spoken somewhat loosely  now listen to me once more and vivian grasped her hand what has passed between you and mr cleveland it is not for me to inquire i give you my word of honour that he never even mentioned your name to me i can scarcely understand how any man could have incurred the deadly hatred which you appear to entertain for him i repeat i can contemplate no situation in which you could be placed together which would justify such behaviour it could not be justified even if he had spurned you whilekneeling at his feet  mrs felix lorraine shrieked and fainted a sprinkling from the fairy stream soon recovered her spare me spare me she faintly cried say nothing of what you have seen  mrs lorraine i have no wish i have spoken thus explicitly that we may not again misunderstand each other i have spoken thus explicitly i say that i may not be under the necessity of speaking again for if i speak again it must not be to mrs felix lorraine there is my hand and now let the elfins well be blotted out of our memories  vivian drove rapidly home and endeavoured to talk in his usual tone and with his usual spirit but his companion could not be excited once ay twice she pressed his hand and as he assisted her from the phaeton she murmured something like a blessing she ran upstairs immediately vivian had to give some directions about the ponies gipsey was ill or fanny had a cold or something of the kind and so he was detained for about a quarter of an hour before the house speaking most learnedly to grooms and consulting on cases with a skilled gravity worthy of professor coleman  when he entered the house he found the luncheon prepared and mrs felix pressed him earnestly to take some refreshment he was indeed wearied and agreed to take a glass of hock and seltzer  let me mix it for you said mrs felix do you like sugar  tired with his drive vivian grey was leaning on the mantelpiece with his eyes vacantly gazing on the lookingglass which rested on the marble slab it was by pure accident that reflected in the mirror he distinctly beheld mrs felix lorraine open a small silver box and throw some powder into the tumbler which she was preparing for him she was leaning down with her back almost turned to the glass but still vivian saw it distinctly a sickness came over him and ere he could recover himself his hebe tapped him on the shoulder  here drink drink while it is effervescent  i cannot drink said vivian i am not thirsty i am too hot i am anything  how foolish you are it will be quite spoiled  no no the dog shall have it here fidele you look thirsty enough come here  mr grey i do not mix tumblers for dogs said the lady rather agitated if you will not take it and she held it once more before him here it goes for ever so saying she emptied the tumbler into a large globe of glass in which some gold and silver fish were swimming their endless rounds     chapter v   this last specimen of mrs felix lorraine was somewhat too much even for the steeled nerves of vivian grey and he sought his chamber for relief  is it possible can i believe my senses or has some demon as we read of in old tales mocked me in a magic mirror i can believe anything oh my heart is very sick i once imagined that i was using this woman for my purpose is it possible that aught of good can come to one who is forced to make use of such evil instruments as these a horrible thought sometimes comes over my spirit i fancy that in this mysterious foreigner that in this woman i have met a kind of double of myself the same wonderful knowledge of the human mind the same sweetness of voice the same miraculous management which has brought us both under the same roof yet do i find her the most abandoned of all beings a creature guilty of that which even in this guilty age i thought was obsolete and is it possible that i am like her that i can resemble her that even the indefinite shadow of my most unhallowed thought can for a moment be as vile as her righteousness o god the system of my existence seems to stop i cannot breathe he flung himself upon his bed and felt for a moment as if he had quaffed the poisoned draught so lately offered  it is not so it cannot be so it shall not be so in seeking the marquess i was unquestionably impelled by a mere feeling of selfinterest but i have advised him to no course of action in which his welfare is not equally consulted with my own indeed if not principle interest would make me act faithfully towards him for my fortunes are bound up in his but am i entitled i who can lose nothing am i entitled to play with other mens fortunes am i all this time deceiving myself with some wretched sophistry am i then an intellectual don juan reckless of human minds as he was of human bodies a spiritual libertine but why this wild declamation whatever i have done it is too late to recede even this very moment delay is destruction for now it is not a question as to the ultimate prosperity of our worldly prospects but the immediate safety of our very bodies poison o god o god away with all fear all repentance all thought of past all reckoning of future if i be the juan that i fancied myself then heaven be praised i have a confidant in all my troubles the most faithful of counsellors the craftiest of valets a leporello often tried and never found wanting my own good mind and now thou female fiend the battle is to the strongest and i see right well that the struggle between two such spirits will be a long and a fearful one woe i say to the vanquished you must be dealt with by arts which even yourself cannot conceive your boasted knowledge of human nature shall not again stand you in stead for mark me from henceforward vivian greys conduct towards you shall have no precedent in human nature  as vivian reentered the drawingroom he met a servant carrying in the globe of gold and silver fishes  what still in your pelisse mrs lorraine said vivian nay i hardly wonder at it for surely a prettier pelisse never yet fitted prettier form you have certainly a most admirable taste in dress and this the more surprises me for it is generally your plain personage that is the most recherché in frills and fans and flounces  the lady smiled  oh bythebye continued her companion i have a letter from cleveland this morning i wonder how any misunderstanding could possibly have existed between you for he speaks of you in such terms  what does he say was the quick question  oh what does he say drawled out vivian and he yawned and was most provokingly uncommunicative  come come mr grey do tell me  oh tell you certainly come let us walk together in the conservatory so saying he took the lady by the hand and they left the room  and now for the letter mr grey  ay now for the letter and vivian slowly drew an epistle from his pocket and therefrom read some exceedingly sweet passages which made mrs felix lorraines very heartblood tingle considering that vivian grey had never in his life received a single letter from mr cleveland this was tolerably well but he was always an admirable improvisatore i am sure that when cleveland comes to town everything will be explained i am sure at least that it will not be my fault if you are not the best friends i am heroic in saying all this mrs lorraine there was a time when and here vivian seemed so agitated that he could scarcely proceed there was a time when i could have called that man liar who would have prophesied that vivian grey could have assisted another in riveting the affections of mrs felix lorraine but enough of this i am a weak inexperienced boy and misinterpret perhaps that which is merely the compassionate kindness natural to all women into a feeling of a higher nature but i must learn to contain myself i really do feel quite ashamed of my behaviour about the tumbler today to act with such unwarrantable unkindness merely because i had remembered that you once performed the same kind office for colonel delmington was indeed too bad  colonel delmington is a vain emptyheaded fool do not think of him my dear mr grey said mrs felix with a countenance beaming with smiles  well i will not and i will try to behave like a man like a man of the world i should say but indeed you must excuse the warm feelings of a youth and truly when i call to mind the first days of our acquaintance and then remember that our moonlit walks are gone for ever and that our  nay do not believe so my dear vivian believe me as i ever shall be your friend your  i will i will my dear my own amalia     chapter vi   it was an autumnal night the wind was capricious and changeable as a petted beauty or an italian greyhound or a shot silk now the breeze blew so fresh that the white clouds dashed along the sky as if they bore a band of witches too late for their sabbath meeting or some other mischief and now lulled and soft as the breath of a slumbering infant you might almost have fancied it midsummer eve and the bright moon with her starry court reigned undisturbed in the light blue sky vivian grey was leaning against an old beechtree in the most secluded part of the park and was gazing on the moon  o thou bright moon thou object of my first love thou shalt not escape an invocation although perchance at this very moment some varlet sonnetteer is prating of the boy endymion and thy silver bow here to thee queen of the night in whatever name thou most delightest or bendis as they hailed thee in rugged thrace or bubastis as they howled to thee in mysterious egypt or dian as they sacrificed to thee in gorgeous rome or artemis as they sighed to thee on the bright plains of ever glorious greece why is it that all men gaze on thee why is it that all men love thee why is it that all men worship thee  shine on shine on sultana of the soul the passions are thy eunuch slaves ambition gazes on thee and his burning brow is cooled and his fitful pulse is calm grief wanders in her moonlit walk and sheds no tear and when thy crescent smiles the lustre of joys revelling eye is dusked quick anger in thy light forgets revenge and even doveeyed hope feeds on no future joys when gazing on the miracle of thy beauty  shine on shine on although a pure virgin thou art the mighty mother of all abstraction the eye of the weary peasant returning from his daily toil and the rapt gaze of the inspired poet are alike fixed on thee thou stillest the roar of marching armies and who can doubt thy influence oer the waves who has witnessed the wide atlantic sleeping under thy silver beam  shine on shine on they say thou art earths satellite yet when i gaze on thee my thoughts are not of thy suzerain they teach us that thy power is a fable and that thy divinity is a dream oh thou bright queen i will be no traitor to thy sweet authority and verily i will not believe that thy influence oer our hearts is at this moment less potent than when we worshipped in thy glittering fane of ephesus or trembled at the dark horrors of thine arician rites then hail to thee queen of the night hail to thee diana triformis cynthia orthia taurica ever mighty ever lovely ever holy hail hail hail  were i a metaphysician i would tell you why vivian grey had been gazing two hours on the moon for i could then present you with a most logical programme of the march of his ideas since he whispered his last honied speech in the ear of mrs felix lorraine at dinnertime until this very moment when he did not even remember that such a being as mrs felix lorraine breathed glory to the metaphysicians allperfect theory when they can tell me why at a bright banquet the thought of death has flashed across my mind who fear not death when they can tell me why at the burial of my beloved friend when my very heartstrings seemed bursting my sorrow has been mocked by the involuntary remembrance of ludicrous adventures and grotesque tales when they can tell me why in a dark mountain pass i have thought of an absent womans eyes or why when in the very act of squeezing the third lime into a beaker of burgundy cup my memory hath been of lean apothecaries and their vile drugs why then i say again glory to the metaphysicians allperfect theory and fare you well sweet world and you my merry masters whom perhaps i have studied somewhat too cunningly nosce teipsum shall be my motto i will doff my travelling cap and on with the monks cowl  there are mysterious moments in some mens lives when the faces of human beings are very agony to them and when the sound of the human voice is jarring as discordant music these fits are not the consequence of violent or contending passions they grow not out of sorrow or joy or hope or fear or hatred or despair for in the hour of affliction the tones of our fellowcreatures are ravishing as the most delicate lute and in the flush moment of joy where is the smiler who loves not a witness to his revelry or a listener to his good fortune fear makes us feel our humanity and then we fly to men and hope is the parent of kindness the misanthrope and the reckless are neither agitated nor agonised it is in these moments that men find in nature that congeniality of spirit which they seek for in vain in their own species it is in these moments that we sit by the side of a waterfall and listen to its music the livelong day it is in these moments that men gaze upon the moon it is in these moments that nature becomes our egeria and refreshed and renovated by this beautiful communion we return to the world better enabled to fight our parts in the hot war of passions to perform the great duties for which man appeared to have been created to love to hate to slander and to slay  it was past midnight and vivian was at a considerable distance from the château he proposed entering by a side door which led into the billiardroom and from thence crossing the long gallery he could easily reach his apartment without disturbing any of the household his way led through the little gate at which he had parted with mrs felix lorraine on the first day of their meeting  as he softly opened the door which led into the long gallery he found he was not alone leaning against one of the casements was a female her profile was to vivian as he entered and the moon which shone bright through the window lit up a countenance which he might be excused for not immediately recognising as that of mrs felix lorraine she was gazing steadfastly but her eye did not seem fixed upon any particular object her features appeared convulsed but their contortions were not momentary and pale as death a hideous grin seemed chiselled on her idiot countenance  vivian scarcely knew whether to stay or to retire desirous not to disturb her he determined not even to breathe and as is generally the case his very exertions to be silent made him nervous and to save himself from being stifled he coughed  mrs lorraine immediately started and stared wildly around her and when her eye caught vivians there was a sound in her throat something like the deathrattle  who are you she eagerly asked  a friend and vivian grey  how came you here and she rushed forward and wildly seized his hand and then she muttered to herself tis flesh  i have been playing i fear the mooncalf tonight and find that though i am a late watcher i am not a solitary one  mrs lorraine stared earnestly at him and then she endeavoured to assume her usual expression of countenance but the effort was too much for her she dropped vivians arm and buried her face in her own hands vivian was retiring when she again looked up where are you going she asked with a quick voice  to sleep as i would advise all tis much past midnight  you say not the truth the brightness of your eye belies the sentence of your tongue you are not for sleep  pardon me dear mrs lorraine i really have been yawning for the last hour said vivian and he moved on  you are speaking to one who takes her answer from the eye which does not deceive and from the speaking lineaments of the face which are truths witnesses keep your voice for those who can credit mans words you will go then what are you afraid of a woman because tis past midnight and you are in an old gallery  fear mrs lorraine is not a word in my vocabulary  the words in your vocabulary are few boy as are the years of your age he who sent you here this night sent you here not to slumber come hither and she led vivian to the window what see you  i see nature at rest mrs lorraine and i would fain follow the example of beasts birds and fishes  yet gaze upon this scene one second see the distant hills how beautifully their rich covering is tinted with the moonbeam these nearer firtrees how radiantly their black skeleton forms are tipped with silver and the old and thickly foliaged oaks bathed in light and the purple lake reflecting in its lustrous bosom another heaven la it not a fair scene  beautiful most beautiful  yet vivian where is the being for whom all this beauty exists where is your mighty creature man the peasant on his rough couch enjoys perchance slaverys only servicemoney sweet sleep or waking in the night curses at the same time his lot and his lord and that lord is restless on some downy couch his night thoughts not of this sheeny lake and this bright moon but of some miserable creation of mans artifice some mighty nothing which nature knows not of some offspring of her bastard child society why then is nature loveliest when man looks not on her for whom then vivian grey is this scene so fair  for poets lady for philosophers for all those superior spirits who require some relaxation from the worlds toils spirits who only commingle with humanity on the condition that they may sometimes commune with nature  superior spirits say you and here they paced the gallery when valerian first lord carabas raised this fair castle when profuse for his posterity all the genius of italian art and italian artists was lavished on this english palace when the stuffs and statues the marbles and the mirrors the tapestry and the carvings and the paintings of genoa and florence and venice and padua and vicenza were obtained by him at miraculous cost and with still more miraculous toil what think you would have been his sensations if while his soul was revelling in the futurity of his descendants keeping their state in this splendid pile some wizard had foretold to him that ere three centuries could elapse the fortunes of his mighty family would be the sport of two individuals one of them a foreigner unconnected in blood or connected only in hatred and the other a young adventurer alike unconnected with his race in blood or in love a being ruling all things by the power of his own genius and reckless of all consequences save his own prosperity if the future had been revealed to my great ancestor the lord valerian think you vivian grey that you and i should be walking in this long gallery  really mrs lorraine i have been so interested in discovering what people think in the nineteenth century that i have had but little time to speculate on the possible opinions of an old gentleman who flourished in the sixteenth  you may sneer sir but i ask you if there are spirits so superior to that of the slumbering lord of this castle as those of vivian grey and amelia lorraine why may there not be spirits proportionately superior to our own  if you are keeping me from my bed mrs lorraine merely to lecture my conceit by proving that there are in this world wiser heads than that of vivian grey on my honour you are giving yourself a great deal of unnecessary trouble  you will misunderstand me then you wilful boy  nay lady i will not affect to misunderstand your meaning but i recognise you know full well no intermediate essence between my own good soul and that ineffable and omnipotent spirit in whose existence philosophers and priests alike agree  omnipotent and ineffable essence leave such words to scholars and to schoolboys and think you that such indefinite nothings such unmeaning abstractions can influence beings whose veins are full of blood bubbling like this and here she grasped vivian with a feverish hand omnipotent and ineffable essence oh i have lived in a land where every mountain and every stream and every wood and every ruin has its legend and its peculiar spirit a land in whose dark forests the midnight hunter with his spiritshout scares the slumbers of the trembling serf a land from whose winding rivers the fairhaired undine welcomes the belated traveller to her fond and fatal embrace and you talk to me of omnipotent and ineffable essence miserable mocker it is not true vivian grey you are but echoing the worlds deceit and even at this hour of the night you dare not speak as you do think you worship no omnipotent and ineffable essence you believe in no omnipotent and ineffable essence shrined in this secret chamber of your soul there is an image before which you bow down in adoration and that image is yourself and truly when i do gaze upon your radiant eyes and here the ladys tone became more terrestrial and truly when i do look upon your luxuriant curls and here the ladys small white hand played like lightning through vivians dark hair and truly when i do remember the beauty of your allperfect form i cannot deem your selfworship a false idolatry and here the ladys arms were locked round vivians neck and her head rested on his bosom  oh amalia it would lie far better for you to rest here than to think of that of which the knowledge is vanity  vanity shrieked mrs lorraine and she violently loosened her embrace and extricated herself from the arm which rather in courtesy than in kindness had been wound round her delicate waist vanity oh if you knew but what i know oh if you had but seen what i have seen and here her voice failed her and she stood motionless in the moonshine with averted head and outstretched arms  amalia this is madness for heavens sake calm yourself  calm myself yes it is madness very very madness tis the madness of the fascinated bird tis the madness of the murderer who is voluntarily broken on the wheel tis the madness of the fawn that gazes with adoration on the lurid glare of the anacondas eye tis the madness of woman who flies to the arms of her fate and here she sprang like a tigress round vivians neck her long light hair bursting from its bands and clustering down her shoulders  and here was vivian grey at past midnight in this old gallery with this wild woman clinging round his neck the figures in the ancient tapestry looked living in the moon and immediately opposite him was one compartment of some old mythological tale in which were represented grinning in grim majesty the fates  the wind now rose again and the clouds which had vanished began to reassemble in the heavens as the blue sky was gradually covering the gigantic figures of clotho lachesis and atropos became as gradually dimmer and dimmer and the grasp of vivians fearful burden looser and looser at last the moon was entirely hid the figures of the fates vanished and mrs felix lorraine sank lifeless into his arms  vivian groped his way with difficulty to the nearest window the very one at which she was leaning when he first entered the gallery he played with her wild curls he whispered to her in a voice sweeter than the sweetest serenade but she only raised her eyes from his breast and stared wildly at him and then clung round his neck with if possible a tighter grasp  for nearly half an hour did vivian stand leaning against the window with his mystic and motionless companion at length the wind again fell there was a break in the sky and a single star appeared in the midst of the clouds surrounded with a little heaven of azure  see there see there the lady cried and then she unlocked her arms what would you give vivian grey to read that star  am i more interested in that star amalia than in any other of the bright host asked vivian with a serious tone for he thought it necessary to humour his companion  are you not is it not the star of your destiny  are you learned in all the learning of the chaldeans too  oh no no no slowly murmured mrs lorraine and then she started but vivian seized her arms and prevented her from again clasping his neck  i must keep these pretty hands close prisoners he said smiling unless you promise to behave with more moderation come my amalia you shall be my instructress why am i so interested in this brilliant star and holding her hands in one of his he wound his arm round her waist and whispered her such words as he thought might calm her troubled spirit the wildness of her eyes gradually gave way at length she raised them to vivian with a look of meek tenderness and her head sank upon his breast  it shines it shines it shines vivian she softly whispered glory to thee and woe to me nay you need not hold my hands i will not harm you i cannot tis no use o vivian when we first met how little did i know to whom i pledged myself  amalia forget these wild fancies estrange yourself from the wild belief which has exercised so baneful an influence not only over your mind but over the very soul of the land from which you come recognise in me only your friend and leave the other world to those who value it more or more deserve it does not this fair earth contain sufficient of interest and enjoyment  o vivian you speak with a sweet voice but with a sceptics spirit you know not what i know  tell me then my amalia let me share your secrets provided they be your sorrows  almost within this hour and in this park there has happened that which and here her voice died and she looked fearfully round her  nay fear not no one can harm you here no one shall harm you rest upon me and tell me all thy grief  i dare not i cannot tell you  nay thou shalt  i cannot speak your eye scares me are you mocking me i cannot speak if you look so at me  i will not look on you i will gaze on yonder star now speak on  o vivian there is a custom in my native land the world calls it an unhallowed one you in your proud spirit will call it a vain one but you would not deem it vain if you were the woman now resting on your bosom at certain hours of particular nights and with peculiar ceremonies which i need not here mention we do believe that in a lake or other standing water fate reveals itself to the solitary votary o vivian i have been too long a searcher after this fearful science and this very night agitated in spirit i sought yon water the wind was in the right direction and everything concurred in favouring a propitious divination i knelt down to gaze on the lake i had always been accustomed to view my own figure performing some future action or engaged in some future scene of my life i gazed but i saw nothing but a brilliant star i looked up into the heavens but the star was not there and the clouds were driving quick across the sky more than usually agitated by this singular occurrence i gazed once more and just at the moment when with breathless and fearful expectation i waited the revelation of my immediate destiny there flitted a figure across the water it was there only for the breathing of u second and as it passed it mocked me here mrs lorraine writhed in vivians arms her features were moulded in the same unnatural expression as when he first entered the gallery and the hideous grin was again sculptured on her countenance her whole frame was in such a state of agitation that she rose up and down in vivians arms and it was only with the exertions of his whole strength that he could retain her  why amalia this this was nothing your own figure  no not my own it was yours  uttering a piercing shriek which echoed through the winding gallery she swooned  vivian gazed on her in a state of momentary stupefaction for the extraordinary scene had begun to influence his own nerves and now he heard the tread of distant feet and a light shone through the keyhole of the nearest door the fearful shriek had alarmed some of the household what was to be done in desperation vivian caught the lady up in his arms and dashing out of an opposite door bore her to her chamber     chapter vii   what is this chapter to be about come i am inclined to be courteous you shall choose the subject of it what shall it be sentiment or scandal a lovescene or a lay sermon you will not choose then we must open the note which vivian in the morning found on his pillow  did you hear the horrid shriek last night it must have disturbed every one i think it must have been one of the south american birds which captain tropic gave the marchioness do not they sometimes favour the world with these nocturnal shriekings is not there a passage in spix apropos to this a  did you hear the shriek last night mr grey asked the marchioness as vivian entered the breakfastroom  oh yes mr grey did you hear the shriek asked miss graves  who did not  what could it be said the marchioness  what could it be said miss graves  what should it be a cat in a gutter or a sick cow or a toad dying to be devoured miss graves  always snub toadeys and led captains it is only your greenhorns who endeavour to make their way by fawning and cringing to every member of the establishment it is a miserable mistake no one likes his dependants to be treated with respect for such treatment affords an unpleasant contrast to his own conduct besides it makes the toadeys blood unruly there are three persons mind you to be attended to my lord or my lady as the case may be usually the latter the pet daughter and the pet dog i throw out these hints en passant for my principal objects in writing this work are to amuse myself and to instruct society in some future hook probably the twentieth or twentyfifth when the plot logins to wear threadbare and we can afford a digression i may give a chapter on domestic tactics  my dear marchioness continued vivian see there i have kept my promise there is your bracelet how is julie today  poor dear i hope she is better  oh yes poor julie i think she is better  i do not know that miss graves said her ladyship somewhat tartly not at all approving of a toadey thinking i am afraid that scream last night must have disturbed her o dear mr grey i am afraid she will be ill again  miss graves looked mournful and lifted up her eyes and hands to heaven but did not dare to speak this time  i thought she looked a little heavy about the eyes this morning said the marchioness apparently very agitated and i have heard from eglamour this post he is not well too i think everybody is ill now he has caught a fever going to see the ruins of paestum i wonder why people go to see ruins  i wonder indeed said miss graves i never could see anything in a ruin  o mr grey continued the marchioness i really am afraid julie is going to be very ill  let miss graves pull her tail and give her a little mustard seed she will be better tomorrow  remember that miss graves  oh yes my lady  mrs felix said the marchioness as that lady entered the room you are late today i always reckon upon you as a supporter of an early breakfast at desir  i have been half round the park  did you hear the scream mrs felix  do you know what it was marchioness  no do you  see the reward of early rising and a walk before breakfast it was one of your new american birds and it has half torn down your aviary  one of the new americans o the naughty thing and has it broken the new fancy wirework  here a little oddlooking snuffy old man with a brown scratch wig who had been very busily employed the whole breakfasttime with a cold game pie the bones of which vivian observed him most scientifically pick and polish laid down his knife and fork and addressed the marchioness with an air of great interest  pray will your ladyship have the goodness to inform me what bird this is  the marchioness looked astounded at any one presuming to ask her a question and then she drawled mr grey you know everything tell this gentleman what some bird is  now this gentleman was mr mackaw the most celebrated ornithologist extant and who had written a treatise on brazilian parroquets in three volumes folio he had arrived late at the château the preceding night and although he had the honour of presenting his letter of introduction to the marquess this morning was the first time he had been seen by any of the party present who were of course profoundly ignorant of his character  oh we were talking of some south american bird given to the marchioness by the famous captain tropic you know him perhaps bolivars brotherinlaw or aidedecamp or something of that kind and which screams so dreadfully at night that the whole family is disturbed the chowchowtow it is called is not it mrs lorraine  the chowchowtow said mr mackaw i dont know it by that name  do not you i dare say we shall find an account of it in spix however said vivian rising and taking a volume from the bookcase ay here it is i will read it to you  the chowchowtow is about five feet seven inches in height from the point of the bill to the extremity of the claws its plumage is of a dingy yellowish white its form is elegant and in its movements and action a certain pleasing and graceful dignity is observable but its head is by no means worthy of the rest of its frame and the expression of its eye is indicative of the cunning and treachery of its character the habits of this bird are peculiar occasionally most easily domesticated it is apparently sensible of the slightest kindness but its regard cannot be depended upon and for the slightest inducement or with the least irritation it will fly at its feeder at other times it seeks perfect solitude and can only be captured with the utmost skill and perseverance it generally feeds three times a day but its appetite is not rapacious it sleeps little is usually on the wing at sunrise and proves that it slumbers but little in the night by its nocturnal and thrilling shrieks  what an extraordinary bird is that the bird you meant mrs felix lorraine  mr mackaw was restless the whole time that vivian was reading this interesting passage at last he burst forth with an immense deal of science and a great want of construction a want which scientific men often experience always excepting those mealymouthed professors who lecture at the royal and get patronised by the blues the lavoisiers of may fair  chowchowtow my lady five feet seven inches high brazilian bird when i just remind your ladyship that the height of the tallest bird to be found in brazil and in mentioning this fact i mention nothing hypothetical the tallest bird does not stand higher than four feet nine chowchowtow dr spix is a name accurate traveller dont remember the passage most singular bird chowchowtow dont know it by that name perhaps your ladyship is not aware i think you called that gentleman mr grey perhaps mr grey is not aware that i am mr mackaw i arrived late here last night whose work in three volumes folio on brazilian parroquets although i had the honour of seeing his lordship is i trust a sufficient evidence that i am not speaking at random on this subject and consequently from the lateness of the hour could not have the honour of being introduced to your ladyship  mr mackaw thought vivian the deuce you are oh why did i not say a columbian cassowary or a peruvian penguin or a chilian condor or a guatemalan goose or a mexican mastard anything but brazilian oh unfortunate vivian grey  the marchioness who was quite overcome with this scientific appeal raised her large beautiful sleepy eyes from a delicious compound of french roll and new milk which she was working up in a sèvre saucer for julie and then as usual looked to vivian for assistance  mr grey you know everything tell mr mackaw about a bird  is there any point on which you differ from spix in his account of the chowchowtow mr mackaw  my dear sir i dont follow him at all dr spix is a most excellent man a most accurate traveller quite a name but to be sure ive only read his work in our own tongue and i fear from the passage you have just quoted five feet seven inches high in brazil it must be an imperfect version i say that four feet nine is the greatest height i know i dont speak without some foundation for my statement the only bird i know above that height is the paraguay cassowary which to be sure is sometimes found in brazil but the description of your bird mr grey does not answer that at all i ought to know i do not speak at random the only living specimen of that extraordinary bird the paraguay cassowary in this country is in my possession it was sent me by bompland and was given to him by the dictator of paraguay himself i call it in compliment doctor francia i arrived here so late last night only saw his lordship or i would have had it on the lawn this morning  oh then mr mackaw said vivian that was the bird which screamed last night  oh yes oh yes mr mackaw said mrs felix lorraine  lady carabas continued vivian it is found out it is mr mackaws particular friend his family physician whom he always travels with that awoke us all last night  is he a foreigner asked the marchioness looking up  my dear mr grey impossible the doctor never screams  oh mr mackaw mr mackaw said vivian  oh mr mackaw mr mackaw said mrs felix lorraine  i tell you he never screams reiterated the man of science i tell you he cant scream hes muzzled  oh then it must have been the chowchowtow  yes i think it must have been the chowchowtow  i should very much like to hear spixs description again said mr mackaw only i fear it is troubling you too much mr grey  read it yourself my dear sir said vivian putting the book into his hand which was the third volume of tremaine  mr mackaw looked at the volume and turned it over and sideways and upside downwards the brain of a man who has written three folios on parroquets is soon puzzled at first he thought the book was a novel but then an essay on predestination under the title of memoirs of a man of refinement rather puzzled him then he mistook it for an oxford reprint of pearson on the creed and then he stumbled on rather a warm scene in an old château in the south of france  before mr mackaw could gain the power of speech the door opened and entered who dr francia  mr mackaws travelling companion possessed the awkward accomplishment of opening doors and now strutted in in quest of his beloved master affection for mr mackaw was not however the only cause which induced this entrance  the household of château desir unused to cassowaries had neglected to supply dr francia with his usual breakfast which consisted of half a dozen pounds of rump steaks a couple of bars of hard iron some pig lead and brown stout the consequence was the dictator was sadly famished  all the ladies screamed and then mrs felix lorraine admired the doctors violet neck and the marchioness looked with an anxious eye on julie and miss graves as in duty bound with an anxious eye on the marchioness  there stood the doctor quite still with his large yellow eye fixed on mr mackaw at length he perceived the cold pasty and his little black wings began to flutter on the surface of his immense body  che che che che said the ornithologist who did not like the symptoms at all che che che che dont be frightened ladies you see hes muzzled che che che che now my dear doctor now now now franky franky franky now go away go away thats a dear doctor che che che che  but the large yellow eye grew more flaming and fiery and the little black wings grew larger and larger and now the left leg was dashed to and fro with a fearful agitation mackaw looked agonised what a whirr francia is on the table all shriek the chairs tumble over the ottomans the sèvre china is in a thousand pieces the muzzle is torn off and thrown at miss graves mackaws wig is dashed in the clotted cream and devoured on the spot and the contents of the boiling urn are poured over the beauteous and beloved julie     chapter viii   the honourable cynthia courtown to vivian grey esq  alburies oct 18  dear grey  we have now been at alburies for a fortnight nothing can be more delightful here is everybody in the world that i wish to see except yourself the knightons with as many outriders as usual lady julia and myself are great allies i like her amazingly the marquess of grandgoût arrived here last week with a most delicious party all the men who write john bull i was rather disappointed at the first sight of stanislaus hoax i had expected i do not know why something juvenile and squibbish when lo i was introduced to a corpulent individual with his coat buttoned up to his chin looking dull gentlemanlike and apoplectic however on acquaintance he came out quite rich sings delightfully and improvises like a prophet ten thousand times more entertaining than pistrucci we are sworn friends and i know all the secret history of john bull there is not much to be sure that you did not tell me yourself but still there are some things i must not trust them however to paper and therefore pray dash down to alburies immediately i shall be most happy to introduce you to lord devildrain there was an interview what think you of that stanislaus told me all circumstantially and after dinner i do not doubt that it is quite true what would you give for the secret history of the rather yellow rather yellow chanson i dare not tell it you it came from a quarter that will quite astound you and in a very elegant small female hand you remember lambton did stir very awkwardly in the lisbon business stanislaus wrote all the songs that appeared in the first number except that but he never wrote a single line of prose for the first three months it all came from vivida vis  i like the marquess of grandgoût so much i hope he will be elevated in the peerage he looks as if he wanted it so poor dear man  oh do you know i have discovered a liaison between bull and blackwood i am to be in the next noctes i forget the words of the chorus exactly but courtown is to rhyme with port down or something of that kind and then they are to dash their glasses over their heads give three cheers and adjourn to whiskytoddy and the chaldee chamber how delightful  the prima donnas are at cheltenham looking most respectable do you ever see the age it is not proper for me to take it in pray send me down your numbers and tell me all about it is it true that his lordship paragraphises a little  i have not heard from ernest clay which i think very odd if you write to him mention this and tell him to send me word how dormer stanhope behaves at mess i understand there has been a melee not much merely a rouette do get it all out of him  colonel delmington is at cheltenham with the most knowing beard you can possibly conceive lady julia rather patronises him lady doubtful has been turned out of the rooms fifty challenges in consequence and one duel missed fire of course  i have heard from alhambra he has been wandering about in all directions he has been to the lakes and is now at edinburgh he likes southey he gave the laureate a quantity of hints for his next volume of the peninsular war but does not speak very warmly of wordsworth gentlemanly man but only reads his own poetry  here has been a cousin of yours about us a young barrister going the circuit by name hargrave grey the name attracted my notice and due inquiries having been made and satisfactorily answered i patronised the limb of law fortunate for him i got him to all the fancy balls and picnics that were going on he was in heaven for a fortnight and at length having overstayed his time he left us also leaving his bag and only brief behind him they say he is ruined for life write soon  yours ever  cynthia courtown  ernest clay esq to vlvian grey esq  october 18  dear grey  i am sick of keybugles and countryballs all the girls in the town are in love with me or my foraging cap i am very much obliged to you for your letter to kennet which procured everything i wanted the family turned out bores as you had prepared me i never met such a clever family in my life the father is summoning up courage to favour the world with a volume of sermons and isabella kennet most satisfactorily proved to me after an argument of two hours which for courtesys sake i fought very manfully that sir walter scott was not the author of waverley and then she vowed as i have heard fifty young literary ladies vow before that she had seen the antiquary in manuscript  there has been a slight row to diversify the monotony of our military life young premium the son of the celebrated loanmonger has bought in and dormer stanhope and one or two others equally fresh immediately anticipated another battier business but with the greatest desire to make a fool of myself i have a natural repugnance to mimicking the foolery of others so with some little exertion and very fortunately for young premium i got the tenth voted vulgar on the score of curiosity and we were civil to the man as it turned out it was all very well for premium is a quiet gentlemanlike fellow enough and exceedingly useful he will keep extra grooms for the whole mess if they want it he is very grateful to me for what does not deserve any gratitude and for what gave me no trouble for i did not defend him from any feeling of kindness and both the mounteneys and young stapylton toad and augustus being in the regiment why i have very little trouble in commanding a majority if it come to a division  i dined the other day at old premiums who lives near this town in a magnificent old hall which however is not nearly splendid enough for a man who is the creditor of every nation from california to china and consequently the great mr stucco is building a plaster castle for him in another part of the park glad am i enough that i was prevailed upon to patronise the premium for i think i seldom witnessed a more amusing scene than i did the day i dined there  i was ushered through an actual street of servitors whose liveries were really cloth of gold and whose elaborately powdered heads would not have disgraced the most ancient mansion in st jamess square into a large and crowded saloon i was of course received with miraculous consideration and the ear of mrs premium seemed to dwell upon the jingling of my spurs for i am adjutant as upon exquisite music it was bona fide evidence of the officers being there  premium is a short but by no means vulgarlooking man about fifty with a high forehead covered with wrinkles and with eyes deep sunk in his head i never met a man of apparently less bustle and of a cooler temperament he was an object of observation from his very unobtrusiveness there were i immediately perceived a great number of foreigners in the room they looked much too knowing for arguelles and co and i soon found that they were members of the different embassies or missions of the various governments to whose infant existence premium is foster father there were two striking figures in oriental costume who were shown to me as the greek deputies not that you are to imagine that they always appear in this picturesque dress it was only as a particular favour and to please miss premium there grey my boy there is a quarry that the illustrious envoys appeared habited this day in their national costume  you would have enjoyed the scene in one part of the room was a naval officer just hot from the mines of mexico and lecturing eloquently on the passing of the cordillera in another was a man of science dilating on the miraculous powers of a newlydiscovered amalgamation process to a knot of merchants who with bent brows and eager eyes were already forming a company for its adoption here floated the latest anecdote of bolivar and there a murmur of some new movement of cochranes and then the perpetual babble about rising states and new loans and enlightened views and juncture of the two oceans and liberal principles and steamboats to mexico and the earnest look which every one had in the room how different to the vacant gaze that we have been accustomed to i was really particularly struck by the circumstance every one at premiums looked full of some great plan as if the fate of empires wag on his very breath i hardly knew whether they were most like conspirators or gamblers or the lions of a public dinner conscious of an universal gaze and consequently looking proportionately interesting one circumstance particularly struck me as i was watching the acute countenance of an individual who young premium informed me was the chilian minister and who was listening with great attention to a dissertation from captain tropic the celebrated traveller on the feasibility of a railroad over the andes i observed a great sensation among those around me every one shifting and shuffling and staring and assisting in that curious and confusing ceremony called making way even premium appeared a little excited when he came forward with a smile on his face to receive an individual apparently a foreigner and who stepped on with great though gracious dignity being curious to know who this great man was i found that this was an ambassador the representative of a recognised state  pon my honour when i saw all this i could not refrain from moralising on the magic of wealth and when i just remembered the embryo plot of some young hussar officers to cut the son of the magician i rather smiled but while i with even greater reverence than all others was making way for his excellency i observed mrs premium looking at my spurs farewell philosophy thought i puppyism for ever  dinner was at last announced and the nice etiquette which was observed between recognised states and nonrecognised states was really excessively amusing not only the ambassador would take precedence of the mere political agent but his excellencys private secretary was equally tenacious as to the agents private secretary at length we were all seated the spacious diningroom was hung round with portraits of most of the successful revolutionary leaders and over mr premium was suspended a magnificent portrait of bolivar if you could but have seen the plate by jove i have eaten off the silver of most of the first families in england yet never in my life did it enter into my imagination that it was possible for the most ingenious artist that ever existed to repeat a crest half so often in a tablespoon as in that of premium the crest is a bubble and really the effect produced by it is most ludicrous  i was very much struck at table by the appearance of an individual who came in very late but who was evidently by his bearing no insignificant personage he was a tall man with a long hooked nose and high cheek bones and with an eye were you ever at the old bailey there you may see its fellow his complexion looked as if it had been accustomed to the breezes of many climes and his hair which had once been red was now silvered or rather irongreyed not by age yet there was in his whole bearing in his slightest actions even in the easy desperate air with which he took a glass of wine an indefinable something you know what i mean which attracted your unremitting attention to him i was not wrung in my suspicions of his celebrity for as miss premium whom i sat next to whispered he was quite a lion it was lord oceanville what he is after no one knows some say he is going to greece others whisper an invasion of paraguay and others of course say other things perhaps equally correct i think he is for greece i know he is one of the most extraordinary men i ever met with i am getting prosy goodbye write soon any fun going on how is cynthia i ought to have written how is mrs felix lorraine she is a deuced odd woman  yours faithfully  ernest clay  hargrave grey esq to vivian grey esq  october 18  dear vivian  you ought not to expect a letter from me i cannot conceive why you do not occasionally answer your correspondents letters if correspondents they may be called it is really a most unreasonable habit of yours any one but myself would quarrel with you  a letter from baker met me at this place and i find that the whole of that most disagreeable and annoying business is arranged from the promptitude skill and energy which are apparent in the whole affair i suspect i have to thank the very gentleman whom i was just going to quarrel with you are a good fellow vivian after all for want of a brief i sit down to give you a sketch of my adventures on this my first circuit  this circuit is a cold and mercantile adventure and i am disappointed in it not so either for i looked for but little to enjoy take one day of my life as a specimen the rest are mostly alike the sheriffs trumpets are playing one some tune of which i know nothing and the other no tune at all i am obliged to turn out at eight it is the first day of the assize so there is some chance of a brief being a new place i push my way into court through files of attorneys as civil to the rogues as possible assuring them there is plenty of room though i am at the very moment gasping for breath wedgedin in a lane of welllined waistcoats i get into court take my place in the quietest corner and there i sit and pass other mens fees and briefs like a twopenny postman only without pay well tis six oclock dinnertime at the bottom of the table carve for all speak to none nobody speaks to me must wait till last to sum up and pay the bill reach home quite devoured by spleen after having heard every one abused who happened to be absent  i travelled to this place with manners whom i believe you know and amused myself by getting from him an account of my fellows anticipating at the same time what in fact happened to wit that i should afterwards get his character from them it is strange how freely they deal with each other that is the person spoken of being away i would not have had you see our stanhope for half a hundred pounds your jealousy would have been so excited to say the truth we are a little rough our mane wants pulling and our hoofs trimming but we jog along without performing either operation and by dint of rattling the whip against the splashboard using all ones persuasion of hand and voice and jerking the bit in his mouth we do contrive to get into the circuit town usually just about the time that the sheriff and his posse comitatus are starting to meet my lord the kings justice and that is the worst of it for their horses are prancing and pawing coursers just out of the stable sleek skins and smart drivers we begin to be knocked up just then and our appearance is the least brilliant of any part of the day here i had to pass through a host of these powdered scented fops and the multitude who had assembled to gaze on the nobler exhibition rather scoffed at our humble vehicle as manners had just then been set down to find the inn and lodging i could not jump out and leave our equipage to its fate so i settled my cravat and seemed not to mind it only i did  but i must leave off this nonsense and attend to his lordships charge which is now about to commence i have not been able to get you a single good murder although i have kept a sharp lookout as you desired me but there is a chance of a firstrate one at n  i am quite delighted with mr justice st prose he is at this moment in a most entertaining passion preparatory to a conscientious summing up and in order that his ideas may not be disturbed he has very liberally ordered the doorkeeper to have the door oiled immediately at his own expense now for my lord the kings justice  gentlemen of the jury  the noise is insufferable the heat is intolerable the doorkeepers let the people keep shuffling in the ducks in the corner are going quack quack quack heres a little girl being tried for her life and the judge cant hear a word thats said bring me my black cap and ill condemn her to death instantly  you cant my lord shrieks the infant sinner its only for petty larceny  i have just got an invite from the kearneys congratulate me  dear vivian yours faithfully  hargrave grey   lady scrope to vivian grey esq  ormsby park oct 18  my dear vivian  by desire of sir berdmore i have to request the fulfilment of a promise upon the hope of which being performed i have existed through this dull month pray my dear vivian come to us immediately ormsby has at present little to offer for your entertainment we have had that unendurable bore vivacity dull with us for a whole fortnight a report of the death of the lord chancellor or a rumour of the production of a new tragedy has carried him up to town but whether it be to ask for the seals or to indite an ingenious prologue to a play which will be condemned the first night i cannot inform you i am quite sure he is capable of doing either however we shall have other deer in a few days  i believe you have never met the mounteneys they have never been at hallesbrooke since you have been at desir they are coming to us immediately i am sure you will like them very much lord mounteney is one of those kind easyminded accomplished men who after all are nearly the pleasantest society one ever meets rather wild in his youth but with his estate now unencumbered and himself perfectly domestic his lady is an unaffected agreeable woman but it is caroline mounteney whom i wish you particularly to meet she is one of those delicious creatures who in spite of not being married are actually conversable spirited without any affectation or brusquerie beautiful and knowing enough to be quite conscious of it perfectly accomplished and yet never annoying you with tattle about bochsa and ronzi de begnis and degville  we also expect the delmonts the most endurable of the angloitalians that i know mrs delmont is not always dropping her handkerchief like lady gusto as if she expected a miserable cavalier servente to be constantly upon his knees or giving those odious expressive looks which quite destroy my nerves whenever i am under the same roof as that horrible lady soprano there is a little too much talk to be sure about roman churches and newlydiscovered mosaics and abbate maii but still we cannot expect perfection there are reports going about that ernest clay is either ruined or going to be married perhaps both are true young premium has nearly lost his character by driving a squarebuilt striped green thing drawn by one horse ernest clay got him through this terrible affair what can be the reasons of the sieur ernests excessive amiability  both the young mounteneys are with their regiment but aubrey vere is coming to us and i have half a promise from but i know you never speak to unmarried men so why do i mention them let me i beseech you my dear vivian have a few days of you to myself before ormsby is full and before you are introduced to caroline mounteney i did not think it was possible that i could exist so long without seeing you but you really must not try me too much or i shall quarrel with you i have received all your letters which are very very agreeable but i think rather rather impudent adieu  harriette scrope  horace grey esq to vivian grey esq  paris oct 18  my dear vivian  i have received yours of the 9th and have read it with mixed feelings of astonishment and sorrow  you are now my dear son a member of what is called the great world society formed on antisocial principles apparently you have possessed yourself of the object of your wishes but the scenes you live in are very moveable the characters you associate with are all masked and it will always be doubtful whether you c an retain that long which has been obtained by some slippery artifice vivian you are a juggler and the deceptions of your sleightofhand tricks depend upon instantaneous motions  when the selfish combine with the selfish bethink you how many projects are doomed to disappointment how many cross interests baffle the parties at the same time joined together without ever uniting what a mockery is their love but how deadly are their hatreds all this great society with whom so young an adventurer has trafficked abate nothing of their price in the slavery of their service and the sacrifice of violated feelings what sleepless nights has it cost you to win over the disobliged to conciliate the discontented to cajole the contumatious you may smile at the hollow flatteries answering to flatteries as hollow which like bubbles when they touch dissolve into nothing but tell me vivian what has the selftormentor felt at the laughing treacheries which force a man down into selfcontempt  is it not obvious my dear vivian that true fame and true happiness must rest upon the imperishable social affections i do not mean that coterie celebrity which paltry minds accept as fame but that which exists independent of the opinions or the intrigues of individuals nor do i mean that glittering show of perpetual converse with the world which some miserable wanderers call happiness but that which can only be drawn from the sacred and solitary fountain of your own feelings  active as you have now become in the great scenes of human affairs i would not have you be guided by any fanciful theories of morals or of human nature philosophers have amused themselves by deciding on human actions by systems but as these system are of the most opposite natures it is evident that each philosopher in reflecting his own feelings in the system he has so elaborately formed has only painted his own character  do not therefore conclude with hobbes and mandeville that man lives in a state of civil warfare with man nor with shaftesbury adorn with a poetical philosophy our natural feelings man is neither the vile nor the excellent being which he sometimes imagines himself to be he does not so much act by system as by sympathy if this creature cannot always feel for others he is doomed to feel for himself and the vicious are at least blessed with the curse of remorse  you are now inspecting one of the worst portions of society in what is called the great world st giles is bad but of another kind and it may be useful on the principle that the actual sight of brutal ebriety was supposed to have inspired youth with the virtue of temperance on the same principle that the platonist in the study of deformity conceived the beautiful let me warn you not to fall into the usual error of youth in fancying that the circle you move in is precisely the world itself do not imagine that there are not other beings whose benevolent principle is governed by finer sympathies by more generous passions and by those nobler emotions which really constitute all our public and private virtues i give you this hint lest in your present society you might suppose these virtues were merely historical  once more i must beseech you not to give loose to any elation of mind the machinery by which you have attained this unnatural result must be so complicated that in the very tenth hour you will find yourself stopped in some part where you never counted on an impediment and the want of a slight screw or a little oil will prevent you from accomplishing your magnificent end  we are and have been very dull here there is every probability of madame de genlis writing more volumes than ever i called on the old lady and was quite amused with the enthusiasm of her imbecility chateaubriand is getting what you call a bore and the whole city is mad about a new opera by boieldieu your mother sends her love and desires me to say that the salmi of woodcocks à la lucullus which you write about does not differ from the practice here in vogue how does your cousin hargrave prosper on his circuit the delmingtons are here which makes it very pleasant for your mother as well as for myself for it allows me to hunt over the old bookshops at my leisure there are no new books worth sending you or they would accompany this but i would recommend you to get meyers new volume from treüttel and wurtz and continue to make notes as you read it give my compliments to the marquess and believe me  your affectionate father  horace grey     chapter ix   it was impossible for any human being to behave with more kindness than the marquess of carabas did to vivian grey after that young gentlemans short conversation with mrs felix lorraine in the conservatory the only feeling which seemed to actuate the peer was an eager desire to compensate by his present conduct for any past misunderstanding and he loaded his young friend with all possible favour still vivian was about to quit château desir and in spite of all that had passed he was extremely loth to leave his noble friend under the guardianship of his female one  about this time the duke and duchess of juggernaut the very pink of aristocracy the wealthiest the proudest the most ancient and most pompous couple in christendom honoured château desir with their presence for two days only two days making the marquesss mansion a convenient restingplace in one of their princely progresses to one of their princely castles  vivian contrived to gain the heart of her grace by his minute acquaintance with the juggernaut pedigree and having taken the opportunity in one of their conversations to describe mrs felix lorraine as the most perfect specimen of divine creation with which he was acquainted at the same time the most amusing and the most amiable of women that lady was honoured with an invitation to accompany her grace to himalaya castle as this was the greatest of all possible honours and as desir was now very dull mrs felix lorraine accepted the invitation or rather obeyed the command for the marquess would not hear of a refusal vivian having dilated in the most energetic terms on the opening which now presented itself of gaining the juggernaut the coast being thus cleared vivian set off the next day for sir berdmore scropes     book iv   chapter i   the important hour drew nigh christmas was to be passed by the carabas family the beaconsfields the scropes and the clevelands at lord courtowns villa at richmond at which place on account of its vicinity to the metropolis the viscount had determined to make out the holidays notwithstanding the thames entered his kitchen windows and the donna del lago was acted in the theatre with real water cynthia courtown performing elena paddling in a punt  let us order our horses cleveland round to the piccadilly gate and walk through the guards i must stretch my legs that bore horace buttonhole captured me in pall mall east and has kept me in the same position for upwards of half an hour i shall make a note to blackball him at the athenaeum how is mrs cleveland  extremely well she goes down to buckhurst lodge with lady carabas is not that lord lowersdale  his very self he is going to call on vivida vis i have no doubt lowersdale is a man of very considerable talent much more than the world gives him credit for  and he doubtless finds a very able counsellor in monsieur le sécrétaire  can you name a better one  you rather patronise vivida i think grey  patronise him he is my political pet  and yet kerrison tells me you reviewed the suffolk papers in the edinburgh  so i did what of that i defended them in blackwood  this then is the usual method of you literary gentlemen thank god i never could write a line  york house rises proudly if york house be its name  this confounded catholic question is likely to give us a great deal of trouble grey it is perfect madness for us to advocate the cause of the six millions of hereditary bondsmen and yet with not only the marchese but even courtown and beaconsfield committed it is to say the least a very delicate business  very delicate certainly but there are some precedents i suspect cleveland for the influence of a party being opposed to measures which the heads of that party had pledged themselves to adopt  does old gifford still live at pimlico grey  still  he is a splendid fellow after all  certainly a mind of great powers but bigoted  oh yes i know exactly what you are going to say it is the fashion i am aware to abuse the old gentleman he is the earl of eldon of literature not the less loved because a little vilified but when i just remember what gifford has done when i call to mind the perfect and triumphant success of everything he has undertaken the antijacobin the baviad and maeviad the quarterly all palpable hits on the very jugular i hesitate before i speak of william gifford in any other terms or in any other spirit than those of admiration and of gratitude  and to think grey that the tory administration and the tory party of great britain should never by one single act or in a single instance have indicated that they were in the least aware that the exertions of such a man differed in the slightest degree from those of hunt and hone of all the delusions which flourish in this mad world the delusion of that man is the most frantic who voluntarily and of his own accord supports the interest of a party i mention this to you because it is the rock on which all young politicians strike fortunately you enter life under different circumstances from those which usually attend most political debutants you have your connections formed and your views ascertained but if by any chance you find yourself independent and unconnected never for a moment suppose that you can accomplish your objects by coming forward unsolicited to fight the battle of a party they will cheer your successful exertions and then smile at your youthful zeal or crossing themselves for the unexpected succour be too cowardly to reward their unexpected champion no grey make them fear you and they will kiss your feet there is no act of treachery or meanness of which a political party is not capable for in politics there is no honour  as to gifford i am surprised at their conduct towards him although i know better than most men of what wood a minister is made and how much reliance may be placed upon the gratitude of a party but canning from canning i certainly did expect different conduct  oh canning i love the man but as you say cleveland ministers have short memories and cannings that was antilles that just passed us apropos to whom i quite rejoice that the marquess has determined to take such a decided course on the west india question  oh yes curse your east india sugar  to be sure slavery and sweetmeats forever  but aside with joking grey i really think that if any man of average ability dare rise in the house and rescue many of the great questions of the day from what dugald stuart or disraeli would call the spirit of political religionism with which they are studiously mixed up he would not fail to make a great impression upon the house and a still greater one upon the country  i quite agree with you and certainly i should recommend commencing with the west india question singular state of affairs when even canning can only insinuate his opinion when the very existence of some of our most valuable colonies is at stake and when even his insinuations are only indulged with an audience on the condition that he favours the house with an introductory discourse of twenty minutes on the divine author of our faith and an éloge of equal length on the génie du christianisme in a style worthy of chateaubriand  miserable work indeed i have got a pamphlet on the west india question sent me this morning do you know any raving lawyer any mad master in chancery or something of the kind who meddles in these affairs  oh stephen a puddle in a storm he is for a crusade for the regeneration of the antilles the most forcible of feebles the most energetic of drivellers velluti acting pietro leremita  do you know by any chance whether southeys vindiciae is out yet i wanted to look it over during the holidays  not out though it has been advertised some time but what do you expect  nay it is an interesting controversy as controversies go not exactly milton and salmasius but fair enough  i do not know it has long degenerated into a mere personal bickering between the laureate and butler southey is of course revelling in the idea of writing an english work with a latin title and that perhaps is the only circumstance for which the controversy is prolonged  but southey after all is a man of splendid talents  doubtless the most philosophical of bigots and the most poetical of prose writers  apropos to the catholic question there goes colonial botherem trying to look like prince metternich a decided failure  what can keep him in town  writing letters i suppose heaven preserve me from receiving any of them  is it true then that his letters are of the awful length that is whispered  true oh they are something beyond all conception perfect epistolary boa constrictors i speak with feeling for i have myself suffered under their voluminous windings  have you seen his quarto volume the cure for the catholic question  yes  if you have it lend it to me what kind of thing is it  oh what should it be ingenious and imbecile he advises the catholics in the old nursery language to behave like good boys to open their mouths and shut their eyes and see what god will send them  well that is the usual advice is there nothing more characteristic of the writer  what think you of a proposition of making jockey of norfolk patriarch of england and of an ascertained credo for our catholic fellowsubjects ingenious is not it  have you seen puffs new volume of ariosto  i have what could possibly have induced mr partenopex puff to have undertaken such a duty mr puff is a man destitute of poetical powers possessing no vigour of language and gifted with no happiness of expression his translation is hard dry and husky as the outside of a cocoanut i am amused to see the excellent tact with which the public has determined not to read his volumes in spite of the incessant exertions of a certain set to ensure their popularity but the time has gone by when the smug coterie could create a reputation  do you think the time ever existed cleveland  what could have seduced puff into being so ambitious i suppose his admirable knowledge of italian as if a man were entitled to strike a die for the new sovereign merely because he was aware how much alloy might legally debase its carats of pure gold  i never can pardon puff for that little book on cats the idea was admirable but instead of one of the most delightful volumes that ever appeared to take up a dull tame compilation from bingleys animal biography  yes and the impertinence of dedicating such a work to the officers of his majestys household troops considering the quarter from whence it proceeded i certainly did not expect much but still i thought that there was to be some little esprit the poor guards how nervous they must have been at the announcement what could have been the point of that dedication  i remember a most interminable proser who was blessed with a very sensiblesounding voice and who on the strength of that and his correct and constant emphases was considered by the world for a great time as a sage at length it was discovered that he was quite the reverse mr puffs wit is very like this mans wisdom you take up one of his little books and you fancy from its titlepage that it is going to be very witty as you proceed you begin to suspect that the man is only a wag and then surprised at not seeing the point you have a shrewd suspicion that he is a great hand at dry humour it is not till you have closed the volume that you wonder who it is that has had the hardihood to intrude such imbecility upon an indulgent world  come come mr puff is a worthy gentleman let him cease to dusk the radiancy of ariostos sunny stanzas and i shall be the first man who will do justice to his merits he certainly tattles prettily about tenses and terminations and is not an inelegant grammarian  our literature i think is at a low ebb  there is nothing like a fall of stocks to affect what it is the fashion to style the literature of the present day a fungus production which has flourished from the artificial state of our society the mere creature of our imaginary wealth everybody being very rich has afforded to be very literary books being considered a luxury almost as elegant and necessary as ottomans bonbons and pierglasses consols at 100 were the origin of all book societies the stockbrokers ladies took off the quarto travels and the hotpressed poetry they were the patronesses of your patent ink and your wirewove paper that is all past twenty per cent difference in the value of our public securities from this time last year that little incident has done more for the restoration of the old english feeling than all the exertions of church and state united there is nothing like a fall in consols to bring the blood of our good people of england into cool order it is your grand state medicine your veritable doctor sangrado  a fall in stocks and halt to the spread of knowledge and the progress of liberal principles is like that of a man too late for posthorses a fall in stocks and where are your london universities and your mechanics institutes and your new docks where your philosophy your philanthropy and your competition national prejudices revive as national prosperity decreases if the consols were at 60 we should be again bellowing god save the king eating roast beef and damning the french  and you imagine literature is equally affected grey  clearly we were literary because we were rich amid the myriad of volumes which issued monthly from the press what one was not written for the mere hour it is all very well to buy mechanical poetry and historical novels when our purses have a plethora but now my dear fellow depend upon it the game is up we have no scholars now no literary recluses no men who ever appear to think scribble scribble scribble as the duke of cumberland said to gibbon should be the motto of the mighty nineteenth century  southey i think grey is an exception  by no means southey is a political writer a writer for a particular purpose all his works from those in three volumes quarto to those in one duodecimo are alike political pamphlets  we certainly want a masterspirit to set us right grey we want byron  there was the man and that such a man should be lost to us at the very moment that he had begun to discover why it had pleased the omnipotent to have endowed him with such powers  if one thing were more characteristic of byrons mind than another it was his strong shrewd common sense his pure unalloyed sagacity  you knew him i think cleveland  well i was slightly acquainted with him when in england slightly however for i was then very young but many years afterwards i met him in italy it was at pisa just before he left that place for genoa i was then very much struck at the alteration in his appearance  indeed  yes his face was swollen and he was getting fat his hair was grey and his countenance had lost that spiritual expression which it once eminently possessed his teeth were decaying and he said that if ever he came to england it would be to consult wayte about them i certainly was very much struck at his alteration for the worse besides he was dressed in the most extraordinary manner  slovenly  oh no no no in the most dandified style that you can conceive but not that of an english dandy either he had on a magnificent foreign foraging cap which he wore in the room but his grey curls were quite perceptible and a frogged surtout and he had a large gold chain round his neck and pushed into his waistcoat pocket i imagined of course that a glass was attached to it but i afterwards found that it bore nothing but a quantity of trinkets he had also another gold chain tight round his neck like a collar  how odd and did you converse much with him  i was not long at pisa but we never parted and there was only one subject of conversation england england england i never met a man in whom the maladie du pays was so strong byron was certainly at this time restless and discontented he was tired of his dragoon captains and pensioned poetasters and he dared not come back to england with what he considered a tarnished reputation his only thought was of some desperate exertion to clear himself it was for this he went to greece when i was with him he was in correspondence with some friends in england about the purchase of a large tract of land in colombia he affected a great admiration of bolivar  who bythebye is a great man  assuredly  your acquaintance with byron must have been one of the gratifying incidents of your life cleveland  certainly i may say with friar martin in goetz of berlichingen the sight of him touched my heart it is a pleasure to have seen a great man  hobhouse was a faithful friend to him  his conduct has been beautiful and byron had a thorough affection for him in spite of a few squibs and a few drunken speeches which damned goodnatured friends have always been careful to repeat  the loss of byron can never be retrieved he was indeed a real man and when i say this i award him the most splendid character which human nature need aspire to at least i for my part have no ambition to be considered either a divinity or an angel and truly when i look round upon the creatures alike effeminate in mind and body of which the world is in general composed i fear that even my ambition is too exalted byrons mind was like his own ocean sublime in its yesty madness beautiful in its glittering summer brightness mighty in the lone magnificence of its waste of waters gazed upon from the magic of its own nature yet capable of representing but as in a glass darkly the natures of all others  hyde park is greatly changed since i was a dandy vivian pray do the misses otranto still live in that house  yes blooming as ever  it is the fashion to abuse horace walpole but i really think him the most delightful writer that ever existed i wonder who is to be the horace walpole of the present century some one perhaps we least suspect  vivida vis think you  more than probable i will tell you who ought to be writing memoirs lord dropmore does my lord manfred keep his mansion there next to the misses otranto  i believe so and lives there  i knew him in germany a singular man and not understood perhaps he does not understand himself i see our horses  i will join you in an instant cleveland i just want to speak one word to osborne whom i see coming down here well osborne i must come and knock you up one of these mornings i have got a commission for you from lady julia knighton to which you must pay particular attention  well mr grey how does lady julia like the bay mare  very much indeed but she wants to know what you have done about the chestnut  oh put it off sir in the prettiest style on young mr feoffment who has just married and taken a house in gower street he wanted a bit of blood hopes he likes it  hopes he does jack there is a particular favour which you can do for me osborne and which i am sure you will ernest clay you know ernest clay a most excellent fellow is ernest clay you know and a great friend of yours osborne i wish you would just step down to connaught place and look at those bays he bought of harry mounteney he is in a little trouble and we must do what we can for him you know he is an excellent fellow and a great friend of yours thank you i knew you would good morning remember lady julia so you really fitted young feoffment with the chestnut well that was admirable good morning  i do not know whether you care for these things at all cleveland but premium a famous millionaire has gone this morning for i know not how much half the new world will be ruined and in this old one a most excellent fellow my friend ernest clay he was engaged to premiums daughter his last resource and now of course it is all up with him  i was at college with his brother augustus clay he is a nephew of lord mounteneys is he not  the very same poor fellow i do not know what we must do for him i think i shall advise him to change his name to clayville and if the world ask him the reason of the euphonious augmentation why he can swear it was to distinguish himself from his brothers too many roués of the same name will never do and now spurs to our steeds for we are going at least three miles out of our way and i must collect my senses and arrange my curls before dinner for i have to flirt with at least three fair ones     chapter ii   these conversations play the very deuce with ones story we had intended to have commenced this book with something quite terrific a murder or a marriage and all our great ideas have ended in a lounge after all it is perhaps the most natural termination in life surely man is not always as monstrously busy as he appears to be in novels and romances we are not always in action not always making speeches or making money or making war or making love occasionally we talk about the weather generally sometimes about ourselves oftener about our friends as often about our enemies at least those who have any which in my opinion is the vulgarest of all possessions  but we must get on  mr cleveland and mrs felix lorraine again met and the gentleman scarcely appeared to be aware that this meeting was not their first the lady sighed and remonstrated she reproached mr cleveland with passages of letters he stared and deigned not a reply to an artifice which he considered equally audacious and shallow there was a scene vivian was forced to interfere but as he deprecated all explanation his interference was of little avail and as it was ineffectual for one party and uncalled for by the other it was of course not encouraged the presence of mrs cleveland did not tend to assist mrs felix in that selfcontrol which with all her wildness she could appositely practise in the presence of the clevelands she was fitful capricious perplexing sometimes impertinent sometimes humble but always ill at ease and never charming  peculiar however as was her conduct in this particular relation it was in all others at this moment most exemplary her whole soul seemed concentrated in the success of the approaching struggle no office was too mechanical for her attention or too elaborate for her enthusiastic assiduity her attentions were not confined merely to vivian and the marquess but were lavished with equal generosity on their colleagues she copied letters for sir berdmore and composed letters for lord courtown and construed letters to lord beaconsfield they in return echoed her praises to her delighted relative who was daily congratulated on the possession of such a fascinating sister in law  well vivian said mrs lorraine to that young gentleman the day previous to his departure from buckhurst lodge you are going to leave me behind you  indeed  yes i hope you will not want me i am very annoyed at not being able to go to town with you but lady courtown is so pressing and i have really promised so often to stay a week with her that i thought it was better to make out my promise at once than in six months hence  well i am exceedingly sorry for you really are so useful and the interest you take in everything is so encouraging that i very much fear we shall not be able to get on without you the important hour draws nigh  it does indeed vivian and i assure you that there is no person awaiting it with intenser interest than myself i little thought she added in a low but distinct voice i little thought when i first reached england that i should ever again be interested in anything in this world  vivian was silent for he had nothing to say  vivian very briskly resumed mrs lorraine i shall get you to frank all my letters for me i shall never trouble the marquess again do you know it strikes me you will make a very good speaker  you flatter me exceedingly suppose you give me a few lessons  but you must leave off some of your wicked tricks vivian you must not improvise parliamentary papers  improvise papers mrs lorraine what can you mean  oh nothing i never mean anything  but you must have had some meaning  some meaning yes i dare say i had i meant i meant do you think it will rain today  every prospect of a hard frost i never knew before that i was an improvisatore  nor i have you heard from papa lately i suppose he is quite in spirits at your success  my father is a man who seldom gives way to any elation of mind  ah indeed a philosopher i have no doubt like his son  i have no claims to the title of philosopher although i have had the advantage of studying in the school of mrs felix lorraine  what do you mean if i thought you meant to be impertinent i really would but i excuse you i think the boy means well  the boy means nothing he never means anything  come vivian we are going to part do not let us quarrel the last day there there is a sprig of myrtle for you       what not accept my foolish flower        nay then i am indeed unblest  and now you want it all unreasonable young man if i were not the kindest lady in the land i should tear this sprig into a thousand pieces sooner but come my child you shall have it there it looks quite imposing in your buttonhole how handsome you look today  how agreeable you are i love compliments  ah vivian will you never give me credit for anything but a light and callous heart will you never be convinced that that but why make this humiliating confession oh no let me be misunderstood for ever the time may come when vivian grey will find that amalia lorraine was  was what madam  you shall choose the word vivian  say then my friend  tis a monosyllable full of meaning and i will not quarrel with it and now adieu heaven prosper you believe me that my first thoughts and my last are for you and of you     chapter iii   this is very kind of you grey i was afraid my note might not have caught you you have not breakfasted really i wish you would take up your quarters in carabas house for i want you now every moment  what is the urgent business of this morning  oh i have seen bromley  hah  and everything most satisfactory i did not go into detail i left that for you but i ascertained sufficient to convince me that management is now alone required  well my lord i trust that will not be wanting  no vivian you have opened my eyes to the situation in which fortune has placed me the experience of every day only proves the truth and soundness of your views fortunate indeed was the hour in which we met  my lord i do trust that it was a meeting which neither of us will live to repent  impossible my dear friend i do not hesitate to say that i would not change my present lot for that of any peer of this realm no not for that of his majestys most favoured counsellor what with my character and my influence and my connections i to be a tool i the marquess of carabas i say nothing of my own powers but as you often most justly and truly observe the world has had the opportunity of judging of them and i think i may recur without vanity to the days in which my voice had some weight in the royal councils and as i have often remarked i have friends i have you vivian my career is before you i know what i should have done at your age not to say what i did do i to be a tool the very last person that ought to be a tool but i see my error you have opened my eyes and blessed be the hour in which we met but we must take care how we act vivian we must be wary eh vivian wary wary people must know what their situations are eh vivian  exceedingly useful knowledge but i do not exactly understand the particular purport of your lordships last observation  you do not eh asked the peer and he fixed his eyes as earnestly and expressively as he possibly could upon his young companion well i thought not i was positive it was not true continued the marquess in a murmur  what my lord  oh nothing nothing people talk at random at random at random i feel confident you quite agree with me eh vivian  really my lord i fear i am unusually dull this morning  dull no no you quite agree with me i feel confident you do people must be taught what their situations are that is what i was saying vivian my lord courtown added the marquess in a whisper is not to have everything his own way eh vivian  oh oh thought vivian this then is the result of that admirable creature miss felix lorraine staying a week with her dear friend lady courtown my lord it would be singular if in the carabas party the carabas interest was not the predominant one  i knew you thought so i could not believe for a minute that you could think otherwise but some people take such strange ideas into their heads i cannot account for them i felt confident what would be your opinion my lord courtown is not to carry everything before him in the spirit that i have lately observed or rather in the spirit which i understand from very good authority is exhibited eh vivian that is your opinion is not it  oh my dear marquess we must think alike on this as on all points  i knew it i felt confident as to your sentiments upon this subject i cannot conceive why some people take such strange ideas into their heads i knew that you could not disagree with me upon this point no no no my lord courtown must feel which is the predominant interest as you so well express it how choice your expressions always are i do not know how it is but you always hit upon the right expression vivian the predominant interest the predominant interest to be sure what with my high character and connections with my stake in society was it to be expected that i the marquess of carabas was going to make any move which compromised the predominancy of my interests no no no my lord courtown the predominant interest must be kept predominant eh vivian  to be sure my lord explicitness and decision will soon arrange any désagrémens  i have been talking to lady carabas vivian upon the expediency of her opening the season early i think a course of parliamentary dinners would produce a good effect it gives a tone to a political party  certainly the science of political gastronomy has never been sufficiently studied  egad vivian i am in such spirits this morning this business of bromley so delights me and finding you agree with me about lord courtown i was confident as to your sentiments on that point but some people take such strange ideas into their heads to be sure to be sure the predominant interest mine that is to say ours vivian is the predominant interest i have no idea of the predominant interest not being predominant that would be singular i knew you would agree with me we always agree twas a lucky hour when we met two minds so exactly alike i was just your very self when i was young and as for you my career is before you  here entered mr sadler with the letters  one from courtown i wonder if he has seen mounteney mounteney is a very goodnatured fellow and i think might be managed ah i wish you could get hold of him vivian you would soon bring him round what it is to have brains vivian and here the marquess shook his head very pompously and at the same time tapped very significantly on his left temple hah what what is all this here read it read it man i have no head today  vivian took the letter and his quick eye dashed through its contents in a second it was from lord courtown and dated far in the country it talked of private communications and premature conduct and the suspicious not to say dishonourable behaviour of mr vivian grey it trusted that such conduct was not sanctioned by his lordship but nevertheless obliged to act with decision regretted the necessity c c c c in short lord courtown had deserted and recalled his pledge as to the official appointment promised to mr cleveland because that promise was made while he was the victim of delusions created by the representations of mr grey  what can all this mean my lord  the marquess swore a fearful oath and threw another letter  this is from lord beaconsfield my lord said vivian with a face pallid as death and apparently the composition of the same writer at least it is the same tale the same refacimento of lies and treachery and cowardice doled out with diplomatic politesse but i will off to shire instantly it is not yet too late to save everything this is wednesday on thursday afternoon i shall be at norwood park thank god i came this morning  the face of the marquess who was treacherous as the wind seemed already to indicate adieu mr vivian grey but that countenance exhibited some very different passions when it glanced over the contents of the next epistle there was a tremendous oath and a dead silence his lordships florid countenance turned as pale as that of his companion the perspiration stole down in heavy drops he gasped for breath  good god my lord what is the matter  the matter howled the marquess the matter that i have been a vain weak miserable fool and then there was another oath and he flung the letter to the other side of the table  it was the official congé of the most noble sydney marquess of carabas his majesty had no longer any occasion for his services his successor was lord courtown  we will not affect to give any description of the conduct of the marquess of carabas at this moment he raved he stamped he blasphemed but the whole of his abuse was levelled against his former monstrous clever young friend of whose character he had so often boasted that his own was she prototype but who was now an adventurer a swindler a scoundrel a liar a base deluding flattering fawning villain c c c c  my lord said vivian  i will not hear you out on your fair words they have duped me enough already that i with my high character and connections that i the marquess of carabas should have been the victim of the arts of a young scoundrel  vivians fist was once clenched but it was only for a moment the marquess leant back in his chair with his eyes shut in the agony of the moment a projecting tooth of his upper jaw had forced itself through his under lip and from the wound the blood was flowing freely over his dead white countenance vivian left the room     chapter iv   he stopped one moment on the landingplace ere he was about to leave the house for ever  tis all over and so vivian grey your game is up and to die too like a dog a womans dupe were i a despot i should perhaps satiate my vengeance upon this female fiend with the assistance of the rack but that cannot be and after all it would be but a poor revenge in one who has worshipped the empire of the intellect to vindicate the agony i am now enduring upon the base body of a woman no tis not all over there is yet an intellectual rack of which few dream far far more terrific than the most exquisite contrivances of parysatis jacinte said he to a female attendant that passed is your mistress at home  she is sir  tis well said vivian and he sprang upstairs  health to the lady of our love said vivian grey as he entered the elegant boudoir of mrs felix lorraine in spite of the easterly wind which has spoiled my beauty for the season i could not refrain from inquiring after your prosperity before i went to the marquess have you heard the news  news no what news  tis a sad tale said vivian with a melancholy voice  oh then pray do not tell it me i am in no humour for sorrow today come a bonmot or a calembourg or exit mr vivian grey  well then good morning i am off for a black crape or a barcelona kerchief mrs cleveland is dead  dead exclaimed mrs lorraine  dead she died last night suddenly is it not horrible  shocking exclaimed mrs lorraine with a mournful voice and an eye dancing with joy why mr grey i do declare you are weeping  it is not for the departed  nay vivian for heavens sake what is the matter  my dear mrs lorraine but here the speakers voice was choked with grief and he could not proceed  pray compose yourself  mrs felix lorraine can i speak with you half an hour undisturbed  by all means i will ring for jacinte jacinte mind i am not at home to anyone well what is the matter  o madam i must pray your patience i wish you to shrive a penitent  good god mr grey for heavens sake be explicit  for heavens sake for your sake for my souls sake i would be explicit but explicitness is not the language of such as i am can you listen to a tale of horror can you promise me to contain yourself  i will promise anything pray pray proceed  but in spite of her earnest solicitations her companion was mute at length he rose from his chair and leaning on the chimneypiece buried his face in his hands and wept  vivian said mrs lorraine have you seen the marquess yet  not yet he sobbed i am going to him but i am in no humour for business this morning  compose yourself i beseech you i will hear everything you shall not complain of an inattentive or an irritable auditor now my dear vivian sit down and tell me all she led him to a chair and then after stifling his sobs with a broken voice he proceeded  you will recollect madam that accident made me acquainted with certain circumstances connected with yourself and mr cleveland alas actuated by the vilest of sentiments i conceived a violent hatred against that gentleman a hatred only to be equalled by my passion for you but i find difficulty in dwelling upon the details of this sad story of jealousy and despair  oh speak speak compensate for all you have done by your present frankness be brief be brief  i will be brief said vivian with earnestness i will be brief know then madam that in order to prevent the intercourse between you and mr cleveland from proceeding i obtained his friendship and became the confidante of his hearts sweetest secret thus situated i suppressed the letters with which i was entrusted from him to you and poisoning his mind i accounted for your silence by your being employed in other correspondence nay i did more with the malice of a fiend i boasted of nay do not stop me i have more to tell  mrs felix lorraine with compressed lips and looks of horrible earnestness gazed in silence  the result of all this you know but the most terrible part is to come and by a strange fascination i fly to confess my crimes at your feet even while the last minutes have witnessed my most heinous one oh madam i have stood over the bier of the departed i have mingled my tears with those of the sorrowing widower his young and tender child was on my knee and as i kissed his innocent lips me thought it was but my duty to the departed to save the father from his mothers rival he stopped  yes yes yes said mrs felix lorraine in a low whisper  it was then even then in the hour of his desolation that i mentioned your name that it might the more disgust him and while he wept over his virtuous and sainted wife i dwelt on the vices of his rejected mistress  mrs lorraine clasped her hands and moved restlessly on her seat  nay do not stop me let me tell all cleveland said i if ever you become the husband of mrs felix lorraine remember my last words it will be well for you if your frame be like that of mithridates of pontus and proof against  poison  and did you say this shrieked the woman  even these were my words  then may all evil blast you she threw herself on the sofa her voice was choked with the convulsions of her passion and she writhed in fearful agony  vivian grey lounging in an armchair in the easiest of postures and with a face brilliant with smiles watched his victim with the eye of a mephistopheles  she slowly recovered and with a broken voice poured forth her sacred absolution to the relieved penitent  you wonder i do not stab you hah hah hah there is no need for that the good powers be praised that you refused the draught i once proffered know wretch that your race is run within five minutes you will breathe a beggar and an outcast your golden dreams are over your cunning plans are circumvented your ambitious hopes are crushed for ever you are blighted in the very spring of your life oh may you never die may you wander for ever the butt of the worlds malice and may the slow moving finger of scorn point whereer you go at the ruined charlatan  hah hah is it so think you that vivian grey would fall by a womans wile think you that vivian grey could be crushed by such a worthless thing as you know then that your political intrigues have been as little concealed from me as your personal ones i have been acquainted with all the marquess has himself seen the minister and is more firmly established in his pride of place than ever i have myself seen our colleagues whom you tampered with and their hearts are still true and their purpose still fixed all all prospers and ere five days are passed the charlatan will be a senator  the shifting expression of mrs lorraines countenance while vivian was speaking would have baffled the most cunning painter her complexion was capricious as the chameleons and her countenance was so convulsed that her features seemed of all shapes and sizes one large vein protruded nearly a quarter of an inch from her forehead and the dank light which gleamed in her tearful eye was like an unwholesome meteor quivering in a marsh when he ended she sprang from the sofa and looking up and extending her arms with unmeaning wildness she gave one loud shriek and dropped like a bird shot on the wing she had burst a bloodvessel  vivian raised her on the sofa and paid her every possible attention there is always a medical attendant lurking about the mansions of the noble and to this worthy and the attendant jacinte vivian delivered his patient  had vivian grey left the boudoir a pledged bridegroom his countenance could not have been more triumphant but he was labouring under unnatural excitement for it is singular that when as he left the house the porter told him that mr cleveland was with his lord vivian had no idea at the moment what individual bore that name the fresh air of the street revived him and somewhat cooled the bubbling of his blood it was then that the mans information struck upon his senses  so poor cleveland thought vivian then he knows all his own misery he had not yet thought of but when cleveland occurred to him with his ambition once more baulked his high hopes once more blasted and his honourable soul once more deceived when he thought of his fair wife and his infant children and his ruined prospects a sickness came over his heart he grew dizzy and fell  and the gentlemans ill i think said an honest irishman and in the fulness of his charity he placed vivian on a doorstep  so it seems said a genteel passenger in black and he snatched with great sangfroid vivians watch stop thief hallooed the hibernian paddy was tripped up there was a row in the midst of which vivian grey crawled to an hotel     chapter v   in half an hour vivian was at mr clevelands door  my master is at the marquess of carabas sir he will not return but is going immediately to richmond where mrs cleveland is staying  vivian immediately wrote to mr cleveland if your master have left the marquess let this be forwarded to him at richmond immediately  cleveland  you know all it would be mockery were i to say that at this moment i am not thinking of myself i am a ruined man in body and in mind but my own misery is nothing i can die i can go mad and who will be harmed but you i had wished that we should never meet again but my hand refuses to trace the thoughts with which my heart is full and i am under the sad necessity of requesting you to see me once more we have been betrayed and by a woman but there has been revenge oh what revenge  vivian grey  when vivian left mr clevelands he actually did not know what to do with himself home at present he could not face and so he continued to wander about quite unconscious of locality he passed in his progress many of his acquaintance who from his distracted air and rapid pace imagined that he was intent on some important business at length he found himself in one of the most sequestered parts of kensington gardens it was a cold frosty day and as vivian flung himself upon one of the summer seats the snow drifted from off the frozen board but vivians brow was as burning hot as if he had been an inhabitant of sirius throwing his arms on a small garden table he buried his face in his hands and wept as men can but once weep in this world  o thou sublime and most subtle philosopher who in thy lamplit cell art speculating upon the passions which thou hast never felt o thou splendid and most admirable poet who with cunning words art painting with a smile a tale of woe tell me what is grief and solve me the mystery of sorrow  not for himself for after the first pang he would have whistled off his high hopes with the spirit of a ripperda not even for cleveland for at this moment it must be confessed his thoughts were not for his friend did vivian greys soul struggle as if it were about to leave its fleshy chamber we said he wept as men can weep but once in this world and yet it would have been impossible for him to have defined what at that fearful moment was the cause of his hearts sorrow incidents of childhood of the most trivial nature and until this moment forgotten flashed across his memory he gazed on the smile of his mother he listened to the sweet tones of his fathers voice and his hand clenched with still more agonised grasp his rude restingplace and the scalding tears dashed down his cheek in still more ardent torrents he had no distinct remembrance of what had so lately happened but characters flitted before him as in a theatre in a dream dim and shadowy yet full of mysterious and undefinable interest and then there came a horrible idea across his mind that his glittering youth was gone and wasted and then there was a dark whisper of treachery and dissimulation and dishonour and then he sobbed as if his very heart were cracking all his boasted philosophy vanished his artificial feelings fled him insulted nature reasserted her longspurned authority and the once proud vivian grey felt too humble even to curse himself gradually his sobs became less convulsed and his brow more cool and calm from very exhaustion he sat for upwards of an hour motionless  at this moment there issued with their attendant from an adjoining shrubbery two beautiful children they were so exceedingly lovely that the passenger would have stopped to gaze upon them the eldest who yet was very young was leading his sister hand in hand with slow and graceful steps mimicking the courtesy of men but when his eye caught vivians the boy uttered a loud cry of exultation and rushed with the eagerness of infantile affection to his gentle and favourite playmate they were the young clevelands with what miraculous quickness will man shake off the outward semblance of grief when his sorrow is a secret the mighty merchant who knows that in fourandtwenty hours the world must be astounded by his insolvency will walk in the front of his confident creditor as if he were the lord of a thousand argosies the meditating suicide will smile on the arm of a companion as if to breathe in this sunny world were the most ravishing and rapturous bliss we cling to our stations in our fellowcreatures minds and memories we know too well the frail tenure on which we are in this world great and considered personages experience makes us shrink from the specious sneer of sympathy and when we are ourselves falling bitter memory whispers that we have ourselves been neglectful  and so it was that even unto these infants vivian grey dared not appear other than a gay and easyhearted man and in a moment he was dancing them on his knee and playing with their curls and joining in their pretty prattle and pressing their small and fragrant lips  it was night when he paced down he passed his club that club to become a member of which had once been the object of his high ambition and to gain which privilege had cost such hours of canvassing such interference of noble friends and the incurring of favours from so many people which never could be forgotten  a desperate feeling actuated him and he entered the clubhouse he walked into the great saloon and met some fifty most particular friends all of whom asked him how the marquess did or have you seen cleveland and a thousand other as comfortable queries at length to avoid these disagreeable rencontres and indeed to rest himself he went to a smaller and more private room as he opened the door his eyes lighted upon cleveland  he was standing with his back to the fire there were only two other persons in the room one was a friend of clevelands and the other an acquaintance of vivians the latter was writing at the table  when vivian saw cleveland he would have retired but he was bid to come in in a voice of thunder  as he entered he instantly perceived that cleveland was under the influence of wine when in this situation unlike other men mr clevelands conduct was not distinguished by any of the little improprieties of behaviour by which a man is always known by his friends to be very drunk he neither reeled nor hiccuped nor grew maudlin the effect of drinking upon him was only to increase the intensity of the sensation by which his mind was at the moment influenced he did not even lose the consciousness of identity of persons at this moment it was clear to vivian that cleveland was under the influence of the extremest passion his eyes rolled wildly and seemed fixed only upon vacancy as vivian was no friend to scenes before strangers he bowed to the two gentlemen and saluted cleveland with his wonted cordiality but his proffered hand was rudely repelled  away exclaimed cleveland in a furious tone i have no friendship for traitors  the two gentlemen stared and the pen of the writer stopped  cleveland said vivian in an earnest whisper as he came up close to him for gods sake contain yourself i have written you a letter which explains all but  out out upon you out upon your honied words and your soft phrases i have been their dupe too long and he struck vivian  sir john poynings said vivian with a quivering lip turning to the gentleman who was writing at the table we were schoolfellows circumstances have prevented us from meeting often in afterlife but i now ask you with the frankness of an old acquaintance to do me the sad service of accompanying me in this quarrel a quarrel which i call heaven to witness is not of my seeking  the baronet who was in the guards and although a great dandy quite a man of business in these matters immediately rose from his seat and led vivian to a corner of the room after some whispering he turned round to mr cleveland and bowed to him with a very significant look it was evident that cleveland comprehended his meaning for though he was silent he immediately pointed to the other gentleman his friend mr castleton  mr castleton said sir john giving his card mr grey will accompany me to my rooms in pall mall it is now ten oclock we shall wait two hours in which time i hope to hear from you i leave time and place and terms to yourself i only wish it to be understood that it is the particular desire of my principal that the meeting should be as speedy as possible  about eleven oclock the communication from mr castleton arrived it was quite evident that cleveland was sobered for in one instance vivian observed that the style was corrected by his own hand the hour was eight the next morning at  common about six miles from town  poynings wrote to a professional friend to be on the ground at halfpast seven and then he and vivian retired  did you ever fight a duel no nor send a challenge either well you are fresh indeed tis an awkward business after all even for the boldest after an immense deal of negotiation and giving your opponent every opportunity of coming to an honourable understanding the fatal letter is at length signed sealed and sent you pass your mornings at your seconds apartments pacing his drawingroom with a quivering lip and uncertain step at length he enters with an answer and while be reads you endeavour to look easy with a countenance merry with the most melancholy smile you have no appetite for dinner but you are too brave not to appear at table and you are called out after the second glass by the arrival of your solicitor who comes to alter your will you pass a restless night and rise in the morning as bilious as a bengal general urged by impending fate you make a desperate effort to accommodate matters but in the contest between your pride and your terror you at the same time prove that you are a coward and fail in the negotiation you both fire and miss and then the seconds interfere and then you shake hands everything being arranged in the most honourable manner and to the mutual satisfaction of both parties the next day you are seen pacing bond street with an erect front and a flashing eye with an air at once dandyish and heroical a mixture at the same time of brummell and the duke of wellington  it was a fine february morning sir john drove vivian to the ground in his cabriolet  nothing like a cab grey for the business you are going on you glide along the six miles in such style that it actually makes you quite courageous i remember once going down on a similar purpose in a post and pair and pon my soul when i came to the ground my hand shook so that i could scarcely draw but i was green then now when i go in my cab with philidor with his sixteenmileanhour paces egad i wing my man in a trice and take all the parties home to pall mall to celebrate the event with a grilled bone havannahs and regents punch ah there that is cleveland that we have just passed going to the ground in a chariot he is a dead man or my name is not poynings  come sir john no fear of clevelands dying said vivian with a smile  what you mean to fire in the air and all that sort of thing sentimental but slipslop  the ground is measured all is arranged cleveland a splendid shot fired first he grazed vivians elbow vivian fired in the air the seconds interfered cleveland was implacable and in the most irregular manner as sir john declared insisted upon another shot to the astonishment of all he fired quite wild vivian shot at random and his bullet pierced clevelands heart cleveland sprang nearly two yards from the ground and then fell upon his back in a moment vivian was at the side of his fallen antagonist but the dying man made no sign he stared wildly and then closed his eyes for ever     chapter vi   when vivian grey remembered his existence he found himself in bed the curtains of his couch were closed but as he stared around him they were softly withdrawn and a face that recalled everything to his recollection gazed upon him with a look of affectionate anxiety  my father exclaimed vivian but the finger pressed on the parental lip warned him to silence his father knelt by his side and then the curtains were again closed  six weeks unconsciously to vivian had elapsed since the fatal day and he was now recovering from the effects of a fever from which his medical attendants had supposed he never could have rallied and what had been the past it did indeed seem like a hot and feverish dream here was he once more in his own quiet room watched over by his beloved parents and had there then ever existed such beings as the marquess and mrs lorraine and cleveland or were they only the actors in a vision it must be so thought vivian and he jumped up in his bed and stared wildly around him and yet it was a horrid dream murder horrible murder and so real so palpable i muse upon their voices as upon familiar sounds and i recall all the events not as the shadowy incidents of sleep that mysterious existence in which the experience of a century seems caught in the breathing of a second but as the natural and material consequences of time and stirring life o no it is too true shrieked the wretched sufferer as his eye glanced upon a despatchbox which was on the table and which had been given to him by lord carabas it is true it is true murder murder he foamed at the mouth and sank exhausted on his pillow  but the human mind can master many sorrows and after a desperate relapse and another miraculous rally vivian grey rose from his bed  my father i fear that i shall live  hope rather my beloved  oh why should i hope and the sufferers head sank upon his breast  do not give way my son all will yet be well and we shall all yet be happy said the father with streaming eyes  happy oh not in this world my father  vivian my dearest your mother visited you this morning but you were asleep she was quite happy to find you slumbering so calmly  and yet my dreams were not the dreams of joy o my mother you were wont to smile upon me alas you smiled upon your sorrow  vivian my beloved you must indeed restrain your feelings at your age life cannot be the lost game you think it a little repose and i shall yet see my boy the honour to society which he deserves to be  alas my father you know not what i feel the springiness of my mind has gone o man what a vain fool thou art nature has been too bountiful to thee she has given thee the best of friends and thou valuest not the gift of exceeding price until the griefs are past even friendships cure o my father why did i leave thee and he seized mr greys hand with convulsive grasp  time flew on even in this house of sorrow my boy said mr grey to his son one day your mother and i have been consulting together about you and we think now that you have somewhat recovered your strength it may be well for you to leave england for a short time the novelty of travel will relieve your mind without too much exciting it and if you can manage by the autumn to settle down anywhere within a thousand miles of england why we will come and join you and you know that will be very pleasant what say you to this little plan  in a few weeks after this proposition had been made vivian grey was in germany he wandered for some months in that beautiful land of rivers among which flows the rhine matchless in its loveliness and at length the pilgrim shook the dust off his feet at heidelberg in which city vivian proposed taking up his residence it is in truth a place of surpassing loveliness where all the romantic wildness of german scenery is blended with the soft beauty of the italian an immense plain which in its extent and luxuriance reminds you of the fertile tracts of lombardy is bordered on one side by the bergstrasse mountains and on the other by the range of the vosges situate on the river neckar in a ravine of the bergstrasse amid mountains covered with vines is heidelberg its ruined castle backing the city and still frowning from one of the most commanding heights in the middle of the broad plain may be distinguished the shining spires of mannheim worms and frankenthal and pouring its rich stream through this luxuriant land the beautiful and abounding rhine receives the tribute of the neckar the range of the vosges forms the extreme distance  to the little world of the little city of which he was now an habitant vivian grey did not appear a brokenhearted man he lived neither as a recluse nor a misanthrope he became extremely addicted to field sports especially to hunting the wild boar for he feared nothing so much as thought and dreaded nothing so much as the solitude of his own chamber he was an early riser to escape from hideous dreams and at break of dawn he wandered among the wild passes of the bergstrasse or climbing a lofty ridge was a watcher for the rising sun and in the evening he sailed upon the starlit neckar     book v   chapter i   thou rapid aar thy waves are swollen by the snows of a thousand hills but for whom are thy leaping waters fed is it for the rhine  calmly o placid neckar does thy blue stream glide through thy vineclad vales but calmer seems thy course when it touches the rushing rhine  how fragrant are the banks which are cooled by thy darkgreen waters thou tranquil maine but is not the perfume sweeter of the gardens of the rhine  thou impetuous nah i lingered by thine islands of nightingales and i asked thy rushing waters why they disturbed the music of thy groves they told me they were hastening to the rhine  red moselle fierce is the swell of thy spreading course but why do thy broad waters blush when they meet the rhine  thou delicate meuse how clear is the current of thy limpid wave as the wife yields to the husband do thy pure waters yield to the rhine  and thou triumphant and imperial river flushed with the tribute of these vassal streams thou art thyself a tributary and hastenest even in the pride of conquest to confess thine own vassalage but no superior stream exults in the homage of thy servile waters the ocean the eternal ocean alone comes forward to receive thy kiss not as a conqueror but as a parent he welcomes with proud joy his gifted child the offspring of his honour thy duty his delight thy tribute thine own glory  once more upon thy banks most beauteous rhine in the springtime of my youth i gazed on thee and deemed thee matchless thy vineenamoured mountains thy spreading waters thy traditionary crags thy shining cities the sparkling villages of thy winding shores thy antique convents thy grey and silent castles the purple glories of thy radiant grape the vivid tints of thy teeming flowers the fragrance of thy sky the melody of thy birds whose carols tell the pleasures of their sunny woods are they less lovely now less beautiful less sweet  the keen emotions of our youth are often the occasion of our estimating too ardently but the first impression of beauty though often overcharged is seldom supplanted and as the first great author which he reads is reverenced by the boy as the most immortal and the first beautiful woman that he meets is sanctified by him as the most adorable so the impressions created upon us by those scenes of nature which first realise the romance of our reveries never escape from our minds and are ever consecrated in our memories and thus some great spirits after having played their part on the theatre of the world have retired from the blaze of courts and cities to the sweet seclusion of some spot with which they have accidentally met in the earliest years of their career  but we are to speak of one who had retired from the world before his time  upwards of a year had elapsed since vivian grey left england the mode of life which he pursued at heidelberg for many months has already been mentioned he felt himself a brokenhearted man and looked for death whose delay was no blessing but the feelings of youth which had misled him in his burning hours of joy equally deceived him in his days of sorrow he lived and in the course of time found each day that life was less burdensome the truth is that if it be the lot of man to suffer it is also his fortune to forget oblivion and sorrow share our being as darkness and light divide the course of time it is not in human nature to endure extremities and sorrows soon destroy either us or themselves perhaps the fate of niobe is no fable but a type of the callousness of our nature there is a time in human suffering when succeeding sorrows are but like snow falling on an iceberg it is indeed horrible to think that our peace of mind should arise not from a retrospection of the past but from a forgetfulness of it but though this peace be produced at the best by a mental opiate it is not valueless and oblivion after all is a just judge as we retain but a faint remembrance of our felicity it is but fair that the smartest stroke of sorrow should if bitter at least be brief but in feeling that he might yet again mingle in the world vivian grey also felt that he must meet mankind with different feelings and view their pursuits with a different interest he woke from his secret sorrow in as changed a state of being as the water nymph from her first embrace and he woke with a new possession not only as miraculous as undines soul but gained at as great a price and leading to as bitter results the nymph woke to new pleasures and to new sorrows and innocent as an infant she deemed mankind a god and the world a paradise vivian grey discovered that this deity was but an idol of brass and this garden of eden but a savage waste for if the river nymph had gained a soul he had gained experience  experience mysterious spirit whose result is felt by all whose nature is described by none the father warns the son of thy approach and sometimes looks to thee as his offsprings cure and his own consolation we hear of thee in the nursery we hear of thee in the world we hear of thee in books but who has recognised thee until he was thy subject and who has discovered the object of so much fame until he has kissed thy chain to gain thee is the work of all and the curse of all thou art at the same time necessary to our happiness and destructive of our felicity thou art the saviour of all things and the destroyer of all things our best friend and our bitterest enemy for thou teachest us truth and that truth is despair ye youth of england would that ye could read this riddle  to wake from your bright hopes and feel that all is vanity to be roused from your crafty plans and know that all is worthless is a bitter but your sure destiny escape is impossible for despair is the price of conviction how many centuries have fled since solomon in his cedar palaces sung the vanity of man though his harp was golden and his throne of ivory his feelings were not less keen and his conviction not less complete how many sages of all nations have since the monarch of jerusalem echoed his sad philosophy yet the vain bubble still glitters and still allures and must for ever  the genealogy of experience is brief for experience is the child of thought and thought is the child of action we cannot learn men from books nor can we form from written descriptions a more accurate idea of the movements of the human heart than we can of the movements of nature a man may read all his life and form no conception of the rush of a mountain torrent or the waving of a forest of pines in a storm and a man may study in his closet the heart of his fellowcreatures for ever and have no idea of the power of ambition or the strength of revenge  it is when we have acted ourselves and have seen others acting it is when we have laboured ourselves under the influence of our passions and have seen others labouring it is when our great hopes have been attained or have been baulked it is when after having had the human heart revealed to us we have the first opportunity to think it is then that the whole truth lights upon us it is then that we ask of ourselves whether it be wise to endure such anxiety of mind such agitation of spirit such harrowing of the soul to gain what may cease to interest tomorrow or for which at the best a few years of enjoyment can alone be afforded it is then that we waken to the hollowness of all human things it is then that the sayings of sages and the warnings of prophets are explained and understood it is then that we gain experience  vivian grey was now about to join for the second time the great and agitated crowd of beings who are all intent in the search after that undiscoverable talisman happiness that he entertained any hope of being the successful inquirer is not to be imagined he considered that the happiest moment in human life is exactly the sensation of a sailor who has escaped a shipwreck and that the mere belief that his wishes are to be indulged is the greatest bliss enjoyed by man  how far his belief was correct how he prospered in this his second venture on the great ocean of life it is our business to relate there were moments when he wished himself neither experienced nor a philosopher moments when he looked back to the lost paradise of his innocent boyhood those glorious hours when the unruffled river of his life mirrored the cloudless heaven of his hope     chapter ii   vivian pulled up his horse as he ascended through the fine beechwood which leads immediately to the city of frankfort from the darmstadt road the crowd seemed to increase every moment but as they were all hastening the same way his progress was not much impeded it was frankfort fair and all countenances were expressive of that excitement which we always experience at great meetings of our fellowcreatures whether the assemblies be for slaughter pleasure or profit and whether or not we ourselves join in the banquet the battle or the fair at the top of the hill is an old roman tower and from this point the flourishing city of frankfort with its picturesque cathedral its numerous villas and beautiful gardens in the middle of the fertile valley of the maine burst upon vivians sight on crossing the bridge over the river the crowd became almost impassable and it was with the greatest difficulty that vivian steered his way through the old narrow winding streets full of tall ancient houses with heavy casements and notched gable ends these structures did not however at the present moment greet the traveller with their usual sombre and antique appearance their outside walls were in most instances covered with pieces of broad cloth of the most showy colours red blue and yellow predominating these standards of trade were not merely used for the purpose of exhibiting the quality of the article sold in the interior but also of informing the curious traveller the name and nation of their adventurous owners inscriptions in german french russian english italian and even hebrew appeared in striking characters on each woollen specimen and as if these were not sufficient to attract the attention of the passenger an active apprentice or assistant commented in eloquent terms on the peculiar fairness and honesty of his master the public squares and other open spaces and indeed every spot which was secure from the hurrying wheels of the heavy oldfashioned coaches of the frankfort aristocracy and the spirited pawings of their sleek and longtailed coachhorses were covered with large and showy booths which groaned under the accumulated treasures of all countries french silks and french clocks rivalled manchester cottons and sheffield cutlery and assisted to attract or entrap the gazer in company with venetian chains neapolitan coral and vienna pipeheads here was the booth of a great bookseller who looked to the approaching leipsic fair for some consolation for his slow sale and the bad taste of the people of frankfort and there was a dealer in bologna sausages who felt quite convinced that in some things the taste of the frankfort public was by no means to be lightly spoken of all was bustle bargaining and business there were quarrels and conversation in all languages and vivian grey although he had no chance either of winning or losing money was amused  at last vivian gained the high street and here though the crowd was not less the space was greater and so in time he arrived at the grand hotel of the roman emperor where he stopped it was a long time before he could be informed whether baron julius von konigstein at present honoured that respectable establishment with his presence for although vivian did sometimes succeed in obtaining an audience of a hurrying waiter that personage when in a hurry has a peculiar habit of never attending to a question which a traveller addresses to him in this dilemma vivian was saluted by a statelylooking personage above the common height he was dressed in a very splendid uniform of green and gold covered with embroidery and glittering with frogs he wore a cocked hat adorned with a flowing particoloured plume and from his broad golden belt was suspended a weapon of singular shape and costly workmanship this personage was as stiff and stately as he was magnificent his eyes were studiously preserved from the profanation of meeting the ground and his wellsupported neck seldom condescended to move from its perpendicular position his coat was buttoned to the chin and over the breast with the exception of one small aperture which was elegantly filled up by a delicate white cambric handkerchief very redolent of rich perfumes this gorgeous gentleman who might have been mistaken for an elector of the german empire had the german empire been in existence or the governor of the city at the least turned out to be the chasseur of the baron von konigstein and with his courtly assistance vivian soon found himself ascending the staircase of the roman emperor  vivian was ushered into an apartment in which he found three or four individuals at breakfast a middleaged man of distinguished appearance in a splendid chamber robe sprung up from a manycushioned easychair and seized his hand as he was announced  my dear mr grey i have left notes for you at the principal hotels and how is eugene wild blood for a student but an excellent heart and you have been so kind to him he feels under such particular obligations to you will you breakfast ah i see you smile at my supposing a horseman unbreakfasted and have you ridden here from heidelberg this morning impossible only from darmstadt i thought so you were at the opera then last night and how is the little signora we are to gain her though trust the good people of frankfort for that pray be seated but really i am forgetting the commonest rules of breeding next to the pleasure of having friends is that of introducing them to each other prince you will have great pleasure in being introduced to my friend mr grey mr grey prince salvinski my particular friend prince salvinski the count von altenburgh mr grey my very particular friend the count von altenburgh and the chevalier de boeffleurs mr grey my most particular friend the chevalier de boeffleurs  baron julius von konigstein was minister to the diet of frankfort from a firstrate german power in person he was short but delicately formed his head a little bald but as he was only fiveandthirty this could scarcely be from age and his remaining hair black glossy and curling proved that their companion ringlets had not been long lost his features were small but not otherwise remarkable except a pair of liquid black eyes of great size which would have hardly become a stoic and which gleamed with great meaning and perpetual animation  i understand mr grey that you are a regular philosopher pray who is the favourite master kant or fichte or is there any other new star who has discovered the origin of our essence and proved the nonnecessity of eating count let me help you to a little more of these saucisses aux choux i am afraid from eugenes account that you are almost past redemption and i am sorry to say that although i am very desirous of being your physician and effecting your cure frankfort will supply me with very few means to work your recovery if you could but get me an appointment once again to your delightful london i might indeed produce some effect or were i even at berlin or at your delicious vienna count altenburgh the count bowed or at that paradise of women warsaw prince salvinski the prince bowed or at paris chevalier the chevalier bowed why then indeed you should have some difficulty in finding an excuse for being in low spirits with julius von konigstein but frankfort eh de boeffleurs  oh frankfort sighed the french chevalier who was also attached to a mission in this very city and who was thinking of his own gay boulevards and his brilliant tuileries  we are mere citizens here continued the baron taking a long pinch of snuff mere citizens do you snuff and here he extended to vivian a gold box covered with the portrait of a crowned head surrounded with diamonds a present from the king of sardinia when i negotiated the marriage of the duke of  and his niece and settled the longagitated controversy about the right of anchovy fishing on the left shore of the mediterranean  but the women continued the baron the women that is a different thing there is some amusement among the little bourgeoises who are glad enough to get rid of their commercial beaus whose small talk after a waltz is about bills of exchange mixed up with a little patriotism about their free city and some chatter about what they call the fine arts their awful collections of the dutch school school forsooth a cabbage by gerard dowl and a candlestick by mieris and now will you take a basin of soup and warm yourself while his highness continues his account of being frozen to death this spring at the top of montblanc how was it prince  your highness has been a great traveller said vivian  i have seen a little of most countries these things are interesting enough when we are young but when we get a little more advanced in life the novelty wears off and the excitement ceases i have been in all quarters of the globe in europe i have seen everything except the miracles of prince hohenlohe in asia everything except the ruins of babylon in africa i have seen every thing but timbuctoo and in america everything except crokers mountains  next to eating music is the business in which an austrian is most interested and count von altenburgh having had the misfortune of destroying for the present one great source of his enjoyment became now very anxious to know what chance there existed of his receiving some consolation from the other pushing his plate briskly from him he demanded with an anxious air can any gentleman inform me what chance there is of the signora coming  no news today said the baron with a mournful look i am almost in despair what do you think of the last notes that have been interchanged  very little chance said the chevalier de boeffleurs shaking his head really these burghers with all their affected enthusiasm have managed the business exceedingly bad no opera can possibly succeed that is not conducted by a committee of noblemen  certainly said the baron we are sure then to have the best singers and be in the gazette the same season  which is much better i think von konigstein than paying our bills and receiving no pleasure  but continued the baron these clumsy burghers with their affected enthusiasm as you well observe who could have contemplated such novices in diplomacy whatever may be the issue i can at least lay my head upon my pillow and feel that i have done my duty did not i de boeffleurs first place the negotiation on a basis of acknowledged feasibility and mutual benefit who drew the protocol i should like to know who baffled the intrigues of the english minister the lord amelius fitzfudge boroughby who sat up one whole night with the signoras friend the russian envoy baron squallonoff and who was it that first arranged about the extra chariot and here the representative of a firstrate german power looked very much like a resigned patriot who feels that he deserves a ribbon  no doubt of it my dear von konigstein echoed the french chargé daffaires and i think whatever may be the result that i too may look back to this negotiation with no ungratified feelings had the arrangement been left as i had wished merely to the ministers of the great powers i am confident that the signora would have been singing this night in our opera house  what is the grand point of difference at present asked the austrian  a terrific one said the baron the lady demanded twenty covers two tables two carriages one of which i arranged should be a chariot that at least the town owes to me and what else merely a town mansion and establishment exerting myself day and night these terms were at length agreed to by the municipality and the lady was to ride over from darmstadt to sign and seal in the course of her ride she took a cursed fancy to the country villa of a great jew banker and since that moment the arrangement has gone off we have offered her everything the commandants country castle his ladys country farm the villa of the director of the opera the retreat of our present prima donna all in vain we have even hinted at a temporary repose in a neighbouring royal residence but all useless the banker and the signora are equally intractable and frankfort is in despair  she ought to have signed and sealed at darmstadt said the count very indignantly  to be sure they should have closed upon her caprice and taken her when she was in the fancy  talking of opera girls commenced the polish prince i remember the countess katszinski  your highness has nothing upon your plate quickly retorted the baron who was in no humour for a story  nothing more i thank you continued the prince as i was saying i remember the countess katszinski but just at this moment the door opened and ernstorff entered and handed a despatch to the baron recommending it to his excellencys particular attention  business i suppose said the plenipotentiary it may wait till tomorrow  from m clarionet your excellency  from m clarionet eagerly exclaimed the baron and tore open the epistle gentlemen congratulate me congratulate yourselves congratulate frankfort and the diplomatist overcome leant back in his chair she is ours salvinski she is ours von altenburgh she is ours my dear de boeffleurs mr grey you are most fortunate the signora has signed and sealed all is arranged she sings tonight what a finespirited body is this frankfort municipality what elevation of soul what genuine enthusiasm eh de boeffleurs  most genuine exclaimed the chevalier who hated german music with all his heart and was now humming an air from la dame blanche  but mind my dear friend this is a secret a cabinet secret the municipality are to have the gratification of announcing the event to the city in a public decree it is but fair i feel that i have only to hint to secure your silence  at this moment with a thousand protestations of secresy the party broke up each hastening to have the credit of first spreading the joyful intelligence through the circles and of depriving the frankfort senate of their hardearned gratification the baron who was in high spirits ordered the carriage to drive vivian round the ramparts where he was to be introduced to some of the most fashionable beauties previous to the evening triumph     chapter iii   vivian passed a week very agreeably at frankfort in the baron and his friends he found the companions that he had need of their conversation and pursuits diverted his mind without engaging his feelings and allowed him no pause to brood there were moments indeed when he found in the baron a companion neither frivolous nor uninstructive his excellency had travelled in most countries and had profited by his travels his taste for the fine arts was equalled by his knowledge of them and his acquaintance with many of the most eminent men of europe enriched his conversation with a variety of anecdotes to which his lively talents did ample justice he seemed fond at times of showing vivian that he was not a mere artificial man of the world destitute of all feelings and thinking only of himself he recurred with satisfaction to moments of his life when his passions had been in full play and while he acknowledged the errors of his youth with candour he excused them with grace in short vivian and he became what the world calls friends that is to say they were men who had no objection to dine in each others company provided the dinner were good assist each other in any scrape provided no particular personal responsibility were incurred by the assistant and live under the same roof provided each were master of his own time vivian and the baron indeed did more than this they might have been described as particular friends for his excellency had persuaded our hero to accompany him for the summer to the baths of ems a celebrated german wateringplace situate in the duchy of nassau in the vicinity of the rhine  on the morrow they were to commence their journey the fair of frankfort which had now lasted nearly a month was at its close a bright sunshiny afternoon was stealing into twilight when vivian escaping from the principal street and the attractions of the braunfels or chief shops under the exchange directed his steps to some of the more remote and ancient streets in crossing a little square his attention was excited by a crowd which had assembled round a conjuror who from the top of a small cart which he had converted into a stage was haranguing in front of a green curtain an audience with great fervency and apparently with great effect at least vivian judged so from the loud applauses which constantly burst forth the men pressed nearer shouted and clapped their hands and the anxious mothers struggled to lift their brats higher in the air that they might early form a due conception of the powers of magic and learn that the maternal threats which were sometimes extended to them at home were not mere idle boasting altogether the men with their cocked hats stiff holiday coats and long pipes the women with their glazed gowns of bright fancy patterns close lace caps or richlychased silver headgear and the children with their gaping mouths and long heads of hair offered quaint studies for a german or flemish painter vivian became also one of the audience and not an uninterested one  the appearance of the conjuror was peculiar he was not much more than five feet high but so slightly formed that he reminded you rather of the boy than the dwarf the upper part of his face was even delicately moulded his sparkling black eyes became his round forehead which was not too much covered by his short glossy black hair his complexion was clear but quite olive his nose was very small and straight and contrasted singularly with his enormous mouth the thin bluish lips of which were seldom closed and consequently did not conceal his large square teeth which though very white were set apart and were so solid that they looked almost like double teeth this enormous mouth which was supported by large jawbones attracted the attention of the spectator so keenly that it was some time before you observed the prodigious size of the ears which also adorned this extraordinary countenance the costume of this being was not less remarkable than his natural appearance he wore a complete under dress of pliant leather which fitted close up to his throat and down to his wrists and ankles where it was clasped with large fastenings either of gold or some gilt material this with the addition of a species of hussar jacket of green cloth which was quite unadorned with the exception of its vivid red lining was the sole covering of the conjuror who with a light cap and feather in his hand was now haranguing the spectators the object of his discourse was a panegyric of himself and a satire on all other conjurors he was the only conjuror the real one a worthy descendant of the magicians of old  were i to tell that broadfaced herr continued the conjuror who is now gaping opposite to me that this rod is the rod of aaron mayhap he would call me a liar yet were i to tell him that he was the son of his father he would not think it wonderful and yet can he prove it my friends if i am a liar the whole world is a liar and yet any one of you wholl go and proclaim that on the braunfels will get his skull cracked every truth is not to be spoken and every lie is not to be punished i have told you that it is better for you to spend your money in seeing my tricks than in swigging schnaps in the chimney corner and yet my friends this may be a lie i have told you that the profits of this whole night shall be given to some poor and worthy person in this town and perhaps i shall give them to myself what then i shall speak the truth and you will perhaps crack my skull is this a reward for truth o generation of vipers my friends what is truth who can find it in frankfort suppose i call upon you mr baker and sup with you this evening you will receive me as a neighbourly man should tell me to make myself at home and do as i like is it not so i see you smile as if my visit would make you bring out one of the bottles of your best asmanshausen  here the crowd laughed out for we are always glad when there is any talk of anothers hospitality being put to the test although we stand no chance of sharing in the entertainment ourselves the baker looked foolish as all men singled out in a crowd do  well well continued the conjuror i have no doubt his wine would be as ready as your tobacco mr smith or a wafila from your basket my honest cakeseller and so saying with a long thin wand the conjuror jerked up the basket of an itinerant and shouting pastrycook and immediately began to thrust the contents into his mouth with a rapidity ludicrously miraculous the laugh now burst out again but the honest baker joined in it this time with an easy spirit  be not disconcerted my little custardmonger if thou art honest thou shalt prosper did i not say that the profits of this night were for the most poor and the most honest if thy stock in trade were in thy basket my raspberrypuff verily thou art not now the richest here and so therefore if thy character be a fair one that is to say if thou only cheat five times a day and give a tenth of thy cheatery to the poor thou shalt have the benefit i ask thee again what is truth if i sup with the baker and he tells me to do what i like with all that is his and i kiss his wife he will kick me out yet to kiss his wife might be my pleasure if her breath were sweet i ask thee again what is truth truth they say lies in a well but perhaps this is a lie how do we know that truth is not in one of these two boxes asked the conjuror placing his cap on his head and holding one small snuffbox to a tall savagelooking oneeyed bohemian who with a comrade had walked over from the austrian garrison at mentz  i see but one box growled the soldier  it is because thou hast only one eye friend open the other and thou shalt see two said the conjuror in a slow malicious tone with his neck extended and his hand with the hateful box outstretched in it  now by our black lady of altoting ill soon stop thy prate chitterling bellowed the enraged bohemian  murder the protection of the free city against the emperor of austria the king of bohemia hungary and lombardy and the knave retreated to the very extremity of the stage and affecting agitating fear hid himself behind the green curtain from a side of which his head was alone visible or rather an immense red tongue which wagged in all shapes at the unlucky soldier except when it retired to the interior of his mouth to enable him to reiterate murder and invoke the privileges of the free city of frankfort  when the soldier was a little cooled the conjuror again came forward and having moved his small magical table to a corner and lit two tapers one of which he placed at each side of the stage he stripped off his hussar jacket and began to imitate a monkey an animal which by the faint light in his singular costume he very much resembled how amusing were his pranks he first plundered a rice plantation and then he cracked cocoanuts then he washed his face and arranged his toilet with his right paw and finally he ran a race with his own tail which humorous appendage to his body was very wittily performed for the occasion by a fragment of an old tarred rope his gambols were so diverting that they even extracted applause from his enemy the oneeyed serjeant and emboldened by the acclamations from monkeys the conjuror began to imitate men he first drank like a dutchman and having reeled round with a thousand oaths to the manifold amusement of the crowd he suddenly began to smoke like a prussian nothing could be more admirable than the look of complacent and pompous stolidity with which he accompanied each puff of his pipe the applause was continued and the oneeyed bohemian serjeant delighted at the ridicule which was heaped on his military rival actually threw the mimic some groschen  keep thy pence friend said the conjuror thou wilt soon owe me more we have not yet closed accounts my friends i have drank like a dutchman i have smoked like a prussian and now i will eat like an austrian and here the immense mouth of the actor seemed distended even a hundred degrees bigger while with gloating eyes and extended arms he again set to at the halfemptied wafila basket of the unhappy pastrycook  now by our black lady of altoting thou art an impudent varlet growled the austrian soldier  you are losing your temper again retorted the glutton with his mouth full how difficult you are to please well then if the austrians may not be touched what say you to a bohemian a tall oneeyed bohemian serjeant with an appetite like a hog and a liver like a lizard  now by our black lady of altoting this is too much and the soldier sprang at the conjuror  hold him cried vivian grey for the mob frightened at the soldier gave way  there is a gentles voice under a dark cloak cried the conjuror but i want no assistance and so saying with a dexterous spring the conjuror leaped over the heads of two or three staring children and lighted on the nape of the serjeants gigantic neck placing his forefingers behind each of the soldiers ears he threatened to slit them immediately if he were not quiet the serjeants companion of course came to his rescue but vivian engaged him and attempted to arrange matters my friends surely a gay word at a fair is not to meet with military punishment what is the use of living in the free city of frankfort or indeed in any other city if jokes are to be answered with oaths and a light laugh met with a heavy blow avoid bloodshed if possible but stand by the conjuror his business is jibes and jests and this is the first time that i ever saw merry andrew arrested come my good fellows said he to the soldiers we had better be off men so important as you and i should not be spectators of these mummeries the austrians who understood vivians compliment literally were not sorry to make a dignified retreat particularly as the mob encouraged by vivians interference began to show fight vivian also took his departure as soon as he could possibly steal off unnoticed but not before he had been thanked by the conjuror  i knew there was gentle blood under that cloak if you like to see the mystery of the crucifixion with the resurrection and real fireworks it begins at eight oclock and you shall be admitted gratis i knew there was gentle blood under that cloak and some day or other when your highness is in distress you shall not want the aid of essper george     chapter iv   it was late in the evening when a britzska stopped at the posthouse at coblentz the passageboat from bingen had just arrived and a portly judge from the danube a tall gaunt prussian officer a sketching english artist two university students and some clothmerchants returning from frankfort fair were busily occupied at a long table in the centre of the room at an ample banquet in which sourcrout cherrysoup and savoury sausages were not wanting so keen were the appetites of these worthies that the entrance of the new comers who seated themselves at a small table in the corner of the room was scarcely noticed and for halfanhour nothing was heard but the sound of crashing jaws and of rattling knives and forks how singular is the sight of a dozen hungry individuals intent upon their prey what a noisy silence a human voice was at length heard it proceeded from the fat judge a man at once convivial dignified and economical he had not spoken for two minutes before his character was evident to every person in the room although he flattered himself that his secret purpose was concealed from all tired with the thin moselle gratuitously allowed to the table the judge wished to comfort himself with a glass of more generous liquor aware of the price of a bottle of good rudesheimer he was desirous of forming a copartnership with one or two gentlemen in the venture still more aware of his exalted situation he felt it did not become him to appear in the eyes of any one as an unsuccessful suppliant  this moselle is very thin observed the judge shaking his head  very fair tablewine i think said the artist refilling his tumbler and then proceeding with his sketch which was a rough likeness in black chalk of the worthy magistrate himself  very good wine i think swore the prussian taking the bottle with the officer there was certainly no chance  the clothmerchants mixed even this thin moselle with water and therefore they could hardly be looked to as boon companions and the students were alone left a german student is no flincher at the bottle although he generally drinks beer these gentry however were no great favourites with the magistrate who was a loyal man of regular habits and no encourager of brawls duels and other still more disgraceful outrages to all which abominations besides drinking beer and chewing tobacco the german student is remarkably addicted but in the present case what was to be done he offered the nearest a pinch of snuff as a mode of commencing his acquaintance and cultivating his complacency the student dug his thumb into the box and with the additional aid of the forefinger sweeping out half its contents growled out something like thanks and then drew up in his seat as if he had too warmly encouraged the impertinent intrusion of a philistine to whom he had never been introduced  the clothmerchant ceasing from sipping his meek liquor and taking out of his pocket a letter from which he tore off the back carefully commenced collecting with his forefinger the particles of dispersed snuff in a small pyramid which when formed was dexterously slided into the paper then folded up and put into his pocket the prudent merchant contenting himself for the moment with the refreshment which was afforded to his senses by the truant particles which had remained in his nail  waiter a bottle of rudesheimer bellowed the judge and if any gentleman or gentlemen would like to join me they may he added in a more subdued tone no one answered and the bottle was put down the judge slowly poured out the bright yellow fluid into a tall bell glass adorned with a beautiful and encircling wreath of vine leaves he held the glass a moment before the lamp for his eye to dwell with still greater advantage on the transparent radiancy of the contents and then deliberately pouring them down his throat and allowing them to dwell a moment on his palate he uttered an emphatic bah and sucking in his breath leaned back in his chair the student immediately poured out a glass from the same bottle and drank it off the judge gave him a look and then blessed himself that though his boon companion was a brute still he would lessen the expense of the bottle which nearly amounted to a days pay and so he again filled his glass but this was merely to secure his fair portion he saw the student was a rapid drinker and although he did not like to hurry his own enjoyment he thought it most prudent to keep his glass well stored by his side  i hope your lordships have had a pleasant voyage exclaimed a man entering the room rapidly as he spoke and deliberately walking up to the table he pushed between two of the clothmerchants who quietly made way and then placing a small square box before him immediately opened it and sweeping aside the dishes and glasses which surrounded him began to fill their places with cups balls rings and other mysteriouslooking matters which generally accompany a conjuror  i hope your lordships have had a pleasant voyage i have been thinking of you all the day here the cups were arranged next to myself i am interested for my friends here the rice was sprinkled i came from fairyland this morning here the trick was executed will any gentleman lend me a handkerchief now sir tie any knot you choose tighter tighter tight as you can tight as you can now pull why sir wheres your knot here most of the company goodnaturedly laughed at a trick which had amused them before a hundred times but the dignified judge had no taste for such trivial amusements and besides he thought that all this noise spoilt the pleasure of his wine and prevented him from catching the flavour of his rudesheimer moreover the judge was not in a very good humour the student appeared to have little idea of the rules and regulations of a fair partnership for not only did he not regulate his draughts by the moderate example of his bottle companion but actually filled the glass of his university friend and even offered the precious green flask to his neighbour the clothmerchant that humble individual modestly refused the proffer the unexpected circumstance of having his health drank by a stranger seemed alone to have produced a great impression upon him and adding a little more water to his already diluted potation he bowed reverently to the student who in return did not notice him all these little circumstances prevented the judge from laughing at the performances of our friend essper george for we need hardly mention that the conjuror was no other his illhumour did not escape the lord of the cups and balls who as was his custom immediately began to torment him  will you choose a card asked the magician of the judge with a most humble look  no sir  essper george looked very penitent as if he felt he had taken a great liberty by his application and so to compensate for his incorrect behaviour he asked the magistrate whether he would have the goodness to lend him his watch the judge was irate and determined to give the intruder a set down  i am not one of those who can be amused by tricks that his grandfather knew  grandfather shrieked essper what a wonderful grandfather yours must have been all my tricks are fresh from fairyland this morning grandfather indeed pray is this your grandfather and here the conjuror leaning over the table with a rapid catch drew out from the fat paunch of the judge a long grinning wooden figure with great staring eyes and the parrot nose of a pulcinello the laugh which followed this sleightofhand was loud long and universal the judge lost his temper and essper george took the opportunity of the confusion to drink off the glass of rudesheimer which stood as we have mentioned ready charged at the magistrates elbow  the waiter now went round to collect the money of the various guests who had partaken of the boatsupper and of course charged the judge extra for his ordered bottle bowing at the same time very low as was proper to so good a customer these little attentions at inns encourage expenditure the judge tried at the same time the bottle which he found empty and applied to his two boon companions for their quota but the students affected a sort of brutal surprise at any one having the impudence to imagine that they were going to pay their proportion and flinging down the money for their own supper on the table they retired the magistrate calling loudly for the landlord followed them out of the room  essper george stood moralising at the table and emptying every glass whose contents were not utterly drained with the exception of the tumblers of the clothmerchants of whose liquor he did not approve  poor man to get only one glass out of his own bottle ay call for m maas threaten as you will your grandfather will not help you here blood out of a wall and money out of a student come the same day ah is your excellency here said essper turning round to our two travellers with affected surprise although he had observed them the whole time is your excellency here i have been looking for you through frankfort this whole morning there it will do for your glass it is of chamois leather and i made it myself from a beast i caught last summer in the valley of the rhone so saying he threw over vivians neck a neat chain or cord of curiouslyworked leather  who the devil is this grey asked the baron  a funny knave whom i once saved from a thrashing or something of the kind which i do him the justice to say he well deserved  who the devil is this said essper george why that is exactly the same question i myself asked when i saw a tall pompous proud fellow dressed like a peacock on a may morning standing at the door just now he looked as if he would pass himself off for an ambassador at least but i told him that if he got his wages paid he was luckier than most servants was i right your excellency  poor ernstorff said the baron laughing yes he certainly gets paid here you are a clever varlet fill your glass  no no wine dont you hear the brawling and nearly the bloodshed which are going on upstairs about a sour bottle of rudesheimer and here i see two gentles who have ordered the best wine merely to show that they are masters and not servants of the green peacock and lo cannot get through a glass lord lord what is man if my fat friend and his grandfather would but come down stairs again here is liquor enough to make wine and water of the danube for he comes from thence by his accent no ill have none of your wine keep it to throw on the sandy floor that the dust may not hurt your delicate shoes nor dirt the hand of the gentleman in green and gold when he cleans them for you in the morning  here the baron laughed again and as he bore his impertinence essper george immediately became polite  does your highness go to ems  we hardly know my friend  oh go there gentlemen i have tried them all aixlachapelle spa wiesbaden carlsbad pyrmont every one of them but what are these to ems there we all live in the same house and eat from the same table when there i feel that you are all under my protection i consider you all as my children besides the country how delightful the mountains the valleys the river the woods and then the company so select no sharpers no adventurers no blacklegs at ems you can be taken in by no one except your intimate friend to ems by all means i would advise you however to send the gentleman in the cocked hat on before you to engage rooms for i can assure you that you will have a hard chance the baths are very full  and how do you get there essper asked vivian  those are subjects on which i never speak answered the conjuror with a solemn air  but have you all your stockintrade with you my good fellow where is the mystery  sold sir sold i never keep to anything long variety is the mother of enjoyment at ems i shall not be a conjuror but i never part with my box it takes no more room than one of those medicine chests which i dare say you have got with you in your carriage to prop up your couple of shattered constitutions  by jove you are a merry impudent fellow said the baron and if you like to get up behind my britzska you may  no i carry my own box and my own body and i shall be at ems tomorrow in time enough to receive your lordships     chapter v   in a delightful valley of nassau formed by the picturesque windings of the taunus mountains and on the banks of the noisy river lahn stands a vast brick pile of irregular architecture which nearly covers an acre of ground this building was formerly a favourite palace of the ducal house of nassau but the present prince has thought proper to let out the former residence of his family as an hotel for the accommodation of the company who in the season frequent this the most lovely spot in his lovely little duchy this extensive building contains two hundred and thirty rooms and eighty baths and these apartments which are under the management of an official agent who lives in the princely bathing house for such is its present dignified title are to be engaged at fixed prices which are marked over the doors all the rooms in the upper story of the princely bathing house open on or are almost immediately connected with a long corridor which extends the whole length of the building the groundfloor besides the space occupied by the baths also affords a spacious promenade arched with stone and surrounded with stalls behind which are marshalled vendors of all the possible articles which can be required by the necessities of the frequenters of a wateringplace there you are greeted by the jeweller of the palais royal and the marchande de mode of the rue de la paix the printseller from mannheim and the chinadealer from dresden and other small speculators in the various fancy articles which abound in vienna berlin geneva basle strasburg and lausanne such as pipes costumes of swiss peasantry crosses of mont blanc crystal and all varieties of national bijouterie all things may here be sold save those which administer to the nourishment of the body or the pleasure of the palate let not those of my readers who have already planned a trip to the sweet vales of the taunus be frightened by this last sentence at ems eatables and drinkables are excellent and abounding but they are solely supplied by the restaurateur who farms the monopoly from the duke this gentleman who is a pupil of beauvilliers and who has conceived an exquisite cuisine by adding to the lighter graces of french cookery something of the more solid virtues of the german presides in a saloon of vast size and magnificent decoration in which during the season upwards of three hundred persons frequent the table dhôte it is the etiquette at ems that however distinguished or however humble the rank of the visitors their fare and their treatment must be alike in one of the most aristocratic countries in the word the sovereign prince and his tradesman subject may be found seated in the morning at the same board and eating from the same dish as in the evening they may be seen staking on the same colour at the gamingtable and sharing in the same interest at the redoute  the situation of ems is delightful the mountains which form the valley are not as in switzerland so elevated that they confine the air or seem to impede the facility of breathing in their fantastic forms the picturesque is not lost in the monotonous and in the rich covering of their various woods the admiring eye finds at the same time beauty and repose opposite the ancient palace on the banks of the lahn are the gardens in these in a pavilion a band of musicians seldom cease from enchanting the visitors by their execution of the most favourite specimens of german and italian music numberless acacia arbours and retired sylvan seats are here to be found where the student or the contemplative may seek refuge from the noise of his more gay companions and the tedium of eternal conversation in these gardens also are the billiardroom and another saloon in which each night meet not merely those who are interested in the mysteries of rouge et noir and the chances of roulette but in general the whole of the company male and female who are frequenting the baths in quitting the gardens for a moment we must not omit mentioning the interesting booth of our friend the restaurateur where coffee clear and hot and exquisite confectionery are never wanting nor should we forget the glittering pennons of the gay boats which glide along the lahn nor the handsome donkeys who with their white saddles and red bridles seem not unworthy of the princesses whom they sometimes bear the gardens with an alley of limetrees which are farther on near the banks of the river afford easy promenades to the sick and debilitated but the more robust and active need not fear monotony in the valley of the lahn if they sigh for the champaign country they can climb the wild passes of the encircling mountains and from their tops enjoy the most magnificent views of the rhineland there they may gaze on that mighty river flowing through the prolific plain which at the same time it nourishes and adorns bounded on each side by mountains of every form clothed with wood or crowned with castles or if they fear the fatigues of the ascent they may wander farther up the valley and in the wild dells romantic forests and grey ruins of stein and nassau conjure up the old times of feudal tyranny when the forest was the only free land and he who outraged the laws the only one who did not suffer from their authority  besides the princely bathing house i must mention that there was another old and extensive building near it which in very full seasons also accommodated visitors on the same system as the palace at present this adjoining building was solely occupied by a russian grand duke who had engaged it for the season  such is a slight description of ems a place almost of unique character for it is a wateringplace with every convenience luxury and accommodation and yet without shops streets or houses  the baron and vivian were fortunate in finding rooms for the baths were very full the extraordinary beauty of the weather having occasioned a very early season they found themselves at the baths early on the morning after their arrival at coblentz and at three oclock in the same day had taken their places at the dinner table in the great saloon at the long table upwards of two hundred and fifty guests were assembled of different nations and of very different characters there was the cunning intriguing greek who served well his imperial master the russian the order of the patron saint of moscow and the glittering stars of other nations which sparkled on his green uniform told how well he had laboured for the interest of all other countries except his own but his clear pale complexion his delicately trimmed mustachio his lofty forehead his arched eyebrow and his eastern eye recalled to the traveller in spite of his barbarian trappings the fine countenances of the aegean and became a form which apparently might have struggled in thermopylae next to him was the austrian diplomatist the sosia of all cabinets in whose gay address and rattling conversation you could hardly recognise the sophistical defender of unauthorised invasion and the subtle inventor of holy alliances and imperial leagues then came the rich usurer from frankfort or the prosperous merchant from hamburgh who with his wife and daughters were seeking some recreation from his flourishing countinghouse in the sylvan gaieties of a german bathingplace flirting with these was an adventurous dancingmaster from paris whose profession at present was kept in the background and whose wellcurled black hair diamond pin and frogged coat hinted at the magnifico incog and also enabled him if he did not choose in time to follow his own profession to pursue another one which he had also studied in the profitable mystery of the redoute there were many other individuals whose commonplace appearance did not reveal a character which perhaps they did not possess there were officers in all uniforms and there were some uniforms without officers but all looked perfectly comme il faut and on the whole very select and if the great persons endeavoured for a moment to forget their dignity still these slight improprieties were amply made up by the affected dignity of those little persons who had none to forget  and how like you the baths of ems the baron asked of vivian we shall get better seats tomorrow and perhaps be among those whom you shall know i see many friends and some agreeable ones in the meantime you must make a good dinner today and i will amuse you and assist your digestion by putting you up to some of the characters with whom you are dining  at this moment a party entered the room who were rather late in their appearance but who attracted the attention of vivian the group consisted of three persons a very goodlooking young man who supported on each arm a female the lady on his right arm was apparently of about fiveandtwenty years of age she was of majestic stature her complexion of untinged purity her features were like those conceptions of grecian sculptors which in moments of despondency we sometimes believe to be ideal her full eyes were of the same deep blue as the mountain lake and gleamed from under their long lashes as that purest of waters beneath its fringing sedge her brown light hair was braided from her high forehead and hung in long full curls over her neck the mass gathered up into a grecian knot and confined by a bandeau of cameos she wore a dress of black velvet whose folding drapery was confined round a waist which was in exact symmetry with the proportions of her full bust and the polished roundness of her bending neck the countenance of the lady was dignified without any expression of pride and reserved without any of the harshness of austerity in gazing on her the enraptured spectator for a moment believed that minerva had forgotten her severity and had entered into a delightful rivalry with venus  her companion was much younger not so tall and of slender form the long tresses of her chestnut hair shaded her oval face her small aquiline nose bright hazel eyes delicate mouth and the deep colour of her lips were as remarkable as the transparency of her complexion the flush of her cheek was singular it was of a brilliant pink you may find it in the lip of an indian shell the blue veins played beneath her arched forehead like lightning beneath a rainbow she was dressed in white and a damask rose half hid in her clustering hair was her only ornament this lovely creature glided by vivian grey almost unnoticed so fixed was his gaze on her companion yet magnificent as was the style of lady madeleine trevor there were few who preferred even her commanding graces to the softer beauties of violet fane  this party having passed vivian proceeded to the top of the room where places had been kept for them vivians eye watched them till they were lost among surrounding visitors their peculiar loveliness could not deceive him  english no doubt observed he to the baron who can they be  i have not the least idea that is i do not exactly know i think they are english answered the baron in so confused a manner that vivian rather stared after musing a moment the baron recovered himself  the unexpected sight of a face we feel that we know and yet cannot immediately recognise is extremely annoying it is almost agitating they are english the lady in black is lady madeleine trevor i knew her in london  and the gentleman asked vivian is the gentleman mr trevor  no trevor poor trevor is dead i think is i am sure dead that i am confident is not he he was of the  family and was in office when i was in england it was in my diplomatic capacity that i first became acquainted with him lady madeleine was and as you see is a charming woman a very charming woman is lady madeleine trevor  and the young lady with her  and the young lady with her i cannot exactly say i do not exactly know her face is familiar to me and yet i cannot remember her name she must have been very young as you may see when i was in england she cannot now be above eighteen miss fane must therefore have been very young when i was in england miss fane how singular i should have recalled her name that is her name violet fane a cousin or some relation of lady madeleine good family will you have some soup  whether it were from not being among his friends or some other cause the baron was certainly not in his usual spirits this day at dinner conversation which with him was generally as easy as it was brilliant like a fountain at the same time sparkling and fluent was evidently constrained for a few minutes he talked very fast and was then uncommunicative absent and dull he moreover drank a great deal of wine which was not his custom but the grape did not inspire him vivian found amusement in his next neighbour a forward bustling man clever in his talk very fine but rather vulgar he was the manager of a company of austrian actors and had come to ems on the chance of forming an engagement for his troop who generally performed at vienna he had been successful in his adventure the archduke having engaged the whole band at the new house and in a few days the troop were to arrive at which time the manager was to drop the character of a travelling gentleman and cease to dine at the table dhôte of ems from this man vivian learnt that lady madeleine trevor had been at the baths for some time before the season commenced that at present hers was the party which from its long stay and eminent rank gave the tone to the amusements of the place the influential circle which those who have frequented wateringplaces have often observed and which may be seen at ems spa or pyrmont equally as at harrowgate tunbridge wells or cheltenham     chapter vi   when dinner was finished the party broke up and most of them assembled in the gardens the baron whose countenance had assumed its wonted cheerfulness and who excused his previous dulness by the usual story of a sudden headache proposed to vivian to join the promenade the gardens were very full and the baron recognised many of his acquaintance  my dear colonel who possibly expected to meet you here why did you dine in the saloon i only arrived this morning this is my friend mr grey colonel von trumpetson  an englishman i believe said the colonel bowing he was a starch militaire with a blue frock coat buttoned up to his chin a bald head with a few grey hairs and long thin mustachios like a mandarins an englishman i believe pray sir will you inform me whether the household troops in england wear the marboeuf cuirass  sir said vivian  i esteem myself particularly fortunate in thus meeting with an english gentleman it was only at dinner today that a controversy arose between major von musquetoon and the prince of buttonstein on this point as i said to the prince you may argue for ever for at present we cannot decide the fact how little did i think when i parted from the major that in a few minutes i should be able to settle the question beyond a doubt i esteem myself particularly fortunate in meeting with an englishman  i regret to say colonel that the question is one that i cannot decide  sir i wish you good morning said the colonel very drily and staring keenly at vivian he walked away  he is good enough to fight i suppose said the baron with a smile and shrug of the shoulders which seemed to return thanks to providence for having been educated in the civil service  at this moment lady madeleine trevor leaning on the arm of the same gentleman passed and the baron bowed the bow was coldly returned  you know her ladyship then well  i did know her said the baron but i see from her bow that i am at present in no very high favour the truth is she is a charming woman but i never expected to see her in germany and there was some little commission of hers which i neglected some little order for eau de cologne or a message about a worked pockethandkerchief which i utterly forgot and then i never wrote and you know grey that these little sins of omission are never forgiven by women  my dear friend de konigstein one pinch one pinch chirped out a little old oddlooking man with a poudré head and dressed in a costume in which the glories of the vieille cour seemed to retire with reluctance a diamond ring twinkled on the snuffy hand which was encircled by a rich ruffle of dirty lace the brown coat was not modern and yet not quite such an one as was worn by its master when he went to see the king dine in public at versailles before the revolution large silver buckles still adorned the wellpolished shoes and silk stockings whose hue was originally black were picked out with clockwork of gold  my dear marquis i am most happy to see you will you try the boulangero  with pleasure aah what a box a louisquatorze i think  oh no by no means so old  pardon me my dear de konigstein i think a louisquatorze  i bought it in sicily  aah slowly exclaimed the little man shaking his head  well good afternoon said the baron passing on  my dear de konigstein one pinch you have often said you have a particular regard for me  my dear marquis  aah i thought so you have often said you would serve me if possible  my dear marquis be brief  aah i will theres a cursed crusty old prussian officer here one colonel de trumpetson  well what can i do you are surely not going to fight him  aah no no i wish you to speak to him  well what  he takes snuff  what is that to me  he has got a box  well  it is a louisquatorze could not you get it for me  good morning to you said the baron pulling on vivian  you have had the pleasure grey of meeting this afternoon two men who have each only one idea colonel von trumpetson and the marquis de la tabatière are equally tiresome but are they more tiresome than any other man who always speaks on the same subject we are more irritable but not more wearied with a man who is always thinking of the pattern of a buttonhole or the shape of a snuffbox than with one who is always talking about pictures or chemistry or politics the true bore is that man who thinks the world is only interested in one subject because he himself can only comprehend one  here lady madeleine passed again and this time the barons eyes were fixed on the ground  a buzz and a bustle at the other end of the gardens to which the baron and vivian were advancing announced the entry of the grand duke his imperial highness was a tall man with a quick piercing eye which was prevented from giving to his countenance the expression of intellect which it otherwise would have done by the dull and almost brutal effect of his flat calmuck nose he was dressed in a plain green uniform adorned by a single star but his tightened waist his stiff stock and the elaborate attention which had evidently been bestowed upon his mustachio denoted the military fop the grand duke was accompanied by three or four stiff and statelylooking personages in whom the severity of the martinet seemed sunk in the servility of the aidedecamp  the baron bowed very low to the prince as he drew near and his highness taking off his cockedhat with an appearance of cordial condescension made a full stop the silent gentlemen in the rear who had not anticipated this suspense in their promenade almost foundered on the heels of their royal master and frightened at the imminency of the profanation forgot their stiff pomp in a precipitate retreat of half a yard  baron said his highness why have i not seen you at the new house  i have but this moment arrived may it please your imperial highness  your companion continued the grand duke pointing very graciously to vivian  my intimate friend my fellowtraveller and an englishman may i have the honour of presenting mr grey to your imperial highness  any friends of the baron von konigstein i shall always feel great pleasure in having presented to me sir i feel great pleasure in having you presented to me sir you ought to be proud of the name of englishman sir the english are a noble nation sir i have the highest respect for the english nation  vivian of course bowed very low and of course made a very proper speech on the occasion which as all speeches of that kind should be was very dutiful and quite inaudible  and what news from berlin baron let us move on and the baron turned with the grand duke the silent gentlemen settling their mustachios followed in the rear for about half an hour anecdote after anecdote scene after scene caricature after caricature were poured out with prodigal expenditure for the amusement of the prince who did nothing during the exhibition but smile stroke his whiskers and at the end of the best stories fence with his forefinger at the barons side with a gentle laugh and a mock shake of the head and a eh von konigstein youre too bad here lady madeleine trevor passed again and the grand dukes hat nearly touched the ground he received a most gracious bow  finish the story about salvinski baron and then i will present you for a reward to the most lovely creature in existence a countrywoman of your friend lady madeleine trevor  i have the honour of a slight acquaintance with her said the baron i had the pleasure of knowing her in england  indeed fortunate mortal i see she has stopped talking to some stranger let us turn and join her  the grand duke and the two friends accordingly turned and of course the silent gentlemen in the rear followed with due precision  lady madeleine said the grand duke i flattered myself for a moment that i might have had the honour of presenting to you a gentleman for whom i have a great esteem but he has proved to me that he is more fortunate than myself since he had the honour before me of an acquaintance with lady madeleine trevor  i have not forgotten baron von konigstein said her ladyship with a serious air may i ask his highness how he prospered in his negotiation with the austrian troop  perfectly successful inspired by your ladyships approbation my steward has really done wonders he almost deserves a diplomatic appointment for the talent which he has shown but what should i do without cracowsky lady madeleine can you conceive what i should do without cracowsky  not in the least  cracowsky is everything to me it is impossible to say what cracowsky is to me i owe everything to cracowsky to cracowsky i owe being here the grand duke bowed very low for this eulogium on his steward also conveyed a compliment to her ladyship the grand duke was certainly right in believing that he owed his summer excursion to ems to his steward that wily pole regularly every year put his imperial masters summer excursion up to auction and according to the biddings of the proprietors of the chief baths did he take care that his master regulated his visit the restaurateur of ems in collusion with the official agent of the duke of nassau were fortunate this season in having the grand duke knocked down to them  may i flatter myself that miss fane feels herself better asked the grand duke  she certainly does feel herself better but my anxiety about her does not decrease in her illness apparent convalescence is sometimes as alarming as suffering  the grand duke continued by the side of lady madeleine for about twenty minutes seizing every opportunity of uttering in the most courtly tone inane compliments and then trusting that he might soon have her ladyships opinion respecting the austrian troop at the new house and that von konigstein and his english friend would not delay letting him see them there his imperial highness followed by his silent suite left the gardens  i am afraid lady madeleine must have almost mistaken me for a taciturn lord chamberlain said the baron occupying immediately the grand dukes vacated side  baron von konigstein must be very changed if silence be imputed to him as a fault said lady madeleine  baron von konigstein is very much changed since last he had the pleasure of conversing with lady madeleine trevor more changed than she will perhaps believe more changed than he can sometimes himself believe i hope that he will not be less acceptable to lady madeleine trevor because he is no longer rash passionate and unthinking because he has learnt to live more for others and less for himself  baron von konigstein does indeed appear changed since by his own account he has become in a very few years a being in whose existence philosophers scarcely believe a perfect man  my selfconceit has been so often reproved by you that i will not apologise for a quality which i almost flattered myself i no longer possessed but you will excuse i am sure one who in zealous haste to prove himself amended has i fear almost shown that he has deceived himself  some strange thoughts occurred to vivian while this conversation was taking place is this a woman to resent the neglect of an order for eau de cologne my dear von konigstein you are a very pleasant fellow but this is not the way men apologise for the nonpurchase of a pockethandkerchief  have you been long at ems inquired the baron with an air of great deference  nearly a month we are travelling in consequence of the illhealth of a relation it was our intention to have gone on to pisa but our physician in consequence of the extreme heat of the summer is afraid of the fatigue of travelling and has recommended ems the air between these mountains is very soft and pure and i have no reason to regret at present that we have not advanced farther on our journey  the lady who was with your party at dinner is i fear your invalid she certainly does not look like one i think said the baron with an effort i think that her face is not unknown to me it is difficult even after so many years to mistake miss  fane said lady madeleine firmly for it seemed that the baron required a little assistance at the end of his sentence  ems returned his excellency with great rapidity of utterance ems is a charming place at least to me i have within these few years quite recurred to the feelings of my boyhood nothing to me is more disgustingly wearisome than the gay bustle of a city my present diplomatic appointment at frankfort ensures a constant life among the most charming scenes of nature naples which was offered to me i refused eight years ago i should have thought an appointment at naples a paradise on earth  you must indeed be changed  how beautiful is the vicinity of the rhine i have passed within these three days for almost the twentieth time in my life through the rheingau and yet how fresh and lovely and novel seemed all its various beauties my young travelling companion is enthusiastic about this gem of germany he is one of your ladyships countrymen might i take the liberty of presenting to you mr grey  lady madeleine as if it could now no longer be postponed introduced to the two gentlemen her brother mr st george this gentleman who during the whole previous conversation had kept his head in a horizontal position looking neither to the right nor to the left and apparently unconscious that any one was conversing with his sister because according to the english custom he was not introduced now suddenly turned around and welcomed his acquaintance with cordiality  mr grey asked her ladyship are you of dorsetshire  my mother is a dorsetshire woman her family name is vivian which name i also bear  then i think we are longer acquainted than we have been introduced i met your father at sir hargrave vivians last christmas he spoke of you in those terms that make me glad that i have met his son you have been long from england i think  nearly a year and a half  the baron had resigned his place by lady madeleine and was already in close conversation with mr st george from whose arm lady madeleines was disengaged no one acted the part of asmodeus with greater spirit than his excellency and the secret history of every person whose secret history could be amusing delighted mr st george  there said the baron goes the son of an unknown father his mother followed the camp and her offspring was early initiated in the mysteries of military petty larceny as he grew up he became the most skilful plunderer that ever rifled the dying of both sides before he was twenty he followed the army as a petty chapman and amassed an excellent fortune by reacquiring after a battle the very goods and trinkets which he had sold at an immense price before it such a wretch could do nothing but prosper and in due tune the sutlers brat became a commissarygeneral he made millions in a period of general starvation and cleared at least a hundred thousand dollars by embezzling the shoe leather during a retreat he is now a baron covered with orders and his daughters are married to some of our first nobles there goes a polish count who is one of the greatest gamblers in christendom in the same season he lost to a russian general at one game of chess his chief castle and sixteen thousand acres of woodland and recovered himself on another game on which he won of a turkish pasha one hundred and eighty thousand leopard skins the turk who was a man of strict honour paid the count by embezzling the tribute in kind of the province he governed and as on quarterday he could not of course make up his accounts with the divan he joined the greeks  while the baron was entertaining mr st george the conversation between lady madeleine and vivian proceeded  your father expressed great disappointment to me at his being prevented paying you a visit do you not long to see him  more than i can express did you think him in good spirits  generally so as cheerful as all fathers can be without their only son  did he complain then of my absence  he regretted it  i linger in germany with the hope of seeing him otherwise i should have now been much further south do you find sir hargrave as amusing as ever  when is he otherwise than the most delightful of old men sir hargrave is one of my great favourites i should like to persuade you to return and see them all cannot you fancy chester grange very beautiful now albert said her ladyship turning to her brother what is the number of our apartments mr grey the sun has now disappeared and i fear the night air among these mountains we have hardly yet summer nights though we certainly have summer days we shall be happy to see you at our rooms so saying bowing very cordially to vivian and coldly to the baron lady madeleine left the gardens  there goes the most delightful woman in the world said the baron how fortunate that you know her for really as you might have observed i have no great claims on her indulgent notice i was certainly very wild in england but then young men you know grey and i did not leave a card or call before i went and the english are very stiff and precise about those things and the trevors had been very kind to me i think we had better take a little coffee now and then if you like we will just stroll into the redoute  in a brilliantlyilluminated saloon adorned with corinthian columns and casts from some of the most famous antique statues assembled between nine and ten oclock in the evening many of the visitors at ems on each side of the room was placed a long narrow table one of which was covered with green baize and unattended while the variouslycoloured leathern surface of the other was closely surrounded by an interested crowd behind this table stood two individuals of different appearance the first was a short thick man whose only business was dealing certain portions of playing cards with quick succession one after the other and as the fate of the table was decided by this process did his companion a very tall thin man throw various pieces of money upon certain stakes which were deposited by the bystanders on different parts of the table or which was much oftener the case with a silver rake with a long ebony handle sweep into a large inclosure near him the scattered sums this inclosure was called the bank and the mysterious ceremony in which these persons were assisting was the celebrated game of rougeetnoir a deep silence was strictly preserved by those who immediately surrounded the table no voice was heard save that of the little short stout dealer when without an expression of the least interest he seemed mechanically to announce the fate of the different colours no other sound was heard except the jingle of the dollars and napoleons and the ominous rake of the tall thin banker the countenances of those who were hazarding their money were grave and gloomy their eyes were fixed their brows contracted and their lips projected and yet there was an evident effort visible to show that they were both easy and unconcerned each player held in his hand a small piece of pasteboard on which with a steel pricker he marked the run of the cards in order from his observations to regulate his own play the rougeetnoir player imagines that chance is not capricious those who were not interested in the game promenaded in two lines within the tables or seated in recesses between the pillars formed small parties for conversation  i suppose we must throw away a dollar or two said the baron as he walked up to the table  my dear de konigstein one pinch  ah marquess what fortune tonight  bad i have lost my napoleon i never risk further there is that cursed crusty old de trumpet son persisting as usual in his run of bad luck because he never will give in trust me my dear de konigstein it will end in his ruin and then if there be a sale of his effects i shall perhaps get his snuffbox aah  come shall i throw down a couple of napoleons on joint account i do not care much for play myself but i suppose at ems we must make up our minds to lose a few louis here now for the red joint account mind  done  theres the grand duke let us go and make our bow we need not stick at the table as if our whole soul were staked with our crownpieces so saying the gentlemen walked up to the top of the room  why grey surely no it cannot be and yet it is de boeffleurs how dye do said the baron with a face beaming with joy and a hearty shake of the hand my dear fellow how did you manage to get off so soon i thought you were not to be here for a fortnight we only arrived ourselves today  yes but i have made an arrangement which i did not anticipate and so i posted after you at once whom do you think i have brought with me  who  salvinski  ah and the count  follows immediately i expect him tomorrow or next day salvinski is talking to the grand duke and see he beckons to me i suppose i am going to be presented  the chevalier moved forward followed by the baron and vivian  any friend of prince salvinski i shall always have great pleasure in having presented to me chevalier i feel great pleasure in having you presented to me chevalier you ought to be proud of the name of frenchman chevalier the french are a great nation chevalier i have the highest respect for the french nation  the most subtile diplomatist thought vivian as he recalled to mind his own introduction would be puzzled to decide to which interest his imperial highness leans  the grand duke now entered into conversation with the prince and most of the circle who surrounded him as his imperial highness was addressing vivian the baron let slip our heros arm and taking that of the chevalier de boeffleurs began walking up and down the room with him and was soon engaged in animated conversation in a few minutes the grand duke bowing to his circle made a move and regained the side of a saxon lady from whose interesting company he had been disturbed by the arrival of prince salvinski an individual of whose long stories and dull romances the grand duke had from experience a particular dread but his highness was always very courteous to the poles  grey i have despatched de boeffleurs to the house to instruct his servant and ernstorff to do the impossible in order that our rooms may be all together you will be delighted with de boeffleurs when you know him and i expect you to be great friends bythebye his unexpected arrival has quite made us forget our venture at rougeetnoir of course we are too late now for anything even if we had been fortunate our stake remaining on the table is of course lost we may as well however walk up so saying the baron reached the table  that is your excellencys stake that is your excellencys stake exclaimed many voices as he came up  what is the matter my friends asked the baron calmly  there has been a run on the red there has been a run on the red and your excellencys stake has doubled each time it has been 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 and now it is 512 quickly rattled a little thin man in spectacles pointing at the same time to his unparalleled line of punctures this was one of those officious noisy little men who are always ready to give you unasked information and who are never so happy as when they are watching over the interest of some stranger who never thanks them for their unnecessary solicitude  vivian in spite of his philosophy felt the excitement of the moment he looked at the baron whose countenance however was unmoved  it seems said he coolly we are in luck  the stake then is not all your own eagerly asked the little man in spectacles  no part of it is yours sir answered the baron drily  i am going to deal said the short thick man behind is the board cleared  your excellency then allows the stake to remain inquired the tall thin banker with affected nonchalance  oh certainly said the baron with real nonchalance  three eight fourteen twentyfour thirtyfour rouge 34  all crowded nearer the table was surrounded five or six deep for the wonderful run of luck had got wind and nearly the whole room were round the table indeed the grand duke and saxon lady and of course the silent suite were left alone at the upper part of the room the tall banker did not conceal his agitation even the short stout dealer ceased to be a machine all looked anxious except the baron vivian looked at the table his excellency watched with a keen eye the little dealer no one even breathed as the cards descended ten twenty here the countenance of the banker brightened twentytwo twentyfive twentyeight thirtyone noir 31 the banks broke no more play tonight the roulette table opens immediately  in spite of the great interest which had been excited nearly the whole crowd without waiting to congratulate the baron rushed to the opposite side of the room in order to secure places at the roulette fable  put these five hundred and twelve napoleons into a bag said the baron grey this is your share with regard to the other half mr hermann what bills have you got  two on gogel of frankfort for two hundred and fifty each and these twelve napoleons will make it right said the tall banker as he opened a large black pocketbook from which he took out two small bits of paper the baron examined them and after having seen them endorsed put them into his pocket not forgetting the twelve napoleons and then taking vivians arm and regretting extremely that he should have the trouble of carrying such a weight he wished mr hermann a very good night and success at his roulette and walked with his companion quietly home thus passed a day at ems     chapter vii   on the following morning vivian met with his friend essper george behind a small stall in the bazaar  well my lord what do you wish here are eau de cologne violet soap and watchribbons a smelling bottle of ems crystal a snuffbox of figtree wood name your price the least trifle that can be given by a man who breaks a bank must be more than my whole stockintrade is worth  i have not paid you yet essper for my glass chain there is your share of my winnings the fame of which it seems has reached even you added vivian with no pleased air  i thank you sir for the nap but i hope i have not offended by alluding to a certain event which shall be passed over in silence continued essper george with a look of mock solemnity i really think you have but a faint appetite for good fortune they deserve her most who value her least  have you any patrons at ems essper that have induced you to fix on this place in particular for your speculations here i should think you have many active rivals said vivian looking round the various stalls  i have a patron here who has never deceived and who will never desert me i want no other and thats myself now here comes a party could you just tell me the name of that tall lady now  if i tell you it is lady madeleine trevor what will it profit you  before vivian could well finish his sentence essper had drawn out a long horn from beneath his small counter and sounded a blast which echoed through the arched passages the attention of every one was excited and no part of the following speech was lost  the celebrated essper george fresh from fairyland dealer in pomatum and all sorts of perfumery watches crosses ems crystal coloured prints dutch toys dresden china venetian chains neapolitan coral french crackers chamois bracelets tame poodles and cherokee corkscrews mender of mandolins and all other musical instruments to lady madeleine trevor has just arrived at ems where he only intends to stay two or three days and a few more weeks besides now gracious lady what do you wish  and who said lady madeleine smiling is this  the celebrated essper george just again commenced the conjuror but vivian prevented the repetition  he is an odd knave lady madeleine that i have met with before at other places i believe i may add an honest one what say you essper  more honest than moonlight gracious lady for that deceives every one and less honest than selfpraise for that deceives no one  my friend you have a ready wit  my wit is like a bustling servant gracious lady always ready when not wanted and never present at a pinch  come i must have a pair of your chamois bracelets how sell you them  i sell nothing all here is gratis to beauty virtue and nobility and these are my only customers  thanks will not supply a stockintrade though essper said vivian  very true but my customers are apt to leave some slight testimonies behind them of the obligations which they are under to me and these at the same time are the prop of my estate and the proof of their discretion but who comes here said essper drawing out his horn the sight of this instrument reminded lady madeleine how greatly the effect of music is heightened by distance and she made a speedy retreat yielding her place to a family procession of a striking character  three daughters abreast flanked by two elder sons formed the first file the father a portly prosperouslooking man followed with his lady on his arm then came two nursery maids with three children between the tender ages of five and six the second division of the grand army consisting of three younger sons immediately followed this was commanded by a tutor a governess and two young daughters then advanced and then came the extreme rear the sutlers of the camp in the persons of two footmen in rich liveries who each bore a basket on his arm filled with various fancy articles which had been all purchased during the promenade of this nation through only part of the bazaar  the trumpet of essper george produced a due effect upon the great party the commanderinchief stopped at his little stall and as if this were the signal for general attack and plunder the files were immediately broken up each individual dashed at his prey and the only ones who struggled to maintain a semblance of discipline were the nursery maids the tutor and the governess who experienced the greatest difficulty in suppressing the early taste which the detachment of light infantry indicated for booty but essper george was in his element he joked he assisted he exhibited he explained tapped the cheeks of the children and complimented the elder ones and finally having parted at a prodigious profit with nearly his whole stock paid himself out of a large and heavy purse which the portly father in his utter inability to comprehend the complicated accounts and the debased currency with great frankness deposited in the hands of the master of the stall desiring him to settle his own claims  i hope i may be allowed to ask after miss fane said vivian  she continues better we are now about to join her in the limewalk if you will join our morning stroll it will give us much pleasure  nothing in the world could give vivian greater pleasure he felt himself impelled to the side of lady madeleine and only regretted his acquaintance with the baron because he felt conscious that there was some secret cause which prevented that intimacy from existing between his excellency and the trevor party which his talents and his position would otherwise have easily produced  bythebye said lady madeleine i do not know whether i may be allowed to congratulate you upon your brilliant success at the redoute last night it is fortunate that all have not to regret your arrival at ems so much as poor mr hermann  the run was extraordinary i am only sorry that the goddess should have showered her favours on one who neither deserves nor desires them for i have no wish to be rich and as i never lost by her caprices it is hardly fair that i should gain by them  you do not play then much  i never played in my life till last night gambling has never been one of my follies although my catalogue of errors is fuller perhaps than most mens  i think baron von konigstein was your partner in the exploit  he was and apparently as little pleased at the issue as myself  indeed have you known the baron long  we are only friends of a week i have been living ever since i was in germany a very retired life a circumstance of a most painful nature drove me from england a circumstance of which i can hardly flatter myself and can hardly wish that you should be ignorant  i learnt the sad history from one who while he spoke the truth spoke of the living sufferer in terms of the fondest affection  a father said vivian agitated a father can hardly be expected to be impartial  such a father as yours may i only wish that he was with us now to assist me in bringing about what he must greatly desire your return to england  it cannot be i look back to the last year which i spent in that country with feelings of such disgust i look forward to a return to that country with feelings of such repugnance thatbut i feel i am trespassing beyond all bounds in touching on these subjects  i promised your father that in case we met i would seek your society i have suffered too much myself not to understand how dangerous and how deceitful is the excess of grief you have allowed yourself to be overcome by that which providence intended as a lesson of instruction not as a sentence of despair in your solitude you have increased the shadow of those fantasies of a heated brain which converse with the pure sunshine of the world would have enabled you to dispel  the pure sunshine of the world lady madeleine would that it had ever lighted me my youth flourished in the unwholesome sultriness of a blighted atmosphere which i mistook for the resplendent brilliancy of a summer day how deceived i was you may judge not certainly from finding me here but i am here because i have ceased to suffer only in having ceased to hope  you have ceased to hope because hope and consolation are not the companions of solitude which are of a darker nature hope and consolation spring from the social affections converse with the world will do more for you than all the arguments of philosophers i hope yet to find you a believer in the existence of that good which we all worship and all pursue happiness comes when we least expect it and to those who strive least to obtain it as you were fortunate yesterday at the redoute when you played without an idea of winning  they were in the limewalk gay sounds greeted them and miss fane came forward from a lighthearted band to welcome her cousin she had to propose a walk to the new spring which she was prepared for lady madeleine to resist on the ground of her cousins health but miss fane combated all the objections with airy merriment and with a bright resource that never flagged as she bent her head slightly to vivian ere she hastened back to her companions to announce the success of her mission it seemed to him that he had never beheld so animated and beaming a countenance or glanced upon a form of such ineffable and sparkling grace  you would scarcely imagine mr grey that we are travelling for my cousins health nor do her physicians indeed give us any cause for serious uneasiness yet i cannot help feeling at times great anxiety her flushed cheek and the alarming languor which succeeds any excitement make me fear her complaint may be more deeply seated than they are willing to acknowledge  they were saying the other day that the extraordinary heat of this season must end in an earthquake or some great convulsion of nature that would bring languor  we are willing to adopt any reasoning that gives us hope but her mother died of consumption     chapter viii   when the walking party returned home they found a crowd of idle servants assembled opposite the house round a group of equipages consisting of two enormous crimson carriages a britzska and a large caravan on all which vehicles the same coat of arms was ostentatiously blazoned  some new guests said miss fane  it must be the singular party that we watched this morning in the bazaar said lady madeleine violet i have such a curious character to introduce you to a particular friend of mr grey who wishes very much to have the honour of your acquaintance mr essper george  these carriages then belong to him  not exactly said vivian  in an hours time the party again met at dinner in the saloon by the joint exertions of ernstorff and mr st georges servants the baron vivian and the chevalier de boeffleurs were now seated next to the party of lady madeleine trevor  my horses fortunately arrived from frankfort this morning said the baron mr st george and myself have been taking a ride very far up the valley has your ladyship yet been to the castle of nassau  we have not the expedition has been one of those plans often arranged and never executed  you should go the ruin is one of the finest in germany an expedition to nassau castle would be a capital foundation for a picnic conceive a beautiful valley discovered by a knight in the middle ages following the track of a stag how romantic the very incident vouches for its sweet seclusion cannot you imagine the wooded mountains the old grey ruin the sound of the unseen river what more should we want except agreeable company fine music and the best provisions to fancy ourselves in paradise  i wish the plan were practicable said mr st george  i take the whole arrangement upon myself there is not a difficulty the ladies shall go on donkeys or we might make a water excursion of it part of the way and the donkeys can meet us at the pass near stein and then the gentlemen may walk and if you fear the water at night why then the carriages may come round and if your own be too heavy for mountain roads my britzska is always at your command you see there is not a difficulty  not a difficulty said mr st george madeleine we only wait your consent  i think we had better put off the execution of our plan till june is a little more advanced we must have a fine summer night for violet  well then i hold the whole party present engaged to follow my standard whenever i have permission from authority to unfold it said the baron bowing to lady madeleine and lest on cool reflection i shall not possess influence enough to procure the appointment i shall like a skilful orator take advantage of your feelings which gratitude for this excellent plan must have already enlisted in my favour and propose myself as master of the ceremonies the barons eye caught lady madeleines as he uttered this and something like a smile rather of pity than derision lighted up her face  here vivian turned round to give some directions to an attendant and to his annoyance found essper george standing behind his chair  is there anything you want sir  who ordered you here  my duty  in what capacity do you attend  as your servant sir  i insist upon your leaving the room directly  ah my friend essper george said lady madeleine are you there what is the matter  this then is essper george said violet fane what kind of being can he possibly be what indeed is the matter  i am merely discharging a servant at a moments warning miss fane and if you wish to engage his constant attendance upon yourself i have no objection to give him a character for the occasion  what do you want essper said miss fane  merely to see whether your walk this morning had done your appetites any good answered essper looking disconsolate and so i thought i might make myself useful at the same time and though i do not bring on the soup in a cocked hat and carve the venison with a couteaudechasse continued he bowing very low to ernstorff who standing stiff behind his masters chair seemed utterly unaware that any other person in the room could experience a necessity still i can change a plate or hand the wine without cracking the first or drinking the second  and very good qualities too said miss fane come essper you shall put your accomplishments into practice immediately change my plate  this essper did with dexterity and quiet displaying at the same time a small white hand on the back of which was marked a comet and three daggers as he had the discretion not to open his mouth and performed all his duties with skill his intrusion in a few minutes was not only pardoned but forgotten  there has been a great addition to the visitors today i see said mr st george who are the new comers  i will tell you all about them said the baron this family is one of those whose existence astounds the continent much more than any of your mighty dukes and earls whose fortunes though colossal can be conceived and whose rank is understood mr fitzloom is a very different personage for thirty years ago he was a journeyman cotton spinner some miraculous invention in machinery entitled him to a patent which has made him one of the great proprietors of england he has lately been returned a member for a manufacturing town and he intends to get over the first two years of his parliamentary career by successively monopolising the accommodation of all the principal cities of france germany switzerland and italy and by raising the price of provisions and posthorses through a track of five thousand miles my information is authentic for i had a casual acquaintance with him in england there was some talk of a contract for supplying our army from england and i saw fitzloom often on the subject i have spoken to him today this is by no means the first of the species that we have had in germany i can assure you that the plain traveller feels seriously the inconvenience of following such a caravan their money flows with such unwise prodigality that real liberality ceases to be valued and many of your nobility have complained to me that in their travels they are now often expostulated with on account of their parsimony and taunted with the mistaken extravagance of a stockingmaker or a porterbrewer  what pleasure can such people find in travelling wondered mr st george  as much pleasure and more profit than half the young men of the present day replied a middleaged english gentleman who was a kinsman of the st georges and called them cousins in my time travelling was undertaken on a very different system to what it is now the english youth then travelled to frequent what lord bacon says are especially to be seen and observed the courts of princes you all travel now it appears to look at mountains and catch cold in spouting trash on lakes by moonlight  but my dear sir said the baron although i grant you that the principal advantages of travel must be the opportunity which it affords us of becoming acquainted with human nature knowledge of course chiefly gained where human beings most congregate great cities and as you say the courts of princes still one of its great benefits is that it enlarges a mans experiences not only of his fellowcreatures in particular but of nature in general many men pass through life without seeing a sunrise a traveller cannot if human experience be gained by seeing men in their undress not only when they are conscious of the presence of others natural experience is only to be acquired by studying nature at all periods not merely when man is busy and the beasts asleep  but what is the use of this deep experience of nature men are born to converse with men not with stocks and stones he who has studied le sage will be more happy and more successful in this world than the man who muses over rousseau  i agree with you i have no wish to make man an anchorite but as to the benefit of a thorough experience of nature it appears to me to be evident it increases our stock of ideas  so does everything  but it does more than this it calls into being new emotions it gives rise to new and beautiful associations it creates that salutary state of mental excitement which renders our ideas more lucid and our conclusions more sound can we too much esteem a study which at the same time stimulates imagination and corrects the judgment  do not you think that a communion with nature is calculated to elevate the soul said lady madeleine to  so is reading your bible a mans soul should always be elevated if not he might look at mountains for ever but i should not trust him a jot more  but sir continued the baron with unusual warmth i am clear that there are cases in which the influence of nature has worked what you profess to treat as an impossibility or a miracle i am myself acquainted with an instance of a peculiar character a few years ago a gentleman of high rank found himself exposed to the unhappy suspicion of being connected with some dishonourable transactions which took place in the highest circles of england unable to find any specific charge which he could meet he added one to the numerous catalogue of those unfortunate beings who have sunk in society the victims of a surmise he quitted england and disgusted with the world became the profligate which he had been falsely believed to be at the house of cardinal  at naples celebrated for its revels this gentleman became a constant guest he entered with a mad eagerness into every species of dissipation although none gave him pleasure and his fortune his health and the powers of his mind were all fast vanishing one night of frantic dissipation a mock election of master of the sports was proposed and the hero of my tale had the splendid gratification of being chosen by unanimous consent to this new office about two oclock of the same night he left the palace of the cardinal with an intention of returning his way on his return led by the chiaja it was one of those nights which we witness only in the south the blue and brilliant sea was sleeping beneath a cloudless sky and the moon not only shed her light over the orange and lemon trees which springing from their green banks of myrtle hung over the water but added fresh lustre to the white domes and glittering towers of the city and flooded vesuvius and the distant coast with light as far even as capua the individual of whom i am speaking had passed this spot on many nights when the moon was not less bright the waves not less silent and the orange trees not less sweet but tonight something irresistible impelled him to stop what a contrast to the artificial light and heat and splendour of the palace to which he was returning he mused in silence would it not be wiser to forget the worlds injustice in gazing on a moonlit ocean than in discovering in the illumined halls of naples the baseness of the crowd which forms the worlds power to enjoy the refreshing luxury of a fanning breeze which now arose he turned and gazed on the other side of the bay upon his right stretched out the promontory of pausilippo there were the shores of baiae but it was not only the loveliness of the land which now overcame his spirit he thought of those whose fame had made us forget even the beauty of these shores in associations of a higher character and a more exalted nature he remembered the time when it was his only wish to be numbered among them how had his early hopes been fulfilled what just account had he rendered to himself and to his country that country that had expected so much that self that had aspired even to more  day broke over the city and found him still pacing the chiaja he did not return to the cardinals palace and in two days he had left naples i can myself from personal experience aver that this individual is now a useful and honourable member of society the world speaks of him in more flattering terms  the baron spoke with energy and animation miss fane who had been silent and who certainly had not encouraged by any apparent interest the previous conversation of the baron listened to this anecdote with eager attention but the effect it produced upon lady madeleine trevor was remarkable  soon after this the party broke up the promenade followed the grand duke his compliments and courtiers then came the redoute mr hermann bowed low as the gentlemen walked up to the table the baron whispered vivian that it was expected that they should play and give the tables a chance of winning back their money vivian staked with the carelessness of one who wishes to lose as is often the case under such circumstances he again left the redoute a considerable winner he parted with the baron at his excellencys door and proceeded to the next which was his own here he stumbled over something at the doorway which appeared like a large bundle he bent down with his light to examine it and found essper george lying on his back with his eyes halfopen it was some moments before vivian perceived he was asleep stepping gently over him he entered his apartment     chapter ix   when vivian rose in the morning a gentle tap at his door announced the presence of an early visitor who being desired to enter appeared in the person of essper george  do you want anything sir asked essper with a submissive air  vivian stared at him for a moment and then ordered him to come in  i had forgotten essper until this moment that on returning to my room last night i found you sleeping at my door this also reminds me of your conduct in the saloon yesterday and as i wish to prevent the repetition of such improprieties i shall take this opportunity of informing you once for all that if you do not in future conduct yourself with more discretion i must apply to the maitre dhôtel now sir what do you want  essper was silent and stood with his hands crossed on his breast and his eyes fixed on the ground  if you do not want anything quit the room immediately  here the singular being began to weep  poor fellow thought vivian i fear with all thy wit and pleasantry thou art after all but one of those capriccios which nature sometimes indulges in merely to show how superior is her accustomed order to eccentricities even accompanied with rare powers  what is your wish essper continued vivian in a kinder tone if there be any service that i can do you you will not find me backward are you in trouble you surely are not in want  no sobbed essper i wish to be your servant here he hid his face in his hands  my servant why surely it is not very wise to seek dependence upon any man i am afraid that you have been keeping company too much with the lackeys that are always loitering about these bathingplaces ernstorffs green livery and sword have they not turned your brain essper  no no no i am tired of living alone  but remember to be a servant you must be a person of regular habits and certain reputation i have myself a good opinion of you but i have myself seen very little of you though more than any one here and i am a person of a peculiar turn of mind perhaps there is not another individual in this house who would even allude to the possibility of engaging a servant without a character  does the ship ask the wind for a character when he bears her over the sea without hire and without reward and shall you require a character from me when i request to serve you without wages and without pay  such an engagement essper it would be impossible for me to enter into even if i had need of your services which at present i have not but i tell you frankly that i see no chance of your suiting me i should require an attendant of steady habits and experience not one whose very appearance would attract attention when i wish to be unobserved and acquire a notoriety for the master which he detests i warmly advise you to give up all idea of entering into a state of life for which you are not in the least suited believe me your stall will be a better friend than a master now leave me  essper remained one moment with his eyes still fixed on the ground then walking very rapidly up to vivian he dropped on his knee kissed his hand and disappeared  mr st george breakfasted with the baron and the gentlemen called on lady madeleine early in the morning to propose a drive to stein castle but she excused herself and vivian following her example the baron and mr st george patronised the fitzlooms because there was nothing else to do vivian again joined the ladies in their morning walk but miss fane was not in her usual high spirits she complained more than once of her cousins absence and this connected with some other circumstances gave vivian the first impression that her feelings towards mr st george were not merely those of a relation as to the chevalier de boeffleurs vivian soon found that it was utterly impossible to be on intimate terms with a being without an idea the chevalier was certainly not a very fit representative of the gay gallant mercurial frenchman he rose very late and employed the whole of the morning in reading the french journals and playing billiards alternately with prince salvinski and count von altenburgh  these gentlemen as well as the baron vivian and mr st george were to dine this day at the new house  they found assembled at the appointed hour a party of about thirty individuals the dinner was sumptuous the wines superb at the end of the banquet the company adjourned to another room where play was proposed and immediately commenced his imperial highness did not join in the game but seated in a corner of the apartment was surrounded by his aidesdecamp whose business was to bring their master constant accounts of the fortunes of the table and the fate of his bets his highness did not stake  vivian soon found that the game was played on a very different scale at the new house to what it was at the redoute he spoke most decidedly to the baron of his detestation of gambling and expressed his unwillingness to play but the baron although he agreed with him in his sentiments advised him to conform for the evening to the universal custom as he could afford to lose he consented and staked boldly this night very considerable sums were lost and won but none returned home greater winners than mr st george and vivian grey     chapter x   the first few days of an acquaintance with a new scene of life and with new characters generally appear to pass very slowly not certainly from the weariness which they induce but rather from the keen attention which every little circumstance commands when the novelty has worn off when we have discovered that the new characters differ little from all others we have met before and that the scene they inhabit is only another variety of the great order we have so often observed we relapse into our ancient habits of inattention we think more of ourselves and less of those we meet and musing our moments away in reverie or in a vain attempt to cheat the coming day of the monotony of the present one we begin to find that the variousvested hours have bounded and are bounding away in a course at once imperceptible uninteresting and unprofitable then it is that terrified at our nearer approach to the great river whose dark windings it seems the business of all to forget we start from our stupor to mourn over the rapidity of that collective sum of pasttime every individual hour of which we have in turn execrated for its sluggishness  vivian had now been three weeks at ems and the presence of lady madeleine trevor and her cousin alone induced him to remain whatever the mystery existing between lady madeleine and the baron his efforts to attach himself to her party had been successful the great intimacy subsisting between the baron and her brother materially assisted in bringing about this result for the first fortnight the baron was lady madeleines constant attendant in the evening promenade and sometimes in the morning walk and though there were few persons whose companionship could be preferred to that of baron von konigstein still vivian sometimes regretted that his friend and mr st george had not continued their rides the presence of the baron seemed always to have an unfavourable influence upon the spirits of miss fane and the absurd and evident jealousy of mr st george prevented vivian from finding in her agreeable conversation some consolation for the loss of the sole enjoyment of lady madeleines exhilarating presence mr st george had never met vivians advances with cordiality and he now treated him with studied coldness  the visits of the gentlemen to the new house had been frequent the saloon of the grand duke was open every evening and in spite of his great distaste for the fatal amusement which was there invariably pursued vivian found it impossible to decline frequently attending without subjecting his motives to painful misconception his extraordinary fortune did not desert him and rendered his attendance still more a duty the baron was not so successful as on his first evenings venture at the redoute but mr st georges star remained favourable of essper vivian had seen little in passing through the bazaar one morning which he seldom did he found to his surprise that the former conjuror had doffed his quaint costume and was now attired in the usual garb of men of his condition of life as essper was busily employed at the moment vivian did not stop to speak to him but he received a respectful bow once or twice also he had met essper in the barons apartments and he seemed to have become a very great favourite with the servants of his excellency and the chevalier de boeffleurs particularly with his former butt ernstorff to whom he now behaved with great deference  for the first fortnight the barons attendance on lady madeleine was constant after this time he began to slacken in his attentions he first disappeared from the morning walks and yet he did not ride he then ceased from joining the party at lady madeleines apartments in the evening and never omitted increasing the circle at the new house for a single night the whole of the fourth week the baron dined with his imperial highness although the invitation had been extended to all the gentlemen from the first it had been agreed that it was not to be accepted in order that the ladies should not find their party in the saloon less numerous or less agreeable the baron was the first to break through a rule which he had himself proposed and mr st george and the chevalier de boeffleurs soon followed his example  mr grey said lady madeleine one evening as she was about to leave the gardens we shall be happy to see you tonight if you are not engaged  i fear that i am engaged said vivian for the receipt of some letters from england made him little inclined to enter into society  oh no you cannot be said miss fane pray come i know you only want to go to that terrible new house i wonder what albert can find to amuse him there i fear no good men never congregate together for any beneficial purpose i am sure with all his gastronomical affectations he would not if all were right prefer the most exquisite dinner in the world to our society as it is we scarcely see him a moment i think that you are the only one who has not deserted the saloon for once give up the new house  vivian smiled at miss fanes warmth and could not persist in his refusal although she did dilate most provokingly on the absence of her cousin he therefore soon joined them  lady madeleine is assisting me in a most important work mr grey i am making drawings of the valley of the rhine i know that you are acquainted with the scenery you can perhaps assist me with your advice about this view of old hattos castle  vivian was so completely master of every spot in the rhineland that he had no difficulty in suggesting the necessary alterations the drawings were vivid representations of the scenery which they professed to depict and vivian forgot his melancholy as he attracted the attention of the fair artist to points of interest unknown or unnoticed by the guidebooks and the diaries  you must look forward to italy with great interest miss fane  the greatest i shall not however forget the rhine even among the apennines  our intended fellowtravellers lord mounteney and his family are already at milan said lady madeleine to vivian we were to have joined their party lady mounteney is a trevor  i have had the pleasure of meeting lord mounteney in england at sir berdmore scropes do you know him  slightly the mounteneys pass the winter at rome where i hope we shall join them do you know the family intimately  mr ernest clay a nephew of his lordships i have seen a great deal of i suppose according to the adopted phraseology i ought to describe him as my friend although i am ignorant where he is at present and although unless he is himself extremely altered there scarcely can be two persons who now more differ in their pursuits and tempers than ourselves  ernest clay is he a friend of yours he is at munich attached to the legation i see you smile at the idea of ernest clay drawing up a protocol  madeleine you have never read me caroline mounteneys letter as you promised said miss fane i suppose full of raptures the alps and apennines the pyrenaean and the river po  by no means the whole letter is filled with an account of the ballet at la scala which according to caroline is a thousand times more interesting than mont blanc or the simplon  one of the immortal works of vigano i suppose said vivian he has raised the ballet of action to an equality with tragedy i have heard my father mention the splendid effect of his vestale and his otello  and yet said violet i do not like othello to be profaned it is not for operas and ballets we require the thrilling words  it is very true yet pastas acting in the opera was a grand performance and i have myself seldom witnessed a more masterly effect produced by any actor in the world than i did a fortnight ago at the opera at darmstadt by wild in othello  i think the history of desdemona is the most affecting of all tales said miss fane  the violent death of a woman young lovely and innocent is assuredly the most terrible of tragedies observed vivian  i have often asked myself said miss fane which is the most terrible destiny for the young to endure to meet death after a life of anxiety and suffering or suddenly to be cut off in the enjoyment of all things that make life delightful  for my part said vivian in the last instance i think that death can scarcely be considered an evil how infinitely is such a destiny to be preferred to that long apprenticeship of sorrow at the end of which we are generally as unwilling to die as at the commencement  and yet said miss fane there is something fearful in the idea of sudden death  very fearful muttered vivian in some cases for he thought of one whom he had sent to his great account before his time  violet my dear said lady madeleine have you finished your drawing of the bingenloch but miss fane would not leave the subject  very fearful in all cases mr grey how few of us are prepared to leave this world without warning and if from youth or sex or natural disposition a few may chance to be better fitted for the great change than their companions still i always think that in those cases in which we view our fellowcreatures suddenly departing from this world apparently without a bodily or mental pang there must be a moment of suffering which none of us can understand a terrible consciousness of meeting death in the very flush of life a moment of suffering which from its intense and novel character may appear an eternity of anguish i have always looked upon such an end as the most fearful of dispensations  violet my dear said her ladyship let us talk no more of death you have been silent a fortnight i think tonight you may sing miss fane rose and sat down to the instrument  it was a lively air calculated to drive away all melancholy feelings and cherishing sunny views of human life but rossinis muse did not smile tonight upon her who invoked its gay spirit and ere lady madeleine could interfere violet fane had found more congenial emotions in one of webers prophetic symphonies  o music miraculous art that makes a poets skill a jest revealing to the soul inexpressible feelings by the aid of inexplicable sounds a blast of thy trumpet and millions rush forward to die a peal of thy organ and uncounted nations sink down to pray mighty is thy threefold power  first thou canst call up all elemental sounds and scenes and subjects with the definiteness of reality strike the lyre lo the voice of the winds the flash of the lightning the swell of the wave the solitude of the valley  then thou canst speak to the secrets of a mans heart as if by inspiration strike the lyre lo our early love our treasured hate our withered joy our flattering hope  and lastly by thy mysterious melodies thou canst recall man from all thought of this world and of himself bringing back to his souls memory dark but delightful recollections of the glorious heritage which he has lost but which he may win again strike the lyre lo paradise with its palaces of inconceivable splendour and its gates of unimaginable glory  when vivian left the apartment of lady madeleine he felt no inclination to sleep and instead of retiring to rest he bent his steps towards the gardens it was a rich summer night the air recovered from the suns scorching rays was cool not chilling the moon was still behind the mountains but the dark blue heavens were studded with innumerable stars whose tremulous light quivered on the face of the river all human sounds had ceased to agitate and the note of the nightingale and the rush of the waters banished monotony without disturbing reflection but not for reflection had vivian grey deserted his chamber his heart was full but of indefinable sensations and forgetting the world in the intenseness of his emotions he felt too much to think  how long he had been pacing by the side of the river he knew not when he was awakened from his reverie by the sound of voices he looked up and saw lights moving at a distance the party at the new house had just broke up he stopped beneath a branching elmtree for a moment that the sound of his steps might not attract their attention and at this very instant the garden gate opened and closed with great violence the figure of a man approached as he passed vivian the moon rose up from above the brow of the mountain and lit up the countenance of the baron despair was stamped on his distracted features     chapter xi   on the evening of the next day there was to be a grand fête given at the new house by his imperial highness the ladies would treasure their energies for the impending ball and the morning was to pass without an excursion only lady madeleine whom vivian met taking her usual early promenade in the gardens seemed inclined to prolong it and even invited him to be her companion she talked of the fête and she expressed a hope that vivian would accompany their party but her air was not festive she seemed abstracted and disturbed and her voice more than once broke off abruptly at the commencement of a sentence which it seemed she had not courage to finish  at length she said suddenly mr grey i cannot conceal any longer that i am thinking of a very different subject from the ball as you form part of my thoughts i shall not hesitate to disburthen my mind to you i wish not to keep you in suspense it is of the mode of life which i see my brother which i see you pursuing here that i wish to speak she added with a tremulous voice may i speak with freedom  with the most perfect unreserve and confidence  you are aware that ems is not the first place at which i have met baron von konigstein  i am not ignorant that he has been in england  it cannot have escaped you that i acknowledged his acquaintance with reluctance  i should judge with the greatest  and yet it was with still more reluctance that i prevailed upon myself to believe you were his friend i experienced great relief when you told me how short and accidental had been your acquaintance i have experienced great pain in witnessing to what that acquaintance has led and it is with extreme sorrow for my own weakness in not having had courage to speak to you before and with a hope of yet benefiting you that i have been induced to speak to you now  i trust there is no cause either for your sorrow or your fear but much much cause for my gratitude  i have observed the constant attendance of yourself and my brother at the new house with the utmost anxiety i have seen too much not to be aware of the danger which young men and young men of honour must always experience at such places alas i have seen too much of baron von konigstein not to know that at such places especially his acquaintance is fatal the evident depression of your spirits yesterday determined me on a step which i have for the last few days been considering i can learn nothing from my brother i fear that i am even now too late but i trust that whatever may be your situation you will remember mr grey that you have friends that you will decide on nothing rash  lady madeleine said vivian i will not presume to express the gratitude which your generous conduct allows me to feel this moment repays me for a year of agony i affect not to misunderstand your meaning my opinion my detestation of the gaming table has always been and must always be the same i do assure you this and all things upon my honour far from being involved my cheek burns while i confess that i am master of a considerable sum acquired by this unhallowed practice you are aware of the singular fortune which awaited my first evening at ems that fortune was continued at the new house the very first day i dined there and when unexpectedly i was forced to play that fatal fortune has rendered my attendance at the new house necessary i found it impossible to keep away without subjecting myself to painful observations my depression of yesterday was occasioned by the receipt of letters from england i am ashamed of having spoken so much about myself and so little about those for whom you are more interested so far as i can judge you have no cause at present for any uneasiness with regard to mr st george you may perhaps have observed that we are not very intimate and therefore i cannot speak with any precision as to the state of his fortunes but i have reason to believe that they are by no means unfavourable and as for the baron  yes yes  i hardly know what i am to infer from your observations respecting him i certainly should infer something extremely bad were not i conscious that after the experience of five weeks i for one have nothing to complain of him the baron certainly is fond of play plays high indeed he has not had equal fortune at the new house as at the redoute at least i imagine so for he has given me no cause to believe in any way that he is a loser  if you could only understand the relief i feel at this moment i am sure you would not wonder that i prevailed upon myself to speak to you it may still be in my power however to prevent evil  yes certainly i think the best course now would be to speak to me frankly respecting von konigstein and if you are aware of anything which has passed in england of a nature  stop said lady madeleine agitated vivian was silent and some moments elapsed before his companion again spoke when she did her eyes were fixed on the ground and her tones were low but her voice was calm and steady  i am going to accept mr grey the confidence which you have proffered me but i do not affect to conceal that i speak even now with reluctance an effort and it will soon be over it is for the best lady madeleine paused one moment and then resumed with a firm voice  upwards of six years have now passed since baron von konigstein was appointed minister to london from the court of  although apparently young for such an important mission he had already distinguished himself as a diplomatist and with all the advantages of brilliant talents various accomplishments rank reputation person and a fascinating address i need not tell you that he immediately became of consideration even in the highest circles mr trevor i was then just married was at this period in office and was constantly in personal communication with the baron they became intimate and he was our constant guest he had the reputation of being a man of pleasure he was one for whose indiscretions there might be some excuse nor had anything ever transpired which could induce us to believe that baron von konigstein could be guilty of anything but an indiscretion at this period a relation and former ward of mr trevors a young man of considerable fortune and one whom we all fondly loved resided in our family we considered him as our brother with this individual baron von konigstein formed a strong friendship they were seldom apart our relation was not exempted from the failings of young men he led a dissipated life but he was very young and as unlike most relations we never allowed any conduct on his part to banish him from our society we trusted that the contrast which his own family afforded to his usual companions would in time render his habits less irregular we had now known baron von konigstein for upwards of a year and a half intimately nothing had transpired during this period to induce mr trevor to alter the opinion which he had entertained of him from the first he believed him to be a man of honour and in spite of a few imprudences of principle whatever might have been my own opinion of him at this period i had no reason to doubt the natural goodness of his disposition and though i could not hope that he was one who would assist us in our plans for the reformation of augustus i still was not sorry to believe that in the baron he would at least find a companion very different from the unprincipled and selfish beings by whom he was too often surrounded something occurred at this time which placed baron von konigstein according to his own declaration under lasting obligations to myself in the warmth of his heart he asked if there was any real and important service which he could do me i took advantage of the moment to speak to him about our young friend i detailed to him all our anxieties he anticipated all my wishes and promised to watch over him to be his guardian his friend his real friend mr grey continued her ladyship i struggle to restrain my feelings but the recollections of this period of my life are so painful that for a moment i must stop to recover myself  for a few minutes they walked on in silence vivian did not speak and when his companion resumed her tale he unconsciously pressed her arm  i try to be brief about three months after the baron had given me the pledge which i mentioned mr trevor was called up at an early hour one morning with the intelligence that his late ward was supposed to be at the point of death at a neighbouring hotel he instantly repaired to him and on the way the fatal truth was broken to him our friend had committed suicide he had been playing all night with one whom i cannot now name here lady madeleines voice died away but with a struggle she again spoke firmly  i mean with the baron some foreigners also and an englishman all intimate friends of von konigstein and scarcely known to the deceased our friend had been the only sufferer he had lost his whole fortune and more than his fortune and with a heart full of despair and remorse had with his own hand terminated his life the whole circumstances were so suspicious that they attracted public attention and mr trevor spared no exertion to bring the offenders to justice the baron had the hardihood to call upon us the next day of course in vain he wrote violent letters protesting his innocence that he was asleep during most of the night and accusing the others who were present of a conspiracy the unhappy business now attracted very general interest its consequence on me was an alarming illness of a most unfortunate kind i was therefore prevented from interfering or indeed knowing anything that took place but my husband informed me that the baron was involved in a public correspondence that the accused parties recriminated and that finally he was convinced that von konigstein if there were any difference was if possible the most guilty however this might be he soon obtained his recall from his own government he wrote to us both before he left england but i was too ill to hear of his letters until mr trevor informed me that he had returned them unopened and now i must give utterance to that which as yet has always died upon my lips the unhappy victim was the brother of miss fane  and mr st george said vivian knowing all this which surely he must have done how came he to tolerate for an instant the advances of such a man  my brother said lady madeleine is a very good young man with a kind heart and warm feelings but my brother has not much knowledge of the world and he is too honourable himself ever to believe that what he calls a gentleman can be dishonest my brother was not in england when the unhappy event took place and of course the various circumstances have not made the same impression upon him as upon us he has heard of the affair only from me and young men too often imagine that women are apt to exaggerate in matters of this nature which of course few of us can understand the baron had not the good feeling or perhaps had not the power connected as he was with the grand duke to affect ignorance of our former acquaintance or to avoid a second one i was obliged formally to present him to my brother i was quite perplexed how to act i thought of writing to him the next morning impressing upon him the utter impossibility of our acquaintance being renewed but this proceeding involved a thousand difficulties how was a man of his distinction a man who not only from his rank but from his disposition is always a remarkable and a remarked character wherever he may be how could he account to the grand duke and to his numerous friends for his not associating with a party with whom he was perpetually in contact explanations and worse must have been the consequence i could hardly expect him to leave ems it was perhaps out of his power and for miss fane to leave ems at this moment was most strenuously prohibited by her physician while i was doubtful and deliberating the conduct of baron von konigstein himself prevented me from taking any step whatever feeling all the awkwardness of his situation he seized with eagerness the opportunity of becoming intimate with a member of the family whom he had not before known his amusing conversation and insinuating address immediately enlisted the feelings of my brother in his favour you know yourself that the very morning after their introduction they were riding together as they became more intimate the baron boldly spoke to albert in confidence of his acquaintance with us in england and of the unhappy circumstances which led to its termination albert was deceived by this seeming courage and candour he has become the barons friend and has adopted his version of the unhappy story and as the baron has had too much delicacy to allude to the affair in a defence of himself to me he calculated that the representations of albert who he was conscious would not preserve the confidence which he has always intended him to betray would assist in producing in my mind an impression in his favour the neapolitan story which he told the other day at dinner was of himself i confess to you that though i have not for a moment doubted his guilt still i was weak enough to consider that his desire to become reconciled to me was at least an evidence of a repentant heart and the neapolitan story deceived me actuated by these feelings and acting as i thought wisest under existing circumstances i ceased to discourage his advances your acquaintance which we all desired to cultivate was perhaps another reason for enduring his presence his subsequent conduct has undeceived me i am convinced now not only of his former guilt but also that he is not changed and that with his accustomed talent he has been acting a part which for some reason or other he has no longer any object in maintaining  and miss fane said vivian she must know all  she knows nothing in detail she was so young at the time that we had no difficulty in keeping the particular circumstances of her brothers death and the sensation which it excited a secret from her as she grew up i have thought it proper that the mode of his death should no longer be concealed from her and she has learnt from some incautious observations of albert enough to make her look upon the baron with terror it is for violet continued lady madeleine that i have the severest apprehensions for the last fortnight her anxiety for her cousin has produced an excitement which i look upon with more dread than anything that can happen to her she has entreated me to speak to albert and also to you the last few days she has become more easy and serene she accompanies us tonight the weather is so beautiful that the night air is scarcely to be feared and a gay scene will have a favourable influence upon her spirits your depression last night did not however escape her notice once more let me say how i rejoice at hearing what you have told me i unhesitatingly believe all that you have said watch albert i have no fear for yourself     chapter xii   the company at the grand dukes fête was most select that is to say it consisted of everybody who was then at the baths those who had been presented to his highness having the privilege of introducing any number of their friends and those who had no friend to introduce them purchasing tickets at an enormous price from cracowsky the wily polish intendant the entertainment was imperial no expense and no exertion were spared to make the hired lodginghouse look like an hereditary palace and for a week previous to the great evening the whole of the neighbouring town of wiesbaden the little capital of the duchy had been put under contribution what a harvest for cracowsky what a commission from the restaurateur for supplying the refreshments what a percentage on hired mirrors and dingy hangings  the grand duke covered with orders received every one with the greatest condescension and made to each of his guests a most flattering speech his suite in new uniforms simultaneously bowed directly the flattering speech was finished  madame von furstenburg i feel the greatest pleasure in seeing you my greatest pleasure is to be surrounded by my friends madame von furstenburg i trust that your amiable and delightful family are quite well the party passed on cravatischeff continued his highness inclining his head round to one of his aidesdecamp cravatischeff a very fine woman is madame von furstenburg there are few women whom i more admire than madame von furstenburg  prince salvinski i feel the greatest pleasure in seeing you my greatest pleasure is to be surrounded by my friends poland honours no one more than prince salvinski cravatischeff a remarkable bore is prince salvinski there are few men of whom i have a greater terror than prince salvinski  baron von konigstein i feel the greatest pleasure in seeing you my greatest pleasure is to be surrounded by my friends baron von konigstein i have not yet forgotten the story of the fair venetian cravatischeff an uncommonly pleasant fellow is baron von konigstein there are few men whose company i more enjoy than baron von konigsteins  count von altenburgh i feel the greatest pleasure in seeing you my greatest pleasure is to be surrounded by my friends you will not forget to give me your opinion of my austrian troop cravatischeff a very good billiard player is count von altenburgh there are few men whose play i would sooner bet upon than count von altenburghs  lady madeleine trevor i feel the greatest pleasure in seeing you my greatest pleasure is to be surrounded by my friends miss fane your servant mr st george mr grey cravatischeff a most splendid woman is lady madeleine trevor there is no woman whom i more admire than lady madeleine trevor and cravatischeff miss fane too a remarkably fine girl is miss fane  the great saloon of the new house afforded excellent accommodation for the dancers it opened on the gardens which though not very large were tastefully laid out and were this evening brilliantly illuminated in the smaller saloon the austrian troop amused those who were not fascinated by waltz or quadrille with acting proverbs the regular dramatic performance was thought too heavy a business for the evening there was sufficient amusement for all and those who did not dance and to whom proverbs were no novelty walked and talked stared at others and were themselves stared at and this perhaps was the greatest amusement of all baron von konigstein did certainly tonight look neither like an unsuccessful gamester nor a designing villain among many who were really amusing he was the most so and apparently without the least consciousness of it attracted the admiration of all to the trevor party he had attached himself immediately and was constantly at lady madeleines side introducing to her in the course of the evening his own and mr st georges particular friends mr and mrs fitzloom among many smiling faces vivian greys was clouded the presence of the baron annoyed him when they first met he was conscious that he was stiff and cool one moments reflection convinced him of the folly of his conduct and he made a struggle to be very civil in five minutes time he had involuntarily insulted the baron who stared at his friend and evidently did not comprehend him  grey said his excellency very quietly you are not in a good humour tonight what is the matter this is not at all a temper to come to a fête in what wont miss fane dance with you asked the baron with an arched smile  i wonder wind can induce your excellency to talk such nonsense  your excellency by jove thats good what the deuce is the matter with the man it is miss fane then eh  baron von konigstein i wish you to understand  my dear fellow i never could understand anything i think you have insulted me in a most disgraceful manner and i positively must call you out unless you promise to dine at my rooms with me tomorrow to meet de boeffleurs  i cannot  why not you have no engagement with lady madeleine i know for st george has agreed to come  yes  de boeffleurs leaves ems next week it is sooner than he expected and i wish to have a quiet evening together before he goes i should be very vexed if you were not there we have scarcely been enough together lately what with the new house in the evening and riding parties in the morning and those fitzloom girls with whom st george is playing a most foolish game he will be taken in now if he is not on his guard we really never meet at least not in a quiet friendly way and so now will you come  st george is positively coming  oh yes positively do not be afraid of his gaining ground on the little violet in your absence  well then my dear von konigstein i will come  well that is yourself again it made me quite unhappy to see you look so sour and melancholy one would have thought that i was some bore salvinski at least by the way you spoke to me well mind you come it is a promise good i must go and say just one word to the lovely little saxon girl bythebye grey one word before i am off list to a friend you are on the wrong scent about miss fane st george i think has no chance there and now no wish to succeed the game is your own if you like trust my word she is an angel the good powers prosper you so saying the baron glided off  mr st george had danced with miss fane the only quadrille in which lady madeleine allowed her to join he was now waltzing with aurelia fitzloom and was at the head of a band of adventurous votaries of terpsichore who wearied with the commonplace convenience of a saloon had ventured to invoke the muse on the lawn  a most interesting sight lady madeleine said mr fitzloom as he offered her his arm and advised their instant presence as patrons of the fête du village for such baron von konigstein had most happily termed it a delightful man that baron von konigstein and says such delightful things fête du village how very good  that is miss fitzloom then whom my brother is waltzing with asked lady madeleine  not exactly my lady said mr fitzloom not exactly miss fitzloom rather miss aurelia fitzloom my third daughter our third eldest as mrs fitzloom sometimes says for really it is necessary to distinguish with such a family as ours you know  let us walk said miss fane to vivian for she was now leaning upon his arm the evening is deliriously soft but even with the protection of a cashmere i scarcely dare venture to stand still lady madeleine seems very much engaged at present what amusing people these fitzlooms are  mrs fitzloom i have not heard her voice yet  no mrs fitzloom does not talk albert says she makes it a rule never to speak in the presence of a stranger she deals plenteously however at home in domestic apophthegms if you could but hear him imitating them all whenever she does speak she finishes all her sentences by confessing that she is conscious of her own deficiencies but that she has taken care to give her daughters the very best education they are what albert calls fine girls and i am glad he has made friends with them for after all he must find it rather dull here bythebye mr grey i am afraid that you cannot find this evening very amusing the absence of a favourite pursuit always makes a sensible void and these walls must remind you of more piquant pleasures than waltzing with fine london ladies or promenading up a dull terrace with an invalid  i assure you that you are quite misinformed as to the mode in which i generally pass my evenings  i hope i am said miss fane in rather a serious tone i wish i could also he mistaken in my suspicions of the mode in which albert spends his time he is sadly changed for the first month that we were here he seemed to prefer nothing in the world to our society and nowi was nearly saying that we had not seen him for one single evening these three weeks i cannot understand what you find at this house of such absorbing interest although i know you think i am much mistaken in my suspicions still i feel very anxious i spoke to albert today but he scarcely answered me or said that which it was a pleasure for me to forget  mr st george should feel highly gratified in having excited such an interest in the mind of miss fane  he should not feel more gratified than all who are my friends for all who are such i must ever experience the liveliest interest  how happy must those be who feel that they have a right to count miss fane among their friends  i have the pleasure then i assure you of making many happy and among them mr grey  vivian was surprised that he did not utter some complimentary answer but he knew not why the words would not come and instead of speaking he was thinking of what had been spoken  how brilliant are these gardens said vivian looking at the sky  very brilliant said miss fane looking on the ground conversation seemed nearly extinct and yet neither offered to turn back  good heavens you are ill exclaimed vivian when on accidentally turning to his companion he found she was in tears shall we go back or will you wait here can i fetch anything i fear you are very ill  no not very ill but very foolish let us walk on and sighing she seemed suddenly to recover  i am ashamed of this foolishness what can you think but i am so agitated so nervous i hope you will forgeti hope  perhaps the air has suddenly affected you shall we go in nothing has been said nothing happened no one has dared to say or do anything to annoy you speak dear miss fane the the the words died on vivians lips yet a power he could not withstand urged him to speak the the the baron  ah almost shrieked miss fane stop one second an effort and i must be well nothing has happened and no one has done or said anything but it is of something that should be said of something that should be done that i was thinking and it overcame me  miss fane said vivian if there be anything which i can do or devise any possible way that i can exert myself in your service speak with the most perfect confidence do not fear that your motives will be misconceived that your purpose will be misinterpreted that your confidence will be misunderstood you are addressing one who would lay down his life for you who is willing to perform all your commands and forget them when performed i beseech you to trust me believe me that you shall not repent  she answered not but holding down her head covered her face with her small white hand her lovely face which was crimsoned with her flashing blood they were now at the end of the terrace to return was impossible if they remained stationary they must be perceived and joined what was to be done he led her down a retired walk still farther from the house as they proceeded in silence the bursts of the music and the loud laughter of the joyous guests became fainter and fainter till at last the sounds died away into echo and echo into silence  a thousand thoughts dashed through vivians mind in rapid succession but a painful one a most painful one to him to any man always remained the last his companion would not speak yet to allow her to return home without freeing her mind of the fearful burden which evidently overwhelmed it was impossible at length he broke a silence which seemed to have lasted an age  do not believe that i am taking advantage of an agitating moment to extract from you a confidence which you may repent i feel assured that i am right in supposing that you have contemplated in a calmer moment the possibility of my being of service to you that in short there is something in which you require my assistance my cooperation an assistance a cooperation which if it produce any benefit to you will make me at length feel that i have not lived in vain no feeling of false delicacy shall prevent me from assisting you in giving utterance to thoughts which you have owned it is absolutely necessary should be expressed remember that you have allowed me to believe that we are friends do not prove by your silence that we are friends only in name  i am overwhelmed i cannot speak my face burns with shame i have miscalculated my strength of mind perhaps my physical strength what what must you think of me she spoke in a low and smothered voice  think of you everything which the most devoted respect dare think of an object which it reverences do not believe that i am one who would presume an instant on my position because i have accidentally witnessed a young and lovely woman betrayed into a display of feeling which the artificial forms of cold society cannot contemplate and dare to ridicule you are speaking to one who also has felt who though a man has wept who can comprehend sorrow who can understand the most secret sensations of an agitated spirit dare to trust me be convinced that hereafter neither by word nor look hint nor sign on my part shall you feel save by your own wish that you have appeared to vivian grey in any other light than in the saloons we have just quitted  generous man i dare trust anything to you that i dare trust to human being but here her voice died away  it is a painful thing for me to attempt to guess your thoughts but if it be of mr st george that you are thinking have no fear respecting him have no fear about his present situation trust to me that there shall be no anxiety for his future one i will be his unknown guardian his unseen friend the promoter of your wishes the protector of your  no no said miss fane with firmness and looking quickly up as if her mind were relieved by discovering that all this time vivian had never imagined she was thinking of him no no you are mistaken it is not of mr st george of mr st george only that i am thinking i am much better now i shall be able in an instant to speak be able i trust to forget how foolish how very foolish i have been  let us walk on continued miss fane let us walk on we can easily account for our absence if it be remarked and it is better that it should be all over i feel quite well and shall be able to speak quite firmly now  do not hurry there is no fear of our absence being remarked lady madeleine is so surrounded  after what has passed it seems ridiculous in me to apologise as i had intended for speaking to you on a graver subject than what has generally formed the point of conversation between us i feared that you might misunderstand the motives which have dictated my conduct i have attempted not to appear agitated and i have been overcome i trust that you will not be offended if i recur to the subject of the new house do not believe that i ever would have allowed my fears my girlish fears so to have overcome my discretion so to have overcome indeed all propriety of conduct on my part as to have induced me to have sought an interview with you to moralise to you about your mode of life no no it is not of this that i wish to speak or rather that i will speak i will hope i will pray that albert and yourself have never found in that which you have followed as an amusement the source the origin the cause of a single unhappy or even anxious moment mr grey i will believe all this  dearest miss fane believe it with confidence of st george i can with sincerity aver that it is my firm opinion that far from being involved his fortune is not in the slightest degree injured believe me i will not attempt to quiet you now as i would have done at any other time by telling you that you magnify your fears and allow your feelings to exaggerate the danger which exists there has been danger there is danger play high play has been and is pursued at this new house but mr st george has never been a loser and if the exertions of man can avail never shall at least unfairly as to the other individual whom you have honoured by the interest which you have professed in his welfare no one can more thoroughly detest any practice which exists in this world than he does the gamingtable  oh you have made me so happy i feel so persuaded that you have not deceived me the tones of your voice your manner your expression convince me that you have been sincere and that i am happy at least for the present  for ever i trust miss fane  let me now prevent future misery let me speak about that which has long dwelt on my mind like a nightmare about that which i did fear it was almost too late to speak not of your pursuit not even of that fatal pursuit do i now think but of your companion in this amusement in all amusements it is he he whom i dread whom i look upon with horror even to him i cannot say with hatred  the baron said vivian calmly  i cannot name him dread him fear him avoid him it is he that i mean he of whom i thought that you were the victim you must have been surprised you must have wondered at our conduct towards him oh when lady madeleine turned from him with coolness when she answered him in tones which to you might have appeared harsh she behaved to him in comparison to what is his due and what we sometimes feel to be our duty with affection actually with affection and regard no human being can know what horror is until he looks upon a fellowcreature with the eyes that i look upon that man she leant upon vivians arm with her whole weight and even then he thought she must have sunk neither spoke how solemn is the silence of sorrow  i am overcome continued miss fane the remembrance of what he has done overwhelms me i cannot speak it the recollection is death yet you must know it that you might know it i have before attempted i wished to have spared myself the torture which i now endure you must know it i will write ay that will do i will write i cannot speak now it is impossible but beware of him you are so young  i have no words now to thank you dear miss fane for this had i been the victim of von konigstein i should have been repaid for all my misery by feeling that you regretted its infliction but i trust that i am in no danger though young i fear that i am one who must not count his time by calendars an aged interpreter though young in days would that i could be deceived fear not for your cousin trust to one whom you have made think better of this world and of his fellowcreatures  the sound of approaching footsteps and the light laugh of pleasure told of some who were wandering like themselves  we had better return said miss fane i fear that lady madeleine will observe that i look unwell some one approaches no they pass only the top of the walk it was mr st george and aurelia fitzloom  quick flew the brilliant hours and soon the dance was over and the music mute  it was late when vivian retired as he opened his door he was surprised to find lights in his chamber the figure of a man appeared seated at the table it moved it was essper george     chapter xiii   the reader will remember that vivian had agreed to dine on the day after the fête with the baron in his private apartments this was an arrangement which in fact the custom of the house did not permit but the irregularities of great men who are attended by chasseurs are occasionally winked at by a supple maître dhôtel vivian had reasons for not regretting his acceptance of the invitation and he never shook hands with the chevalier de boeffleurs apparently with greater cordiality than on the day on which he met him at dinner at the baron von konigsteins mr st george had not arrived  past five said the baron riding out i suppose with the fitzlooms aurelia is certainly a fine girl but i should think that lady madeleine would hardly approve the connection the st georges have blood in their veins and would i suppose as soon think of marrying a fitzloom as we germans should of marrying a woman without a von before her name we are quite alone grey only the chevalier and st george i had an idea of asking salvinski but he is such a regular steamengine and began such a long story last night about his interview with the king of ashantee that the bare possibility of his taking it into his head to finish it today frightened me you were away early from the grand dukes last night the business went off well  very well indeed said the chevalier de boeffleurs completing by this speech the first dozen of words which he had uttered since his stay at ems  i think that last night lady madeleine trevor looked perfectly magnificent and a certain lady too grey eh here is st george my dear fellow how are you has the fair aurelia recovered from the last nights fatigues now ernstorff dinner as soon as possible  the baron made up today certainly for the silence of his friend the chevalier he outdid himself story after story adventure after adventure followed each other with exciting haste in fact the baron never ceased talking the whole dinner except when he refreshed himself with wine which he drank copiously a nice observer would perhaps have considered the barons high spirits artificial and his conversation an effort yet his temper though lively was generally equable and his ideas which always appeared to occur easily were usually thrown out in fluent phraseology the dinner was long and a great deal of wine was drunk more than most of the parties present for a long time had been accustomed to about eight oclock the chevalier proposed going to the redoute but the baron objected  let us have an evening altogether surely we have had enough of the redoute in my opinion one of the advantages of the fête is that there is no new house tonight conversation is a novelty on a moderate calculation i must have told you today at least fifty original anecdotes i have done my duty it is the chevaliers turn now come de boeffleurs a choice one  i remember a story prince salvinski once told me  no no that is too bad none of that polish bears romances if we have his stories we may as well have his company  but it is a very curious story continued the chevalier with a little animation  oh so is every story according to the storier  i think von konigstein you imagine no one can tell a story but yourself said de boeffleurs actually indignant vivian had never heard him speak so much before and really began to believe that he was not quite an automaton  let us have it said st george  it is a story told of a polish nobleman a count somebody i never can remember their crackjaw names well the point is this said the silent little chevalier who apparently already repented of the boldness of his offer and misdoubting his powers wished to begin with the end of his tale the point is this he was playing one day at ecarté with the governor of wilna the stake was trifling but he had a bet you see with the governor of a thousand roubles a bet with the governors secretary never mind the amount say two hundred and fifty you see then he went on the turnup with the commandants wife and took the pips on the trumps with the archbishop of warsaw to understand the point of the story you see you must have a distinct conception how the game stood you see st george there was the bet with the governor one thousand roubles the governors secretary never mind the amount say two hundred and fifty turnup with the commandants lady and the pips with the archbishop of warsaw proposed three times one for the king the governor drew ace the governor was already three and the ten when the governor scored king the archbishop gave the odds drew knave queen one hand the count offered to propose fourth time governor refused king to six ace fell to knave queen cleared on governor lost besides bets with the whole étatmajor the secretary gave his bill the commandants lady pawned her jewels and the archbishop was done on the pips  by jove what a salvinski  how many trumps had the governor asked st george  three said the chevalier  then it is impossible i do not believe the story it could not be  i beg your pardon said the chevalier you see the governor had  by jove dont let us have it all over again said the baron well if this be your model for an afterdinner anecdote which ought to be as piquant as an anchovy toast i will never complain of your silence in future  the story is a true story said the chevalier have you got a pack of cards von konigstein i will show it you  there is not such a thing in the room said the baron  well i never heard of a room without a pack of cards before said the chevalier i will send for one to my own apartments  perhaps ernstorff has got a pack here ernstorff have you got a pack of cards thats well bring it immediately  the cards were brought and the chevalier began to fight his battle over again but could not satisfy mr st george you see there was the bet with the governor and the pips as i said before with the archbishop of warsaw  my dear de boeffleurs lets no more of this if you like to have a game of ecarté with st george well and good but as for quarrelling the whole evening about some blundering lie of salvinskis it really is too much you two can play and i can talk to don vivian who bythebye is rather of the rueful countenance tonight why my dear fellow i have not heard your voice this evening frightened by the fate of the archbishop of warsaw i suppose  ecarté is so devilish dull said st george and it is such a trouble to deal  i will deal for both if you like said de boeffleurs i am used to dealing  oh no i wont play ecarté let us have something in which we can all join  rougeetnoir suggested the chevalier in a careless tone as if he had no taste for the amusement  there is not enough is there asked st george  oh two are enough you know one deals much more four  well i dont care rougeetnoir then let us have rougeetnoir von konigstein what say you to rougeetnoir de boeffleurs says we can play it here very well come grey  oh rougeetnoir rougeetnoir said the baron have not you both had rougeetnoir enough am i not to be allowed one holiday well anything to please you so rougeetnoir if it must be so  if all wish it i have no objection said vivian  well then let us sit down ernstorff has i dare say another pack of cards and st george will be dealer i know he likes that ceremony  no no i appoint the chevalier  very well said de boeffleurs the plan will be for two to bank against the table the table to play on the same colour by joint agreement you can join me von konigstein and pay or receive with me from mr st george and grey  i will bank with you if you like chevalier said vivian  oh certainly that is if you like but perhaps the baron is more used to banking you perhaps dont understand it  perfectly it appears to me to be very simple  no dont you bank grey said st george i want you to play with me against the chevalier and the baron i like your luck  luck is very capricious remember  oh no i like your luck dont bank  be it so  playing commenced an hour elapsed and the situation of none of the parties was materially different from what it had been when they began the game vivian proposed leaving off but mr st george avowed that he felt very fortunate and that he had a presentiment that he should win another hour elapsed and he had lost considerably eleven oclock vivians luck had also deserted him mr st george was losing desperately midnight vivian had lost back half his gains on the season st george still more desperate all his coolness had deserted him he had persisted obstinately against a run on the red then floundered and got entangled in a seesaw which alone cost him a thousand  ernstorff now brought in refreshments and for a moment they ceased playing the baron opened a bottle of champagne and st george and the chevalier were stretching their legs and composing their minds in very different ways the first in walking rapidly up and down the room and the other by lying very quietly at his full length on the sofa vivian was employed in building houses with the cards  grey said the chevalier de boeffleurs i cannot imagine why you do not for a moment try to forget the cards that is the only way to win never sit musing over the table  but grey was not to be persuaded to give up building his pagoda which now many stories high like a more celebrated but scarcely more substantial structure fell with a crash vivian collected the scattered cards into two divisions  now said the baron seating himself for st georges revenge  the chevalier and the greatest sufferer took their places  is ernstorff coming in again baron asked vivian  no i think not  let us be sure it is disagreeable to be disturbed at this time of night  lock the door then said st george  a very good plan said vivian and he locked it accordingly  now gentlemen said vivian rising from the table and putting both packs of cards into his pocket now gentlemen i have another game to play the chevalier started on his chair the baron turned pale but both were silent mr st george continued vivian i think that you owe the chevalier de boeffleurs about four thousand napoleons and to baron von konigstein something more than half that sum i have to inform you that it is unnecessary for you to satisfy the claims of either of these gentlemen which are founded neither in law nor in honour  mr grey what am i to understand asked the quiet chevalier de boeffleurs with the air of a wolf and the voice of a lion  understand sir answered vivian sternly that i am not one who will be bullied by a blackleg  grey good god what do you mean asked the baron  that which it is my duty not my pleasure to explain baron von konigstein  if you mean to insinuate burst forth the chevalier  i mean to insinuate nothing i leave insinuations and innuendoes to chevaliers dindustrie i mean to prove everything  mr st george did not speak but seemed as utterly astounded and overwhelmed as baron von konigstein himself who with his arm leaning on the table his hands clasped and the forefinger of his right hand playing convulsively on his left was pale as death and did not even breathe  gentlemen said vivian i shall not detain you long though i have much to say that is to the purpose i am perfectly cool and believe me perfectly resolute let me recommend to you all the same temperament it may be better for you rest assured that if you flatter yourselves that i am one to be pigeoned and then bullied you are mistaken in one word i am aware of everything that has been arranged for the reception of mr st george and myself this evening your marked cards are in my pocket and can only be obtained by you with my life here are two of us against two we are equally matched in number and i gentlemen am armed if i were not you would not dare to go to extremities is it not then the wisest course to be temperate my friends  this is some vile conspiracy of your own fellow said de boeffleurs marked cards indeed a pretty tale forsooth the ministers of a firstrate power playing with marked cards the story will gain credit and on the faith of whom an adventurer that no one knows who having failed this night in his usual tricks and lost money which he cannot pay takes advantage of the marked cards which he has not succeeded in introducing and pretends forsooth that they are those which he has stolen from our table our own cards being previously to his accusation concealed in a secret pocket  the impudence of the fellow staggered even vivian as for mr st george he stared like a wild man before vivian could answer him the baron had broken silence it was with the greatest effort that he seemed to dig his words out of his breast  no no this is too much it is all over i am lost but i will not add crime to crime your courage and your fortune have saved you mr grey and your friend from the designs of villains and you wretch said he turning to de boeffleurs sleep now in peace at length you have undone me he leant on the table and buried his face in his hands  chickenhearted fool said the chevalier is this the end of all your promises and all your pledges but remember sir remember i have no taste for scenes good night gentlemen baron i expect to hear from you  stop sir said vivian no one leaves this room without my permission  i am at your service sir when you please said the chevalier  it is not my intention to detain you long sir far from it i have every inclination to assist you in your last exit from this room had i time it should not be by the door as it is go in the devils name so saying he hurled the adventurous frenchman half down the corridor  baron von konigstein said vivian turning to the baron you have proved yourself by your conduct this evening to be a better man than i imagined you i confess that i thought you had been too much accustomed to such scenes to be sensible of the horror of detection  never said the baron with emphasis with energy the firm voice and manner in which he pronounced this single word wonderfully contrasted with his delivery when he had last spoke but his voice immediately died away  tis all over i have no wish to excite your pity gentlemen or to gain your silence by practising upon your feelings be silent i am not the less ruined not the less disgraced not the less utterly undone be silent my honour all the same in fourandtwenty hours has gone for ever i have no motive then to deceive you you must believe what i speak even what i speak the most degraded of men i say again never never never never never was my honour before sullied though guilty of a thousand follies you see before you gentlemen the unhappy victim of circumstances of circumstances which he has in vain struggled to control to which he has at length fallen a victim i am not pretending for a moment that my crimes are to be accounted for by an inexorable fate and not to be expiated by my everlasting misery no no i have been too weak to be virtuous but i have been tried tried most bitterly i am the most unfortunate of men i was not born to be a villain four years have passed since i was banished from the country in which i was honoured my prospects in life blasted my peace of mind destroyed and all because a crime was committed of any participation in which i am as innocent as yourselves driven in despair to wander i tried in the wild dissipation of naples to forget my existence and my misery i found my fate in the person of this vile frenchman who never since has quitted me even after two years of madness in that fatal place my natural disposition rallied i struggled to save myself i quitted it i was already involved to de boeffleurs i became still more so in gaining from him the means of satisfying all claims against me alas i found i had sold myself to a devil a very devil with a heart like an adders incapable of a stray generous sensation he has looked upon mankind during his whole life with the eyes of a bully of a gaminghouse i still struggled to free myself from this man and i indemnified him for his advances by procuring him a place in the mission to which with the greatest difficulty and perseverance i had at length obtained my appointment in public life i yet hoped to forget my private misery at frankfort i felt that though not happy i might be calm i determined never again even to run the risk of enduring the slavery of debt i foreswore with the most solemn oaths the gaming table and had it not been for the perpetual sight of de boeffleurs i might perhaps have felt at ease though the remembrance of my blighted prospects the eternal feeling that i experienced of being born for nobler ends was quite sufficient perpetually to embitter my existence the second year of my frankfort appointment i was tempted to this unhappy place the unexpected sight of faces which i had known in england though they called up the most painful associations strengthened me nevertheless in my resolution to be virtuous my unexpected fortune at the redoute the first night made me forget all my resolves and has led to all this misery i make my sad tale brief i got involved at the new house de boeffleurs once more assisted me though his terms were most severe yet yet again i was mad enough vile enough to risk what i did not possess i lost to prince salvinski and a russian gentleman a considerable sum on the night before the fête it is often the custom at the new house as you know among men who are acquainted to pay and receive all losses which are considerable on the next night of meeting the fête gave me breathing time it was not necessary to redeem my pledge till the fourth night i rushed to de boeffleurs he refused to assist me alleging his own losses and his previous advance what was to be done no possibility of making any arrangement with salvinski had he won of me as others have done an arrangement though painful would perhaps have been possible but by a singular fate whenever i have chanced to be successful it is of this man that i have won de boeffleurs then was the only chance he was inexorable i prayed to him i promised him everything i offered him any terms in vain at length when he had worked me up to the last point of despair he whispered hope i listened let me be quick why finish you know i fell the baron again covered his face and appeared perfectly overwhelmed  by god it is too horrible said st george grey let us do something for him  my dear st george said vivian be calm you are taken by surprise i was prepared for all this believe me it is better for you to leave us i recommend you to retire and meet me in the morning breakfast with me at eight we can then arrange everything  vivians conduct had been so decisive and evidently so well matured that st george felt that in the present case it was for him only to obey and he retired with wonder still expressed on his countenance for he had not yet in the slightest degree recovered from the first surprise  baron von konigstein said vivian to the unhappy man we are alone mr st george has left the room you are freed from the painful presence of the cousin of captain fane  you know all then exclaimed the baron quickly looking up or you have read my secret thoughts how wonderful at that very moment i was thinking of my friend would i had died with him you know all then and now you must believe me guilty yet at this moment of annihilating sorrow when i can gain nothing by deceit i swear and if i swear falsely may i fall down a livid corpse at your feet i swear that i was guiltless of the crime for which i suffered guiltless as yourself what may be my fate i know not probably a few hours and all will be over yet before we part sir it would be a relief you would be doing a generous service to a dying man to bear a message from me to one with whom you are acquainted to one whom i cannot now name  lady madeleine trevor  again you have read my thoughts lady madeleine is it she who told you of my early history  all that i know is known to many  i must speak if you have time if you can listen for half an hour to a miserable being it would be a consolation to me i should die with ease if i thought that lady madeleine could believe me innocent of that first great offence  your excellency may address anything to me if it be your wish even at this hour of the night it may be better after what has passed we neither of us can sleep and this business must be arranged at once  my object is that lady madeleine should receive from me at this moment at a time when i can have no interest to deceive an account of the particulars of her cousins and my friends death i sent it written after the horrid event but she was ill and trevor who was very bitter against me returned the letters unopened for four years i have never travelled without these rejected letters this year i have them not but you could convey to lady madeleine my story as now given to you to you at this terrible moment  speak on  i must say one word of my connection with the family to enable you fully to understand the horrid event of which if as i believe you only know what all know you can form but a most imperfect conception when i was minister at the court of london i became acquainted became indeed intimate with mr trevor then in office the husband of lady madeleine she was just married of myself at that time i may say that though depraved i was not heartless and that there were moments when i panted to be excellent lady madeleine and myself became friends she found in me a companion who not only respected her talents and delighted in her conversation but one who in return was capable of instructing and was overjoyed to amuse her i loved her but when i loved her i ceased to be a libertine at first i thought that nothing in the world could have tempted me to have allowed her for an instant to imagine that i dared to look upon her in any other light than as a friend but the negligence the coldness of trevor the overpowering mastery of my own passions drove me one day past the line and i wrote that which i dared not utter it never entered into my mind for an instant to insult such a woman with the commonplace sophistry of a ribald no i loved her with all my spirits strength i would have sacrificed all my views in life my ambition my family my fortune my country to have gained her and i told her this in terms of respectful adoration i worshipped the divinity even while i attempted to profane the altar when i had sent this letter i was in despair conviction of the insanity of my conduct flashed across my mind i expected never to see her again there came an answer i opened it with the greatest agitation to my surprise an appointment why trouble you with a detail of my feelings my mad hope my dark despair the moment for the interview arrived i was received neither with affection nor anger in sorrow she spoke i listened in despair i was more madly in love with her than ever that very love made me give her such evidences of a contrite spirit that i was pardoned i rose with a resolution to be virtuous with a determination to be her friend then i made the fatal promise which you know of to be doubly the friend of a man whose friend i already was it was then that i pledged myself to lady madeleine to be the guardian spirit of her cousin here the baron overpowered by his emotions leant back in his chair and ceased to speak in a few minutes he resumed  i did my duty by all thats sacred i did my duty night and day i was with young fane a hundred times he was on the brink of ruin a hundred times i saved him one day one nevertobeforgotten day one most dark and damnable day i called on him and found him on the point of joining a coterie of desperate character i remonstrated with him i entreated i supplicated him not to go in vain at last he agreed to forego his engagement on condition that i dined with him there were important reasons that day for my not staying with him yet every consideration vanished when i thought of her for whom i was exerting myself he was frantic this day and imagining that there was no chance of his leaving his home i did not refuse to drink freely to drink deeply my doing so was the only way to keep him at home as we were passing down pall mall we met two foreigners of distinction and a noble of your country they were men of whom we both knew little i had myself introduced fane to the foreigners a few days before being aware that they were men of high rank after some conversation they asked us to join them at supper at the house of their english friend i declined but nothing could induce fane to refuse them and i finally accompanied them play was introduced after supper i made an ineffectual struggle to get fane home but i was too full of wine to be energetic after losing a small sum i got up from the table and staggering to a sofa fell fast asleep even as i passed fanes chair in this condition my master thought was evident and i pulled him by the shoulder all was useless i woke to madness it was terrible to witness the anguish of von konigstein  could you not clear yourself asked vivian for he felt it necessary to speak  clear myself everything told against me the villains were my friends not the sufferers i was not injured my dining with him was part of the conspiracy he was intoxicated previous to his ruin conscious of my innocence quite desperate but confiding in my character i accused the guilty trio they recriminated and answered and without clearing themselves convinced the public that i was their dissatisfied and disappointed tool i can speak no more  it is awful to witness sudden death but oh how much more awful it is to witness in a moment the moral fall of a fellowcreature how tremendous is the quick succession of mastering passions the firm the terrifically firm the madly resolute denial of guilt that eagerness of protestation which is a sure sign of crime then the agonising suspense before the threatened proof is produced the hell of detection the audible anguish of sorrow the curses of remorse the silence of despair few of us unfortunately have passed through life without having beheld some instance of this instantaneous degradation of human nature but oh how terrible is it when the confessed criminal has been but a moment before our friend what a contrast to the laugh of joyous companionship is the quivering tear of an agonised frame how terrible to be prayed to by those whose wishes a moment before we lived only to anticipate  von konigstein said vivian after a long silence i feel for you had i known this i would have spared both you and myself this night of misery i would have prevented you from looking back to this day with remorse you have suffered for that of which you were not guilty you shall not suffer now for what has passed much would i give to see you freed from that wretched knave whose vile career i was very nearly tempted this evening to have terminated for ever i shall make the communication you desire and i will endeavour that it shall be credited as to the transactions of this evening the knowledge of them can never transpire to the world it is the interest of de boeffleurs to be silent if he speak no one will credit the tale of such a creature who if he speak truth must proclaim his own infamy and now for the immediate calls upon your honour in what sum are you indebted to prince salvinski and his friend  thousands two three thousand  i shall then have an opportunity of ridding myself of that the acquisition of which to me has been matter of great sorrow your honour is saved i will discharge the claims of salvinski and his friend  impossible i cannot allow  stop in this business i must command surely there can be no feelings of delicacy between us two now if i gave you the treasures of the indies you would not be under so great an obligation to me as you are already i say this with pain i recommend you to leave ems tomorrow public business will easily account for your sudden departure and now your character is yet safe you are yet in the prime of life you have vindicated yourself from that which has preyed upon your mind for years cease to accuse your fate vivian was about to leave the room when the baron started from his seat and seized his hand he would have spoken but the words died upon his lips and before he could recover himself vivian had retired     chapter xiv   the sudden departure of baron von konigstein from the baths excited great surprise and sorrow all wondered at the cause and all regretted the effect the grand duke missed his good stories the rougeetnoir table his constant presence and monsieur le restaurateur gave up in consequence an embryo idea of a fête and fireworks for his own benefit which agreeable plan he had trusted that with his excellencys generous cooperation as patron he should have had no difficulty in carrying into execution but no one was more surprised and more regretted the absence of his excellency than his friend mr fitzloom what could be the reason public business of course indeed he had learnt as much confidentially from cracowsky he tried mr grey but could elicit nothing satisfactory he pumped mr st george but produced only the waters of oblivion mr st george was gifted when it suited his purpose with a most convenient want of memory there must be something in the wind perhaps a war was the independence of greece about to be acknowledged or the dependence of spain about to be terminated what firstrate power had marched a million of soldiers into the land of a weak neighbour on the mere pretence of exercising the military what patriots had had the proud satisfaction of establishing a constitutional government without bloodshed to be set aside in the course of the next month in the same manner had a conspiracy for establishing a republic in russia been frustrated by the timely information of the intended first consuls were the janissaries learning mathematics or had lord cochrane taken constantinople in the james watt steampacket one of these many events must have happened but which at length fitzloom decided on a general war england must interfere either to defeat the ambition of france or to curb the rapacity of russia or to check the arrogance of austria or to regenerate spain or to redeem greece or to protect portugal or to shield the brazils or to uphold the bible societies or to consolidate the greek church or to monopolise the commerce of mexico or to disseminate the principles of free trade or to keep up her high character or to keep up the price of corn england must interfere in spite of his conviction however fitzloom did not alter the arrangements of his tour he still intended to travel for two years all he did was to send immediate orders to his broker in england to sell two millions of consols the sale was of course effected the example followed stocks fell ten per cent the exchange turned money became scarce the public funds of all europe experienced a great decline smash went the country banks consequent runs on the london a dozen baronets failed in one morning portland place deserted the cause of infant liberty at a terrific discount the greek loan disappeared like a vapour in a storm all the new american states refused to pay their dividends manufactories deserted the revenue in a decline the country in despair orders in council meetings of parliament change of ministry and new loan such were the terrific consequences of a diplomatist turning blackleg the secret history of the late distress is a lesson to all modern statesmen rest assured that in politics however tremendous the effects the causes are often as trifling  vivian found his reception by the trevor party the morning after the memorable night a sufficient reward for all his anxiety and exertion st george a generous openhearted young man full of gratitude to vivian and regretting his previous want of cordiality towards him now delighted in doing full justice to his coolness courage and ability lady madeleine said a great deal in the most graceful and impressive manner but miss fane scarcely spoke vivian however read in her eyes her approbation and her gratitude  and now how came you to discover the whole plot mr grey asked lady madeleine for we have not yet heard was it at the table  they would hardly have had recourse to such clumsy instruments as would have given us the chance of detecting the conspiracy by casual observation no no we owe our preservation and our gratitude to one whom we must hereafter count among our friends i was prepared as i told you for everything and though i had seen similar cards to those with which they played only a few hours before it was with difficulty that i satisfied myself at the table that the cards we lost by were prepared so wonderful is the contrivance  but who is the unknown friend said miss fane with great eagerness  i must have the pleasure of keeping you all in suspense said vivian cannot any of you guess  none none none  what say you then toessper george  is it possible  it is the fact that he and he alone is our preserver soon after my arrival at this place this singular being was seized with the unaccountable fancy of becoming my servant you all remember his unexpected appearance one day in the saloon in the evening of the same day i found him sleeping at the door of my room and thinking it high time that he should be taught more discretion i spoke to him very seriously the next morning respecting his troublesome and eccentric conduct it was then that i learnt his wish i objected of course to engaging a servant of whose previous character i was ignorant and of which i could not be informed and one whose peculiar habits would render both himself and his master notorious while i declined his services i also advised him most warmly to give up all idea of deserting his present mode of life for which i thought him extremely well suited the consequence of my lecture was what you all perceived with surprise a great change in esspers character he became serious reserved and retiring and commenced his career as a respectable character by throwing off his quaint costume in a short time by dint of making a few bad bargains he ingratiated himself with ernstorff von konigsteins pompous chasseur his object in forming this connection was to gain an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the duties of a gentlemans servant and in this he has succeeded about a week since he purchased from ernstorff a large quantity of castoff apparel of the barons and other perquisites of a great mans valet among these were some playing cards which had been borrowed one evening in great haste from the servant of that rascal de boeffleurs and never returned on accidentally examining these cards essper detected they were marked the system on which the marks are formed and understood is so simple and novel that it was long before i could bring myself to believe that his suspicions were founded even on a probability at length however he convinced me it is at vienna he tells me that he has met with these cards before the marks are all on the rim of the cards and an experienced dealer that is to say a blackleg can with these marks produce any results and combinations which may suit his purpose essper tells me that de boeffleurs is even more skilled in sleightofhand than himself from ernstorff essper learnt on the day of the fête that mr st george was to dine with the chevalier at the barons apartments on the morrow and that there was a chance that i should join them he suspected that villany was in the wind and when i retired to my room at a late hour on the night of the fête i there met him and it was then that he revealed to me everything which i have told you am i not right then in calling him our preserver  what can be done for him said lady madeleine  his only wish is already granted he is my servant that he will serve me diligently and faithfully i have no doubt i only wish that he would accept or could appreciate a more worthy reward  can man be more amply rewarded said miss fane than by choosing his own remuneration i think he has shown in his request his accustomed talent i must go and see him this moment  say nothing of what has passed he is prepared for silence from all parties  a week a happy week passed over and few minutes of the day found vivian absent from the side of violet fane and now he thought again of england of his return to that country under very different circumstances to what he had ever contemplated soon very soon he trusted to write to his father to announce to him the revolution in his wishes the consummation of his hopes soon very soon he trusted that he should hail his native cliffs a reclaimed wanderer with a matured mind and a contented spirit his sorrows forgotten his misanthropy laid aside     chapter xv   it was about a week after the departure of the baron that two young englishmen who had been college friends of mr st george arrived at the baths these were mr anthony st leger and mr adolphus st john in the academic shades of christchurch these three gentlemen had been known as all saints among their youthful companions they bore the more martial style of the three champions st george st john and st anthony  st john and st anthony had just completed the grand tour and after passing the easter at rome had returned through the tyrol from italy since then they had travelled over most parts of germany and now in the beginning of july found themselves at the baths of ems two years travel had not produced any very beneficial effect on either of these sainted personages they had gained by visiting the capitals of all europe only a due acquaintance with the follies of each and the only difference that could be observed in their conduct on their return was that their affectation was rather more fantastical and therefore more amusing  corpo di bacco my champion who ever thought of meeting thee thou holy saint by the eyebrow of venus my spirit rejoiceth exclaimed st anthony whose peculiar affectation was an adoption in english of the italian oaths  this is the sweetest spot st anthony that we have found since we left paradiso that is st george in the vulgar since we quitted italia italia o italia i forget the rest probably you remember it certainly a most sweet spot this quite a gaspar  art was the peculiar affectation of st john he was indeed quite a patron of the belle arti had scattered his orders through the studios of most of the celebrated sculptors of italy and spoke on all subjects and all things only with a view to their capability of forming material for the painter according to the school of which mr st john was a disciple the only use of the human passions is that they produce situations for the historical painter and nature according to these votaries of the greek to kalon is only to be valued as affording hints for the more perfect conceptions of a claude or a salvator  by the girdle of venus a devilish fine woman exclaimed st anthony  a splendid bit ejaculated st john touched in with freedom a grand tournure great gout in the swell of the neck what a study for retsch  in the name of the graces who is it mio santo  ay name la bellissima signora  the fine bit st john is my sister  the devil  diavolo  will you introduce us most holy man  this request from both simultaneously arranging their mustachios  the two saints were accordingly in due time introduced but finding the attention of miss fane always engrossed and receiving some not very encouraging responses from lady madeleine they voted her ladyship cursedly satirical and passing a general censure on the annoying coldness of englishwomen they were in fourandtwenty hours attached to the suite of the miss fitzlooms to whom they were introduced by st george as his particular friends and were received with the most flattering consideration  by the aspect of diana fine girls swore st anthony  truly most gorgeous colouring quite venetian aurelia is a perfect giorgione said st john  madeleine said st george one morning to his sister have you any objection to make up a party with the fitzlooms to pass a day at nassau you know we have often talked of it and as violet is so well now and the weather so delightful there surely can be no objection the fitzlooms are very agreeable people and though you do not admire the santi still upon my word when you know them a little more you will find them very pleasant fellows and they are extremely goodnatured and just the fellows for such a party do not refuse me i have set my mind upon your joining the party pray nod assent thank you now i must go and arrange everything let us see there are seven fitzlooms for we cannot count on less than two boys yourself grey violet and myself four the santi quite enough a most delightful party half a dozen servants and as many donkeys will manage the provisions then three light carriages will take us all by the wand of mercury as st anthony would vow admirably planned  by the breath of zephyr a most lovely day miss fane said st anthony on the morning of the intended excursion  quite a claude said st john  almost as beautiful as an italian winter day mr st leger asked miss fane  hardly said st anthony with a serious air for he imagined the question to be quite genuine  the carriages are at the door into the first ascended mrs fitzloom two daughters and the travelling saints the second bore lady madeleine mr fitzloom and his two sons the third division was formed of mr st george and aurelia fitzloom miss fane and vivian  away away rolled the carriages the day was beautiful the sky was without a cloud and a mild breeze prevented the heat of the sun from being overpowering all were in high spirits for st george had made a capital master of the ceremonies and had arranged the company in the carriages to their mutual satisfaction st anthony swore by the soul of psyche that augusta fitzloom was an angel and st john was in equal raptures with araminta who had an expression about the eyes which reminded him of titians flora mrs fitzlooms natural silence did not disturb the uninterrupted jargon of the santi whose foppery elicited loud and continued approbation from the fair sisters the mother sat admiring these sprigs of noble trees the young fitzlooms in crimson cravats conversed with lady madeleine with a delightful military air and their happy parent as he gazed upon them with satisfied affection internally promised them both a commission in a crack regiment  the road from ems to nassau winds along the banks of the lahn through two leagues of delightful scenery at the end of which springing up from the peak of a bold and richlywooded mountain the lofty tower of the ancient castle of nassau meets your view winding walks round the sides of the mountain lead through all the varieties of sylvan scenery and command in all points magnificent views of the surrounding country these finally bring you to the old castle whose spacious chambers though now choked up with masses of grey ruin or covered with underwood still bear witness to the might of their former lord the powerful baron whose sword gained for his posterity a throne  all seemed happy none happier than violet fane never did she look so beautiful as today never was she so animated never had she boasted that her pulse beat more melodious music or her lively blood danced a more healthful measure after examining all the antique chambers of the castle and discovering as they flattered themselves secret passages and dark dungeons and hidden doors they left this interesting relic of the middle ages and soon by a gradual descent through delightful shrubberies they again found themselves at the bottom of the valley here they visited the modern château of baron von stein one of the most enlightened and able politicians that germany has ever produced as minister of prussia he commenced those reforms which the illustrious hardenberg perfected for upwards of five centuries the family of stein have retained their territorial possessions in the valley of the lahn their family castle at present a ruin and formerly a fief of the house of nassau is now only a picturesque object in the pleasuregrounds of the present lord  the noon had passed some hours before the delighted wanderers complained of fatigue and by that time they found themselves in a pleasant green glade on the skirts of the forest of nassau it was nearly environed by mountains covered with hanging woods which shaded the beautiful valley and gave it the appearance of a sylvan amphitheatre from a rocky cleft in these green mountains a torrent dashing down with impetuous force and whose fall was almost concealed by the cloud of spray which it excited gave birth to a small and gentle river whose banks were fringed with beautiful trees which prevented the suns darts from piercing its coldness by bowing their fair heads over its waters from their extending branches natures choristers sent forth many a lovely lay       of gods high praise and of their loves sweet teen  near the banks of this river the servants under the active direction of essper george had prepared a banquet for the party the cloth had been laid on a raised work of wood and turf and rustic seats of the same material surrounded the picturesque table it glowed with materials and with colours to which veronese alone could have done justice pasties and birds and venison and groups of fish gleamy with prismatic hues while amid pyramids of fruit rose goblets of fantastic glass worthy of the famous wines they were to receive  well said miss fane i never will be a member of an adventurous party like the present of which albert is not manager  i must not take the whole credit upon myself violet st john is butler and st leger my vicechamberlain  well i cannot praise mr st john till i have tasted the malvoisie which he has promised but as for the other part of the entertainment mr st leger i am sure this is a temptation which it would be a sin even in st anthony to withstand  by the body of bacchus very good swore mr st leger  these mountains said mr st john remind me of one of gaspars cool valleys the party indeed give it a different character quite a watteau  now mrs fitzloom said st george who was in his element let me recommend a little of this pike lady madeleine i have sent you some lamb miss fitzloom i hope st anthony is taking care of you wrightson plates to mr st leger holy man and much beloved send araminta some chicken grey has helped you violet aurelia this is for you william pitt fitzloom i leave you to yourself george canning fitzloom take care of the ladies near you essper george where is essper st john who is your deputy in the wine department wrightson bring those long green bottles out of the river and put the champagne underneath the willow will your ladyship take some light claret mrs fitzloom you must use your tumbler nothing but tumblers allowed by miss fanes particular request  st george thou holy man said miss fane methinks you are very impertinent you shall not be my patron saint if you say such words  for the next hour there was nothing heard save the calling of servants the rattling of knives and forks the drawing of corks and continued bursts of laughter which were not occasioned by any brilliant observations either of the saints or any other persons but merely the result of an exuberance of spirits on the part of every one present  well aurelia said lady madeleine do you prefer our present mode of life to feasting in an old hall covered with banners and battered shields and surrounded by mysterious corridors and dark dungeons aurelia was so flattered by the notice of lady madeleine that she made her no answer probably because she was intent on a plovers egg  i think we might all retire to this valley said miss fane and revive the feudal times with great success albert might take us to nassau castle and you mr fitzloom might refortify the old tower of stein with two sons however who are about to enter the guards i am afraid we must be your vassals then what should we do we could not have wood parties every day i suppose we should get tired of each other no that does seem impossible do not you all think so  omnes impossible  we must however have some regular pursuit some cause of constant excitement some perpetual source of new emotions new ideas of course we must give up there would be no going to london for the season for new opinions to astound country cousins on our return some pursuit must be invented we all must have something to do i have it albert shall be a tyrant  i am very much obliged to you violet  yes a cruel unprincipled vindictive remorseless tyrant with a long black beard i cannot tell how long about twenty thousand times longer than mr st legers mustachios  by the beard of jove swore st anthony as he almost started from his seat and arranged with his thumb and forefinger the delicate albanian tuft of his upper lip by the beard of jove miss fane i am obliged to you  well then continued violet albert being a tyrant lady madeleine must be an unhappy illused persecuted woman living on black bread and green water in an unknown dungeon my part shall be to discover her imprisonment sounds of strange music attract my attention to a part of the castle which i have not before frequented there i shall distinctly hear a female voice chaunting the bridesmaids chorus with erards double pedal accompaniment by the aid of the confessors of the two families two drinking rattling impertinent most corrupt and most amusing friars to wit our sainted friends  here both mr st leger and mr st john bowed low to miss fane  a most lively personage is miss fane whispered st anthony to his neighbour miss fitzloom great style  most amusing delightful girl great style rather a display today i think  oh decidedly and devilish personal too some people wouldnt like it i have no doubt she will say something about you next  oh i shall be very surprised indeed if she does it may be very well to you but miss fane must be aware  before this pompous sentence could be finished an incident occurred which prevented miss fane from proceeding with her allotment of characters and rendered unnecessary the threatened indignation of miss fitzloom  miss fane as we mentioned suddenly ceased speaking the eyes of all were turned in the direction in which she was gazing as if she had seen a ghost  what are you looking up at violet asked st george  did not you see anything did not any of you see anything  none none  mr grey surely you must have seen it  i saw nothing  it could not be fancy impossible i saw it distinctly i cannot be in a dream see there again on that topmost branch it moves  some odd shrill sounds uttered in the voice of a pulcinello attracted the notice of them all and lo high in the air behind a lofty chestnut tree the figure of a pulcinello did appear hopping and vaulting in the unsubstantial air now it sent forth another shrill piercing sound and now with both its hands it patted and complacently stroked its ample paunch dancing all the time with unremitting activity and wagging its queer head at the astounded guests  who what can it be cried all the misses fitzloom shrieked and the santi seemed quite puzzled  who what can it be  ere time could be given for any one to hazard a conjecture the figure had advanced from behind the trees and had spanned in an instant the festal board with two enormous stilts on which they now perceived it was mounted the misses fitzloom shrieked again the figure imitated their cries in his queer voice and gradually raising one enormous stilt up into the air stood only on one support which was planted behind the lovely araminta  o inimitable essper george exclaimed violet fane  here signor punch commenced a song which he executed in the tone peculiar to his character and in a style which drew applauses from all and then with a hop step and a jump he was again behind the chestnuttree in a moment he advanced without his stilts towards the table here on the turf he again commenced his antics kicking his nose with his right foot and his hump with his left one executing splendid somersets and cutting every species of caper and never ceasing for a moment from performing all his movements to the inspiring music of his own melodious voice at last jumping up very high in the air he fell as if all his joints were loosened and the misses fitzloom imagining that his bones were really broken shrieked again but now essper began the wonderful performance of a dead body possessed by a devil and in a minute his shattered corpse apparently without the assistance of any of its members began to jump and move about the ground with miraculous rapidity at length it disappeared behind the chestnuttree  i really think said mr st george it is the most agreeable day i ever passed in all my life  decidedly said st anthony st john you remember our party to paestum with lady calabria mcrater and the marquis of agrigentum it was nothing to this nothing do you know i thought that rather dull  yes too elaborate too highly finished nothing of the pittore improvisatore a party of this kind should be more sketchy in its style the outline more free and less detail  essper is coming out today said vivian to miss fane after a long and i venture to say painful forbearance however i hope you will excuse him it seems to amuse us  i think it is delightful see here he comes again  he now appeared in his original costume the one in which vivian first met him at the fair bowing he threw his hand carelessly over his mandolin and having tried the melody of its strings sang with great taste and a sweet voice sweeter from its contrast with its previous shrill tones a very pretty romance all applauded him very warmly and no one more so than miss fane  ah inimitable essper george how can we sufficiently thank you how well he plays and his voice is quite beautiful oh could not we dance would not it be delightful and he could play on his guitar think of the delicious turf  omnes delightful delightful they rose from the table  violet my dear asked lady madeleine what are you going to do  by the toe of terpsichore as mr st leger would say i am going to dance  but remember today you have done so much let us be moderate though you feel so much better still think what a change today has been from your usual habits  but dearest lady madeleine think of dancing on the turf and i feel so well  by the graces i am for the waltz said st anthony  it has certainly a very free touch to recommend it said st john  no no said violet let us all join in a country dance but the misses fitzloom preferred a quadrille  the quadrille was soon formed violet made up for not dancing with vivian at the grand dukes she was most animated and kept up a successful rivalry with mr st leger who evidently prided himself as mr fitzloom observed on his light fantastic toe now he pirouetted like paul and now he attitudinised like albert and now miss fane eclipsed all his exertions by her inimitable imitations of ronzi vestris rushing and arrowy manner st anthony in despair but quite delighted revealed a secret which had been taught him by a spanish dancer at milan but then miss fane vanquished him for ever with the pas de zephyr of the exquisite fanny bias  the day was fast declining when the carriages arrived the young people were in no humour to return and as when they had once entered the carriage the day seemed finished for ever they proposed walking part of the way home lady madeleine made little objection to violet joining the party as after the exertion that miss fane had been making a drive in an open carriage might be dangerous and yet the walk was too long but all agreed that it would be impossible to shorten it and as violet declared that she was not in the least fatigued the lesser evil was therefore chosen the carriages rolled off at about halfway from ems the two empty ones were to wait for the walking party lady madeleine smiled with fond affection as she waved her hand to violet the moment before she was out of sight  and now said st george good people all instead of returning by the same road it strikes me that there must be a way through this little wood you see there is an excellent path before the sun is set we shall have got through it and it will bring us out i have no doubt by the old cottage which you observed grey when we came along i saw a gate and path there just where we first got sight of nassau castle there can be no doubt about it you see it is a regular rightangle and besides varying the walk we shall at least gain a quarter of an hour which after all as we have to walk nearly three miles is an object it is quite clear if i have a head for anything it is for finding my way  i think you have a head for everything said aurelia fitzloom in a soft sentimental whisper i am sure we owe all our happiness today to you  if i have a head for everything i have a heart only for one person  as every one wished to be convinced no one offered any argument in opposition to mr st georges view of the case and some were already in the wood  albert said miss fane i do not like walking in the wood so late pray come back  oh nonsense violet come if you do not like to come you can walk by the road you will meet us round by the gate it is only five minutes walk ere he had finished speaking the rest were in the wood and some had advanced vivian strongly recommended violet not to join them he was sure that lady madeleine would not approve of it he was sure that it was very dangerous extremely and bythebye while he was talking which way had they gone he did not see them he halloed all answered and a thousand echoes besides we certainly had better go by the road we shall lose our way if we try to follow them nothing is so puzzling as walking in woods we had much better keep to the road so by the road they went  the sun had already sunk behind the mountains whose undulating forms were thrown into dark shadow against the crimson sky the thin crescent of the new moon floated over the eastern hills whose deep woods glowed with the rosy glories of twilight over the peak of a purple mountain glittered the solitary star of evening as the sun dropped universal silence seemed to pervade the whole face of nature the voice of the birds was still the breeze which had refreshed them during the day died away as if its office were now completed and none of the dark sounds and sights of hideous night yet dared to triumph over the death of day unseen were the circling wings of the fell bat unheard the screech of the waking owl silent the drowsy hum of the shadeborn beetle what heart has not acknowledged the influence of this hour the sweet and soothing hour of twilight the hour of love the hour of adoration the hour of rest when we think of those we love only to regret that we have not loved more dearly when we remember our enemies only to forgive them  and vivian and his beautiful companion owned the magic of this hour as all must do by silence no word was spoken yet is silence sometimes a language they gazed and gazed again and their full spirits held due communion with the starlit sky and the mountains and the woods and the soft shadows of the increasing moon oh who can describe what the oercharged spirit feels at this sacred hour when we almost lose the consciousness of existence and our souls seem to struggle to pierce futurity in the forest of the mysterious odenwald in the solitudes of the bergstrasse had vivian at this hour often found consolation for a bruised spirit often in adoring nature had forgotten man but now when he had never felt natures influence more powerful when he had never forgotten man and mans world more thoroughly when he was experiencing emotions which though undefinable he felt to be new he started when he remembered that all this was in the presence of a human being was it hesperus he gazed upon or something else that glanced brighter than an evening star even as he thought that his gaze was fixed on the countenance of nature he found that his eyes rested on the face of natures loveliest daughter  violet dearest violet  as in some delicious dream the sleeper is awakened from his bliss by the sound of his own rapturous voice so was vivian roused by these words from his reverie and called back to the world which he had forgotten but ere a moment had passed he was pouring forth in a rapid voice and incoherent manner such words as men speak only once he spoke of his early follies his misfortunes his misery of his matured views his settled principles his plans his prospects his hopes his happiness his bliss and when he had ceased he listened in his turn to some small still words which made him the happiest of human beings he bent down he kissed the soft silken cheek which now he could call his own her hand was in his her head sank upon his breast suddenly she clung to him with a strong grasp violet my own my dearest you are overcome i have been rash i have been imprudent speak speak my beloved say you are not ill  she spoke not but clung to him with a fearful strength her head still upon his breast her full eyes closed alarmed he raised her off the ground and bore her to the riverside water might revive her but when he tried to lay her a moment on the bank she clung to him gasping as a sinking person clings to a stout swimmer he leant over her he did not attempt to disengage her arms and by degrees by very slow degrees her grasp loosened at last her arms gave way and fell by his side and her eyes partly opened  thank god violet my own my beloved say you are better  she answered not evidently she did not know him evidently she did not see him a film was on her sight and her eye was glassy he rushed to the waterside and in a moment he had sprinkled her temples now covered with a cold dew her pulse beat not her circulation seemed suspended he rubbed the palms of her hands he covered her delicate feet with his coat and then rushing up the bank into the road he shouted with frantic cries on all sides no one came no one was near again with a cry of fearful anguish he shouted as if an hyaena were feeding on his vitals no sound no answer the nearest cottage was above a mile off he dared not leave her again he rushed down to the waterside her eyes were still open still fixed her mouth also was no longer closed her hand was stiff her heart had ceased to beat he tried with the warmth of his own body to revive her he shouted he wept he prayed all all in vain again he was in the road again shouting like an insane being there was a sound hark it was but the screech of an owl  once more at the riverside once more bending over her with starting eyes once more the attentive ear listening for the soundless breath no sound not even a sigh oh what would he have given for her shriek of anguish no change had occurred in her position but the lower part of her face had fallen and there was a general appearance which struck him with awe her body was quite cold her limbs stiffened he gazed and gazed and gazed he bent over her with stupor rather than grief stamped on his features it was very slowly that the dark thought came over his mind very slowly that the horrible truth seized upon his soul he gave a loud shriek and fell on the lifeless body of violet fane     book vi   chapter i   the green and bowery summer had passed away it was midnight when two horsemen pulled up their steeds beneath a wide oak which with other lofty trees skirted the side of a winding road in an extensive forest in the south of germany  by heavens said one who apparently was the master we must even lay our cloaks i think under this oak for the road winds again and assuredly cannot lead now to our village  a starlit sky in autumn can scarcely be the fittest curtain for one so weak as you sir i should recommend travelling on if we keep on our horses backs till dawn  but if we are travelling in a directly contrary way to our voiturier honest as we may suppose him to be if he find in the morning no paymaster for his job he may with justice make free with our baggage and i shall be unusually mistaken if the road we are now pursuing does not lead back to the city  city town or village you must sleep under no forest tree sir let us ride on it will be hard if we do not find some huntsmans or rangers cottage and for aught we know a neat snug village or some comfortable old manorhouse which has been in the family for two centuries and where with gods blessing they may chance to have wine as old as the bricks i know not how you may feel sir but a ten hours ride when i was only prepared for half the time and that too in an autumn night makes me somewhat desirous of renewing my acquaintance with the kitchenfire  i could join you in a glass of hock and a slice of venison i confess my good fellow but in a nocturnal ride i am no longer your match however if you think it best we will prick on our steeds for another hour if it be only for them i am sure we must soon stop  ay do sir and put your cloak well round you all is for the best you are not i guess a sabbathborn child  that am i not but how would that make our plight worse than it is should we be farther off supper  nearer perhaps than you imagine for we should then have a chance of sharing the spoils of the spirit hunter  ah essper is it so  truly yes sir and were either of us a sabbathborn child by holy cross i would not give much for our chance of a down bed this night  here a great horned owl flew across the road  were i in the north said essper i would sing an ave mary against the stut ozel  what call you that asked vivian  tis the great bird sir the great horned owl that always flies before the wild hunter and truly sir i have passed through many forests in my time but never yet saw i one where i should sooner expect to hear a midnight bugle if you will allow me sir i will ride by your side thank god at least it is not the walpurgis night  i wish to heaven it were said vivian and that we were on the brocken it must be highly amusing  hush hush it is lucky we are not in the hartz but we know not where we are nor who at this moment may be behind us  and here essper began pouring forth a liturgy of his own half catholic and half calvinistic quite in character with the creed of the country through which they were travelling  my horse has stumbled continued essper and yours sir is he not shying there is a confounded cloud over the moon but i have no sight in the dark if that mass before you be not a devilsstone the lord have mercy upon our sinful souls  peace essper said vivian who was surprised to find him really alarmed i see nothing but a block of granite no uncommon sight in a german forest  it is a devilstone i tell you sir there has been some church here which he has knocked down in the night look is it the mosspeople that i see as sure as i am a hungry sinner the wild one is out ahunting tonight  more luck for us if we meet him his dogs as you say may gain us a supper i think our wisest course will be to join the cry  hush hush you would not talk so if you knew what your share of the spoils might be ay if you did sir your cheek would be paler and your very teeth would chatter i knew one man who was travelling in the forest just as we are now it was about this time and he believed in the wild huntsman about as much as you that is he liked to talk of the spirit merely to have the opportunity of denying that he believed in him which showed as i used to say that his mind was often thinking of it he was a merry knave and as firm a hand for a boarspear as ever i met with and i have met many we used to call him before the accident lefthanded hans but they call him now sir the childhunter oh it is a very awful tale and i would sooner tell it in blazing hall than in free forest you did not hear any sound to the left did you  nothing but the wind essper on with your tale my man  it is a very awful tale sir but i will make short work of it you see sir it was a night just like this the moon was generally hid but the stars prevented it from ever being pitch dark and so sir he was travelling alone he had been up to the castle of the baron his master you see sir he was headranger to his lordship and he always returned home through the forest what he was thinking of i cannot say but most likely of no good when all on a sudden he heard the baying of hounds in the distance now directly he heard it i have heard him tell the story a thousand times directly he heard it it struck him that it must be the spirit huntsman and though there were many ways to account for the hounds still he never for a moment doubted that they were the helldogs the sounds came nearer and nearer now i tell you this because if ever which the holy virgin forbid if ever you meet the wild huntsman you will know how to act conduct yourself always with propriety make no noise but behave like a gentleman and dont put the dogs off the scent stand aside and let him pass dont talk he has no time to lose for if he hunt after daybreak a nights sport is forfeited for every star left in the morning sky so sir you see nothing puts him in a greater passion than to lose his time in answering impertinent questions well sir lefthanded hans stood by the roadside the baying of the dogs was so distinct that he felt that in a moment the wild one would be up his horse shivered like a sallow in a storm he heard the tramp of the spiritsteed they came in sight as the tall figure of the huntsman passed i cannot tell you what it was it might have been lord forgive me for thinking what it might have been but a voice from behind hans a voice so like his own that for a moment he fancied that he had himself spoken although he was conscious that his lips had been firmly closed the whole time a voice from the roadside just behind poor hans mind said good sport sir huntsman tis an odd light to track a stag the poor man sir was all of an ague but how much greater was his horror when the tall huntsman stopped he thought that he was going to be eaten up on the spot at least not at all my friend said the wild one in the kindest voice imaginable my friend would you like to give your horse a breathing with us poor hans was so alarmed that it never entered into his head for a single moment to refuse the invitation and instantly he was galloping by the side of the wild huntsman away they flew away away away over bog and over mere over ditch and over hedge away away away and the rangers horse never failed but kept by the side of the wild spirit without the least distress and yet it is very singular that hans was about to sell this very beast only a day before for a matter of five crowns you see he only kept it just to pick his way at night from the castle to his own cottage well it is very odd but hans soon lost all fear for the sport was so fine and he had such a keen relish for the work that far from being alarmed he thought himself one of the luckiest knaves alive but the oddest thing all this time was that hans never caught sight for one moment of either buck or boar although he saw by the dogs noses that there was something keen in the wind and although he felt that if the hunted beast were like any that he had himself ever followed before it must have been run down with such dogs quicker than a priest could say a paternoster at last for he had grown quite bold says hans to the wild huntsman the beasts run quick o nights sir i think it has been a long time i ween ere i scampered so far and saw so little do you know that the old gentleman was not the least affronted but said in the pleasantest voice imaginable a true huntsman should be patient hans you will see the game quick enough look forward man what see you and sure enough your highness he did look forward it was near the skirts of the forest there was a green glade before them and very few trees and therefore he could see far ahead the moon was shining very bright and sure enough what did he see running as fleet over the turf as a rabbit was a child the little figure was quite black in the moonlight and hans could not catch its face in a moment the helldogs were on it hans quivered like a windy reed and the wild one laughed till the very woods echoed how like you hunting mossmen asked the spirit now when hans found it was only a mossman he took heart again and said in a shaking voice that it is rare good sport in good company and then the spirit jumped off his horse and said now hans you must watch me well for i am little used to bag game he said this with a proudish air as much as to hint that had not he expected hans he would not have rode out this evening without his groom so the wild one jumped on his horse again and put the bag before him it was nearly morning when hans found himself at the door of his own cottage and bowing very respectfully to the spirit hunter he thanked him for the sport and begged his share of the nights spoil this was all in joke but hans had heard that talk to the devil and fear the last word and so he was determined now that they were about to part not to appear to tremble but to carry it off with a jest truly hans said the huntsman thou art a bold lad and to encourage thee to speak to wild huntsmen again i have a mind to give thee for thy pains the whole spoil take the bag knave a mossman is good eating had i time i would give thee a receipt for sauce and so saying the spirit rode off laughing very heartily well sir hans was so anxious to examine the contents of the bag and see what kind of thing a mossman really was for he had only caught a glimpse of him in the chase that instead of going to bed immediately and saying his prayers as he should have done he lighted a lamp and undid the string and what think you he took out of the bag as sure as i am a born sinner his own child  tis a wonderful tale said vivian and did the unfortunate man tell you this himself  often and often i knew lefthanded hans well he was ranger as i said to a great lord and was quite a favourite you see for some reason or other he got out of favour some said that the baron had found him out apoaching and that he used to ride his masters horses anight whether this be true or not who can say but howsoever hans went to ruin and instead of being a flourishing active lad he was turned out and went abegging all through saxony and he always told this story as the real history of his misfortunes some say he is not as strong in his head as he used to be however why should we say it is not a true tale what is that almost shrieked essper  vivian listened and heard distinctly the distant baying of hounds  tis he said essper now dont speak sir dont speak and if the devil make me join him as may be the case for i am but a cockbrained thing particularly at midnight dont be running after me from any foolish feeling but take care of yourself and dont be chattering to think you should come to this my precious young master  cease your blubbering do you think that i am to be frightened by the idiot tales of a parcel of old women and the lies of a gang of detected poachers come sir ride on we are most probably near some huntsmans cottage that distant baying is the sweetest music i have heard a long while  dont be rash sir dont be rash if you were to give me fifty crowns now i could not remember a single line of a single prayer ave maria it always is so when i most want it paternoster and whenever i have need to remember a song sure enough i am always thinking of a prayer unser vater der du bist im himmel sanctificado se el tu nombra il tuo regno venga here essper george was proceeding with a scrap of modern greek when the horsemen suddenly came upon one of those broad green vistas which we often see in forests and which are generally cut either for the convenience of hunting or carting wood it opened on the left side of the road and at the bottom of it though apparently at a great distance a light was visible  so much for your wild huntsman friend essper i shall be much disappointed if here are not quarters for the night and see the moon comes out a good omen  after ten minutes canter over the noiseless turf the travellers found themselves before a large and manywindowed mansion the building formed the farthest side of a quadrangle which you entered through an ancient and massy gate on each side of which was a small building of course the lodges essper soon found that the gate was closely fastened and though he knocked often and loudly it was with no effect that the inhabitants of the mansion had not yet retired was certain for lights were moving in the great house and one of the lodges was not only very brilliantly illuminated but full as vivian was soon convinced of clamorous if not jovial guests  now by the soul of my unknown father said the enraged essper i will make these saucy porters learn their dutywhat ho there what ho within within but the only answer he received was the loud reiteration of a rude and roaring chorus which as it was now more distinctly and audibly enunciated evidently for the purpose of enraging the travellers they detected to be something to the following effect       then a prayer to st peter a prayer to st paul      a prayer to st jerome a prayer to them all      a prayer to each one of the saintly stock      but devotion alone devotion to hock  a right good burden said essper the very words had made him recover his temper and ten thousand times more desirous of gaining admittance he was off his horse in a moment and scrambling up the wall with the aid of the iron stanchions he clambered up to the window the sudden appearance of his figure startled the inmates of the lodge and one of them soon staggered to the gate  what want you ye noisy and disturbing varlets what want you ye most unhallowed rogues at such a place and at such an hour if you be thieves look at our bars here a hiccup if you be poachers our master is engaged and ye may slay all the game in the forest another hiccup but if ye be good men and true  we are halloed essper eagerly  you are said the porter in a tone of great surprise then you ought to be ashamed of yourselves for disturbing holy men at their devotions  is this the way said essper to behave ye shameless rascals to a noble and mighty prince who happens to have lost his way in your abominable forest but who though he has parted with his suite has still in his pocket a purse full of ducats would ye have him robbed by any others but yourselves is this the way you behave to a prince of the holy roman empire a knight of the golden fleece and a most particular friend of your own master is this the way to behave to his secretary who is one of the merriest fellows living can sing a jolly song with any of you and so bedevil a bottle of geisenheim with lemons and brandy that for the soul of ye you wouldnt know it from the greenest tokay out out on ye you know not what you have lost  ere essper had finished more than one stout bolt had been drawn and the great key had already entered the stouter lock  most honourable sirs hiccuped the porter in our ladys name enter i had forgot myself for in these autumn nights it is necessary to anticipate the cold with a glass of cheering liquor and god forgive me if i did not mistake your most mighty highnesses for a couple of forest rovers or small poachers at least thin entertainment here kind sir here the last bolt was withdrawn a glass of indifferent liquor and a prayerbook i pass the time chiefly these cold nights with a few holyminded friends at our devotions you heard us at our prayers honourable lords       a prayer to st peter a prayer to st paul      a prayer to st jerome a prayer to them all  here the devout porter most reverently crossed himself       a prayer to each one of the saintly stock      but devotion alone devotion to hock  added essper george you forget the best part of the burden my honest friend  oh said the porter with an arch smile as he opened the lodge door i am glad to find that your honourable excellencies have a taste for hymns  the porter led them into a room at a round table in which about halfadozen individuals were busily engaged in discussing the merits of various agreeable liquors there was an attempt to get up a show of polite hospitality to vivian as he entered but the man who offered him his chair fell to the ground in an unsuccessful struggle to be courteous and another one who had filled a large glass for the guest on his entrance offered him after a preliminary speech of incoherent compliments the empty bottle by mistake the porter and his friends although they were all drunk had sense enough to feel that the presence of a prince of the holy roman empire a chevalier of the golden fleece and the particular friend of their master was not exactly a fit companion for themselves and was rather a check on the gay freedom of equal companionship and so although the exertion was not a little troublesome the guardian of the gate reeled out of the room to inform his honoured lord of the sudden arrival of a stranger of distinction essper george immediately took his place and ere the master of the lodge had returned the noble secretary had not only given a choice toast sung a choice song and been hailed by the grateful plaudits of all present but had proceeded in his attempt to fulfil the pledge which he had given at the gate to the very letter by calling out lustily for a bottle of geisenheim lemons brandy and a bowl  fairly and softly my little son of bacchus said the porter as he reentered fairly and softly and then thou shalt want nothing but remember i have to perform my duties unto the noble lord my master and also to the noble prince your master if thou wilt follow me continued the porter reeling as he bowed with the greatest consideration to vivian if thou wilt follow me most high and mighty sir my master will be right glad to have the honour of drinking your health and as for you my friends fairly and softly say i again we will talk of the geisenheim anon am i to be absent from the first brewing no no fairly and softly you can drink my health when i am absent in cold liquor and say those things which you could not well say before my face but mind my most righteous and wellbeloved i will have no flattery flattery is the destruction of all good fellowship it is like a qualmish liqueur in the midst of a bottle of wine speak your minds say any little thing that comes first as thus well for hunsdrich the porter i must declare that i never heard evil word against him or thus a very good leg has hunsdrich the porter and a tightmade lad altogether no enemy with the girls i warrant me or thus well for a goodhearted goodlooking stoutdrinking virtuous honourable handsome generous sharpwitted knave commend me to hunsdrich the porter but not a word more my friends not a word more no flatterynow sir i beg your pardon  the porter led the way through a cloistered walk until they arrived at the door of the great mansion to which they ascended by a lofty flight of steps it opened into a large octagonal hail the sides of which were covered with fowlingpieces stags heads couteaux de chasse boarspears and huge fishingnets passing through this hall they ascended a noble staircase on the first landingplace of which was a door which vivians conductor opened and ushering him into a large and welllighted chamber withdrew from the centre of this room descended a magnificently cut chandelier which threw a graceful light upon a sumptuous banquet table at which were seated eight very singularlooking personages all of them wore huntingdresses of various shades of strawcoloured cloth with the exception of one who sat on the left hand of the master of the feast and the colour of whose costume was a rich crimson purple from the top to the bottom of the table extended a double file of wineglasses and goblets of all sizes and all colours there you might see brilliant relics of that ancient rubyglass the vivid tints of which seem lost to us for ever next to these were marshalled goblets of venetian manufacture of a cloudy creamy white then came the huge hock glass of some ancient primate of mentz nearly a yard high towering above its companions as the church its former master predominated over the simple laymen of the middle ages why should we forget a set of most curious and antique drinkingcups of painted glass on whose rare surfaces were emblazoned the kaiser and ten electors of the old empire  vivian bowed to the party and stood in silence while they stared a scrutinising examination at length the master of the feast spoke he was a very stout man with a prodigious paunch which his tightened dress set off to great advantage his face and particularly his forehead were of great breadth his eyes were set far apart his long ears hung down almost to his shoulders yet singular as he was not only in these but in many other respects everything was forgotten when your eyes lighted on his nose it was the most prodigious nose that vivian ever remembered not only seeing but hearing or even reading of it fact it was too monstrous for a dream this mighty nose seemed to hang almost to its owners chest  be seated said this personage in no unpleasing voice and he pointed to the chair opposite to him vivian took the vacated seat of the vicepresident who moved himself to the right be seated and whoever you may be welcome if our words be few think not that our welcome is scant we are not much given to speech holding it for a principle that if a mans mouth be open it should be for the purpose of receiving that which cheers a mans spirit not of giving vent to idle words which so far as we have observed produce no other effect save filling the world with crude and unprofitable fantasies and distracting our attention when we are on the point of catching those flavours which alone make the world endurable therefore briefly but heartily welcome welcome sir stranger from us and from all and first from us the grand duke of johannisberger here his highness rose and pulled out a large ruby tumbler from the file each of those present did the same without however rising and the late vicepresident who sat next to vivian invited him to follow their example  the grand duke of johannisberger brought forward from beneath the table an ancient and exquisite bottle of that choice liquor from which he took his exhilarating title the cork was drawn and the bottle circulated with rapidity and in three minutes the ruby glasses were filled and emptied and the grand dukes health quaffed by all present  again sir stranger continued the grand duke briefly but heartily welcome welcome from us and welcome from all and first from us and now from the archduke of hockheimer  the archduke of hockheimer was a thin sinewy man with long carroty hair eyelashes of the same colour but of a remarkable length and mustachios which though very thin were so long that they met under his chin vivian could not refrain from noticing the extreme length whiteness and apparent sharpness of his teeth the archduke did not speak but leaning under the table soon produced a bottle of hockheimer he then took from the file one of the venetian glasses of clouded white all followed his example the bottle was sent round his health was pledged and the grand duke of johannisberger again spoke  again sir stranger briefly but heartily welcome welcome from us and welcome from all and first from us and now from the elector of steinberg  the elector of steinberg was a short but very broadbacked strongbuilt man though his head was large his features were small and appeared smaller from the immense quantity of coarse shaggy brown hair which grew over almost every part of his face and fell down upon his shoulders the elector was as silent as his predecessor and quickly produced a bottle of steinberg the curious drinking cups of painted glass were immediately withdrawn from the file the bottle was sent round the electors health was pledged and the grand duke of johannisberger again spoke  again sir stranger briefly but heartily welcome welcome from us and welcome from all and first from us and now from the margrave of rudesheimer  the margrave of rudesheimer was a slender man of elegant appearance as vivian watched the glance of his speaking eye and the halfsatirical and halfjovial smile which played upon his features he hardly expected that he would be as silent as his predecessors but the margrave spoke no word he gave a kind of shout of savage exultation as he smacked his lips after dashing off his glass of rudesheimer and scarcely noticing the salutations of those who drank his health he threw himself back in his chair and listened seemingly with a smile of derision while the grand duke of johannisberger again spoke  again sir stranger briefly but heartily welcome welcome from us and welcome from all and first from us and now from the landgrave of grafenberg  the landgrave of grafenberg was a rude awkwardlooking person who when he rose from his seat stared like an idiot and seemed utterly ignorant of what he ought to do but his quick companion the margrave of rudesheimer soon thrust a bottle of grafenberg into the landgraves hand and with some trouble and bustle the landgrave extracted the cork and then helping himself sat down forgetting either to salute or to return the salutations of those present  again sir stranger briefly but heartily welcome welcome from us and welcome from all and first from us and now from the palsgrave of geisenheim  the palsgrave of geisenheim was a dwarf in spectacles he drew the cork from his bottle like lightning and mouthed at his companions even while he bowed to them  again sir stranger briefly but heartily welcome welcome from us and welcome from all and first from us and now from the count of markbrunnen  the count of markbrunnen was a sullenlooking personage with lips protruding nearly three inches beyond his nose from each side of his upper jaw projected a large tooth  thanks to heaven said vivian as the grand duke again spoke thanks to heaven here is our last man  again sir stranger briefly but heartily welcome welcome from us and welcome from all and first from us and now from the baron of asmanshausen  the baron of asmanshausen sat on the left hand of the grand duke of johannisberger and was dressed as we have before said in an unique costume of crimson purple the baron stood without his boots about six feet eight he was a sleek man with a head not bigger than a childs and a pair of small black beady eyes of singular brilliancy the baron introduced a bottle of the only red wine that the rhine boasts but which for its fragrant and fruity flavour and its brilliant tint is perhaps not inferior to the sunset glow of burgundy  and now continued the grand duke having introduced you to all present sir we will begin drinking  vivian had submitted to the introductory ceremonies with the good grace which becomes a man of the world but the coolness of this last observation recalled our heros wandering senses and at the same time alarmed at discovering that eight bottles of wine had been discussed by the party merely as preliminary and emboldened by the contents of one bottle which had fallen to his own share he had the courage to confront the grand duke of johannisberger in his own castle  your wine most noble lord stands in no need of my commendation but as i must mention it let it not be said that i ever mentioned it without praise after a ten hours ride its flavour is as grateful to the palate as its strength is refreshing to the heart but though old hock in homely phrase is styled meat and drink i confess to you that at this moment i stand in need of even more solid sustenance than the juice of the sunny hill  a traitor shrieked all present each with his right arm stretched out glass in hand a traitor  no traitor answered vivian noble and right thirsty lords but one of the most hungry mortals that ever yet famished  the only answer that he received for some time was a loud and illboding murmur the long whisker of the archduke of hockheimer curled with renewed rage audible though suppressed was the growl of the hairy elector of steinberg fearful the corporeal involutions of the tall baron of asmanshausen and savagely sounded the wild laugh of the brighteyed margrave of rudesheimer  silence my lords said the grand duke forget we that ignorance is the strangers portion and that no treason can exist among those who are not our sworn subjects pity we rather the degeneracy of this boldspoken youth and in the plenitude of our mercy let us pardon his demand know ye unknown knight that you are in the presence of an august society who are here met at one of their accustomed convocations whereof the purport is the frequent quaffing of those most glorious liquors of which the sacred rhine is the great father we profess to find a perfect commentary on the pindaric laud of the strongest element in the circumstance of the banks of a river being the locality where the juice of the grape is most delicious and holding therefore that water is strongest because in a manner it giveth birth to wine we also hold it as a sacred element and consequently most religiously refrain from refreshing our bodies with that sanctified and most undrinkable fluid know ye that we are the children of the rhine the conservators of his flavours profound in the learning of his exquisite aroma and deep students in the mysteries of his inexplicable näre professing not to be immortal we find in the exercise of the chase a noble means to preserve that health which is necessary for the performance of the ceremonies to which we are pledged at tomorrows dawn our bugle sounds and thou stranger may engage the wild boar at our side at tomorrows noon the castle bell will toll and thou stranger may eat of the beast which thou hast conquered but to feed after midnight to destroy the power of catching the delicate flavour to annihilate the faculty of detecting the undefinable näre is heresy most rank and damnable heresy therefore at this hour soundeth no plate or platter jingleth no knife or culinary instrument in the palace or the wines yet in consideration of thy youth and that on the whole thou hast tasted thy liquor like a proper man from which we augur the best expectations of the manner in which thou wilt drink it we feel confident that our brothers of the goblet will permit us to grant thee the substantial solace of a single shoeing horn  let it be a dutch herring then said vivian and as you have souls to be saved grant me one slice of bread  it cannot be said the grand duke but as we are willing to be indulgent to bold hearts verily we will wink at the profanation of a single toast but you must order an anchovy one and give secret instructions to the waitingman to forget the fish it must be counted as a second shoeing horn and you will forfeit for the last a bottle of markbrunnen  and now illustrious brothers continued the grand duke let us drink 1726  all present gave a single cheer in which vivian was obliged to join and they honoured with a glass of the very year the memory of a celebrated vintage  1748 said the grand duke  two cheers and the same ceremony  1766 and 1779 were honoured in the same manner but when the next toast was drank vivian almost observed in the countenances of the grand duke and his friends the signs of incipient insanity  1783 hallooed the grand duke in a tone of the most triumphant exultation and his mighty proboscis as it snuffed the air almost caused a whirlwind round the room hockheimer gave a roar steinberg a growl rudesheimer a wild laugh markbrunnen a loud grunt grafenberg a bray asmanshausens long body moved to and fro with wonderful agitation and little geisenheims bright eyes glistened through their glasses as if they were on fire how ludicrous is the incipient inebriety of a man who wears spectacles  thanks to an excellent constitution which recent misery however had somewhat shattered vivian bore up against all these attacks and when they had got down to 1802 from the excellency of his digestion and the inimitable skill with which he emptied many of the latter glasses under the table he was perhaps in better condition than any one in the room  and now rose the idiot grafenberg rudesheimer all the time with a malicious smile faintly pulling him down by the skirt of his coat as if he were desirous of preventing an exposure which his own advice had brought about he had been persuading grafenberg the whole evening to make a speech  my lord duke brayed the jackass and then he stopped dead and looked round the room with an unmeaning stare  hear hear hear was the general cry but grafenberg seemed astounded at any one being desirous of hearing his voice or for a moment seriously entertaining the idea that he could have anything to say and so he stared again and again and again till at last rudesheimer by dint of kicking his shins under the table the margrave the whole time seeming perfectly motionless at length extracted a sentence from the asinine landgrave  my lord duke again commenced grafenberg and again he stopped  go on shouted all  my lord duke rudesheimer is treading on my toes  here little geisenheim gave a loud laugh of derision in which all joined except surly markbrunnen whose lips protruded an extra inch beyond their usual length when he found that all were laughing at his friend the grand duke at last procured silence  shame shame mighty princes shame shame noble lords is it with this irreverent glee these scurvy flouts and indecorous mockery that you would have this stranger believe that we celebrate the ceremonies of our father rhine shame i say and silence it is time that we should prove to him that we are not merely a boisterous and unruly party of swilling varlets who leave their brains in their cups it is time that we should do something to prove that we are capable of better and worthier things what ho my lord of geisenheim shall i speak twice to the guardian of the horn of the fairy king  the little dwarf instantly jumped from his seat and proceeded to the end of the room where after having bowed three times with great reverence before a small black cabinet made of vine wood he opened it with a golden key and then with great pomp and ceremony bore its contents to the grand duke that chieftain took from the little dwarf the horn of a gigantic and antediluvian elk the cunning hand of an ancient german artificer had formed this curious relic into a drinkingcup it was exquisitely polished and cased in the interior with silver on the outside the only ornaments were three richlychased silver rings which were placed nearly at equal distances when the grand duke had carefully examined this most precious horn he held it up with great reverence to all present and a party of devout catholics could not have paid greater homage to the elevated host than did the various guests to the horn of the fairy king even the satanic smile on rudesheimers countenance was for a moment subdued and all bowed the grand duke then delivered the mighty cup to his neighbour the archduke of hockheimer who held it with both hands until his royal highness had emptied into it with great care three bottles of johannisberger all rose the grand duke took the goblet in one hand and with the other he dexterously put aside his most inconvenient and enormous nose dead silence prevailed save the roar of the liquor as it rushed down the grand dukes throat and resounded through the chamber like the distant dash of a waterfall in three minutes the chairman had completed his task the horn had quitted his mouth his nose had again resumed its usual situation and as he handed the cup to the archduke vivian thought that a material change had taken place in his countenance since he had quaffed his last draught his eyes seemed more apart his ears seemed broader and longer and his nose visibly lengthened the archduke before he commenced his draught ascertained with great scrupulosity that his predecessor had taken his fair share by draining the horn as far as the first ring and then he poured off with great rapidity his own portion but though in performing the same task he was quicker than the master of the party the draught not only apparently but audibly produced upon him a much more decided effect than it had on the grand duke for when the second ring was drained the archduke gave a loud roar of exultation and stood up for some time from his seat with his hands resting on the table over which he leant as if he were about to spring upon his opposite neighbour the cup was now handed across the table to the baron of asmanshausen his lordship performed his task with ease but as he withdrew the horn from his mouth all present except vivian gave a loud cry of supernaculum the baron smiled with great contempt as he tossed with a careless hand the great horn upside downwards and was unable to shed upon his nail even the one excusable pearl he handed the refilled horn to the elector of steinberg who drank his portion with a growl but afterwards seemed so pleased with the facility of his execution that instead of delivering it to the next bibber the palsgrave of markbrunnen he commenced some clumsy attempts at a dance of triumph in which he certainly would have proceeded had not the loud grunts of the surly and thicklipped markbrunnen occasioned the interference of the president supernaculum now fell to the margrave of rudesheimer who gave a loud and longcontinued laugh as the dwarf of geisenheim filled the horn for the third time  while this ceremony was going on a thousand plans had occurred to vivian for his escape but all on second thoughts proved impracticable with agony he had observed that supernaculum was his miserable lot could he but have foisted it on the idiot grafenberg he might by his own impudence and the others stupidity have escaped but he could not flatter himself that he should be successful in bringing about this end for he observed with dismay that the malicious rudesheimer had not for a moment ceased watching him with a keen and exulting glance geisenheim performed his task and ere vivian could ask for the goblet rudesheimer with a fell laugh had handed it to grafenberg the greedy ass drank his portion with ease and indeed drank far beyond his limit the cup was in vivians hand rudesheimer was roaring supernaculum louder than all vivian saw that the covetous grafenberg had providentially rendered his task comparatively light but even as it was he trembled at the idea of drinking at a single draught more than a pint of most vigorous and powerful wine  my lord duke said vivian you and your companions forget that i am little used to these ceremonies that i am yet uninitiated in the mysteries of the näre i have endeavoured to prove myself no chickenhearted waterdrinking craven and i have more wine within me at this moment than any man yet bore without dinner i think therefore that i have some grounds for requesting indulgence and i have no doubt that the good sense of yourself and your friends  ere vivian could finish he almost fancied that a wellstocked menagerie had been suddenly emptied in the room such roaring and such growling and such hissing could only have been exceeded on some grand feast day in the recesses of a brazilian forest asmanshausen looked as fierce as a boa constrictor before dinner the proboscis of the grand duke heaved to and fro like the trunk of an enraged elephant hockheimer glared like a bengal tiger about to spring upon its prey steinberg growled like a baltic bear in markbrunnen vivian recognised the wild boar he had himself often hunted grafenberg brayed like a jackass and geisenheim chattered like an ape but all was forgotten and unnoticed when vivian heard the fell and frantic shouts of the laughing hyaena the margrave of rudesheimer vivian in despair dashed the horn of oberon to his mouth one pull a gasp another desperate draught it was done and followed by a supernaculum almost superior to the exulting asmanshausens  a loud shout hailed the exploit and when the shout had subsided into silence the voice of the grand duke of johannisberger was again heard  noble lords and princes i congratulate you on the acquisition of a congenial comate and the accession to our society of one who i now venture to say will never disgrace the glorious foundation but who on the contrary with heavens blessing and the aid of his own good palate will it is hoped add to our present knowledge of flavours by the detection of new ones and by illustrations drawn from frequent study and constant observation of the mysterious näre in consideration of his long journey and his noble achievement i do propose that we drink but very lightly tonight and meet by two hours after tomorrows dawn under the mossmans oak nevertheless before we part for the refreshment of our own good bodies and by way of reward and act of courtesy unto this noble and accomplished stranger let us pledge him in some foreign grape of fame to which he may perhaps be more accustomed than unto the everpreferable juices of our father rhine here the grand duke nodded to little geisenheim who in a moment was at his elbow  it was in vain that vivian remonstrated excused himself from joining or assured them that their conduct had already been so peculiarly courteous that any further attention was at present unnecessary a curiously cut glass which on a moderate calculation vivian reckoned would hold at least three pints was placed before each guest and a basket containing nine bottles of sparkling champagne première qualité was set before his highness  we are no bigots noble stranger said the grand duke as he took one of the bottles and scrutinised the cork with a very keen eye we are no bigots and there are moments when we drink champagne nor is burgundy forgotten nor the soft bourdeaux nor the glowing grape of the sunny rhone his highness held the bottle at an oblique angle with the chandelier the wire is loosened whirr the exploded cork whizzed through the air extinguished one of the burners of the chandelier and brought the cut drop which was suspended under it rattling down among the glasses on the table the president poured the foaming fluid into his great goblet and bowing to all around fastened on its contents with as much eagerness as arabs hasten to a fountain  the same operation was performed as regularly and as skilfully by all except vivian eight burners were extinguished eight diamond drops had fallen clattering on the table eight human beings had finished a miraculous carouse by each drinking off a bottle of sparkling champagne it was vivians turn all eyes were fixed on him with the most perfect attention he was now indeed quite desperate for had he been able to execute a trick which long practice alone could have enabled any man to perform he felt conscious that it was quite out of his power to taste a single drop of the contents of his bottle however he loosened his wire and held the bottle at an angle with the chandelier but the cork flew quite wild and struck with great force the mighty nose of johannisberger  a forfeit cried all  treason and a forfeit cried the margrave of rudesheimer  a forfeit is sufficient punishment said the president who however still felt the smarting effect of the assault on his proboscis you must drink oberons horn full of champagne he continued  never said vivian enough of this i have already conformed in a degree which may injuriously affect my health with your barbarous humours but there is moderation even in excess and so if you please my lord your servant may show me to my apartment or i shall again mount my horse  you shall not leave this room said the president with great firmness  who shall prevent me asked vivian  i will all will  now by heavens a more insolent and inhospitable old ruffian did i never meet by the wine you worship if one of you dare touch me you shall rue it all your born days and as for you sir if you advance one step towards me i will take that sausage of a nose of yours and hurl you half round your own castle  treason shouted all and looked to the chair  treason said enraged majesty the allusion to the nose had done away with all the constitutional doubts which had been sported so moderately at the commencement of the evening  treason howled the president instant punishment  what punishment asked asmanshausen  drown him in the new butt of moselle recommended rudesheimer the suggestion was immediately adopted every one rose the little geisenheim already had hold of vivians shoulder and grafenberg instigated by the cowardly but malicious rudesheimer was about to seize him by the neck vivian took the dwarf and hurled him at the chandelier in whose brazen chains the little being got entangled and there remained an unexpected crossbuttocker floored the incautious and unscientific grafenberg and following up these advantages vivian laid open the skull of his prime enemy the retreating margrave of rudesheimer with the assistance of the horn of oberon which flew from his hand to the other end of the room from the force with which it rebounded from the cranium of the enemy all the rest were now on the advance but giving a vigorous and unexpected push to the table the johannisberger and asmanshausen were thrown over and the nose of the former got entangled with the awkward windings of the fairy kings horn taking advantage of this move vivian rushed to the door he escaped but had not time to secure the lock against the enemy for the stout elector of steinberg was too quick for him he dashed down the stairs with extraordinary agility but just as he had gained the large octagonal hall the whole of his late boon companions with the exception of the dwarf of geisenheim who was left in the chandelier were visible in full chase escape was impossible and so vivian followed by the seven nobles headed by their president described with all possible rapidity a circle round the hall he gave himself up for lost but luckily for him it never occurred to one of his pursuers to do anything but follow their leader and as therefore they never dodged vivian and as also he was a much fleeter runner than the fat president whose pace of course regulated the progress of his followers the party might have gone on at this rate until all of them had dropped from fatigue had not the occurrence of a ludicrous incident prevented this consummation  the hall door was suddenly dashed open and essper george rushed in followed in full chase by hunsdrich and the guests of the lodge who were the servants of vivians pursuers essper darted in between rudesheimer and markbrunnen and hunsdrich and his friends following the same tactics as their lords and masters without making any attempt to surround and hem in the object of their pursuit merely followed him in order describing but in a contrary direction a lesser circle within the eternal round of the first party it was only proper for the servants to give their masters the wall in spite of their very disagreeable and dangerous situation it was with difficulty that vivian refrained from laughter as he met essper regularly every half minute at the foot of the great staircase suddenly as essper passed he took vivian by the waist and with a single jerk placed him on the stairs and then with a dexterous dodge he brought hunsdrich the porter and the grand duke in full contact  i have got you at last said hunsdrich seizing hold of his grace of johannisberger by the ears and mistaking him for essper  i have got you at last said his master grappling as he supposed with vivian both struggled their followers pushed on with impetuous force the battle was general the overthrow universal in a moment all were on the ground and if any less inebriated or more active individual attempted to rise essper immediately brought him down with a boarspear  give me that large fishingnet said essper to vivian quick quick  vivian pulled down a large coarse net which covered nearly five sides of the room it was immediately unfolded and spread over the fallen crew to fasten it down with half a dozen boarspears which they drove into the floor was the work of a moment essper had one pull at the proboscis of the grand duke of johannisberger before he hurried vivian away and in ten minutes they were again on their horses backs and galloping through the starlit wood     chapter ii   it is the hour before the labouring bee has left his golden hive not yet the blooming day buds in the blushing east not yet has the victorious lucifer chased from the early sky the fainting splendour of the stars of night all is silent save the light breath of morn waking the slumbering leaves even now a golden streak breaks over the grey mountains hark to shrill chanticleer as the cock crows the owl ceases hark to shrill chanticleers feathered rival the mountain lark springs from the sullen earth and welcomes with his hymn the coming day the golden streak has expanded into a crimson crescent and rays of living fire flame over the roseenamelled east man rises sooner than the sun and already sound the whistle of the ploughman the song of the mower and the forge of the smith and hark to the bugle of the hunter and the baying of his deepmouthed hound the sun is up the generating sun and temple and tower and tree the massy wood and the broad field and the distant hill burst into sudden light quickly upcurled is the dusky mist from the shining river quickly is the cold dew drunk from the raised heads of the drooping flowers  a canter by a somewhat clearer light than the one which had so unfortunately guided himself and his companion to the palace of the wines soon carried them again to the skirts of the forest and at this minute they are emerging on the plain from yonder dark wood  by heavens essper i cannot reach the town this morning was ever anything more unfortunate a curse on those drunken fools what with no rest and no solid refreshment and the rivers of hock that are flowing within me and the infernal exertion of running round that vile hall i feel fairly exhausted and could at this moment fall from my saddle see you no habitation my good fellow where there might be a chance of a breakfast and a few hours rest we are now well out of the forest oh surely there is smoke from behind those pines some good wife i trust is by her chimney corner  if my sense be not destroyed by the fumes of that mulled geisenheim which still haunts me i could swear that the smoke is the soul of a burning weed  a truce to your jokes good essper i really am very ill a year ago i could have laughed at our misfortunes but now it is very different and by heavens i must have breakfast so stir exert yourself and although i die for it let us canter up to the smoke  no dear master i will ride on before do you follow gently and if there be a pigeon in the pot in all germany i swear by the patron saint of every village for fifty miles round provided they be not heretics that you shall taste of its breastbone this morning  the smoke did issue from a chimney but the door of the cottage was shut  hilloa within shouted essper who shuts the sun out on a september morning  the door was at length slowly opened and a most illfavoured and inhospitablelooking dame demanded in a sullen voice whats your will  you pretty creature said essper who was still a little tipsy  the door would have been shut in his face had not he darted into the house before the woman was aware  truly a neat and pleasant dwelling and you would have no objection i guess to give a handsome young gentleman some little sop of something just to remind him you know that it isnt dinnertime  we give no sops here what do you take us for and so my handsome young gentleman be off or i shall call the good man  why i am not the handsome young gentleman that is my master who if he were not halfstarved to death would fall in love with you at first sight  your master is he in the carriage  carriage no on horseback  travellers  to be sure dear dame travellers true  travellers true without luggage and at this time of morn methinks by your looks queer fellows that you are travellers whom it may be wise for an honest woman not to meet  what some people have an objection then to a forty kreüzer piece on a sunny morning  so saying essper in a careless manner tossed a broad piece in the air and made it ring on a fellow coin as he caught it in the palm of his hand when it descended  is that your master asked the woman  ay is it and the prettiest piece of flesh i have seen this month except yourself  well if the gentleman likes bread he can sit down here said the woman pointing to a bench and throwing a sour black loaf upon the table  now sir said essper wiping the bench with great care lie you here and rest yourself i have known a marshal sleep upon a harder sofa breakfast will be ready immediately  if you cannot eat what you have you may ride where you can find better cheer  what is bread for a travellers breakfast but i daresay my lord will be contented young men are so easily pleased when there is a pretty girl in the case you know that you wench i you do you little hussy you are taking advantage of it  something like a smile lit up the face of the sullen woman when she said there may be an egg in the house but i dont know  but you will soon you dear creature what a pretty foot bawled essper after her as she left the room now confound this hag if there be not meat about this house may i keep my mouth shut at our next dinner whats that in the corner a boars tusk ay ay a huntsmans cottage and when lived a huntsman on black bread before oh bless your bright eyes for these eggs and this basin of new milk  so saying essper took them out of her hand and placed them before vivian  i was saying to myself my pretty girl when you were out of the room essper george good cheer say thy prayers and never despair come what may you will fall among friends at last and how do you know that your dream maynt come true after all didnt you dream that you breakfasted in the month of september with a genteel young woman with gold earrings and is not she standing before you now and did not she do everything in the world to make you comfortable did not she give you milk and eggs and when you complained that you and meat had been but slack friends of late did not she open her own closet and give you as fine a piece of hunting beef as was ever set before a jagd junker  i think you will turn me into an innkeepers wife at last said the dame her stern features relaxing into a smile and while she spoke she advanced to the great closet essper george following her walking on his toes lolling out his enormous tongue and stroking his mock paunch as she opened it he jumped upon a chair and had examined every shelf in less time than a pistol could flush white bread fit for a countess salt worthy of poland boars head no better at troyes and hunting beef my dream is true and he bore in triumph to vivian who was nearly asleep the ample round of salt and pickled beef well stuffed with all kinds of savoury herbs  it was nearly an hour before noon ere the travellers had remounted their road again entered the forest which they had been skirting for the last two days the huntsmen were abroad and the fine weather his good meal and seasonable rest and the inspiriting sounds of the bugle made vivian feel recovered from his late fatigues  that must be a truehearted huntsman essper by the sound of his bugle i never heard one played with more spirit hark how fine it dies away hi the wood fainter and fainter yet how clear it must be now half a mile distant  i hear nothing so wonderful said essper putting the two middle fingers of his right hand before his mouth and sounding a note so clear and beautiful so exactly imitative of the fall which vivian had noticed and admired that for a moment he imagined that the huntsman was at his elbow  thou art a cunning knave do it again this time essper made the very wood echo in a few minutes a horseman galloped up he was as spruce a cavalier as ever pricked gay steed on the pliant grass he was dressed in a green military uniform and a gilt bugle hung by his side his spear told them that he was hunting the wild boar when he saw vivian and essper he suddenly pulled up his horse and seemed astonished  i thought that his highness had been here said the huntsman  no one has passed us sir said vivian  i could have sworn that his bugle sounded from this very spot said the huntsman my ear seldom deceives me  we heard a bugle to the right sir said essper  thanks my friend and the huntsman was about to gallop off  may i ask the name of his highness said vivian we are strangers in this country  that may certainly account for your ignorance said the huntsman but no one who lives in this land can be unacquainted with his serene highness the prince of little lilliput my illustrious master i have the honour continued the huntsman of being jagd junker or gentilhomme de la chasse to his serene highness  tis an office of great dignity said vivian and one that i have no doubt you admirably perform i will not stop you sir to admire your horse  the huntsman bowed courteously and galloped off  you see sir said essper george that my bugle has deceived even the jagd junker or gentilhomme de la chasse of his serene highness the prince of little lilliput himself so saying essper again sounded his instrument  a joke may be carried too far my good fellow said vivian a true huntsman like myself must not spoil a brothers sport so silence your bugle  now again galloped up the jagd junker or gentilhomme de la chasse of his serene highness the prince of little lilliput he pulled up his horse again apparently as much astounded as ever  i thought that his highness had been here said the huntsman  no one has passed us said vivian  we heard a bugle to the right said essper george  i am afraid his serene highness must be in distress the whole suite are off the scent it must have been his bugle for the regulations of this forest are so strict that no one dare sound a blast but his serene highness away galloped the huntsman  next time i must give you up essper said vivian  one more blast good master begged essper in a supplicating voice this time to the left the confusion will be then complete  i command you not and so they rode on in silence but it was one of those days when essper could neither be silent nor subdued greatly annoyed at not being permitted to play his bugle he amused himself imitating the peculiar sound of every animal that he met a young fawn and various birds already followed him and even a squirrel had perched on his horses neck and now they came to a small farmhouse which was situated in the forest the yard here offered great amusement to essper he neighed and half a dozen horses heads immediately appeared over the hedge another neigh and they were following him in the road a dog rushed out to seize the dangerous stranger and recover his charge but essper gave an amicable bark and in a second the dog was jumping by his side and engaged in earnest and friendly conversation a loud and continued grunt soon brought out the pigs and meeting three or four cows returning home a few lowing sounds soon seduced them from keeping their appointment with the dairymaid a stupid jackass who stared with astonishment at the procession was saluted with a lusty bray which immediately induced him to swell the ranks and as essper passed the poultryyard he so deceitfully informed its inhabitants that they were about to be fed that broods of ducks and chickens were immediately after him the careful hens were terribly alarmed at the danger which their offspring incurred from the heels and hoofs of the quadrupeds but while they were in doubt and despair a whole flock of stately geese issued in solemn pomp from another gate of the farmyard and commenced a cackling conversation with the delighted essper so contagious is the force of example and so great was the confidence which the hens placed in these pompous geese who were not the first fools whose solemn air has deceived a few old females that as soon as they perceived them in the train of the horseman they also trotted up to pay their respects at his levée  but it was not a moment for mirth for rushing down the road with awful strides appeared two sturdy and enraged husbandmen one armed with a pike and the other with a pitchfork and accompanied by a frantic female who never for a moment ceased hallooing murder rape and fire everything but theft  now essper heres a pretty scrape  stop you rascals hallooed adolph the herdsman  stop you gang of thieves hallooed wilhelm the ploughman  stop you bloody murderers shrieked phillippa the indignant mistress of the dairy and the poultryyard  stop you villains hallooed all three the villains certainly made no attempt to escape and in half a second the enraged household of the forest farmer would have seized on essper george but just at this crisis he uttered loud sounds in the respective language of every bird and beast about him and suddenly they all turned round and countermarched away rushed the terrified adolph the herdsman while one of his own cows was on his back still quicker scampered off the scared wilhelm the ploughman while one of his own steeds kicked him in his rear quicker than all these shouting screaming shrieking dashed back the unhappy mistress of the henroost with all her subjects crowding about her some on her elbow some on her head her lace cap destroyed her whole dress disordered the movements of the crowd were so quick that they were soon out of sight  a trophy called out essper as he jumped off his horse and picked up the pike of adolph the herdsman  a boarspear or i am no huntsman said vivian give it me a moment he threw it up into the air caught it with ease poised it with the practiced skill of one well used to handle the weapon and with the same delight imprinted on his countenance as greets the sight of an old friend  this forest essper and this spear make me remember days when i was vain enough to think that i had been sufficiently visited with sorrow ah little did i then know of human misery although i imagined i had suffered so much  as he spoke the sounds of a man in distress were heard from the right side of the road  who calls cried essper a shout was the only answer there was no path but the underwood was low and vivian took his horse an old forester across it with ease esspers jibbed vivian found himself in a small green glade of about thirty feet square it was thickly surrounded with lofty trees save at the point where he had entered and at the farthest corner of it near some grey rocks a huntsman was engaged in a desperate contest with a wild boar  the huntsman was on his right knee and held his spear with both hands at the furious beast it was an animal of extraordinary size and power its eyes glittered like fire on the turf to its right a small grey mastiff of powerful make lay on its back bleeding profusely with its body ripped open another dog a fawncoloured bitch had seized on the left ear of the beast but the under tusk of the boar which was nearly a foot long had penetrated the courageous dog and the poor creature writhed in agony even while it attempted to wreak its revenge upon its enemy the huntsman was nearly exhausted had it not been for the courage of the fawncoloured dog which clinging to the boar prevented it making a full dash at the man he must have been gored vivian was off his horse in a minute which frightened at the sight of the wild boar dashed again over the hedge  keep firm sir said he do not move i will amuse him behind and make him turn  a graze of vivians spear on its back though it did not materially injure the beast for there the boar is nearly in vulnerable annoyed it and dashing off the fawncoloured dog with great force it turned on its new assailant now there are only two places in which the wild boar can be assailed with any effect and these are just between the eyes and between the shoulders great caution however is necessary in aiming these blows for the boar is very adroit in transfixing the weapon on his snout or his tusks and if once you miss particularly if you are not assisted by dogs which vivian was not tis all over with you for the enraged animal rushes in like lightning and gored you must be  but vivian was fresh and cool the animal suddenly stood still and eyed its new enemy vivian was quiet for he had no objection to give the beast an opportunity of retreating to its den but retreat was not its object it suddenly darted at the huntsman who however was not off his guard though unable from a slight wound in his knee to rise vivian again annoyed the boar at the rear and the animal soon returned to him he made a feint as if he were about to strike his pike between its eyes the boar not feeling a wound which had not been inflicted and very irritated rushed at him and he buried his spear a foot deep between its shoulders the beast made one fearful struggle and then fell down quite dead the fawncoloured bitch though terribly wounded gave a loud bark and even the other dog which vivian thought had been long dead testified its triumphant joy by an almost inarticulate groan as soon as he was convinced that the boar was really dead vivian hastened to the huntsman and expressed his hope that he was not seriously hurt  a trifle which our surgeon who is used to these affairs will quickly cure sir we owe you our life said the huntsman with great dignity as vivian assisted him in rising from the ground he was a tall man of distinguished appearance but his dress which was the usual hunting costume of a german nobleman did not indicate his quality  sir we owe you our life repeated the stranger five minutes more and our son must have reigned in little lilliput  i have the honour then of addressing your serene highness far from being indebted to me i feel that i ought to apologise for having so unceremoniously joined your sport  nonsense man we have killed in our time too many of these gentry to be ashamed of owning that had it not been for you one of them would at last have revenged the species but many as are the boars that we have killed or eaten we never saw a more furious or powerful animal than the present why sir you must be one of the best hands at the spear in all christendom  indifferently good your highness your highness forgets that the animal was already exhausted by your assault  why there is something in that but it was neatly done man it was neatly done you are fond of the sport we think  i have had some practice but illness has so weakened me that i have given up the forest  pity and on a second examination we observe that you are no hunter this coat is not for the free forest but how came you by the pike  i am travelling to the next post town to which i have sent on my luggage i am getting fast to the south and as for this pike my servant got it this morning from some peasant in a brawl and was showing it to me when i heard your highness call i really think now that providence must have sent it i certainly could not have done you much service with my riding whip hilloa essper where are you  here noble sir here here why what have you got there the horses have jibbed and will not stir i can stay no longer they may go to the devil so saying vivians valet dashed over the underwood and leaped al the foot of the prince  in gods name is this thy servant asked his highness  in good faith am i said essper his valet his cook and his secretary all in one and also his jagd junker or gentilhomme de la chasse as a puppy with a bugle horn told me this morning  a merry knave said the prince and talking of a puppy with a bugle horn reminds us how unaccountably we have been deserted today by a suite that never yet were wanting we are indeed astonished our bugle we fear has turned traitor so saying the prince executed a blast with great skill which vivian immediately recognised as the one which essper george had imitated  and now my good friend said the prince we cannot hear of your passing through our land without visiting our good castle we would that we could better testify the obligation that we feel under to you in any other way than by the offer of an hospitality which all gentlemen by right can command but your presence would indeed give us sincere pleasure you must not refuse us your looks as well as your prowess prove your blood and we are quite sure no clothmerchants order will suffer by your not hurrying to your proposed point of destination we are not wrong we think though your accent is good in supposing that we are conversing with an english gentleman but here they come  as he spoke three or four horsemen at the head of whom was the young huntsman whom the travellers had met in the morning sprang into the glade  why arnelm said the prince when before was the jagd junkers ear so bad that he could not discover his masters bugle even though the wind were against him  in truth your highness we have heard bugles enough this morning who is violating the forests laws we know not but that another bugle is sounding and played st hubert forgive me for saying so with as great skill as your highness is certain myself von neuwied and lintz have been galloping over the whole forest the rest i doubt not will be up directly the jagd junker blew his own bugle  in the course of five minutes about twenty other horsemen all dressed in the same uniform had arrived all complaining of their wild chases after the prince in every other part of the forest  it must be the wild huntsman himself swore an old hand this solution of the mystery satisfied all  well well said the prince whoever it may be had it not been for the timely presence of this gentleman you must have changed your green jackets for mourning coats and our bugle would have sounded no more in the forest of our fathers here arnelm cut up the beast and remember that the left shoulder is the quarter of honour and belongs to this stranger not less honoured because unknown  all present took off their caps and bowed to vivian who took this opportunity of informing the prince who he was  and now continued his highness mr grey will accompany us to our castle nay sir we can take no refusal we will send on to the town for your luggage arnelm do you look to this and honest friend said the prince turning to essper george we commend you to the special care of our friend von neuwied and so gentlemen with stout hearts and spurs to your steeds to the castle     chapter iii   the cavalcade proceeded for some time at a brisk but irregular pace until they arrived at a less wild and wooded part of the forest the prince of little lilliput reined in his steed as he entered a broad avenue of purple beeches at the end of which though at a considerable distance vivian perceived the towers and turrets of a gothic edifice glittering in the sunshine  welcome to turriparva said his highness  i assure your highness said vivian that i view with no unpleasant feeling the prospect of a reception in any civilised mansion for to say the truth for the last eightandforty hours fortune has not favoured me either in my researches after a bed or that which some think still more important than repose  is it so said the prince why we should have thought by your home thrust this morning that you were as fresh as the early lark in good faith it was a pretty stroke and whence come you then good sir  know you a most insane and drunken idiot who styles himself the grand duke of johannisberger  no no said the prince staring in vivians face earnestly and then laughing and you have actually fallen among that mad crew a most excellent adventure arnelm why man where art thou ride up behold in the person of this gentleman a new victim to the overwhelming hospitality of our uncle of the wines and did they confer a title on you on the spot say art thou elector or palsgrave or baron or failing in thy devoirs as once did our good cousin arnelm confess that thou wert ordained with becoming reverence the archprimate of puddledrink eh arnelm is not that the style thou bearest at the palace of the wines  so it would seem your highness i think the title was conferred on me the same night that your highness mistook the grand dukes proboscis for oberons horn and committed treason not yet pardoned  good good thou hast us there truly a good memory is often as ready a friend as a sharp wit wit is not thy strong point friend arnelm and yet it is strange that in the sharp encounter of ready tongues and idle logomachies thou hast sometimes the advantage but nevertheless rest assured good cousin arnelm that wit is not thy strong point  it is well for me that all are not of the same opinion as your serene highness said the young jagd junker somewhat nettled for he prided himself on his repartees  the prince was much diverted with vivians account of his last nights adventure and our hero learnt from his highness that his late host was no less a personage than the cousin of the prince of little lilliput an old german baron who passed his time with some neighbours of congenial temperament in hunting the wild boar in the morning and speculating on the flavours of the fine rhenish wines during the rest of the day he and his companions continued the prince will enable you to form some idea of the german nobility half a century ago the debauch of last night was the usual carouse which crowned the exploits of each day when we were a boy the revolution has rendered all these customs obsolete would that it had not sent some other things equally out of fashion  at this moment the prince sounded his bugle and the gates of the castle which were not more than twenty yards distant were immediately thrown open the whole cavalcade set spurs to their steeds and dashed at full gallop over the hollowsounding drawbridge into the courtyard of the castle a crowd of servingmen in green liveries instantly appeared and arnelm and von neuwied jumping from their saddles respectively held the stirrup and the bridle of the prince as he dismounted  where is master rodolph asked his highness with a loud voice  so please your serene highness i am here answered a very thin treble and bustling through the surrounding crowd came forward the owner of the voice master rodolph was not much above five feet high but he was nearly as broad as he was long though more than middleaged an almost infantile smile played upon his broad fair face to which his small turnup nose large green goggleeyes and unmeaning mouth gave no expression his long hair hung over his shoulders the flaxen locks in some places maturing into grey in compliance with the taste of his master this most unsportsmanlikelooking steward was clad in a green jerkin on the right arm of which was embroidered a giants head the crest of the little lilliputs  truly rodolph we have received some scratch in the chase today and need your assistance the best of surgeons we assure you mr grey if you require one and look you that the blue chamber be prepared for this gentleman and we shall have need of our cabinet this evening see that all this be done and inform prince maximilian that we would speak with him and look you master rodolph there is one in this company what call you your servants name sir essper george tis well look you rodolph see that our friend essper george be well provided for we know that we can trust him to your good care and now gentlemen at sunset we meet in the giants hall so saying his highness bowed to the party and taking vivian by the arm and followed by arnelm and von neuwied he ascended a stair case which opened into the court and then mounted into a covered gallery which ran round the whole building the interior wall of the gallery was alternately ornamented with stags heads or other trophies of the chase and coats of arms blazoned in stucco the prince did the honours of the castle to vivian with great courtesy the armoury and the hall the knights chamber and even the donjonkeep were all examined and when vivian had sufficiently admired the antiquity of the structure and the beauty of the situation the prince having proceeded down a long corridor opened the door into a small chamber which he introduced to vivian as his cabinet the furniture of this room was rather quaint and not unpleasing the wainscot and ceiling were painted alike of a light green colour and were richly carved and gilt the walls were hung with green velvet of which material were also the chairs and a sofa which was placed under a large and curiouslycut looking glass the lower panes of the windows of this room were of stained glass of vivid tints but the upper panes were untinged in order that the light should not be disturbed which fell through them upon two magnificent pictures one a huntingpiece by schneiders and the other a portrait of an armed chieftain on horseback by lucas cranach  and now the door opened and master rodolph entered carrying in his hand a white wand and bowing very reverently as he ushered in servants bearing a cold collation as he entered it was with difficulty that he could settle his countenance into the due and requisite degree of gravity and so often was the fat steward on the point of bursting into laughter as he arranged the setting out of the refreshments on the table that the prince with whom he was at the same time both u favourite and a butt at last noticed his unusual and unmanageable risibility  why rodolph what ails thee hast thou just discovered the point of some good saying of yesterday  the steward could now contain his laughter no longer and he gave vent to his emotion in a most treble he he he  speak man in the name of st hubert and on the word of as stout a huntsman as ever yet crossed horse speak we say what ails thee  he he he in truth a most comical knave i beg your serene highness ten thousand most humble pardons but in truth a more comical knave did i never see how call you him essper george i think he he he in truth your highness was right when you styled him a merry knave in truth a most comical knave he he a very funny knave he says your highness that i am like a snake in a consumption he he he in truth a most comical knave  well rodolph so long as you do not quarrel with his jokes they shall pass as true wit but why comes not our son have you bidden the prince maximilian to our presence  in truth have i your highness but he was engaged at the moment with mr sievers and therefore he could not immediately attend my bidding nevertheless he bade me deliver to your serene highness his dutiful affection saying that he would soon have the honour of bending his knee unto your serene highness  he never said any such nonsense at least if he did he must be changed since last we hunted  in truth your highness i cannot aver upon my conscience as a faithful steward that such were the precise words and exact phraseology of his highness the prince maximilian but in the time of the good prince your father whose memory be ever blessed such were the words and style of message which i was schooled and instructed by mr von lexicon your serene highness most honoured tutor to bear unto the good prince your father whose memory be ever blessed when i had the great fortune of being your serene highness most particular page and it fell to my lot to have the pleasant duty of informing the good prince your father whose memory be ever blessed  enough but sievers is not von lexicon and maximilian we trust is  papa papa dearest papa shouted a young lad as he dashed open the door and rushing into the room threw his arms round the princes neck  my darling said the father forgetting at this moment of genuine feeling the pompous plural in which he had hitherto spoken of himself the prince fondly kissed his child the boy was about ten years of age exquisitely handsome courage not audacity was imprinted on his noble features  papa may i hunt with you tomorrow  what says mr sievers  oh mr sievers says i am excellent i assure you upon my honour he does i heard you come home but though i was dying to see you i would not run out till i had finished my roman history i say papa what a grand fellow brutus was what a grand thing it is to be a patriot i intend to be a patriot myself and to kill the grand duke of reisenburg who is that  my friend max mr grey speak to him  i am happy to see you at turriparva sir said the boy bowing to vivian with dignity have you been hunting with his highness this morning  i can hardly say i have  max i have received a slight wound today do not look alarmed it is slight i only mention it because had it not been for this gentleman it is very probable you would never have seen your father again he has saved my life  saved your life saved my papas life said the young prince seizing vivians hand oh sir what can i do for you mr sievers said the boy with eagerness to a gentleman who entered the room mr sievers here is a young lord who has saved papas life  mr sievers was a tall thin man about forty with a clear sallow complexion a high forehead on which a few wrinkles were visible bright keen eyes and a quantity of grey curling hair which was combed back off his forehead and fell down over his shoulders he was introduced to vivian as the princes particular friend and then he listened apparently with interest to his highness narrative of the mornings adventure his danger and his rescue young maximilian never took his large darkblue eyes off his father while he was speaking and when he had finished the boy rushed to vivian and threw his arms round his neck vivian was delighted with the affection of the child who whispered to him in a low voice i know what you are  what my young friend  ah i know  but tell me  you thought i should not find out you are a patriot  i hope i am said vivian but travelling in a foreign country is hardly a proof of it perhaps you do not know that i am an englishman  an englishman said the child with an air of great disappointment i thought you were a patriot i am one do you know i will tell you a secret you must promise not to tell though promise upon your word well then said the urchin whispering with great energy in vivians ear through his hollow fist i hate the grand duke of reisenburg and i mean to stab him to the heart so saying the little prince grated his teeth with an expression of bitter detestation  what the deuce is the matter with the child thought vivian but at this moment his conversation with him was interrupted  am i to believe this young gentleman my dear sievers asked the prince when he tells me that his conduct has met your approbation  your son prince answered mr sievers can only speak truth his excellence is proved by my praising him to his face  the young maximilian when mr sievers had ceased speaking stood blushing with his eyes fixed on the ground and the delighted parent catching his child up in his arms embraced him with unaffected fondness  and now all this time master rodolph is waiting for his patient by st hubert you can none of you think me very ill your pardon mr grey for leaving you my friend sievers will i am sure be delighted to make you feel at ease at turriparva max come with me  vivian found in mr sievers an interesting companion nothing of the pedant and much of the philosopher their conversation was of course chiefly on topics of local interest anecdotes of the castle and the country of vivians friends the drunken johannisberger and his crew and such matters but there was a keenness of satire in some of mr sievers observations which was highly amusing and enough passed to make vivian desire opportunities of conversing with him at greater length and on subjects of greater interest they were at present disturbed by essper george entering the room to inform vivian that his luggage had arrived from the village and that the blue chamber was now prepared for his presence  we shall meet i suppose in the hall mr sievers  no i shall not dint there if you remain at turriparva which i trust you will i shall be happy to see you in my room if it have no other inducement to gain it the honour of your visit it has here at least the recommendation of singularity there is at any rate no other chamber like it in this good castle  the business of the toilet is sooner performed for a hunting party in a german forest than for a state dinner at château desir and vivian was ready before he was summoned  his serene highness has commenced his progress towards the hall announced essper george to vivian in a treble voice and bowing with ceremony as he offered to lead the way with a white wand waving in his right hand  i shall attend his highness said his master but before i do if that white wand be not immediately laid aside it will be broken about your back  broken about my back what the wand of office sir of your steward master rodolph says that in truth a steward is but half himself who hath not his wand methinks when his rod of office is wanting his highness of lilliputs steward is but unequally divided in truth he is stout enough to be aarons wand that swallowed up all the rest but has your nobleness any serious objection to my carrying a wand it gives such an air  the giants hall was a gothic chamber of imposing appearance the oaken rafters of the curiouslycarved roof rested on the grim heads of gigantic figures of the same material these statues extended the length of the hall on each side they were elaborately sculptured and highly polished and each one held in its outstretched arm a blazing and aromatic torch above them small windows of painted glass admitted a light which was no longer necessary at the banquet to which we are now about to introduce the reader over the great entrance doors was a gallery from which a band of trumpeters arrayed in ample robes of flowing scarlet sent forth many a festive and martial strain more than fifty individuals all wearing hunting dresses of green cloth on which the giants head was carefully emblazoned were already seated in the hall when vivian entered he was conducted to the upper part of the chamber and a seat was allotted him on the left hand of the prince his highness had not arrived but a chair of state placed under a crimson canopy denoted the style of its absent owner and a stool covered with velvet of the same regal colour and glistening with gold lace announced that the presence of prince maximilian was expected while vivian was musing in astonishment at the evident affectation of royal pomp which pervaded the whole establishment of the prince of little lilliput the trumpeters in the gallery suddenly commenced a triumphant flourish all rose as the princely procession entered the hall first came master rodolph twirling his white wand with the practised pride of a drummajor and looking as pompous as a turkeycock in a storm six footmen in splendid liveries two by two immediately followed him a page heralded the prince maximilian and then came the serene father the jagd junker and four or five other gentlemen of the court formed the suite  his highness ascended the throne prince maximilian was on his right and vivian had the high honour of the left hand the jagd junker seated himself next to our hero the table was profusely covered chiefly with the sports of the forest and the celebrated wild boar was not forgotten few minutes had elapsed ere vivian perceived that his highness was always served on bended knee surprised at this custom which even the mightiest and most despotic monarchs seldom exact and still more surprised at the contrast which all this state afforded to the natural ease and affable amiability of the prince vivian ventured to ask his neighbour arnelm whether the banquet of today was in celebration of any particular event of general or individual interest  by no means said the jagd junker this is the usual style of the princes daily meal except that today there is perhaps rather less state and fewer guests than usual in consequence of many of our fellowsubjects having left us with the purpose of attending a great hunting party which is now holding in the dominions of his highness cousin the duke of micromegas  when the more necessary but as most hold the less delightful part of banqueting was over and the numerous servingmen had removed the more numerous dishes of wild boar red deer roebuck and winged game a stiff calvinisticlooking personage rose and delivered a long and most grateful grace to which the sturdy huntsmen listened with a due mixture of piety and impatience when his starch reverence who in his black coat looked among the huntsmen very like as essper george observed a blackbird among a set of moulting canaries had finished an old man with long snowwhite hahand a beard of the same colour rose from his seat and with a glass in his hand bowing first to his highness with great respect and then to his companions with an air of condescension gave in a stout voice the prince a loud shout was immediately raised and all quaffed with rapture the health of a ruler whom evidently they adored master rodolph now brought forward an immense silver goblet full of some crafty compound from its odour doubtless delicious the prince held the goblet by its two massy handles and then said in a loud voice  my friends the giants head and he who sneers at its frown may he rue its bristles  the toast was welcomed with a cry of triumph when the noise had subsided the jagd junker rose and prefacing the intended pledge by a few observations as remarkable for the delicacy of their sentiments as the elegance of their expression he gave pointing to vivian the guest and may the prince never want a stout arm at a strong push the sentiment was again echoed by the lusty voices of all present and particularly by his highness as vivian shortly returned thanks and modestly apologised for the german of a foreigner he could not refrain from remembering the last time when he was placed in the same situation it was when the treacherous lord courtown had drank success to mr vivian greys maiden speech in a bumper of claret at the political orgies of château desir could he really be the same individual as the daring youth who then organised the crazy councils of those ambitious imbecile greybeards what was he then what had happened since what was he now he turned from the comparison with feelings of sickening disgust and it was with difficulty that his countenance could assume the due degree of hilarity which befitted the present occasion  truly mr grey said the prince your german would pass current at weimar arnelm good cousin arnelm we must trouble thy affectionate duty to marshal and regulate the drinking devoirs of our kind subjects tonight for by the advice of our trusty surgeon master rodolph of much fame we shall refrain this night from our accustomed potations and betake ourselves to the solitude of our cabinet a solitude in good sooth unless we can persuade you to accompany us kind sir said the prince turning to mr grey methinks eightandforty hours without rest and a good part spent in the mad walls of our cousin of johannisberger are hardly the best preparatives for a drinking bout unless after oberons horn ye may fairly be considered to be in practice nevertheless i advise the cabinet and a cup of rodolphs coffee what sayest thou vivian acceded to the princes proposition with eagerness and accompanied by prince maximilian and preceded by the little steward who surrounded by his servingmen very much resembled a planet eclipsed by his satellites they left the hall  tis almost a pity to shut out the moon on such a night said the prince as he drew a large green velvet curtain from the windows of the cabinet  tis a magnificent night said vivian how fine the effect of the light is upon the picture of the warrior the horse seems quite living and its fierce rider actually frowns upon us  he may well frown said the prince of little lilliput in a voice of deep melancholy and he hastily redrew the curtain in a moment he started from the chair on which he had just seated himself and again admitted the moonlight am i really afraid of an old picture no no it has not yet come to that  this was uttered in a distinct voice and of course excited the astonishment of vivian who however had too much discretion to evince his surprise or to take any measure by which his curiosity might be satisfied  his companion seemed instantly conscious of the seeming singularity of his expression  you are surprised at my words good sir said his highness as he paced very rapidly up and down the small chamber you are surprised at my words but sir my ancestors brow was guarded by a diadem  which was then well won prince and is now worthily worn  by whom where how asked the prince in a rapid voice maximilian continued his highness in a more subdued tone maximilian my own love leave us go to mr sievers god bless you my only boy good night  good night dearest papa and down with the grand duke of reisenburg  he echoes the foolish zeal of my fond followers said the prince as his son left the room the idle parade to which their illegal loyalty still clings my own manners the relics of former days habits will not change like stations all these have deceived you sir you have mistaken me for a monarch i should be one a curse light on me the hour i can mention it without a burning blush oh shame shame on the blood of my fathers son can my mouth own that i once was one yes sir you see before you the most injured the least enviable of human beings i am a mediatised prince  vivian had resided too long in germany to be ignorant of the meaning of this title with which perhaps few of our readers may be acquainted a mediatised prince is an unhappy victim of those congresses which among other good and evil purged with great effect the ancient german political system by the regulations then determined on that country was freed at one fell swoop from the vexatious and harassing dominion of the various petty princes who exercised absolute sovereignties over little nations of fifty thousand souls these independent sovereigns became subjects and either swelled by their mediatisation the territories of some already powerful potentate or transmuted into a state of importance some more fortunate petty ruler than themselves whose independence through the exertions of political intrigue or family influence had been preserved inviolate in most instances the concurrence of these little rulers in their worldly degradation was obtained by a lavish grant of official emoluments or increase of territorial possessions and the mediatised prince instead of being an impoverished and uninfluential sovereign became a wealthy and powerful subject but so dominant in the heart of man is the love of independent dominion that even with these temptations few of the petty princes could have been induced to have parted with their cherished sceptres had they not been conscious that in case of contumacy the resolutions of a diet would have been enforced by the armies of an emperor as it is few of them have yet given up the outward and visible signs of regal sway the throne is still preserved and the tiara still revered they seldom frequent the courts of their sovereigns and scarcely condescend to notice the attentions of their fellow nobility most of them expend their increased revenues in maintaining the splendour of their little courts at their ancient capitals or in swelling the ranks of their retainers at their solitary forest castles  the prince of little lilliput was the first mediatised sovereign that vivian had ever met at another time and under other circumstances he might have smiled at the idle parade and useless pomp which he had this day witnessed or moralised on that weakness of human nature which seemed to consider the inconvenient appendages of a throne as the great end for which power was to be coveted but at the present moment he only saw a kind and as he believed estimable individual disquieted and distressed it was painful to witness the agitation of the prince and vivian felt it necessary to make some observations which from his manner expressed more than they meant  sir said his highness your sympathy consoles me do not imagine that i can misunderstand it it does you honour you add by this to the many favours you have already conferred on me by saving my life and accepting my hospitality i sincerely hope that your departure hence will be postponed to the last possible moment your conversation and your company have made me pass a more cheerful day than i am accustomed to all here love me but with the exception of sievers i have no companion and although i esteem his principles and his talents there is no congeniality in our tastes or in our tempers as for the rest a more devoted band cannot be conceived but they think only of one thing the lost dignity of their ruler and although this concentration of their thoughts on one subject may gratify my pride it does not elevate my spirit but this is a subject on which in future we will not converse one of the curses of my unhappy lot is that a thousand circumstances daily occur which prevent me forgetting it  the prince rose from the table and pressing with his right hand on part of the wall the door of a small closet sprung open the interior was lined with crimson velvet he took out of it a cushion of the same regal material on which reposed in solitary magnificence a golden coronet of antique workmanship  the crown of my fathers said his highness as he placed the treasure with great reverence on the table won by fifty battles and lost without a blow yet in my youth i was deemed no dastard and i have shed more blood for my country in one day than he who claims to be my suzerain in the whole of his long career of undeserved prosperity ay this is the curse the ancestor of my present sovereign was that warriors serf the prince pointed to the grim chieftain whose stout helmet vivian now perceived was encircled by a crown similar to the one which was now lying before him had i been the subject had i been obliged to acknowledge the sway of a caesar i might have endured it with resignation had i been forced to yield to the legions of an emperor a noble resistance might have consoled me for the clanking of my chains but to sink without a struggle the victim of political intrigue to become the bondsman of one who was my fathers slave for such was reisenburg even in my own remembrance our unsuccessful rival this was too had it rankles in my heart and unless i ran be revenged i shall sink under it to have lost my dominions would have been nothing but revenge i will have it is yet in my power to gain for an enslaved people the liberty i have myself lost yes the enlightened spirit of the age shall yet shake the quavering councils of the reisenburg cabal i will in truth i have already seconded the just the unanswerable demands of an oppressed and insulted people and ere six months are over i trust to see the convocation of a free and representative council in the capital of the petty monarch to whom i have been betrayed the chief of reisenburg has in his eagerness to gain his grand ducal crown somewhat overstepped the mark  besides myself there are no less than three other powerful princes whose dominions have been devoted to the formation of his servile duchy we are all animated by the same spirit all intent upon the same end we have all used and are using our influence as powerful nobles to gain for our fellowsubjects their withheld rights rights which belong to them as men not merely as germans within this week i have forwarded to the residence a memorial subscribed by myself my relatives the other princes and a powerful body of discontented nobles requesting the immediate grant of a constitution similar to those of wirtemburg and bavaria my companions in misfortune are inspirited by my joining them had i been wise i should have joined them sooner but until this moment i have been the dupe of the artful conduct of an unprincipled minister my eyes however are now open the grand duke and his crafty counsellor whose name shall not profane my lips already tremble part of the people emboldened by our representations have already refused to answer an unconstitutional taxation i have no doubt that he must yield whatever may be the inclination of the courts of vienna or st petersburg rest assured that the liberty of germany will meet with no opponent except political intrigue and that metternich is too well acquainted with the spirit which is now only slumbering in the bosom of the german nation to run the slightest risk of exciting it by the presence of foreign legions no no that mode of treatment may do very well for naples or poland or spain but the moment that a croat or a cossack shall encamp upon the rhine or the elbe for the purpose of supporting the unadulterated tyranny of their newfangled grand dukes that moment germany becomes a great and united nation the greatest enemy of the prosperity of germany is the natural disposition of her sons but that disposition while it does now and may for ever hinder us from being a great people will at the same time infallibly prevent us from ever becoming a degraded one  at this moment this moment of pleasing anticipation of public virtue and private revenge master rodolph entered and prevented vivian from gaining any details of the history of his host the little round steward informed his master that a horseman had just arrived bearing for his highness a despatch of importance which he insisted upon delivering into the princes own hands  whence comes he asked his highness  in truth your serene highness that were hard to say inasmuch as the messenger refuses to inform us  admit him  a man whose jaded looks proved that he had travelled far that day was soon ushered into the room and bowing to the prince delivered to him in silence a letter  from whom comes this asked the prince  it will itself inform your highness was the only answer  my friend you are a trusty messenger and have been well trained rodolph look that this gentleman be well lodged and attended  i thank your highness said the messenger but i do not tarry here i wait no answer and my only purpose in seeing you was to perform my commission to the letter by delivering this paper into your own hands  as you please sir you must be the best judge of your own time but we like not strangers to leave our gates while our drawbridge is yet echoing with their entrance steps  the prince and vivian were again alone astonishment and agitation were visible on his highness countenance as he threw his eye over the letter at length he folded it up put it into his breastpocket and tried to resume conversation but the effort was both evident and unsuccessful in another moment the letter was again taken out and again read with not less emotion than accompanied its first perusal  i fear i have wearied you mr grey said his highness it was inconsiderate in me not to remember that you require repose  vivian was not sorry to have an opportunity of retiring so be quickly took the hint and wished his highness agreeable dreams     chapter iv   no one but an adventurous traveller can know the luxury of sleep there is not a greater fallacy in the world than the common creed that sweet sleep is labours guerdon mere regular corporeal labour may certainly procure us a good sound refreshing slumber disturbed often by the consciousness of the monotonous duties of the morrow but how sleep the other great labourers of this laborious world where is the sweet sleep of the politician after hours of fatigue in his office and hours of exhaustion in the house he gains his pillow and a brief feverish night disturbed by the triumph of a cheer and the horrors of a reply where is the sweet sleep of the poet we all know how harassing are the common dreams which are made up of incoherent images of our daily life in which the actors are individuals that we know and whose conduct generally appears to be regulated by principles which we can comprehend how much more enervating and destroying must be the slumber of that man who dreams of an imaginary world waking with a heated and excited spirit to mourn over some impressive incident of the night which is nevertheless forgotten or to collect some inexplicable plot which has been revealed in sleep and has fled from the memory as the eyelids have opened where is the sweet sleep of the artist of the lawyer where indeed of any human being to whom tomorrow brings its necessary duties sleep is the enemy of care and care is the constant companion of regular labour mental or bodily  but your traveller your adventurous traveller careless of the future reckless of the past with a mind interested by the world from the immense and various character which that world presents to him and not by his own stake in any petty or particular contingency wearied by delightful fatigue daily occasioned by varying means and from varying causes with the consciousness that no prudence can regulate the fortunes of the morrow and with no curiosity to discover what those fortunes may be from a conviction that it is utterly impossible to ascertain them perfectly easy whether he lie in a mountainhut or a royal palace and reckless alike of the terrors and chances of storm and bandits seeing that he has a fair chance of meeting both with security and enjoyment this is the fellow who throwing himself upon a down couch or his mules packsaddle with equal eagerness and equal sangfroid sinks into a repose in which he is never reminded by the remembrance of an appointment or an engagement for the next day a duel a marriage or a dinner the three perils of man that he has the misfortune of being mortal and wakes not to combat care but only to feel that he is fresher and more vigorous than he was the night before and that come what come may he is at any rate sure this day of seeing different faces and of improvising his unpremeditated part upon a different scene  we have now both philosophically accounted and politely apologised for the loud and unfashionable snore which sounded in the blue chamber about five minutes after vivian grey had entered that most comfortable apartment in about twelve hours time he was scolding essper george for having presumed to wake him so early quite unconscious that he had enjoyed anything more than a twenty minutes doze  i should not have come in sir only they are all out they were off by six oclock this morning sir most part at least the prince has gone i do not know whether he went with them but master rodolph has given mei breakfasted with master rodolph holy virgin what quarters we have got into  to the point what of the prince  his highness has left the castle and desired master rodolph if your grace had only seen master rodolph tipsy last night he rolled about like a turbot in a tornado  what of the prince  the prince desired this letter to be given to you sir  vivian read the note which supposed that of course he would not wish to join the chase this morning and regretted that the writer was obliged to ride out for a few hours to visit a neighbouring nobleman but requested the pleasure of his guests company at a private dinner in the cabinet on his return  after breakfast vivian called on mr sievers he found that gentleman busied in his library  you never hunt i suppose mr sievers  never his highness i apprehend is out this morning the beautiful weather continues surely we never had such a season as for myself i almost have given up my indoor pursuits the sun is not the light of study let us take our caps and have a stroll  the gentlemen accordingly left the library and proceeding through a different gate to that by which vivian had entered the castle they came upon a part of the forest in which the timber and brushwood had been in a great measure cleared away large clumps of trees being left standing on an artificial lawn and newlymade roads winding about in pleasing irregularity until they were all finally lost in the encircling woods  i think you told me said mr sievers that you had been long in germany what course do you think of taking from here  straight to vienna  ah a delightful place if as i suppose to be the case you are fond of dissipation and luxury vienna is to be preferred to any city with which i am acquainted and intellectual companions are not wanting there as some have said there are one or two houses in which the literary soirées will yield to few in europe and i prefer them to most because there is less pretension and more ease the archduke john is a man of considerable talents and of more considerable acquirements an excellent geologist are you fond of geology  i am not in the least acquainted with the science  naturally so at your age if in fact we study at all we are fond of fancying ourselves moral philosophers and our study is mankind trust me my dear sir it is a branch of research soon exhausted and in a few years you will be very glad for want of something else to do to meditate upon stones see now said mr sievers picking up a stone to what associations does this little piece of quartz give rise i am already an antediluvian and instead of a stag bounding by that wood i witness the moving mass of a mammoth i live in other worlds which at the same time i have the advantage of comparing with the present geology is indeed a magnificent study what excites more the imagination what exercises more the reason can you conceive anything sublimer than the gigantic shadows and the grim wreck of an antediluvian world can you devise any plan which will more brace our powers and develop our mental energies than the formation of a perfect chain of inductive reasoning to account for these phenomena what is the boasted communion which the vain poet holds with nature compared with conversation which the geologist perpetually carries on with the elemental world gazing on the strata of the earth he reads the fate of his species in the undulations of the mountains is revealed to him the history of the past and in the strength of rivers and the powers of the air he discovers the fortunes of the future to him indeed that future as well as the past and the present are alike matter for meditation for the geologist is the most satisfactory of antiquarians the most interesting of philosophers and the most inspired of prophets demonstrating that which has past by discovery that which is occurring by observation and that which is to come by induction when you go to vienna i will give you a letter to frederic schlegel we were fellowstudents and are friends though for various reasons we do not at present meet nevertheless a letter from me will command respect i will recommend you however before you go on to vienna to visit reisenburg  indeed from the princes account i should have thought that there was little to interest me there  his highness is not an impartial judge you are probably acquainted with the disagreeable manner in which he is connected with that court far from his opinion being correct i should say there are few places in germany more worthy of a visit than the little court near us and above all things my advice is that you should not pass it over  i am inclined to follow it you are right in supposing that i am not ignorant that his highness has the misfortune of being a mediatised prince but what is the exact story about him i have heard some odd rumours some  it is a curious story but i am afraid you will find it rather long nevertheless if you really visit reisenburg it may be of use to you to know something of the singular characters you will meet there in the first place you say you know that little lilliput is a mediatised prince and of course are precisely aware what that title means about fifty years ago the rival of the illustrious family in whose chief castle we are both of us now residing was the margrave of reisenburg another petty prince with territories not so extensive as those of our friend and with a population more limited perhaps fifty thousand souls half of whom were drunken cousins the old margrave of reisenburg who then reigned was a perfect specimen of the oldfashioned german prince he did nothing but hunt and drink and think of the quarterings of his immaculate shield all duly acquired from some vandal ancestor as barbarous as himself his little margraviate was misgoverned enough for a great empire half of his nation who were his real people were always starving and were unable to find crown pieces to maintain the extravagant expenditure of the other moiety the cousins who out of gratitude to their fellowsubjects for their generous support harassed them with every species of excess complaints were of course made to the margrave and loud cries for justice resounded at the palace gates this prince was an impartial chief magistrate he prided himself upon his invariable principles of justice and he allowed nothing to influence his decisions his plan for arranging all differences had the merit of being brief and if brevity be the soul of wit it certainly was most unreasonable in his subjects to consider his judgments no joke he always counted the quarterings in the shields of the respective parties and decided accordingly imagine the speedy redress gained by a muddyveined peasant against one of the cousins who of course had as many quarterings as the margrave himself the defendant was regularly acquitted at length a mans house having been burnt down out of mere joke in the night the owner had the temerity in the morning to accuse one of the privileged and to produce at the same tune a shield with exactly one more quartering than the reigning shield itself contained the margrave was astounded the people in raptures and the cousins in despair the complainants shield was examined and counted and not a flaw discovered what a dilemma the chief magistrate consulted with the numerous branches of his family and the next morning the complainants head was struck off for high treason for daring to have one more quartering than his monarch  in this way they passed their time about fifty years since in reisenburg occasionally for the sake of variety declaring war against the inhabitants of little lilliput who to say the truth in their habits and pursuits did not materially differ from their neighbours the margrave had one son the present grand duke a due reverence of the great family shield and a full acquaintance with the invariable principles of justice were early instilled into him and the royal stripling made such rapid progress under the tuition of his amiable parent that he soon became highly popular with all his relations at length his popularity became troublesome to his father and so the old margrave sent for his son one morning and informed him that he had dreamed the preceding night that the air of reisenburg was peculiarly unwholesome for young persons and therefore he begged him to get out of his dominions as soon as possible the young prince had no objection to see something of the world he flew to a relative whom he had never before visited this nobleman was one of those individuals who anticipate their age which bythebye mr grey none but noblemen should do for he who anticipates his century is generally persecuted when living and is always pilfered when dead howbeit this relation was a philosopher all about him thought him mad he in return thought all about him fools he sent the prince to an university and gave him for a tutor a young man about ten years older than his pupil this persons name was beckendorff you will hear more of him  about three years after the sudden departure of the young prince the old margrave his father and the then reigning prince of little lilliput shot each other through the head in a drunken brawl after a dinner given in honour of a proclamation of peace between the two countries the cousins were not much grieved as they anticipated a fit successor in their former favourite splendid preparations were made for the reception of the inheritor of the family shield and all reisenburg was poured out to witness the triumphant entrance of their future monarch at last two horsemen in plain dresses and on indifferent steeds rode up to the palace gates dismounted and without making any enquiry ordered the attendance of some of the chief nobility in the presence chamber one of them a young man without any preparatory explanation introduced the reisenburg chieftains to his companion as his prime minister and commanded them immediately to deliver up their portefeuilles and golden keys to mr beckendorff the nobles were in dismay and so astounded that they made no resistance though the next morning they started in their beds when they remembered that they had delivered their insignia of office to a man without a von before his name they were soon however roused from their sorrow and their stupor by receiving a peremptory order to quit the palace and as they retired from the walls which they had long considered as their own they had the mortification of meeting crowds of the common people their slaves and their victims hurrying with joyful countenances and triumphant looks to the palace of their prince in consequence of an energetic proclamation for the redress of grievances and an earnest promise to decide cases in future without examining the quarterings of the parties in a weeks time the cousins were all adrift at length they conspired but the conspiracy was tardy they found their former servants armed and they joined in an unequal struggle for their opponents were alike animated with hopes of the future and with revenge for the past the cousins got well beat and this was not the worst for beckendorff took advantage of this unsuccessful treason which he had himself fomented and forfeited all their estates destroying in one hour the system which had palsied for so many years the energies of his masters subjects in time many of the chief nobility were restored to their honours and estates but the power with which they were again invested was greatly modified and the privileges of the commons greatly increased at this moment the french revolution broke out the french crossed the rhine and carried all before them and the prince of little lilliput among other true germans made a bold but fruitless resistance the margrave of reisenburg on the contrary received the enemy with open arms he raised a larger body of troops than his due contingent and exerted himself in every manner to second the views of the great nation in return for his services he was presented with the conquered principality of little lilliput and some other adjoining lands and the margraviate of reisenburg with an increased territory and population and governed with consummate wisdom began to be considered the most flourishing of the petty states in the quarter of the empire to which it belonged on the contrary our princely and patriotic friend mortified by the degenerate condition of his country and the prosperity of his rival house quitted little lilliput and became one of those emigrant princes who abounded during the first years of the revolution in the northern courts of europe napoleon soon appeared upon the stage and vanquished austria with the french dictating at the gates of her capital was no longer in a condition to support the dignity of the empire the policy of the margrave of reisenburg was as little patriotic and quite as consistent as before beckendorff became the constant and favoured counsellor of the french emperor it was chiefly by his exertions that the celebrated confederation of the rhine was carried into effect the institution of this body excited among many germans at the time loud expressions of indignation but i believe few impartial and judicious men now look upon that league as any other than one in the formation of which consummate statesmanship was exhibited in fact it prevented the subjugation of germany to france and by flattering the pride of napoleon saved the decomposition of our empire but how this might be it is not at present necessary for us to enquire certain it was that the pupil of beckendorff was amply repaid for the advice and exertions of his master and his minister and when napoleon fell the brows of the former margrave were encircled with a grand ducal crown and his duchy while it contained upwards of a million and a half of inhabitants numbered in its limits some of the most celebrated cities in germany and many of germanys most flourishing provinces but napoleon fell the prince of little lilliput and his companions in patriotism and misfortune returned from their exile panting with hope and vengeance a congress was held to settle the affairs of agitated germany where was the grand duke of reisenburg his hardearned crown tottered on his head where was his crafty minister the supporter of revolutionary france the friend of its imperial enslaver the constant enemy of the house of austria at the very congress which according to the expectations of the exiled princes was to restore them to their own dominions and to reward their patriotic loyalty with the territories of their revolutionary brethren yes at this very congress was beckendorff not as a suppliant not as a victim but seated at the right hand of metternich and watching with parental affection the first interesting and infantile movements of that most prosperous of political bantlings the holy alliance you may well imagine that the military grand duke had a much better chance in political negotiation than the emigrant prince in addition to this the grand duke of reisenburg had married during the war a princess of a powerful house and the allied sovereigns were eager to gain the future aid and constant cooperation of a mind like beckendorffs the prince of little lilliput the patriot was rewarded for his conduct by being restored to his forfeited possessions and the next day he became the subject of his former enemy the grand duke of reisenburg the traitor what think you of monsieur beckendorff  one of the most interesting characters i have long heard of but his pupil appears to be a man of mind  you shall hear i should however first mention that while beckendorff has not scrupled to resort to any measures or adopt any opinions in order to further the interests of his monarch and his country he has in every manner shown that personal aggrandisement has never been his object he lives in retirement scarcely with an attendant and his moderate official stipend amply supports his more moderate expenditure the subjects of the grand duke may well be grateful that they have a minister without relations and without favourites the grand duke is unquestionably a man of talents but at the same time perhaps one of the most weakminded men that ever breathed he was fortunate in meeting with beckendorff early in life and as the influence of the minister has not for a moment ceased over the mind of the monarch to the world the grand duke of reisenburg has always appeared to be an individual of a strong mind and consistent conduct but when you have lived as much and as intimately in his court as i have done you will find how easily the world may he deceived since the close connection which now exists between reisenburg and austria took place beckendorff has in a great degree revived the ancient privileges of blood and birth a minister who has sprung from the people will always conciliate the aristocracy having no family influence of his own he endeavours to gain the influence of others and it often happens that merit is never less considered than when merit has made the minister a curious instance of this occurs in a neighbouring state there the premier decidedly a man of great talents is of as humble an origin as beckendorff with no family to uphold him he supports himself by a lavish division of all the places and patronage of the state among the nobles if the younger son or brother of h peer dare to sully his oratorical virginity by a chance observation in the lower chamber the minister himself a real orator immediately rises to congratulate in pompous phrase the house and the country on the splendid display which has made this night memorable and on the decided advantages which must accrue both to their own resolutions and the national interests from the future participation of his noble friend in their deliberations all about him are young nobles quite unfit for the discharge of their respective duties his private secretary is unable to coin a sentence almost to direct a letter but he is noble the secondary officials cannot be trusted even in the least critical conjunctures but they are noble and the prime minister of a powerful empire is forced to rise early and be up late not to meditate on the present fortunes or future destinies of his country but by his personal exertions to compensate for the inefficiency and expiate the blunders of his underlings whom his unfortunate want of blood has forced him to overwhelm with praises which they do not deserve and duties which they cannot discharge i do not wish you to infer that the policy of beckendorff has been actuated by the feelings which influence the minister whom i have noticed from whose conduct in this very respect his own materially differs on the contrary his connection with austria is in all probability the primary great cause however this may be certain it is that all offices about the court and connected with the army and i need not remind you that at a small german court these situations are often the most important in the state can only be filled by the nobility nor can any person who has the misfortune of not inheriting the magical monosyllable von before his name the shibboleth of nobility and the symbol of territorial pride violate by their unhallowed presence the sanctity of court dinners or the as sacred ceremonies of a noble fête but while a monopoly of those offices which for their due performance require only a showy exterior or a schooled address is granted to the nobles all those state charges which require the exercise of intellect are now chiefly filled by the bourgeoisie at the same time however that both our secretaries of state many of our privy councillors war councillors forest councillors and finance councillors are to be reckoned among the second class still not one of these exalted individuals who from their situations are necessarily in constant personal communication with the sovereign ever see that sovereign except in his cabinet and his councilchamber beckendorff himself the premier is the son of a peasant and of course not noble nobility which has been proffered him not only by his own monarch but by most of the sovereigns of europe he has invariably refused and consequently never appears at court the truth is that from disposition he is little inclined to mix with men and he has taken advantage of his want of an escutcheon completely to exempt himself from all those duties of etiquette which his exalted situation would otherwise have imposed upon him none can complain of the haughtiness of the nobles when ostensibly the minister himself is not exempted from their exclusive regulations if you go to reisenburg you will not therefore see beckendorff who lives as i have mentioned in solitude about thirty miles from the capital communicating only with his royal master the foreign ministers and one or two official characters of his own country i was myself an inmate of the court for upwards of two years during that time i never saw the minister and with the exception of some members of the royal family and the characters i have mentioned i never knew one person who had even caught a glimpse of the individual who may indeed be said to be regulating their destinies  it is at the court then continued mr sievers when he is no longer under the control of beckendorff and in those minor points which are not subjected to the management or influenced by the mind of the minister that the true character of the grand duke is to be detected indeed it may really be said that the weakness of his mind has been the origin of his fortune in his early youth his pliant temper adapted itself without a struggle to the barbarous customs and the brutal conduct of his fathers court that same pliancy of temper prevented him opposing with bigoted obstinacy the exertions of his relation to educate and civilise him that same pliancy of temper allowed him to become the ready and the enthusiastic disciple of beckendorff had the pupil when he ascended the throne left his master behind him it is very probable that his natural feelings would have led him to oppose the french and at this moment instead of being the first of the second rate powers of germany the grand duke of reisenburg might himself have been an mediatised prince as it was the same pliancy of temper which i have noticed enabled him to receive napoleon when an emperor with outstretched arms and at this moment does not prevent him from receiving with equal rapture the imperial archduchess who will soon be on her road from vienna to espouse his son for to crown his career beckendorff has successfully negotiated a marriage between a daughter of the house of austria and the crown prince of reisenburg it is generally believed that the next step of the diet will be to transmute the fathers grand ducal coronet into a regal crown and perhaps my good sir before you reach vienna you may have the supreme honour of being presented to his majesty the king of reisenburg  but when you talk only of the pupils pliancy of temper am i to suppose that in mentioning his talents you were speaking ironically  by no means the grand duke is a scholar a man of refined taste a patron of the fine arts a lover of literature a promoter of science and what the world would call a philosopher his judgment is sound and generally correct his powers of discrimination acute and his knowledge of mankind greater than that of most sovereigns but with all these advantages he is cursed with such a wavering and indecisive temper that when which is usually the case he has come to a right conclusion he can never prevail upon himself to carry his theory into practice and with all his acuteness his discernment and his knowledge of the world his mind is always ready to receive any impression from the person who last addresses him though he himself be fully aware of the inferiority of his advisers intellect to his own or the imperfection of that advisers knowledge never for a moment out of the sight of beckendorff the royal pupil has made an admirable political puppet since his talents have always enabled him to understand the part which the minister had forced him to perform thus the world has given the grand duke credit not only for the possession of great talents but almost for as much firmness of mind and decision of character as his minister but since his longagitated career has become calm and tranquil and beckendorff like a guardian spirit has ceased to be ever at his elbow the character of the grand duke of reisenburg begins to be understood his court has been and still is frequented by all the men of genius in germany who are admitted without scruple even if they be not noble but the astonishing thing is that the grand duke is always surrounded by every species of political and philosophical quack that you can imagine discussions on a free press on the reformation of the criminal code on the abolition of commercial duties and such like interminable topics are perpetually resounding within the palace of this arbitrary prince and the people fired by the representations of the literary and political journals with which reisenburg abounds and whose bold speculations on all subjects elude the vigilance of the censor by being skilfully amalgamated with a lavish praise of the royal character are perpetually flattered with the speedy hope of becoming freemen suddenly when all are expecting the grant of a charter or the institution of chambers mr beckendorff rides up from his retreat to the residence and the next day the whole crowd of philosophers are swept from the royal presence and the censorship of the press becomes so severe that for a moment you would fancy that reisenburg instead of being as it boasts itself the modern athens had more right to the title of the modern boeotia the people who enjoy an impartial administration of equal laws who have flourished and are flourishing under the wise and moderate rule of their new monarch have in fact no inclination to exert themselves for the attainment of constitutional liberty in any other way than by their voices their barbarous apathy astounds the philosophers who in despair when the people tell them that they are happy and contented artfully remind them that their happiness depends on the will of a single man and that though the present character of the monarch may guarantee present felicity still they should think of their children and not less exert themselves for the insurance of the future these representations as constantly reiterated as the present system will allow have at length produced an effect and political causes of a peculiar nature combining their influence with these philosophical exertions have of late frequently frightened the grand duke who in despair would perhaps grant a constitution if beckendorff would allow him but the minister is conscious that the people would not be happier and do not in fact require one he looks with a jealous and an evil eye on the charlatanism of all kinds which is now so prevalent at court he knows from the characters of many of these philosophers and patriots that their private interest is generally the secret spring of their public virtue that if the grand duke moved by their entreaties or seduced by their flattery were to yield a little he would soon be obliged to grant all to their demands and their threats and finally beckendorff has of late years so completely interwoven the policy of reisenburg with that of austria that he feels that the rock on which he has determined to found the greatness of his country must be quitted for ever if he yield one jot to the caprice or the weakness of his monarch  but beckendorff said vivian why can he not crush in the bud the noxious plant which he so much dreads why does the press speak in the least to the people why is the grand duke surrounded by any others except pompous grand marshals and emptyheaded lord chamberlains i am surprised at this indifference this want of energy  my dear sir there are reasons for all things rest assured that beckendorff is not a man to act incautiously or weakly the grand duchess the mother of the crown prince has been long dead beckendorff who as a man has the greatest contempt for women as a statesman looks to them as the most precious of political instruments it was his wish to have married the grand duke to the young princess who is now destined for his son but for once in his life he failed in influencing his pupil the truth was and it is to this cause that we must trace the present disorganised state of the court and indeed of the duchy that the grand duke had secretly married a lady to whom he had long been attached this lady was a countess and his subject and as it was impossible by the laws of the kingdom that any one but a member of the reigning family could be allowed to share the throne his royal highness had recourse to a plan which is not uncommon in this country and espoused the lady with his left hand the ceremony which we call here a morganatic marriage you have probably heard of before the favoured female is to all intents and purposes the wife of the monarch and shares everything except his throne she presides at court but neither she nor her children assume the style of majesty although in some instances the latter have been created princes and acknowledged as heirs apparent when there has been a default in the lineal royal issue the lady of whom we are speaking according to the usual custom has assumed a name derivative from that of her royal husband and as the grand dukes name is charles she is styled madame carolina  and what kind of lady is madame carolina asked vivian  philosophical piquant parisian a genius according to her friends who as in fact she is a queen are of course the whole world though a german by family she is a frenchwoman by birth educated in the spiritual saloons of the french metropolis she has early imbibed superb ideas of the perfectibility of man and of the science of conversation on both which subjects you will not be long at court ere you hear her descant demonstrating by the brilliancy of her ideas the possibility of the one and by the fluency of her language her acquaintance with the other she is much younger than her husband and though not exactly a model for phidias a fascinating woman variety is the talisman by which she commands all hearts and gained her monarchs she is only consistent in being delightful but though changeable she is not capricious each day displays a new accomplishment as regularly as it does a new costume but as the acquirement seems only valued by its possessor as it may delight others so the dress seems worn not so much to gratify her own vanity as to please her friends tastes genius is her idol and with her genius is found in everything she speaks in equal ruptures of an opera dancer and an epic poet her ambition is to converse on all subjects and by a judicious management of a great mass of miscellaneous reading and by indefatigable exertions to render herself mistress of the prominent points of the topics of the day she appears to converse on all subjects with ability she takes the liveliest interest in the progress of mind in all quarters of the globe and imagines that she should at the same time immortalise herself and benefit her species could she only establish a quarterly review in ashantee and a scientific gazette at timbuctoo notwithstanding her sudden elevation no one has ever accused her of arrogance or pride or ostentation her liberal principles and her enlightened views are acknowledged by all she advocates equality in her circle of privileged nobles and is enthusiastic on the rights of man in a country where justice is a favour her boast is to be surrounded by men of genius and her delight to correspond with the most celebrated persons of all countries she is herself a literary character of no mean celebrity few months have elapsed since enraptured reisenburg hailed from her glowing pen two neat octavos bearing the title of memoirs of the court of charlemagne which give an interesting and accurate picture of the age and delight the modern public with vivid descriptions of the cookery costume and conversation of the eighth century you smile my friend at madame carolinas production do not you agree with me that it requires no mean talent to convey a picture of the bustle of a levée during the middle ages conceive sir oliver looking in at his club and fancy the small talk of roland during a morning visit yet even the fame of this work is to be eclipsed by madames forthcoming quarto of haroun al raschid and his times this it is whispered is to be a chefdoeuvre enriched by a chronological arrangement by a celebrated oriental scholar of all the anecdotes in the arabian nights relating to the caliph it is of course the sun of madames patronage that has hatched into noxious life the swarm of sciolists who now infest the court and who are sapping the husbands political power while they are establishing the wifes literary reputation so much for madame carolina i need hardly add that during your short stay at court you will be delighted with her if ever you know her as well as i do you will find her vain superficial heartless her sentiment a system her enthusiasm exaggeration and her genius merely a clever adoption of the profundity of others  and beckendorff and the lady are not friendly asked vivian who was delighted with his communicative companion  beckendorffs is a mind that such a woman cannot comprehend he treats her with contempt and if possible views her with hatred for he considers that she has degraded the character of his pupil while she on the contrary wonders by what magic spell he exercises such influence over the conduct of her husband at first beckendorff treated her and her circle of illuminati with contemptuous silence but in politics nothing is contemptible the minister knowing that the people were prosperous and happy cared little for projected constitutions and less for metaphysical abstractions but some circumstances have lately occurred which i imagine have convinced him that for once he has miscalculated after the arrangement of the german states when the princes were first mediatised an attempt was made by means of a threatening league to obtain for these political victims a very ample share of the power and patronage of the new state of reisenburg this plan failed from the lukewarmness and indecision of our good friend of little lilliput who between ourselves was prevented from joining the alliance by the intrigues of beckendorff beckendorff secretly took measures that the prince should be promised that in case of his keeping backward he should obtain more than would fall to his lot by leading the van the prince of little lilliput and his peculiar friends accordingly were quiet and the attempt of the other chieftains failed it was then that his highness found that he had been duped beckendorff would not acknowledge the authority and of course did not redeem the pledge of his agent the effect that this affair produced upon the princes mind you can conceive since then he has never frequented reisenburg but constantly resided either at his former capital now a provincial town of the grand duchy or at this castle viewed you may suppose with no very cordial feeling by his companions in misfortune but the thirst of revenge will inscribe the bitterest enemies in the same musterroll and the princes incited by the bold carriage of madame carolinas philosophical protégés and induced to believe that beckendorffs power is on the wane have again made overtures to our friend without whose powerful assistance they feel that they have but little chance of success observe how much more mens conduct is influenced by circumstances than principles when these persons leagued together before it was with the avowed intention of obtaining a share of the power and patronage of the state the great body of the people of course did not sympathise in that which after all to them was a party quarrel and by the joint exertions of open force and secret intrigue the court triumphed but now these same individuals come forward not as indignant princes demanding a share of the envied tyranny but as ardent patriots advocating a peoples rights the public though i believe that in fact they will make no bodily exertion to acquire a constitutional freedom the absence of which they can only abstractedly feel have no objection to attain that which they are assured will not injure their situation provided it be by the risk and exertions of others so far therefore as clamour can support the princes they have the people on their side and as upwards of three hundred thousand of the grand ducal subjects are still living on their estates and still consider themselves as their serfs they trust that some excesses from this great body may incite the rest of the people to similar outrages the natural disposition of mankind to imitation particularly when the act to be imitated is popular deserves attention the court is divided for the exertions of madame and the bewitching influence of fashion have turned the heads even of greybeards and to give you only one instance his excellency the grand marshal protégé of the house of austria and a favourite of metternich the very person to whose interests and as a reward for whose services our princely friend was sacrificed by the minister has now himself become a pupil in the school of modern philosophy and drivels out with equal ignorance and fervour enlightened notions on the most obscure subjects in the midst of all this confusion the grand duke is timorous dubious and uncertain beckendorff has a difficult game to play he may fall at last such my dear sir are the tremendous consequences of a weak prince marrying a bluestocking  and the crown prince mr sievers how does he conduct himself at this interesting moment or is his mind so completely engrossed by the anticipation of his imperial alliance that he has no thought for anything but his approaching bride  the crown prince my dear sir is neither thinking of his bride nor of anything else he is a hunchbacked idiot of his deformity i have myself been a witness and though it is difficult to give an opinion of the intellect of a being with whom you have never interchanged a syllable nevertheless his countenance does not contradict the common creed i say the common creed mr grey for there are moments when the crown prince of reisenburg is spoken of by his future subjects in a very different manner whenever any unpopular act is committed or any unpopular plan suggested by the court or the grand duke then whispers are immediately afloat that a future brutus must be looked for in their prince then it is generally understood that his idiocy is only assumed and what woman does not detect in the glimmerings of his lacklustre eye the vivid sparks of suppressed genius in a short time the cloud blows over the court dissatisfaction disappears and the moment that the monarch is again popular the unfortunate crown prince again becomes the uninfluential object of pity or derision all immediately forget that his idiocy is only assumed and what woman ever ceases from deploring the unhappy lot of the future wife of their impuissant prince such my dear sir is the way of mankind at the first glance it would appear that in this world monarchs on the whole have it pretty well their own way but reflection will soon enable us not to envy their situations and speaking as a father which unfortunately i am not should i not view with disgust that lot in life which necessarily makes my son my enemy the crown prince of all countries is only a puppet in the hands of the people to be played against his own father     chapter v   the prince returned home at a late hour and immediately enquired for vivian during dinner which he hastily despatched it did not escape our heros attention that his highness was unusually silent and indeed agitated  when we have finished our meal my good friend at length said the prince i very much wish to consult with you on a most important business since the explanation of last night the prince in private conversation had dropped his regal plural  i am ready at once said vivian  you will think it strange mr grey when you become acquainted with the nature of my communication you will justly consider it most strange most singular that i should choose for a confidant and a counsellor in an important business a gentleman with whom i have been acquainted so short a time as yourself but sir i have well weighed at least i have endeavoured well to weigh all the circumstances and contingencies which such a confidence would involve and the result of my reflection is that i will look to you as a friend and adviser feeling assured that both from your situation and your disposition no temptation exists which can induce you to betray or to deceive me though the prince said this with an appearance of perfect sincerity he stopped and looked earnest in his guests face as if he would read his secret thoughts or were desirous of now giving him an opportunity of answering  so far as the certainty of your confidence being respected answered vivian i trust your highness may communicate to me with the most assured spirit but while my ignorance of men and affairs in this country will ensure you from any treachery on my part i very much fear that it will also preclude me from affording you any advantageous advice or assistance  on that head replied the prince i am of course the best judge the friend whom i need is a man not ignorant of the world with a cool head and an impartial mind though young you have said and told me enough to prove that you are not unacquainted with mankind of your courage i have already had a convincing proof in the business in which i require your assistance freedom from national prejudices will materially increase the value of your advice and therefore i am far from being unwilling to consult a person ignorant according to your own phrase of men and affairs in this country moreover your education as an englishman has early led you to exercise your mind on political subjects and it is in a political business that i require your aid  am i fated always to be the dry nurse of an embryo faction thought vivian and he watched earnestly the countenance of the prince in a moment he expected to be invited to become a counsellor of the leagued princes either the lamp was burning dim or the blazing wood fire had suddenly died away or a mist was over vivians eyes but for a moment he almost imagined that he was sitting opposite his old friend the marquis of carabas the princes phrase had given rise to a thousand agonising associations in an instant vivian had worked up his mind to a pitch of nervous excitement  political business said vivian in an agitated voice you could not address a more unfortunate person i have seen prince too much of politics ever to wish to meddle with them again  you are too quick my good friend continued his highness i may wish to consult you on political business and yet have no intention of engaging you in politics which indeed is quite a ridiculous idea but i see that i was right in supposing that these subjects have engaged your attention  i have seen in a short time something of the political world answered vivian who was almost ashamed of his previous emotion and i thank heaven daily that i have no chance of again having any connection with it  well well that as it may be nevertheless your experience is only another inducement to me to request your assistance do not fear that i wish to embroil you in politics but i hope you will not refuse although almost a stranger to add to the great obligations which i am already under to you and give me the benefit of your opinion  your highness may speak with perfect unreserve and reckon upon my delivering my genuine sentiments  you have not forgotten i venture to believe said the prince our short conversation of last night  it was of too interesting a nature easily to escape my memory  before i can consult you on the subject which at present interests me it is necessary that i should make you a little acquainted with the present state of public affairs here and the characters of the principal individuals who control them  so far as an account of the present state of political parties the history of the grand dukes career and that of his minister mr beckendorff and their reputed characters will form part of your highnesss narrative by so much may its length be curtailed and your trouble lessened for i have at different times picked up in casual conversation a great deal of information on these topics indeed you may address me in this respect as you would any german gentleman who not being himself personally interested in public life is of course not acquainted with its most secret details  i did not reckon on this said the prince in a cheerful voice this is a great advantage and another reason that i should no longer hesitate to develop to you a certain affair which now occupies my mind to be short continued the prince it is of the letter which i so mysteriously received last night and which as you must have remarked very much agitated me it is on this letter that i wish to consult you bearing in mind the exact position the avowed and public position in which i stand as connected with the court and having a due acquaintance which you state you have with the character of mr beckendorff what think you of this letter  so saying the prince leant over the table and handed to vivian the following epistle  to his highness the prince of little lilliput  i am commanded by his royal highness to inform your highness that his royal highness has considered the request which was signed by your highness and other noblemen and presented by you to his royal highness in a private interview his royal highness commands me to state that that request will receive his most attentive consideration at the same time his royal highness also commands me to observe that in bringing about the completion of a result desired by all parties it is difficult to carry on the necessary communications merely by written documents and his royal highness has therefore commanded me to submit to your highness the advisability of taking some steps in order to further the possibility of the occurrence of an oral interchange of the sentiments of the respective parties being aware from the position which your highness has thought proper at present to maintain and from other causes which are of too delicate a nature to be noticed in any other way except by allusion that your highness may feel difficulty in personally communicating with his royal highness without consulting the wishes and opinions of the other princes a process to which it must be evident to your highness his royal highness feels it impossible to submit and at the same time desirous of forwarding the progress of those views which his royal highness and your highness may conjunctively consider calculated to advance the wellbeing of the state i have to submit to your highness the propriety of considering the propositions contained in the enclosed paper which if your highness keep unconnected with this communication the purport of this letter will be confined to your highness  propositions  1st that an interview shall take place between your highness and myself the object of which shall be the consideration of measures by which when adopted the various interests now in agitation shall respectively be regarded  2nd that this interview shall be secret your highness be incognito  if your highness be disposed to accede to the first proposition i beg to submit to you that from the nature of my residence its situation and other causes there will be no fear that any suspicion of the fact of mr von philipson acceding to the two propositions will gain notoriety this letter will be delivered into your own hands if mr von philipson determine on acceding to these propositions he is most probably aware of the general locality in which my residence is situated and proper measures will be taken that if mr von philipson honour me with a visit he shall not be under the necessity of attracting attention by inquiring the way to my house it is wished that the fact of the second proposition being acceded to should only be known to mr von philipson and myself but if to be perfectly unattended be considered as an insuperable objection i consent to his being accompanied by a single friend i shall be alone  beckendorff  well said the prince as vivian finished the letter  the best person said vivian to decide upon your highness consenting to this interview is yourself  that is not the point on which i wish to have the benefit of your opinion for i have already consented i rode over this morning to my cousin the duke of micromegas and despatched from his residence a trusty messenger to beckendorff i have agreed to meet him and tomorrow but on the express terms that i should not be unattended now then continued the prince with great energy now then will you be my companion  i said vivian  yes you my good friend you i should consider myself as safe if i were sleeping in a burning house as i should be were i with beckendorff alone although this is not the first time that we have communicated i have never yet seen him and i am fully aware that if the approaching interview were known to my friends they would consider it high time that my son reigned in my stead but i am resolved to be firm to be inflexible my course is plain i am not to be again duped by him which continued the prince much confused i will not conceal that i have been once  but i said vivian i what good can i possibly do it appears to me that if beckendorff is to be dreaded as you describe the presence or the attendance of no friend can possibly save you from his crafty plans but surely if any one attend you why not be accompanied by a person whom you have known long and who knows you well on whom you can confidently rely and who may be aware from a thousand signs and circumstances which will never attract my attention at what particular and pressing moments you may require prompt and energetic assistance such is the companion you want and surely such an one you may find in arnelm von neuwied  arnelm von neuwied said the prince the best hands at sounding a bugle or spearing a boar in all reisenburg excellent men forsooth to guard their master from the diplomatic deceits of the wily beckendorff moreover were they to have even the slightest suspicion of my intended movement they would commit rank treason out of pure loyalty and lock me up in my own cabinet no no they will never do i want a companion of experience and knowledge of the world with whom i may converse with some prospect of finding my wavering firmness strengthened or my misled judgment rightly guided or my puzzled brain cleared modes of assistance to which the worthy jagd junker is but little accustomed however quickly he might hasten to my side in a combat or the chase  if these then will not do surely there is one man in this castle who although he may not be a match for beckendorff can be foiled by few others mr sievers said vivian with an inquiring eye  sievers exclaimed the prince with great eagerness the very man firm experienced and sharpwitted well schooled in political learning in case i required his assistance in arranging the terms of the intended charter or the plan of the intended chambers for these of course are the points on which beckendorff wishes to consult but one thing i am determined on i positively pledge myself to nothing while under beckendorffs roof he doubtless anticipates by my visit to grant the liberties of the people on his own terms perhaps mr beckendorff for once in his life may be mistaken i am not to be deceived twice and i am determined not to yield the point of the treasury being under the control of the senate that is the part of the harness which galls and to preserve themselves from this rather inconvenient regulation without question my good friend beckendorff has hit upon this plan  then mr sievers will accompany you asked vivian calling the princes attention to the point of consultation  the very man for it my dear friend but although beckendorff most probably respecting my presence and taking into consideration the circumstances under which we meet would refrain from consigning sievers to a dungeon still although the minister invites this interview and although i have no single inducement to conciliate him yet it would scarcely be correct scarcely dignified on my part to prove by the presence of my companion that i had for a length of time harboured an individual who by beckendorffs own exertions was banished from the grand duchy it would look too much like a bravado  oh said vivian is it so and pray of what was mr sievers guilty  of high treason against one who was not his sovereign  how is that  sievers who is a man of considerable talents was for a long time a professor in one of our great universities the publication of many able works procured him a reputation which induced madame carolina to use every exertion to gain his attendance at court and a courtier in time the professor became at reisenburg mr sievers was the great authority on all subjects philosophical literary and political in fact he was the fashion and at the head of the great literary journal which is there published he terrified admiring germany with his profound and piquant critiques unfortunately like some men as good he was unaware that reisenburg was not an independent state and so on the occasion of austria attacking naples mr sievers took the opportunity of attacking austria his article eloquent luminous profound revealed the dark colours of the austrian policy as an artists lamp brings out the murky tints of a spagnoletto every one admired sievers bitter sarcasms enlightened views and indignant eloquence madame carolina crowned him with laurel in the midst of her coterie and it is said that the grand duke sent him a snuffbox in a short time the article reached vienna and in a still shorter time mr beckendorff reached the residence and insisted on the author being immediately given up to the austrian government madame carolina was in despair the grand duke in doubt and beckendorff threatened to resign if the order were not signed a kind friend perhaps his royal highness himself gave sievers timely notice and by rapid flight he reached my castle and demanded my hospitality he has lived here ever since and has done me a thousand services not the least of which is the education which he has given my son my glorious maximilian  and beckendorff asked vivian has he always been aware that sievers was concealed here  that i cannot answer had he been it is not improbable that he would have winked at it since it never has been his policy unnecessarily to annoy a mediatised prince or without great occasion to let us feel that our independence is gone i will not with such a son as i have say for ever  mr sievers of course then cannot visit beckendorff said vivian  that is clear said the prince and i therefore trust that now you will no longer refuse my first request  it was impossible for vivian to deny the prince any longer and indeed he had no objection as his highness could not be better attended to seize the singular and unexpected opportunity which now offered itself of becoming acquainted with an individual respecting whom his curiosity was much excited it was a late hour ere the prince and his friend retired having arranged everything for the morrows journey and conversed on the probable subjects of the approaching interview at great length     chapter vi   on the following morning before sunrise the princes valet roused vivian from his slumbers according to the appointment of the preceding evening vivian repaired in due time to a certain spot in the park the prince reached it at the same moment a mounted groom leading two english horses of showy appearance and each having a travelling case strapped on the back of its saddle awaited them his highness mounted one of the steeds with skilful celerity although arnelm and von neuwied were not there to do honour to his bridle and his stirrup  you must give me an impartial opinion of your courser my dear friend said the prince to vivian for if you deem it worthy of being bestridden by you my son requests that you will do him the honour of accepting it if so call it max and provided it be as thoroughbred as the donor you need not change it for bucephalus  not unworthy of the son of ammon said vivian as he touched the spirited animal with the spur and proved its fiery action on the springing turf  a man never feels so proud or so sanguine as when he is bounding on the back of a fine horse cares fly with the first curvet and the very sight of a spur is enough to prevent one committing suicide  when vivian and his companion had proceeded about five miles the prince pulled up and giving a sealed letter to the groom he desired him to leave them the prince and vivian amused themselves by endeavouring to form some conception of the person manners and habits of the remarkable man to whom they were on the point of paying so interesting a visit  i expect said vivian to be received with folded arms and a brow lowering with the overwhelming weight of a brain meditating for the control of millions his letter has prepared us for the mysterious but not very amusing style of his conversation he will be perpetually on his guard not to commit himself and although public business and the receipt of papers by calling him away will occasionally give us an opportunity of being alone still i regret that i did not put up in my case some interesting volume which would have allowed me to feel less tedious those hours during which you will necessarily be employed with him in private consultation  after a ride of five hours the horsemen arrived at a small village  thus far i think i have well piloted you said the prince but i confess my knowledge here ceases and though i shall disobey the diplomatic instructions of the great man i must even ask some old woman the way to mr beckendorffs  while they were hesitating as to whom they should address an equestrian who had already passed them on the road though at some distance came up and inquired in a voice which vivian recognised as that of the messenger who had brought beckendorffs letter to turriparva whether he had the honour of addressing mr von philipson neither of the gentlemen answered for vivian of course expected the prince to reply and his highness was as yet so unused to his incognito that he had actually forgotten his own name but it was evident that the demandant had questioned rather from system than by way of security and he waited patiently until the prince had collected his senses and assumed sufficient gravity of countenance to inform the horseman that he was the person in question what sir is your pleasure  i am instructed to ride on before you sir that you may not mistake your way and without waiting for an answer the laconic messenger turned his steeds head and trotted off  the travellers soon left the high road and turned up a wild turf path not only inaccessible to carriages but even requiring great attention from horsemen after much winding and some floundering they arrived at a light gate which apparently opened into a shrubbery  i will take your horses here gentlemen said the guide and getting off his horse he opened the gate follow this path and you can meet with no difficulty the prince and vivian accordingly dismounted and the guide immediately gave a loud shrill whistle  the path ran for a short way through the shrubbery which evidently was a belt encircling the grounds from this the prince and vivian emerged upon a lawn which formed on the farthest side a terrace by gradually sloping down to the margin of the river it was enclosed on the other side and white pheasants were feeding in its centre following the path which skirted the lawn they arrived at a second gate which opened into a garden in which no signs of the taste at present existing in germany for the english system of picturesque pleasuregrounds were at all visible the walk was bounded on both sides by tall borders or rather hedges of box cut into the shape of battlements the sameness of these turrets being occasionally varied by the immovable form of some trusty warder carved out of yew or laurel raised terraces and arched walks aloes and orange trees mounted on sculptured pedestals columns of cypress and pyramids of bay whose dark foliage strikingly contrasted with the marble statues and the white vases shining in the sun rose in all directions in methodical confusion the sound of a fountain was not wanting and large beds of beautiful flowers abounded proceeding through a lofty berçeau occasional openings in whose curving walks allowed effective glimpses of a bust or a statue the companions at length came in sight of the house it was a long uneven low building evidently of ancient architecture numerous stacks of tall and fantasticallyshaped chimneys rose over three thick and heavy gables which reached down farther than the middle of the elevation forming three compartments one of them including a large and modern bow window over which clustered hi profusion the sweet and glowing blossoms of the clematis and the pomegranate indeed the whole front of the house was so completely covered with a rich scarletcreeper that it was difficult to ascertain of what materials it was built as vivian was admiring a white peacock which attracted by their approach had taken the opportunity of unfurling its wheeling train a man came forward from the bow window  in height he was about five feet eight and of a spare but wellproportioned figure he had little hair which was powdered and dressed in a manner to render more remarkable the elevation of his conical and polished forehead his long piercing black eyes were almost closed from the fullness of their upper lids his cheek was sallow his nose aquiline his mouth compressed his ears which were uncovered were so small that it would be wrong to pass them over unnoticed as indeed were his hands and feet in form quite feminine he was dressed in a coat and waistcoat of black velvet the latter part of his costume reaching to his thighs and in a buttonhole of his coat was a large bunch of tuberose the broad collar of his exquisitely plaited shirt though tied round with a wide black ribbon did not conceal a neck which agreed well with his beardless chin and would not have misbecome a woman in england we should have called his breeches buckskin they were of a pale yellow leather and suited his large and spurarmed cavalry boots which fitted closely to the legs they covered reaching over the knees of the wearer a ribbon round his neck tucked into his waistcoat pocket was attached to a small french watch he swung in his right hand the bow of a violin and in the other the little finger of which was nearly hid by a large antique ring he held a white handkerchief strongly perfumed with violets notwithstanding the many feminine characteristics which i have noticed either from the expression of the eyes or the formation of the mouth the countenance of this individual generally conveyed an impression of firmness and energy this description will not be considered ridiculously minute by those who have never had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the person of so celebrated a gentleman as mr beckendorff  he advanced to the prince with an air which seemed to proclaim that as his person could not be mistaken the ceremony of introduction was unnecessary bowing in a ceremonious and courtly manner to his highness mr beckendorff in a weak but not unpleasing voice said that he was honoured by the presence of mr von philipson the prince answered his salutation in a manner equally ceremonious and equally courtly for having no mean opinion of his own diplomatic abilities his highness determined that neither by an excess of coldness nor cordiality on his part should the minister gather the slightest indication of the temper in which he had attended the interview you see that even the bow of a diplomatist is a serious business  mr beckendorff said his highness my letter doubtless informed you that i should avail myself of your permission to be accompanied let me have the honour of presenting to you my friend mr grey an english gentleman  as the prince spoke beckendorff stood with his arms crossed behind him and his chin resting upon his chest but his eyes at the same time so raised as to look his highness full in the face vivian was so struck by his posture and the expression of his countenance that he nearly omitted to bow when he was presented as his name was mentioned the minister gave him a sharp sidelong glance and moving his head slightly invited his guests to enter the house the gentlemen accordingly complied with his request passing through the bow window they found themselves in a wellsized room the sides of which were covered with shelves filled with richlybound books there was nothing in the room which gave the slightest indication that the master of the library was any other than a private gentleman not a book not a chair was out of its place a purple inkstand of sèvre and a highlytooled morocco portfolio of the same colour reposed on a marqueterie table and that was all no papers no despatches no red tape and no red boxes over an ancient chimney lined with china tiles on which were represented grotesque figures cows playing the harp monkeys acting monarchs and tall figures all legs flying with rapidity from pursuers who were all head over this chimney were suspended some curious pieces of antique armour among which an italian dagger with a chased and jewelled hilt was the most remarkable and the most precious  this said mr beckendorff is my library  what a splendid poignard said the prince who had no taste for books and he immediately walked up to the chimneypiece beckendorff followed him and taking down the admired weapon from its restingplace proceeded to lecture on its virtues its antiquity and its beauty vivian seized this opportunity of taking a rapid glance at the contents of the library he anticipated interleaved copies of machiavel vattel and montesquieu and the lightest works that he expected to meet with were the lying memoirs of some intriguing cardinal or the deluding apology of an exiled minister to his surprise he found that without an exception the collection consisted of poetry and romance somewhat surprised vivian looked with a curious eye on the unlettered backs of a row of mighty folios on a corner shelf these he thought at least must be royal ordinances and collected state papers the sense of propriety struggled for a moment with the passion of curiosity but nothing is more difficult for the man who loves books than to refrain from examining a volume which he fancies may be unknown to him from the jewelled dagger beckendorff had now got to an enamelled breastplate two to one he should not be observed and so with a desperate pull vivian extracted a volume it was a herbal he tried another it was a collection of dried insects  and now said mr beckendorff i will show you my drawingroom  he opened a door at the farther end of the library and introduced them to a room of a different character the sun which was shining brightly lent additional brilliancy to the rainbowtinted birds of paradise the crimson maccaws and the green parroquets that glistened on the indian paper which covered not only the walls but also the ceiling of the room over the fireplace a black frame projecting from the wall and mournfully contrasting with the general brilliant appearance of the apartment inclosed a picture of a beautiful female and bending over its frame and indeed partly shadowing the countenance was the withered branch of a tree a harpsichord and several cases of musical instruments were placed in different parts of the room and suspended by broad black ribbons from the wall on each side of the picture were a guitar and a tambourine on a sofa of unusual size lay a cremona and as mr beckendorff passed the instrument he threw by its side the bow which he had hitherto carried in his hand  we may as well now take something said mr beckendorff when his guests had sufficiently admired the room my pictures are in my diningroom let us go there  so saying and armed this time not only with his bow but also with his violin he retraced his steps through the library and crossing a small passage which divided the house into two compartments he opened the door into his diningroom the moment they entered the room their ears were saluted and indeed their senses ravished by what appeared to be a concert of a thousand birds yet none of the winged choristers were to be seen and not even a single cage was visible the room which was simply furnished appeared at first rather gloomy for though lighted by three windows the silk blinds were all drawn  and now said mr beckendorff raising the first blind you shall see my pictures at what do you estimate this breughel  the window which was of stained green glass gave to the landscape an effect similar to that generally produced by the artist mentioned the prince who was already puzzled by finding one who at the same time was both his host and his enemy so different a character from what he had conceived and who being by temper superstitious considered that this preliminary false opinion of his was rather a bad omen did not express any great admiration of the gallery of mr beckendorff but vivian who had no ambitious hopes or fears to affect his temper and who was amused by the character with whom he had become so unexpectedly acquainted goodnaturedly humoured the fantasies of the minister and said that he preferred his picture to any breughel he had ever seen  i see you have a fine taste said mr beckendorff with a serious air but in a courteous tone you shall see my claude  the rich yellow tint of the second window gave to the fanciful garden all that was requisite to make it look italian  have you ever been in italy sir asked beckendorff  i have not  you have mr von philipson  never south of germany answered the prince who was hungry and eyed with a rapacious glance the capital luncheon which he saw prepared for him  well then when either of you go you will of course not miss the lago maggiore gaze on isola bella at sunset and you will not view so fair a scene as this and now mr von philipson said beckendorff do me the favour of giving me your opinion of this honthorst  his highness would rather have given his opinion of the dish of game which still smoked upon the table but which he was mournfully convinced would not smoke long but thought he this is the last and so he admired the effect produced by the flaming panes to which beckendorff swore that no piece ever painted by gerard honthorst for brilliancy of colouring and boldness of outline could be compared besides continued beckendorff mine are all animated pictures see that cypress waving from the breeze which is now stirring and look look at this crimson peacock look mr von philipson  i am looking mr voni beg pardon mr beckendorff said the prince with great dignity making this slight mistake in the name either from being unused to converse with such low people as had not the nominal mark of nobility or to vent his spleen at being so unnecessarily kept from the refreshment which he so much required  mr von philipson said beckendorff suddenly turning round all my fruits and all my vegetables are from my own garden let us sit down and help ourselves  the only substantial food at table was a great dish of game the vegetables and the fruits were numerous and superb and there really appeared to be a fair prospect of the prince of little lilliput making as good a luncheon as if the whole had been conducted under the auspices of master rodolph himself had it not been for the melody of the unseen vocalists which probably excited by the sounds of the knives and plates too evidently increased every moment but this inconvenience was soon removed by mr beckendorff rising and giving three loud knocks on the door opposite to the one by which they had entered immediate silence ensued  clara will change your plate mr von philipson said beckendorff  vivian eagerly looked up not with the slightest idea that the entrance of clara would prove that the mysterious picture in the drawingroom was a portrait but it must be confessed with a little curiosity to view the first specimen of the sex who lived under the roof of mr beckendorff clara was a hale old woman with rather an acid expression of countenance prim in her appearance and evidently precise in her manners she placed a bottle and two wineglasses with long thin stems on the table and having removed the game and changed the plates she disappeared  pray what wine is this mr beckendorff eagerly asked the prince  i really dont know i never drink wine  not know i never tasted such tokay in my life  probably said mr beckendorff i think it was a present from the emperor i have never tasted it  my dear sir take a glass said the prince his naturally jovial temper having made him completely forget whom he was addressing and the business he had come upon  i never drink wine i am glad you like it i have no doubt clara has more  no no no we must be moderate said the prince who though a great admirer of a good luncheon had also a due respect for a good dinner and consequently had no idea at this awkward hour in the day of preventing himself from properly appreciating the future banquet moreover his highness taking into consideration the manner in which the game had been dressed and the marks of refinement and good taste which seemed to pervade every part of the establishment of mr beckendorff did not imagine that he was much presuming when he conjectured that there was a fair chance of his dinner being something superior  the sudden arrival and appearance of some new and unexpected guests through the mysterious portal on which mr beckendorff by his three knocks had previously produced such a tranquillising effect and which he had now himself opened explained the character of the apartment which from its unceasing melody had so much excited the curiosity of his guests these new visitors were a crowd of piping bullfinches virginia nightingales trained canaries java sparrows and indian lorys which freed from their cages of golden wire by their fond master had fled as was their custom from his superb aviary to pay their respects and compliments at his daily levée  i am glad to see that you like birds sir said beckendorff to vivian for our hero goodnaturedly humouring the tastes of his host was impartially dividing the luxuries of a peach among a crowd of gaudy and greedy little sparrows you shall see my favourites continued beckendorff and tapping rather loudly on the table he held out the forefinger of each hand two bullfinches recognised the signal and immediately hastened to their perch  my dear trilled out one little songster and it raised its speaking eyes to its delighted master  my love warbled the other marking its affection by looks equally personal  as these monosyllables were repeated beckendorff with sparkling eyes triumphantly looked round at vivian as if the frequent reiteration were a proof of the sincerity of the affection of these singular friends  at length to the princes relief mr beckendorffs feathered friends having finished their dessert were sent back to their cages with a strict injunction not to trouble their master at present with their voices an injunction which was obeyed to the letter and when the door was closed few persons could have been persuaded that the next room was an aviary  i am proud of my peaches mr von philipson said beckendorff recommending the fruit to his guests attention then rising from the table he threw himself on the sofa and began humming a tune in a low voice presently he took up his cremona and using the violin as a guitar accompanied himself in a beautiful air but not in a more audible tone while mr beckendorff was singing he seemed unconscious that any person was in the room and the prince who was not very fond of music certainly gave him no hint either by his approbation or his attention that he was listened to vivian however like most unhappy men loved music and actuated by this feeling and the interest which he began to take in the character of mr beckendorff he could not when that gentleman had finished his air refrain from very sincerely saying encore  beckendorff started and looked round as if he were for the first moment aware that any being had heard him  encore said he with a kind sneer who ever could sing or play the same thing twice are you fond of music sir  very much so indeed i fancied i recognised that air you are an admirer i imagine of mozart  i never heard of him i know nothing of those gentry but if you really like music i will play you something worth listening to  mr beckendorff began a beautiful air very adagio gradually increasing the time in a kind of variation till at last his execution became so rapid that vivian surprised at the mere mechanical action rose from his chair in order better to examine the players management and motion of his bow exquisite as were the tones enchanting as were the originality of his variations and the perfect harmony of his composition it was nevertheless extremely difficult to resist smiling at the contortions of his face and figure now his body bending to the strain he was at one moment with his violin raised in the air and the next instant with the lower nut almost resting upon his foot at length by wellproportioned degrees the air died away into the original soft cadence and the player becoming completely entranced in his own performance finished by sinking back on the sofa with his bow and violin raised over his head vivian would not disturb him by his applause an instant after mr beckendorff throwing down the instrument rushed through an open window into the garden  as soon as beckendorff was out of sight vivian looked at the prince and his highness elevating his eyebrows screwing up his mouth and shrugging his shoulders altogether presented a comical picture of a puzzled man  well my dear friend said he this is rather different from what we expected  very different but much more amusing  humph said the prince slowly i do not think it exactly requires a ghost to tell us that mr beckendorff is not in the habit of going to court i do not know how he is accustomed to conduct himself when he is honoured by a visit from the grand duke but i am quite sure that as regards his treatment of myself to say the least the incognito is well observed  mr von philipson said the gentleman of whom they were speaking putting his head in at the window you shall see my blue passionflower we will take a walk round the garden  the prince gave vivian a look which seemed to suppose they must go and accordingly they stepped into the garden  you do not see my garden in its glory said mr beckendorff stopping before the bow window of the library this spot is my strong point had you been here earlier in the year you might have admired with me my invaluable crescents of tulips such colours such brilliancy so defined and last year i had three kingtulips their elegantlyformed creamy cups i have never seen equalled and then my double variegated ranunculuses my hyacinths of fifty bells in every tint single and double and my favourite stands of auriculas so large and powdered that the colour of the velvet leaves was scarcely discoverable the blue passionflower is however now beautiful you see that summerhouse sir continued he turning to vivian the top is my observatory you will sleep in that pavilion tonight so you had better take notice how the walk winds  the passionflower was trained against the summerhouse in question  there said mr beckendorff and he stood admiring with outstretched arms the latter days of its beauty for the autumn frosts will soon stop its flower pray mr von philipson are you a botanist  why said the prince i am a great admirer of flowers but i cannot exactly say that  ah no botanist the flower of this beautiful plant continues only one day but there is a constant succession from july to the end of the autumn and if this fine weather continuepray sir how is the wind  i really cannot say said the prince but i think the wind is either  do you know sir continued beckendorff to vivian  i think sir that it is  westerly well if this weather continue the succession may still last another month you will be interested to know mr von philipson that the flower comes out at the same joint with the leaf on a peduncle nearly three inches long round the centre of it are two radiating crowns look look sir the inner inclining towards the centre column now examine this well and i will be with you in a moment so saying mr beckendorff running down the walk jumped over the railing and in a moment was coursing across the lawn towards the river in a chase after a dragonfly  mr beckendorff was soon out of sight and after lingering halfanhour in the vicinity of the blue passionflower the prince proposed to vivian that they should quit the spot so far as i can observe continued his highness we might as well quit the house no wonder that beckendorffs power is on the wane for he appears to me to be growing childish surely he could not always have been this frivolous creature  i am really so astonished said vivian that it is quite out of my power to assist your highness in any supposition but i should recommend you not to be too hasty in your movements take care that staying here does not affect the position which you have taken up or retard the progress of any measures on which you have determined and you are safe what will it injure you if with the chance of achieving the great and patriotic purpose to which you have devoted your powers and energies you are subjected for a few hours to the caprices or even rudeness of any man whatever if beckendorff be the character which the world gives him credit to be i do not think he can imagine that you are to be deceived twice and if he do imagine so we are convinced that he will be disappointed if as you have supposed not only his power is on the wane but his intellect also fourandtwenty hours will convince us of the fact for in less than that time your highness will necessarily have conversation of a more important nature with him i recommend therefore that we continue here today although added vivian smiling i have to sleep in his observatory  after walking in the gardens about an hour the prince and vivian again went into the house imagining that beckendorff might have returned by another entrance but he was not there the prince was much annoyed and vivian to amuse himself had recourse to the library after reexamining the armour looking at the garden through the painted windows conjecturing who might be the original of the mysterious picture and what could be the meaning of the withered branch the prince was fairly worn out the precise dinner hour he did not know and notwithstanding repeated exertions he had hitherto been unable to find the blooming clara he could not flatter himself however that there were less than two hours to kill before the great event took place and so heartily wishing himself back again at turriparva he prevailed upon vivian to throw aside his book and take another walk  this time they extended their distance stretched out as far as the river and explored the adjoining woods but of mr beckendorff they saw and heard nothing at length they again returned it was getting dusk they found the bow window of the library closed they again entered the diningroom and to their surprise found no preparations for dinner this time the prince was more fortunate in his exertions to procure an interview with madam clara for that lady almost immediately entered the room  pray my good madam inquired the prince has your master returned  mr beckendorff is in the library sir said the old lady pompously  indeed we do not dine in this room then  dine sir said the good dame forgetting her pomposity in her astonishment  yes dine said the prince  mr beckendorff never takes anything after his noon meal  am i to understand then that we are to have no dinner asked his highness angry and agitated  mr beckendorff never takes anything after his noon meal sir but i am sure that if you and your friend are hungry sir i hope there is never a want in this house  my good lady i am hungry very hungry indeed and if your master i mean mr von that is mr beckendorff has such a bad appetite that he can satisfy himself with picking once a day the breast of a pheasant why if he expect his friends to be willing or even able to live on such fare the least that i can say is that he is much mistaken and so therefore my good friend grey i think we had better order our horses and be off  no occasion for that i hope said mrs clara rather alarmed at the princes passion no want i trust ever here sir and i make no doubt you will have dinner as soon as possible and so sir i hope you will not be hasty  hasty i have no wish to be hasty but as for disarranging the whole economy of the house and getting up an extemporaneous meal for me i cannot think of it mr beckendorff may live as he likes and if i stay here i am contented to live as he does i do not wish him to change his habits for me and i shall take care that after today there will be no necessity for his doing so however absolute hunger can make no compliments and therefore i will thank you my good madam to let me and my friend have the remains of that cold game if they be still in existence on which we lunched or as you term it took our noon meal this morning and which if it were your own cooking mrs clara i assure you as i observed to my friend at the time did you infinite credit  the prince although his gentlemanlike feelings had in spite of his hunger dictated a deprecation of mrs claras making a dinner merely for himself still thought that a seasonable and deserved compliment to the lady might assist in bringing about a result which notwithstanding his politeness he much desired and that was the production of another specimen of her culinary accomplishments having behaved as he considered with moderation and dignified civility he was it must be confessed rather astounded when mrs clara duly acknowledging his compliment by her curtsey was sorry to inform him that she dared give no refreshment in this house without mr beckendorffs special order  special order why surely your master will not grudge me the cold leg of a pheasant  mr beckendorff is not in the habit of grudging anything answered the housekeeper with offended majesty  then why should he object asked the prince  mr beckendorff is the best judge sir of the propriety of his own regulations  well well said vivian more interested for his friend than himself there is no difficulty in asking mr beckendorff  none in the least sir answered the housekeeper when he is awake  awake said the prince why is he asleep now  yes sir in the library  and how long will he be asleep asked the prince with eagerness  it is uncertain he may be asleep for hours he may wake in five minutes all i can do is to watch  but surely in a case like the present you can wake your master  i could not wake mr beckendorff sir if the house were on fire no one can enter the room when he is asleep  then how can you possibly know when he is awake  i shall hear his violin immediately sir  well well i suppose it must be so i wish we were in turriparva that is all i know men of my station have no business to be paying visits to the sons of the lord knows who peasants shopkeepers and pedagogues  as a fire was blazing in the diningroom which mrs clara informed them mr beckendorff never omitted having every night in the year the prince and his friend imagined that they were to remain there and they consequently did not attempt to disturb the slumbers of their host resting his feet on the hobs his highness for the fiftieth time declared that he wished he had never left turriparva and just when vivian was on the point of giving up in despair the hope of consoling him mrs clara entered and proceeded to lay the cloth  your master is awake then asked the prince very quickly  mr beckendorff has been long awake sir and dinner will be ready immediately  his highness countenance brightened and in a short time the supper appearing the prince again fascinated by mrs claras cookery and mr beckendorffs wine forgot his chagrin and regained his temper  in about a couple of hours mr beckendorff entered  i hope that clara has given you wine you like mr von philipson  the same bin i will answer for that  mr beckendorff had his violin in his hand but his dress was much changed his great boots being pulled off exhibited the white silk stockings which he invariably wore his coat had given place to the easier covering of a brocade dressinggown he drew a chair round the fire between the prince and vivian it was a late hour and the room was only lighted by the glimmering coals for the flames had long died away mr beckendorff sat for some time without speaking gazing earnestly on the decaying embers indeed before many minutes had elapsed complete silence prevailed for both the endeavours of the prince and of vivian to promote conversation had been unsuccessful at length the master of the house turned round to the prince and pointing to a particular mass of coal said i think mr von philipson that is the completest elephant i ever saw we will ring the bell for some coals and then have a game of whist  the prince was so surprised by mr beckendorffs remark that he was not sufficiently struck by the strangeness of his proposition and it was only when he heard vivian professing his ignorance of the game that it occurred to him that to play at whist was hardly the object for which he had travelled from turriparva  an englishman not know whist said mr beckendorff  ridiculous you do know it let us play mr von philipson i know has no objection  but my good sir said the prince although previous to conversation i may have no objection to join in a little amusement still it appears to me that it has escaped your memory that whist is a game which requires the cooperation of four persons  not at all i take dummy i am not sure it is not the finest way of playing the game  the table was arranged the lights brought the cards produced and the prince of little lilliput greatly to his surprise found himself playing whist with mr beckendorff nothing could be more dull the minister would neither bet nor stake and the immense interest which he took in every card that was played ludicrously contrasted with the rather sullen looks of the prince and the very sleepy ones of vivian whenever mr beckendorff played for dummy he always looked with the most searching eye into the next adversarys face as if he would read his cards in his features the first rubber lasted an hour and a half three long games which mr beckendorff to his triumph hardly won in the first game of the second rubber vivian blundered in the second he revoked and in the third having neglected to play and being loudly called upon and rated both by his partner and mr beckendorff he was found to be asleep beckendorff threw down his hand with a loud dash which roused vivian from his slumber he apologised for his drowsiness but said that he was so sleepy that he must retire the prince who longed to be with beckendorff alone winked approbation of his intention  well said beckendorff you spoiled the rubber i shall ring for clara why you all are so fond of going to bed i cannot understand i have not been to bed these thirty years  vivian made his escape and beckendorff pitying his degeneracy proposed to the prince in a tone which seemed to anticipate that the offer would meet with instantaneous acceptation double dummy this however was too much  no more cards sir i thank you said the prince if however you have a mind for an hours conversation i am quite at your service  i am obliged to you i never talk good night mr von philipson  mr beckendorff left the room his highness could contain himself no longer he rang the bell  pray mrs clara said he where are my horses  mr beckendorff will have no quadrupeds within a mile of the house except owlface  how do you mean let me see the manservant  the household consists only of myself sir  why where is my luggage then  that has been brought up sir it is in your room  i tell you i must have my horses  it is quite impossible tonight sir i think sir you had better retire mr beckendorff may not be home again these six hours  what is your master gone out  yes sir he is just gone out to take his ride  why where is his horse kept then  it is owlface sir  owlface indeed what is your master in the habit of riding out at night  mr beckendorff rides out sir just when it happens to suit him  it is very odd i cannot ride out when it happens to suit me however i will be off tomorrow and so if you please show me my bedroom at once  your room is the library sir  the library why there is no bed in the library  we have no beds sir but the sofa is made up  no beds well it is only for one night you are all mad and i am as mad as you for coming here     chapter vii   the morning sun peeping through the window of the little summerhouse roused its inmate at an early hour and finding no signs of mr beckendorff and his guest having yet risen from their slumbers vivian took the opportunity of strolling about the gardens and the grounds directing his way along the margin of the river he soon left the lawn and entered some beautiful meadows whose dewy verdure glistened in the brightening beams of the early sun crossing these and passing through a gate he found himself in a rural road whose lofty hedgerows rich with all the varieties of wild fruit and flower and animated with the cheering presence of the busy birds chirping from every bough and spray altogether presented a scene which reminded him of the soft beauties of his own country with some men to remember is to be sad and unfortunately for vivian grey there were few objects which with him did not give rise to associations of a painful nature the strange occurrences of the last few days had recalled if not revived the feelings of his boyhood his early career flitted across his mind he would have stifled the remembrance with a sigh but man is the slave of memory for a moment he mused over power but then he shuddering shrank from the wearing anxiety the consuming care the eternal vigilance the constant contrivance the agonising suspense the distracting vicissitudes of his past career alas it is our nature to sicken from our birth after some object of unattainable felicity to struggle through the freshest years of our life in an insane pursuit after some indefinite good which does not even exist but sure and quick is the dark hour which cools our doting frenzy in the frigid waves of the ocean of oblivion we dream of immortality until we die ambition at thy proud and fatal altar we whisper the secrets of our mighty thoughts and breathe the aspirations of our inexpressible desires a clouded flame licks up the offering of our ruined souls and the sacrifice vanishes in the sable smoke of death  but where are his thoughts wandering had he forgotten that day of darkest despair there had that happened to him which had happened to no other man he was roused from his reverie by the sound of a trotting horse he looked up but the winding road prevented him at first from seeing the steed which evidently was approaching the sound came nearer and nearer and at length turning a corner mr beckendorff came in sight he was mounted on a strongbuilt rough and ugly pony with an obstinate mane which defying the exertions of the groom fell in equal divisions on both sides of its bottle neck and a large white face which combined with its blinking vision had earned for it the euphonious title of owlface both master and steed must have travelled hard and far for both were covered with dust and mud from top to toe from mane to hoof mr beckendorff seemed surprised at meeting vivian and pulled up his pony as he reached him  an early riser i see sir where is mr von philipson  i have not yet seen him and imagined that both he and yourself had not yet risen  hum how many hours is it to noon asked mr beckendorff who always spoke astronomically  more than four i imagine  pray do you prefer the country about here to turriparva  both i think are beautiful  you live at turriparva asked mr beckendorff  as a guest answered vivian  has it been a fine summer at turriparva  i believe everywhere  i am afraid mr von philipson finds it rather dull here  i am not aware of it  he seems a very said beckendorff looking keenly in his companions face but vivian did not supply the desired phrase and so the minister was forced to finish the sentence himself a very gentlemanlike sort of man a low bow was the only response  i trust sir i may indulge the hope continued mr beckendorff that you will honour me with your company another day  you are exceedingly obliging  mr von philipson is fond i think of a country life said beckendorff  most men are  i suppose he has no innate objection to live occasionally in a city  few have  you probably have known him long  not long enough to wish our acquaintance at an end  hum  they proceeded in silence for some moments and then beckendorff again turned round and this time with a direct question  i wonder if mr von philipson can make it convenient to honour me with his company another day can you tell me  i think the best person to inform you of that would be his highness himself said vivian using his friends title purposely to show mr beckendorff how ridiculous he considered his present use of the incognito  you think so sir do you answered beckendorff sarcastically  they had now arrived at the gate by which vivian had reached the road  your course sir said mr beckendorff lies that way i see like myself you are no great talker we shall meet at breakfast so saying the minister set spurs to his pony and was soon out of sight  when vivian reached the house he found the bow window of the library thrown open and as he approached he saw mr beckendorff enter the room and bow to the prince his highness had passed a good night in spite of not sleeping in a bed and he was at this moment commencing a delicious breakfast his illhumour had consequently vanished he had made up his mind that beckendorff was mad and although he had given up all the secret and flattering hopes which he had dared to entertain when the interview was first arranged he nevertheless did not regret his visit which on the whole had been amusing and had made him acquainted with the person and habits and as he believed the intellectual powers of a man with whom most probably he should soon be engaged in open hostility vivian took his seat at the breakfast table and beckendorff stood conversing with them with his back to the fireplace and occasionally during the pauses of conversation pulling the strings of his violin with his fingers it did not escape vivians observation that the minister was particularly courteous and even attentive to the prince and that he endeavoured by his quick and more communicative answers and occasionally by a stray observation to encourage the good humour visible on the cheerful countenance of his guest  have you been long up mr beckendorff asked the prince for his host had resumed his dressinggown and slippers  i generally see the sun rise  and yet you retire late out riding last night i understand  i never go to bed  indeed said the prince well for my part without my regular rest i am nothing have you breakfasted mr beckendorff  clara will bring my breakfast immediately  the dame accordingly soon appeared bearing a tray with a basin of boiling water and one large thick biscuit this mr beckendorff having well soaked in the hot fluid eagerly devoured and then taking up his violin amused himself until his guests had finished their breakfast  when vivian had ended his meal he left the prince and beckendorff alone determined that his presence should not be the occasion of the minister any longer retarding the commencement of business the prince who by a private glance had been prepared for his departure immediately took the opportunity of asking mr beckendorff in a decisive tone whether he might flatter himself that he could command his present attention to a subject of importance mr beckendorff said that he was always at mr von philipsons service and drawing a chair opposite him the prince and mr beckendorff now sat on each side of the fireplace  hem said the prince clearing his throat and he looked at mr beckendorff who sat with his heels close together his toes out square his hands resting on his knees which as well as his elbows were turned out his shoulders bent his head reclined and his eyes glancing  hem said the prince of little lilliput in compliance mr beckendorff with your wish developed in the communication received by me on theinst i assented in my answer to the arrangement then proposed the object of which was to use your own words to facilitate the occurrence of an oral interchange of the sentiments of various parties interested in certain proceedings by which interchange it was anticipated that the mutual interests might be respectively considered and finally arranged prior mr beckendorff to either of us going into any detail upon those points of probable discussion which will in all likelihood form the fundamental features of this interview i wish to recall your attention to the paper which i had the honour of presenting to his royal highness and which is alluded to in your communication of thelost the principal heads of that document i have brought with me abridged in this paper  here the prince handed to mr beckendorff a ms pamphlet consisting of several sheets closely written the minister bowed very graciously as he took it from his highness hand and then without even looking at it laid it on the table  you sir i perceive continued the prince are acquainted with its contents and it will therefore be unnecessary for me at present to expatiate upon their individual expediency or to argue for their particular adoption and sir when we observe the progress of the human mind when we take into consideration the quick march of intellect and the wide expansion of enlightened views and liberal principles when we take a birdseye view of the history of man from the earliest ages to the present moment i feel that it would be folly in me to conceive for an instant that the measures developed and recommended in that paper will not finally receive the approbation of his royal highness as to the exact origin of slavery mr beckendorff i confess that i am not at this moment prepared distinctly to speak that the divine author of our religion was its decided enemy i am informed is clear that the slavery of ancient times was the origin of the feudal service of a more modern period is a point on which men of learning have not precisely made up their minds with regard to the exact state of the ancient german people tacitus affords us a great deal of most interesting information whether or not certain passages which i have brought with me marked in the germania are incontestable evidences that our ancestors enjoyed or understood the practice of a wise and wellregulated representative system is a point on which i shall be happy to receive the opinion of so distinguished a statesman as mr beckendorff in stepping forward as i have felt it my duty to do as the advocate of popular rights and national privileges i am desirous to prove that i have not become the votary of innovation and the professor of revolutionary doctrines the passages of the roman author in question and an ancient charter of the emperor charlemagne are i consider decisive and sufficient precedents for the measures which i have thought proper to sanction by my approval and to support by my influence a minister mr beckendorff must take care that in the great race of politics the minds of his countrymen do not leave his own behind them we must never forget the powers and capabilities of man on this very spot perhaps some centuries ago savages clothed in skins were committing cannibalism in a forest we must not forget i repeat that it is the business to those to whom providence has allotted the responsible possession of power and influence that it is their duty our duty mr beckendorff to become guardians of our weaker fellowcreatures that all power is a trust that we are accountable for its exercise that from the people and for the people all springs and all must exist and that unless we conduct ourselves with the requisite wisdom prudence and propriety the whole system of society will be disorganised and this country in particular will fall a victim to that system of corruption and misgovernment which has already occasioned the destruction of the great kingdoms mentioned in the bible and many other states besides greece rome carthage c  thus ended the peroration of an harangue consisting of an incoherent arrangement of imperfectlyremembered facts and misunderstood principles all gleaned by his highness from the enlightening articles of the reisenburg journals like brutus the prince of little lilliput paused for a reply  mr von philipson said his companion when his highness had finished you speak like a man of sense having given this answer mr beckendorff rose from his seat and walked straight out of the room  the prince at first took the answer for a compliment but mr beckendorff not returning he began to have a faint idea that he was neglected in this uncertainty he rang the bell for his friend clara  mrs clara where is your master  just gone out sir  how do you mean  he has gone out with his gun sir  you are quite sure he hasgone out  quite sure sir i took him his coat and boots myself  i am to understand then that your master has gone out  yes sir mr beckendorff has gone out he will be home for his noon meal  that is enough grey called out the indignant prince darting into the garden  well my dear prince said vivian what can possibly be the matter  the matter insanity can be the only excuse insanity can alone account for his preposterous conduct we have seen enough of him the repetition of absurdity is only wearisome pray assist me in getting our horses immediately  certainly if you wish it but remember you brought me here as your friend and counsellor as i have accepted the trust i cannot help being sensible of the responsibility before therefore you finally resolve upon departure pray let me be fully acquainted with the circumstances which have impelled you to this sudden resolution  willingly my good friend could i only command my temper and yet to fall into a passion with a madman is almost a mark of madness but his manner and his conduct are so provoking and so puzzling that i cannot altogether repress my irritability and that ridiculous incognito why i sometimes begin to think that i really am mr von philipson an incognito forsooth for what to deceive whom his household apparently only consists of two persons one of whom has visited me in my own castle and the other is a cross old hag who would not be able to comprehend my rank if she were aware of it but to the point when you left the room i was determined to be trifled with no longer and i asked him in a firm voice and very marked manner whether i might command his immediate attention to important business he professed to be at my service i opened the affair by taking a cursory yet definite review of the principles in which my political conduct had originated and on which it was founded i flattered myself that i had produced an impression sometimes we are in a better cue for these expositions than at others and today i was really unusually felicitous my memory never deserted i was at the same time luminous and profound and while i was guided by the philosophical spirit of the present day i showed by my various reading that i respected the experience of antiquity in short i was satisfied with myself and with the exception of one single point about the origin of slavery which unfortunately got entangled with the feudal system i could not have got on better had sievers himself been at my side nor did i spare mr beckendorff but on the contrary i said a few things which had he been in his senses must i imagine have gone home do you know i finished by drawing his own character and showing the inevitable effects of his ruinous policy and what do you think he did  left you in a passion  not at all he seemed much struck by what i had said and apparently understood it i have heard that in some species of insanity the patient is perfectly able to comprehend everything addressed to him though at that point his sanity ceases and he is unable to answer or to act this must be beckendorffs case for no sooner had i finished than he rose up immediately and saying that i spoke like a man of sense abruptly quitted the room the housekeeper says he will not be at home again till that infernal ceremony takes place called the noon meal now do you not advise me to be off as soon as possible  it will require some deliberation pray did you not speak to him last night  ah i forgot that i had not been able to speak to you since then well last night what do you think he did when you were gone he had the insolence to congratulate me on the opportunity then afforded of playing double dummy and when i declined his proposition but said that if he wished to have an hours conversation i was at his service he coolly told me that he never talked and bade me good night did you ever know such a madman he never goes to bed i only had a sofa how the deuce did you sleep  well and safely considering that i was in a summerhouse without lock or bolt  well i need not ask you now as to your opinion of our immediately getting off we shall have however some trouble about our horses for he will not allow a quadruped near the house except some monster of an animal that he rides himself and by st hubert i cannot find out where our steeds are what shall we do but vivian did not answer what are you thinking of continued his highness why dont you answer  your highness must not go said vivian shaking his head  not go why so  depend upon it you are wrong about beckendorff that he is a humorist there is no doubt but it appears to me to be equally clear that his queer habits and singular mode of life are not of late adoption what he is now he must have been these ten perhaps these twenty years perhaps more of this there are a thousand proofs about us as to the overpowering cause which has made him the character he appears at present it is needless for us to inquire probably some incident in his private life in all likelihood connected with the mysterious picture let us be satisfied with the effect if the case be as i state it in his private life and habits beckendorff must have been equally incomprehensible and equally singular at the very time that in his public capacity he was producing such brilliant results as at the present moment now then can we believe him to be insane i anticipate your objections i know you will enlarge upon the evident absurdity of his inviting his political opponent to his house for a grave consultation on the most important affairs and then treating him as he has done you when it must be clear to him that you cannot be again duped and when he must feel that were he to amuse you for as many weeks as he has days your plans and your position would not be injuriously affected be it so probably a humorist like beckendorff cannot even in the most critical moment altogether restrain the bent of his capricious inclinations however my dear prince i will lay no stress upon this point my opinion indeed my conviction is that beckendorff acts from design i have considered his conduct well and i have observed all that you have seen and more than you have seen and keenly depend upon it that since you assented to the interview beckendorff has been obliged to shift his intended position for negotiation some of the machinery has gone wrong fearful if he had postponed your visit you should imagine that he was only again amusing you and consequently would listen to no future overtures he has allowed you to attend a conference for which he is not prepared that he is making desperate exertions to bring the business to a point is my firm opinion and you would perhaps agree with me were you as convinced as i am that since we parted last night our host has been to reisenburg and back again  to reisenburg and back again  ay i rose this morning at an early hour and imagining that both you and beckendorff had not yet made your appearance i escaped from the grounds intending to explore part of the surrounding country in my stroll i came to a narrow winding road which i am convinced lies in the direction towards reisenburg there for some reason or other i loitered more than an hour and very probably should have been too late for breakfast had not i been recalled to myself by the approach of a horseman it was beckendorff covered with dust and mud his horse had been evidently hard ridden i did not think much of it at the time because i supposed he might have been out for three or four hours and hard worked but i nevertheless was struck by his appearance and when you mentioned that he went out riding at a late hour last night it immediately occurred to me that had he come home at one or two oclock it was not very probable that he would have gone out again at four or five i have no doubt that my conjecture is correct beckendorff has been to reisenburg  you have placed this business in a new and important light said the prince his expiring hopes reviving what then do you advise me to do  to be quiet if your own view of the case be right you can act as well tomorrow or the next day as this moment on the contrary if mine be the correct one a moment may enable beckendorff himself to bring affairs to a crisis in either case i should recommend you to be silent and in no manner to allude any more to the object of your visit if you speak you only give opportunities to beckendorff of ascertaining your opinions and your inclinations and your silence after such frequent attempts on your side to promote discussion upon business will soon be discovered by him to be systematic this will not decrease his opinion of your sagacity and firmness the first principle of negotiation is to make your adversary respect you  after long consultation the prince determined to follow vivians advice and so firmly did he adhere to his purpose that when he met mr beckendorff at the noon meal he asked him with a very unembarrassed voice and manner what sport he had had in the morning  the noon meal again consisted of a single dish as exquisitely dressed however as the preceding one it was a haunch of venison  this is my dinner gentlemen said beckendorff let it be your luncheon i have ordered your dinner at sunset  after having eaten a slice of the haunch mr beckendorff rose from the table and said we will have our wine in the drawingroom mr von philipson and then you will not be disturbed by my birds  he left the room  to the drawingroom therefore his two guests soon adjourned they found him busily employed with his pencil the prince thought it must be a chart or a fortification at least and was rather surprised when mr beckendorff asked him the magnitude of mirac in boötes and the prince confessing his utter ignorance of the subject the minister threw aside his unfinished planisphere and drew his chair to them at the table it was with satisfaction that his highness perceived a bottle of his favourite tokay and with no little astonishment he observed that today there were three wine glasses placed before them they were of peculiar beauty and almost worthy for their elegant shapes and great antiquity of being included in the collection of the grand duke of johannisberger  after exhausting their bottle in which they were assisted to the extent of one glass by their host who drank mr von philipsons health with cordiality they assented to mr beckendorffs proposition of visiting his fruitery  to the princes great relief dinnertime soon arrived and having employed a couple of hours on that meal very satisfactorily he and vivian adjourned to the drawingroom having previously pledged their honour to each other that nothing should again induce them to play dummy whist their resolutions and their promises were needless mr beckendorff who was sitting opposite the fire when they came into the room neither by word nor motion acknowledged that he was aware of their entrance vivian found refuge in a book and the prince after having examined and reexamined the brilliant birds that figured on the drawingroom paper fell asleep upon the sofa mr beckendorff took down the guitar and accompanied himself in a low voice for some time then he suddenly ceased and stretching out his legs and supporting his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat he leant back in his chair and remained motionless with his eyes fixed upon the picture vivian in turn gazed upon this singular being and the fair pictured form which he seemed to idolise was he too unhappy had he too been bereft in the hour of his proud and perfect joy had he too lost a virgin bride his agony overcame him the book fell from his hand and he sighed aloud mr beckendorff started and the prince awoke vivian confounded and unable to overpower his emotions uttered some hasty words explanatory apologetical and contradictory and retired in his walk to the summerhouse a man passed him in spite of a great cloak vivian recognised him as their messenger and guide and his ample mantle did not conceal his riding boots and the spurs which glistened in the moonlight  it was an hour past midnight when the door of the summerhouse softly opened and mr beckendorff entered he started when he found vivian still undressed and pacing up and down the little chamber the young man made an effort when he witnessed an intruder to compose a countenance whose agitation could not be concealed  what are you up again said mr beckendorff are you ill  would i were as well in mind as in body i have not yet been to rest we cannot command our feelings at all moments sir and at this especially i felt that i had a right to count upon being alone  i exceedingly regret that i have disturbed you said mr beckendorff in a kind voice and in a manner which responded to the sympathy of his tone i thought that you had been long asleep there is a star which i cannot exactly make out i fancy it must be a comet and so i ran to the observatory but let me not disturb you and mr beckendorff was retiring  you do not disturb me sir i cannot sleep pray ascend  never mind the star but if you really have no inclination to sleep let us sit down and have a little conversation or perhaps we had better take a stroll it is a warm night as he spoke mr beckendorff gently put his arm within vivians and led him down the steps  are you an astronomer sir asked beckendorff  i can tell the great bear from the little dog but i confess that i look upon the stars rather in a poetical than a scientific spirit  hum i confess i do not  there are moments continued vivian when i cannot refrain from believing that these mysterious luminaries have more influence over our fortunes than modern times are disposed to believe i feel that i am getting less sceptical perhaps i should say more credulous every day but sorrow makes us superstitious  i discard all such fantasies said mr beckendorff they only tend to enervate our mental energies and paralyse all human exertion it is the belief in these and a thousand other deceits i could mention which leach man that he is not the master of his own mind but the ordained victim or the chance sport of circumstances that makes millions pass through life unimpressive as shadows and has gained for this existence the stigma of a vanity which it does not deserve  i wish that i could think as you do said vivian but the experience of my life forbids me within only these last two years my career has in so many instances indicated that i am not the master of my own conduct that no longer able to resist the conviction which is hourly impressed on me i recognise in every contingency the preordination of my fate  a delusion of the brain said beckendorff quickly fate destiny chance particular and special providence idle words dismiss them all sir a mans fate is his own temper and according to that will be his opinion as to the particular manner in which the course of events is regulated a consistent man believes in destiny a capricious man in chance  but sir what is a mans temper it may be changed every hour i started in life with very different feelings from those which i profess at this moment with great deference to you i imagine that you mistake the effect for the cause for surely temper is not the origin but the result of those circumstances of which we are all the creatures  sir i deny it man is not the creature of circumstances circumstances are the creatures of men we are free agents and man is more powerful than matter i recognise no intervening influence between that of the established course of nature and my own mind truth may be distorted may be stifled be suppressed the invention of cunning deceits may and in most instances does prevent man from exercising his own powers they have made him responsible to a realm of shadows and a suitor in a court of shades re is ever dreading authority which does not exist and fearing the occurrence of penalties which there are none to enforce but the mind that dares to extricate itself from these vulgar prejudices that proves its loyalty to its creator by devoting all its adoration to his glory such a spirit as this becomes a mastermind and that mastermind will invariably find that circumstances are its slaves  mr beckendorff yours is a bold philosophy of which i myself was once a votary how successful in my service you may judge by finding me a wanderer  sir your present age is the age of error your whole system is founded on a fallacy you believe that a mans temper can change i deny it if you have ever seriously entertained the views which i profess if as you lead me to suppose you have dared to act upon them and failed sooner or later whatever may be your present conviction and your present feelings you will recur to your original wishes and your original pursuits with a mind experienced and matured you may in all probability be successful and then i suppose stretching your legs in your easychair you will at the same moment be convinced of your own genius and recognise your own destiny  with regard to myself mr beckendorff i am convinced of the erroneousness of your views it is my opinion that no one who has dared to think can look upon this world in any other than a mournful spirit young as i am nearly two years have elapsed since disgusted with the world of politics i retired to a foreign solitude at length with passions subdued and as i flatter myself with a mind matured convinced of the vanity of all human affairs i felt emboldened once more partially to mingle with my species bitter as my lot had been i had discovered the origin of my misery in my own unbridled passions and tranquil and subdued i now trusted to pass through life as certain of no fresh sorrows as i was of no fresh joys and yet sir i am at this moment sinking under the infliction of unparalleled misery misery which i feel i have a right to believe was undeserved but why expatiate to a stranger on sorrow which must be secret i deliver myself up to my remorseless fate  what is grief said mr beckendorff if it be excited by the fear of some contingency instead of grieving a man should exert his energies and prevent its occurrence if on the contrary it be caused by an event that which has been occasioned by anything human by the cooperation of human circumstances can be and invariably is removed by the same means grief is the agony of an instant the indulgence of grief the blunder of a life mix in the world and in a months time you will speak to me very differently a young man you meet with disappointment in spite of all your exalted notions of your own powers you immediately sink under it if your belief of your powers were sincere you should have proved it by the manner in which you have struggled against adversity not merely by the mode in which you laboured for advancement the latter is but a very inferior merit if in fact you wish to succeed success i repeat is at your command you talk to me of your experience and do you think that my sentiments are the crude opinions of an unpractised man sir i am not fond of conversing with any person and therefore far from being inclined to maintain an argument in a spirit of insincerity merely for the sake of a victory of words mark what i say it is truth no minister ever yet fell but from his own inefficiency if his downfall be occasioned as it generally is by the intrigues of one of his own creatures his downfall is merited for having been the dupe of a tool which in all probability he should never have employed if he fall through the open attacks of his political opponents his downfall is equally deserved for having occasioned by his impolicy the formation of a party for having allowed it to be formed or for not having crushed it when formed no conjecture can possibly occur however fearful however tremendous it may appear from which a man by his own energy may not extricate himself as a mariner by the rattling of his cannon can dissipate the impending waterspout     chapter viii   it was on the third day of the visit to mr beckendorff just as that gentleman was composing his mind after his noon meal with his favourite cremona and in a moment of rapture raising his instrument high in the air that the door was suddenly dashed open and essper george rushed into the room the intruder the moment that his eye caught vivian flew to his master and seizing him by the arm commenced and continued a loud shout of exultation accompanying his scream the whole time by a kind of quick dance which though not quite as clamorous as the pyrrhic nevertheless completely drowned the scientific harmony of mr beckendorff  so astounded were the three gentlemen by this unexpected entrance that some moments elapsed ere either of them found words at his command at length the master of the house spoke  mr von philipson i beg the favour of being informed who this person is  the prince did not answer but looked at vivian in great distress and just as our hero was about to give mr beckendorff the requisite information essper george taking up the parable himself seized the opportunity of explaining the mystery  who am i who are you i am an honest man and no traitor and if all were the same why then there would be no rogues in reisenburg who am i a man theres an arm theres a leg can you see through a wood by twilight if so yours is a better eye than mine can you eat an unskinned hare or dine on the haunch of a bounding stag if so your teeth are sharper than mine can you hear a robbers footstep when hes kneeling before murder or can you listen to the snow falling on midsummers day if so your ears are finer than mine can you run with a chamois can you wrestle with a bear can you swim with an otter if so im your match how many cities have you seen how many knaves have you gulled which is dearest bread or justice why do men pay more for the protection of life than life itself is cheatery a staple at constantinople as it is at vienna and whats the difference between a baltic merchant and a greek pirate tell me all this and i will tell you who went in mourning in the moon at the death of the last comet who am i indeed  the embarrassment of the prince and vivian while essper george addressed to mr beckendorff these choice queries was indescribable once vivian tried to check him but in vain he did not repeat his attempt for he was sufficiently employed in restraining his own agitation and keeping his own countenance for in spite of the mortification and anger that esspers appearance had excited in him still an unfortunate but innate taste for the ludicrous did not allow him to be perfectly insensible to the humour of the scene mr beckendorff listened quietly till essper had finished he then rose  mr von philipson said he as a personal favour to yourself and to my own great inconvenience i consented that in this interview you should be attended by a friend i did not reckon upon your servant and it is impossible that i can tolerate his presence for a moment you know how i live and that my sole attendant is a female i allow no male servants within this house even when his royal highness honours me with his presence he is unattended i desire that i am immediately released from the presence of this buffoon  so saying mr beckendorff left the room  who are you said essper following him with his back bent his head on his chest and his eyes glancing the imitation was perfect  essper said vivian your conduct is inexcusable the mischief that you have done irreparable and your punishment shall be severe  severe why what day did my master sell his gratitude for a silver groschen is this the return for finding you out and saving you from a thousand times more desperate gang than that baron at ems severe indeed will be your lot when you are in a dungeon in reisenburg castle with black bread for roast venison and sour water for rhenish  why what are you talking about  talking about about treason and arch traitors and an old scoundrel who lives in a lone lane and dares not look you straight in the face why his very blink is enough to hang him without trial  essper cease immediately this rhodomontade and then in distinct terms inform his highness and myself of the causes of this unparalleled intrusion  the impressiveness of vivians manner produced a proper effect and except that he spoke somewhat affectedly slow and ridiculously precise essper george delivered himself with great clearness  you see sir you never let me know that you were going to leave and so when i found that you did not come back i made bold to speak to mr arnelm when he came home from hunting but i could not get enough breath out of him to stop a ladybird on a roseleaf i did not much like it your honour for i was among strangers and so were you you know well then i went to master rodolph he was very kind to me and seeing me in low spirits and thinking me i suppose in love or in debt or that i had done some piece of mischief or had something or other preying on my mind he comes to me and says essper said he you remember master rodolphs voice sir  to the point never let me hear master rodolphs name again  yes sir well well he said to me come and dine with me in my room says i i will a good offer should never be refused unless we have a better one at the same time whereupon after dinner master rodolph said to me we will have a bottle of burgundy for a treat you see sir we were rather sick of the rhenish well sir we were free with the wine and master rodolph who is never easy except when he knows everything must be trying you see to get out of me what it was that made me so down in the mouth i seeing this thought i would put off the secret to another bottle which being produced i did not conceal from him any longer what was making me so low rodolph said i i do not like my young master going out in this odd way he is of a temper to get into scrapes and i should like very much to know what he and the prince saving your highness presence are after they have been shut up in that cabinet these two nights and though i walked by the door pretty often devil a bit of a word ever came through the keyhole and so you see rodolph said i it requires a bottle or two of burgundy to keep my spirits up well your highness strange to say no sooner had i spoken than master rodolph put his head across the little table we dined at the little table on the right hand of the room as you enter  go on  i am going on well he put his head across the little table and said to me in a low whisper cocking his oddlooking eye at the same time i tell you what essper you are a deuced sharp fellow and so giving a shake of his head and another wink of his eye he was quiet i smelt a rat but i did not begin to pump directly but after the third bottle rodolph said i with regard to your last observation for we had not spoken lately burgundy being too fat a wine for talking we are both of us sharp fellows i dare say now you and i are thinking of the same thing no doubt of it said rodolph and so sir he agreed to tell me what he was thinking of on condition that i should be equally frank afterwards well then he told me that there were sad goings on at turriparva  the deuce said the prince  let him tell his story said vivian  sad goings on at turriparva he wished that his highness would hunt more and attend less to politics and then he told me quite confidentially that his highness the prince and heaven knows how many other princes besides had leagued together and were going to dethrone the grand duke and that his master was to be made king and he master rodolph prime minister hearing all this and duly allowing for a tale over a bottle i made no doubt as i find to be the case that you good master were about to be led into some mischief and as i know that conspiracies are always unsuccessful i have done my best to save my master and i beseech you upon my knees to get out of the scrape as soon as you possibly can here essper george threw himself at vivians feet and entreated him to quit the house immediately  was ever anything so absurd and so mischievous ejaculated the prince and then he conversed with vivian for some time in a whisper essper at length vivian said you have committed one of the most perfect and most injurious blunders that you could possibly perpetrate the mischief which may result from your imprudent conduct is incalculable how long is it since you have thought proper to regulate your conduct on the absurd falsehoods of a drunken steward his highness and myself wish to consult in private but on no account leave the house now mind me if you leave this house without my permission you forfeit the little chance which remains of being retained in my service  where am i to go sir  stay in the passage  suppose here he imitated beckendorff comes to me  then open the door and come into this room  well said the prince when the door was at length shut one thing is quite clear he does not know who beckendorff is  so far satisfactory but i feel the force of your highness observations it is a most puzzling case to send him back to turriparva would be madness the whole affair would be immediately revealed over another bottle of burgundy with master rodolph in fact your highness visit would be a secret to no one in the country your host would be soon discovered and the evil consequences are incalculable i know no one to send him to at reisenburg and if i did it appears to me that the same objections equally apply to his proceeding to that city as to his returning to turriparva what is to be done surely some demon must have inspired him we cannot now request beckendorff to allow him to stay here and if we did i am convinced from his tone and manner that nothing could induce him to comply with our wish the only course to be pursued is certainly an annoying one but so far as i can judge it is the only mode by which very serious mischief can be prevented let me proceed forthwith to reisenburg with essper placed immediately under my eye and solemnly adjured by me to silence i think i can answer particularly when i give him a gentle hint of the station of beckendorff for his preserving the confidence with which it will now be our policy partially to entrust him it is to say the least awkward and distressing to leave you alone but what is to be done it does not appear that i can now be of any material service to you i have assisted you as much as and more than we could reasonably have supposed it would have been in my power to have done by throwing some light upon the character and situation of beckendorff with the clue to his conduct which my chance meeting with him yesterday morning has afforded us the only point for your highness to determine is as to the length of time you will resolve to wait for his communication as to your final agreement together with your highness settled views and decided purpose all the difficulty of negotiation will be on his side whatever my dear prince continued vivian with a significant voice and marked emphasis whatever my dear prince may be your secret wishes be assured that to attain them in your present negotiation you have only to be firm let nothing divert you from your purpose and the termination of this interview must be gratifying to you  the prince of little lilliput was very disinclined to part with his shrewd counsellor who had already done him considerable service and he strongly opposed vivians proposition his opposition however like that of most other persons was unaccompanied by any suggestion of his own and as both agreed that something must be done it of course ended in the prince being of opinion that vivians advice must be followed the prince was really much affected by this sudden and unexpected parting with one for whom though he had known him so short a time he began to entertain a sincere regard i owe you my life said the prince and perhaps more than my life and here we are about suddenly to part never to meet again i wish i could get you to make turriparva your home you should have your own suite of rooms your own horses your own servants and never feel for an instant that you were not master of all around you in truth continued the prince with great earnestness i wish my dear friend you would really think seriously of this you know you could visit vienna and even italy and yet return to me max would be delighted to see you he loves you already and sievers and his library would be at your command agree to my proposition dear friend  i cannot express to your highness how sensible i am of your kindness your friendship i sincerely value and shall never forget but i am too unhappy and unlucky a being to burden any one with my constant presence adieu or will you go with me to beckendorff  oh go with you by all means but said the prince taking a ruby ring of great antiquity off his finger i should feel happy if you would wear this for my sake  the prince was so much affected at the thoughts of parting with vivian that he could scarcely speak vivian accepted the ring with a cordiality which the kindhearted donor deserved and yet our hero unfortunately had had rather too much experience of the world not to be aware that most probably in less than another week his affectionate friend would not be able to recall his name under an hours recollection such are friends the moment that we are not at their side we are neglected and the moment that we die we are forgotten  they found mr beckendorff in his library in apprising mr beckendorff of his intention of immediately quitting his roof vivian did not omit to state the cause of his sudden departure these not only accounted for the abruptness of his movement but also gave beckendorff an opportunity of preventing its necessity by allowing essper to remain but the opportunity was not seized by mr beckendorff the truth was that gentleman had a particular wish to see vivian out of his house in allowing the prince of little lilliput to be attended during the interview by a friend beckendorff had prepared himself for the reception of some brawny jagd junker or some thickheaded chamberlain who he reckoned would act rather as an incumbrance than an aid to his opponent it was with great mortification therefore that he found him accompanied by a shrewd experienced wary and educated englishman a man like beckendorff soon discovered that vivian greys was no common mind his conversation with him of the last night had given him some notion of his powers and the moment that beckendorff saw essper george enter the house he determined that he should be the cause of vivian leaving it there was also another and weighty reason for mr beckendorff desiring that the prince of little lilliput should at this moment be left to himself  mr grey will ride on to reisenburg immediately said the prince and my dear friend you may depend upon having your luggage by the day after tomorrow i shall be at turriparva early tomorrow and it will be my first care  this was said in a loud voice and both gentlemen watched mr beckendorffs countenance as the information was given but no emotion was visible  well sir good morning to you said mr beckendorff i am sorry you are going had i known it sooner i would have given you a letter mr von philipson said beckendorff do me the favour of looking over that paper so saying mr beckendorff put some official report into the princes hand and while his highness attention was attracted by this sudden request mr beckendorff laid his finger on vivians arm and said in a lower tone i shall take care that you find a powerful friend at reisenburg     book vii   chapter i   as vivian left the room mr beckendorff was seized with an unusual desire to converse with the prince of little lilliput and his highness was consequently debarred the consolation of walking with his friend as far as the horses at the little gate vivian and essper encountered the only male attendant who was allowed to approach the house of mr beckendorff as vivian quietly walked his horse up the rough turf road he could not refrain from recurring to his conversation of the previous night and when he called to mind the adventures of the last six days he had new cause to wonder at and perhaps to lament over his singular fate in that short time he had saved the life of a powerful prince and being immediately signalled out without any exertion on his part as the object of that princes friendship the moment he arrives at his castle by a wonderful contingency he becomes the depositary of state secrets and assists in a consultation of importance with one of the most powerful ministers in europe and now the object of so much friendship confidence and honour he is suddenly on the road to the capital of the state of which his late host is the prime minister and his friend the chief subject without even the convenience of a common letter of introduction and with little prospect of viewing with even the usual advantages of a common traveller one of the most interesting of european courts  when he had proceeded about halfway up the turf lane he found a private road to his right which with that spirit of adventure for which englishmen are celebrated he immediately resolved must not only lead to reisenburg but also carry him to that city much sooner than the regular high road he had not advanced far up this road before he came to the gate at which he had parted with beckendorff on the morning that gentleman had roused him so unexpectedly from his reverie in a green lane he was surprised to find a horseman dismounting at the gate struck by this singular circumstance the appearance of the stranger was not unnoticed he was a tall and well proportioned man and as the traveller passed he stared vivian so fully in the face that our hero did not fail to remark his handsome countenance the expression of which however was rather vacant and unpleasing he was dressed in a ridingcoat exactly similar to the one always worn by beckendorffs messenger and had vivian not seen him so distinctly he would have mistaken him for that person the stranger was rather indifferently mounted and carried his cloak and a small portmanteau at the back of his saddle  i suppose it is the butler said essper george who now spoke for the first time since his dismissal from the room vivian did not answer him not because he entertained any angry feeling on account of his exceedingly unpleasant visit by no means it was impossible for a man like vivian grey to cherish an irritated feeling for a second but he did not exchange a syllable with essper george merely because he was not in the humour to speak he could not refrain from musing on the singular events of the last few days and above all the character of beckendorff particularly engrossed his meditation their conversation of the preceding night excited in his mind new feelings of wonder and revived emotions which he thought were dead or everlastingly dormant apparently the philosophy on which beckendorff had regulated his career and by which he had arrived at his pitch of greatness was exactly the same with which he himself vivian grey had started in life which he had found so fatal in its consequences which he believed to be so vain in its principles how was this what radical error had he committed it required little consideration thirty and more than thirty years had passed over the head of beckendorff ere the world felt his power or indeed was conscious of his existence a deep student not only of man in detail but of man in groups not only of individuals but of nations beckendorff had hived up his ample knowledge of all subjects which could interest his fellowcreatures and when that opportunity which in this world occurs to all men occurred to beckendorff he was prepared with acquirements equal to his genius beckendorff depended only upon himself and succeeded vivian grey with a mind inferior to no mans dashed on the stage in years a boy though in feelings a man brilliant as might have been his genius his acquirements necessarily were insufficient he could not depend only upon himself a consequent necessity arose to have recourse to the assistance of others to inspire them with feelings which they could not share and humour and manage the petty weaknesses which he himself could not experience his colleagues were at the same time to work for the gratification of their own private interests the most palpable of all abstract things and to carry into execution a great purpose which their feeble minds interested only by the first point cared not to comprehend the unnatural combination failed and its originator fell to believe that he could recur again to the hopes the feelings the pursuits of his boyhood he felt to be the vainest of delusions it was the expectation of a man like beckendorff whose career though difficult though hazardous had been uniformly successful of a man who mistook cares for grief and anxiety for sorrow  the travellers entered the city at sunset proceeding through an ancient and unseemly town full of long narrow and illpaved streets and black unevenly built houses they ascended the hill on the top of which was situated the new and residence town of reisenburg the proud palace the white squares the architectural streets the new churches the elegant opera house the splendid hotels and the gay public gardens full of busts vases and statues and surrounded by an iron railing cast out of the cannon taken from both sides during the war by the reisenburg troops and now formed into pikes and fasces glittering with gilded heads all these shining in the setting sun produced an effect which at any time and in any place would have been beautiful and striking but on the present occasion were still more so from the remarkable contrast they afforded to the ancient gloomy and filthy town through which vivian had just passed and where from the lowness of its situation the sun had already set there was as much difference between the old and new town of reisenburg as between the old barbarous margrave and the new and noble grand duke  on the second day after his arrival at reisenburg vivian received the following letter from the prince of little lilliput his luggage did not accompany the epistle  my dear friend  by the time you have received this i shall have returned to turriparva my visit to a certain gentleman was prolonged for one day i never can convey to you by words the sense i entertain of the value of your friendship and of your services i trust that time will afford me opportunities of testifying it by my actions i return home by the same road by which we came you remember how excellent the road was as indeed are all the roads in reisenburg that must be confessed by all i fear that the most partial admirers of the old régime cannot say as much for the convenience of travelling in the time of our fathers good roads are most excellent things and one of the first marks of civilisation and prosperity the emperor napoleon who it must be confessed had after all no common mind was celebrated for his roads you have doubtless admired the route napoleon on the rhine and if you travel into italy i am informed that you will be equally and even more struck by the passage over the simplon and the other italian roads reisenburg has certainly kept pace with the spirit of the time nobody can deny that and i confess to you that the more i consider the subject it appears to me that the happiness prosperity and content of a state are the best evidences of the wisdom and beneficent rule of a government many things are very excellent in theory which are quite the reverse in practice and even ludicrous and while we should do our most to promote the cause and uphold the interests of rational liberty still at the same time we should ever be on our guard against the crude ideas and revolutionary systems of those who are quite inexperienced in that sort of particular knowledge which is necessary for all statesmen nothing is so easy as to make things look fine on paper we should never forget that there is a great difference between highsounding generalities and laborious details is it reasonable to expect that men who have passed their lives dreaming in colleges and old musty studies should be at all calculated to take the head of affairs or know what measures those at the head of affairs ought to adopt i think not a certain personage who bythebye is one of the most clearheaded and most perfect men of business that i ever had the pleasure of being acquainted with a real practical man in short he tells me that professor skyrocket whom you will most likely see at reisenburg wrote an article in the military quarterly review which is published there on the probable expenses of a war between austria and prussia and forgot the commissariat altogether did you ever know anything so ridiculous what business have such fellows to meddle with affairs of state they should certainly be put down that i think none can deny a liberal spirit in government is certainly a most excellent thing but we must always remember that liberty may degenerate into licentiousness liberty is certainly an excellent thing that all admit but as a certain person very well observed so is physic and yet it is not to be given at all times but only when the frame is in a state to require it people may be as unprepared for a wise and discreet use of liberty as a vulgar person may be for the management of a great estate unexpectedly inherited there is a great deal in this and in my opinion there are cases in which to force liberty down a peoples throat is presenting them not with a blessing but a curse i shall send your luggage on immediately it is very probable that i may be in town at the end of the week for a short time i wish much to see and to consult you and therefore hope that you will not leave reisenburg before you see  your faithful and obliged friend  little lilliput  two days after the receipt of this letter essper george ran into the room with a much less solemn physiognomy than he had thought proper to assume since his masters arrival at reisenburg  lord sir whom do you think i have just met  whom asked vivian with eagerness for as is always the case when such questions are asked us he was thinking of every person in the world except the right one it might be  to think that i should see him continued essper  it is a man then thought vivian who is it at once essper  i thought you would not guess sir it will quite cure you to hear it master rodolph  master rodolph  ay and theres great news in the wind  which of course you have confidentially extracted from him pray let us have it  the prince of little lilliput is coming to reisenburg said essper  well i had some idea of that before said vivian  oh then you know it all sir i suppose said essper with a look of great disappointment  i know nothing more than i have mentioned said his master  what do you not know sir that the prince has come over that he is going to live at court and be heaven knows what that he is to carry a staff every day before the grand duke at dinner does not my master know that  i know nothing of all this and so tell me in plain german what the case is  well then continued essper i suppose you do not know that his highness the prince is to be his excellency the grand marshal that unfortunate but principal officer of state having received his dismissal yesterday they are coming up immediately not a moment is to be lost which seems to me very odd master rodolph is arranging everything and he has this morning purchased from his masters predecessor his palace furniture wines and pictures in short his whole establishment the late grand marshal consoling himself for his loss of office and revenging himself on his successor by selling him his property at a hundred per cent profit however master rodolph seems quite contented with his bargain and your luggage is come sir his highness the prince will be in town at the end of the week and all the men are to be put in new livery mr arnelm is to be his highness chamberlain and von neuwied master of the horse so you see sir you were right and that old puss in boots was no traitor after all upon my soul i did not much believe you sir until i heard all this good news     chapter ii   about a week after his arrival at reisenburg as vivian was at breakfast the door opened and mr sievers entered  i did not think that our next meeting would be in this city said mr sievers smiling  his highness of course informed me of your arrival said vivian as he greeted him cordially  you i understand are the diplomatist whom i am to thank for finding myself again at reisenburg let me at the same time express my gratitude for your kind offices to me and congratulate you on the brilliancy of your talents for negotiation little did i think when i was giving you the other day an account of mr beckendorff that the information would have been of such service to you  i am afraid you have nothing to thank me for though certainly had the office of arranging the terms between the parties devolved on me my first thoughts would have been for a gentleman for whom i have so much regard and respect as mr sievers  sir i feel honoured you already speak like a finished courtier pray what is to be your office  i fear mr beckendorff will not resign in my favour and my ambition is so exalted that i cannot condescend to take anything under the premiership  you are not to be tempted by a grand marshalship said mr sievers you hardly expected when you were at turriparva to witness such a rapid termination of the patriotism of our good friend i think you said you have seen him since your arrival the interview must have been piquant  not at all i immediately congratulated him on the judicious arrangements which had been concluded and to relieve his awkwardness took some credit to myself for having partially assisted in bringing about the result the subject was not again mentioned and i dare say never will be  it is a curious business said sievers the prince is a man who rather than have given me up to the grand duke me with whom he was not connected and who of my own accord sought his hospitality sooner i repeat than have delivered me up he would have had his castle razed to the ground and fifty swords through his heart and yet without the slightest compunction has this same man deserted with the greatest coolness the party of which ten days ago he was the zealous leader how can you account for this except it be as i have long suspected that in politics there positively is no feeling of honour every one is conscious that not only himself but his colleagues and his rivals are working for their own private purpose and that however a party may apparently be assisting in bringing about a result of common benefit that nevertheless and in fact each is conscious that he is the tool of another with such an understanding treason is an expected affair and the only point to consider is who shall be so unfortunate as to be the deserted instead of the deserter it is only fair to his highness to state that beckendorff gave him incontestable evidence that he had had a private interview with every one of the mediatised princes they were the dupes of the wily minister in these negotiations he became acquainted with their plans and characters and could estimate the probability of their success the golden bribe which was in turn dandled before the eyes of all had been always reserved for the most powerful our friend his secession and the consequent desertion of his relatives destroy the party for ever while at the same time that party have not even the consolation of a good conscience to uphold them in their adversity but feel that in case of their clamour or of any attempt to stir up the people by their hollow patriotism it is in the power of the minister to expose and crush them for ever  all this said vivian makes me the more rejoice that our friend has got out of their clutches he will make an excellent grand marshal and you must not forget my dear sir that he did not forget you to tell you the truth although i did not flatter myself that i should benefit during my stay at reisenburg by his influence i am not the least surprised at the termination of our visit to mr beckendorff i have seen too many of these affairs not to have been quite aware the whole time that it would require very little trouble and very few sacrifices on the part of mr beckendorff to quash the whole cabal bythebye our visit to him was highly amusing he is a singular man  he has had nevertheless said sievers a difficult part to play had it not been for you the prince would have perhaps imagined that he was only trifling with him again and terminated the interview abruptly and in disgust having brought the grand duke to terms and having arranged the interview beckendorff of course imagined that all was finished the very day that you arrived at his house he had received despatches from his royal highness recalling his promise and revoking beckendorffs authority to use his unlimited discretion in this business the difficulty then was to avoid discussion with the prince with whom he was not prepared to negotiate and at the same time without letting his highness out of his sight to induce the grand duke to resume his old view of the case the first night that you were there beckendorff rode up to reisenburg saw the grand duke was refused through the intrigues of madame carolina the requested authority and resigned his power when he was a mile on his return he was summoned back to the palace and his royal highness asked as a favour from his tutor fourandtwenty hours consideration this beckendorff granted on the condition that in case the grand duke assented to the terms proposed his royal highness should himself be the bearer of the proposition and that there should be no more written promises to recall and no more written authorities to revoke the terms were hard but beckendorff was inflexible on the second night of your visit a messenger arrived with a despatch advising beckendorff of the intended arrival of his royal highness on the next morning the ludicrous intrusion of your amusing servant prevented you from being present at the great interview in which i understand beckendorff for the moment laid aside all his caprices our friend acted with great firmness and energy he would not be satisfied even with the personal pledge and written promise of the grand duke but demanded that he should receive the seals of office within a week so that had the court not been sincere his situation with his former party would not have been injured it is astonishing how very acute even a dull man is when his own interests are at stake had his highness been the agent of another person he would probably have committed many blunders have made disadvantageous terms or perhaps have been thoroughly duped selfinterest is the finest eyewater  and what says madame carolina to all this  oh according to custom she has changed already and thinks the whole business admirably arranged his highness is her grand favourite and my little pupil max her pet i think however on the whole the boy is fondest of the grand duke whom if you remember he was always informing you in confidence that he intended to assassinate and as for your obedient servant said sievers bowing here am i once more the aristarchus of her coterie her friends bythebye view the accession of the prince with no pleased eyes and anticipating that his juncture with the minister is only a prelude to their final dispersion they are compensating for the approaching termination of their career by unusual violence and fresh fervour stinging like mosquitoes before a storm conscious of their impending destruction from the clearance of the atmosphere as for myself i have nothing more to do with them liberty and philosophy are fine words but until i find men are prepared to cultivate them both in a wiser spirit i shall remain quiet i have no idea of being banished and imprisoned because a parcel of knaves are making a vile use of the truths which i disseminate in my opinion philosophers have said enough now let men act but all this time i have forgotten to ask you how you like reisenburg  i can hardly say with the exception of yesterday when i rode max round the ramparts i have not been once out of the hotel but today i feel so well that if you are disposed for a lounge i should like it above all things  i am quite at your service but i must not forget that i am the bearer of a missive to you from his excellency the grand marshal you are invited to join the court dinner today and be presented  really my dear sir an invalid  well if you do not like it you must make your excuses to him but it really is the pleasantest way of commencing your acquaintance at court and only allowed to distingués among which as you are the friend of the new grand marshal you are of course considered no one is petted so much as a political apostate except perhaps a religious one so at present we are all in high feather you had better dine at the palace today everything quite easy and by an agreeable relaxation of state neither swords bags nor trains are necessary have you seen the palace i suppose not we will look at it and then call on the prince  the gentlemen accordingly left the hotel and proceeding down the principal street of the new town they came into a large square or place darmes a couple of regiments of infantry were exercising in it  a specimen of our standing army said sievers in the war time this little state brought thirty thousand highlydisciplined and wellappointed troops into the field this efficient contingent was at the same time the origin of our national prosperity and our national debt for we have a national debt sir i assure you we are proud of it and consider it the most decided sign of being a great people our force in times of peace is of course much reduced we have however still eight thousand men who are perfectly unnecessary the most curious thing is that to keep up the patronage of the court and please the nobility though we have cut down our army twothirds we have never reduced the number of our generals and so at this moment among our eight thousand men we count about forty general officers being one to every two hundred privates we have however which perhaps you would not suspect one military genius among our multitude of heroes the count von sohnspeer is worthy of being one of napoleons marshals who he is no one exactly knows some say an illegitimate son of beckendorff certain it is that he owes his nobility to his sword and as certain it is that he is to be counted among the very few who share the ministers confidence von sohnspeer has certainly performed a thousand brilliant exploits yet in my opinion the not least splendid day of his life was that of the battle of leipsic he was on the side of the french and fought against the allies with desperate fury when he saw that all was over and the allies triumphant calling out germany for ever he dashed against his former friends and captured from the flying gauls a hundred pieces of cannon he hastened to the tent of the emperors with his bloodred sword in his hand and at the same time congratulated them on the triumph of their cause and presented them with his hardearned trophies the manoeuvre was perfectly successful and the troops of reisenburg complimented as true germans were pitied for their former unhappy fate in being forced to fight against their fatherland and were immediately enrolled in the allied army as such they received a due share of all the plunder he is a grand genius young master von sohnspeer  decidedly worthy of being a companion of the fighting bastards of the middle ages this is a fine square  very grand indeed precedents for some of the architectural combinations could hardly be found at athens or rome nevertheless the general effect is magnificent do you admire this plan of making every elevation of an order consonant with the purpose of the building see for instance on the opposite side of the square is the palace the corinthian order which is evident in all its details suits well the character of the structure it accords with royal pomp and elegance with fêtes and banquets and interior magnificence on the other hand what a happy contrast is afforded to this gorgeous structure by the severe simplicity of this tuscan palace of justice the school of arts in the farthest corner of the square is properly entered through an ionic portico let us go into the palace here not only does our monarch reside but an arrangement which i much admire here are deposited in a gallery worthy of the treasures it contains our superb collection of pictures they are the private property of his royal highness but as is usually the case under despotic princes the people equally his property are flattered by the collection being styled the public gallery  the hour of the court dinner at reisenburg was two oclock about which time in england a man first remembers the fatal necessity of shaving though bythebye this allusion is not a very happy one for in this country shaving is a ceremony at present somewhat obsolete at two oclock however our hero accompanying the grand marshal and mr sievers reached the palace in the saloon were assembled various guests chiefly attached to the court immediately after the arrival of our party the grand duke and madame carolina followed by their chamberlains and ladies in waiting entered the little prince maximilian strutted in between his royal highness and his fair consort having hold of a hand of each the urchin was much changed in appearance since vivian first saw him he was dressed in the complete uniform of a captain of the royal guards having been presented with a commission on the day of his arrival at court a brilliant star glittered on his scarlet coat and paled the splendour of his golden epaulettes the duties however of the princely captain were at present confined to the pleasing exertion of carrying the bonbon box of madame carolina the contents of which were chiefly reserved for his own gratification in the grand duke vivian was not surprised to recognise the horseman whom he had met in the private road on the morning of his departure from mr beckendorffs his conversation with sievers had prepared him for this madame carolina was in appearance parisian of the highest order that is to say an exquisite figure and an indescribable tournure an invisible foot a countenance full of esprit and intelligence without a single regular feature and large and very bright black eyes madames hair was of the same colour and arranged in the most effective manner her cashmere would have graced the feast of roses and so engrossed your attention that it was long before you observed the rest of her costume in which however traces of a creative genius were immediately visible in short madame carolina was not fashionable but fashion herself in a subsequent chapter at a ball which we have in preparation we will make up for this brief notice of her costume by publishing her court dress for the sake of our fair readers however we will not pass over the ornament in her hair the comb which supported her elaborate curls was invisible except at each end whence it threw out a large psyches wing of golden web the eyes of which were formed of rubies encircled with turquoises  the royal party made a progress round the circle madame carolina first presented her delicate and faintlyrouged cheek to the humpbacked crown prince who scarcely raised his eyes from the ground as he performed the accustomed courtesy one or two royal relatives who were on a visit at the palace were honoured by the same compliment the grand duke bowed graciously and gracefully to every individual and his lady accompanied the bow by a speech which was at the same time personal and piquant the first great duty of a monarch is to know how to bow skilfully nothing is more difficult and nothing more important a royal bow may often quell a rebellion and sometimes crush a conspiracy it should at the same time be both general and individual equally addressed to the company assembled and to every single person in the assembly our own sovereign bows to perfection his bow is eloquent and will always render an oration on his part unnecessary which is a great point for harangues are not regal nothing is more undignified than to make a speech it is from the first an acknowledgment that you are under the necessity of explaining or conciliating or convincing or confuting in short that you are not omnipotent but opposed  the bow of the grand duke of reisenburg was a firstrate bow and always produced a great sensation with the people particularly if it were followed up by a proclamation for a public fête or fireworks then his royal highness popularity was at its height but madame carolina after having by a few magic sentences persuaded the whole room that she took a peculiar interest in the happiness of every individual present has reached vivian who stood next to his friend the grand marshal he was presented by that great officer and received most graciously for a moment the room thought that his royal highness was about to speak but he only smiled madame carolina however said a great deal and stood not less than sixty seconds complimenting the english nation and particularly the specimen of that celebrated people who now had the honour of being presented to her no one spoke more in a given time than madame carolina and as while the eloquent words fell from her deep red lips her bright eyes were invariably fixed on those of the person she addressed what she did say as invariably was very effective vivian had only time to give a nod of recognition to his friend max for the company arminarm now formed into a procession to the dining saloon vivian was parted from the grand marshal who as the highest officer of state present followed immediately after the grand duke our heros companion was mr sievers although it was not a state dinner the party from being swelled by the suites of the royal visitors was numerous and as the court occupied the centre of the table vivian was too distant to listen to the conversation of madame who however he well perceived from the animation of her countenance was delighted and delighting the grand duke spoke little but listened like a lover of three days to the accents of his accomplished consort the arrangement of a german dinner promotes conversation the numerous dishes are at once placed upon the table and when the curious eye has well examined their contents the whole dinner untouched disappears although this circumstance is rather alarming to a novice his terror soon gives place to selfcongratulation when he finds the banquet reappear each dish completely carved and cut up  not being sunday said mr sievers there is no opera tonight we are to meet again i believe at the palace in a few hours at madame carolinas soirée in the meantime you had better accompany his excellency to the public gardens that is the fashionable drive i shall go home and smoke a pipe  the circle of the public gardens of reisenburg exhibited exactly although upon a smaller scale the same fashions and the same frivolities the same characters and the same affectations as the hyde park of london or the champs elysées of paris the prater of vienna the corso of rome or milan or the cascine of florence there was the female leader of ton hated by her own sex and adored by the other and ruling both ruling both by the same principle of action and by the influence of the same quality which creates the arbitress of fashion in all countries by courage to break through the conventional customs of an artificial class and by talents to ridicule all those who dare follow her innovating example attracting universal notice by her own singularity and at the same time conciliating the support of those from whom she dares to differ by employing her influence in preventing others from violating their laws the arbitress of fashion is one who is allowed to be singular in order that she may suppress singularity she is exempted from all laws but by receiving the dictatorship she ensures the despotism then there was that mysterious being whose influence is perhaps even more surprising than the dominion of the female despot of manners for she wields a power which can be analysed and comprehended i mean the male authority in coats cravats and chargers who without fortune and without rank and sometimes merely through the bold obtrusion of a fantastic taste becomes the glass of fashion in which even royal dukes and the most aristocratic nobles hasten to adjust themselves and the mould by which the ingenious youth of a whole nation is enthusiastically formed there is a brummell in every country  vivian who after a round or two with the grand marshal had mounted max was presented by the young count von bernstorff the son of the grand chamberlain to whose care he had been specially commended by the prince to the lovely countess von s the examination of this high authority was rigid and her report satisfactory when vivian quitted the side of her britzska half a dozen dandies immediately rode up to learn the result and on being informed they simultaneously cantered up to young von bernstorff and requested to have the honour of being introduced to his highlyinteresting friend all these exquisites wore white hats lined with crimson in consequence of the head of the allinfluential emilius von aslingen having on the preceding day been kept sacred from the profaning air by that most tasteful covering the young lords were loud in their commendations of this latest evidence of von aslingens happy genius and rallied with unmerciful spirit the unfortunate von bernstorff for not having yet mounted the allperfect chapeau like all von aslingens introductions it was as remarkable for good taste as for striking singularity they had no doubt it would have a great run exactly the style of thing for a hot autumn and it suited so admirably with the claretcoloured riding coat which madame considered von aslingens chefdoeuvre inimitable von aslingen as they were in these raptures to vivians delight and to their dismay the object of their admiration appeared our hero was of course anxious to see so interesting a character but he could scarcely believe that he in fact beheld the ingenious introducer of white and crimson hats and the still happier inventor of those chefdoeuvres claretcoloured riding coats when his attention was directed to a horseman who wore a peculiarly high heavy black hat and a frogged and furred frock buttoned up although it was a most sultry day to his very nose how singular is the slavery of fashion notwithstanding their mortification the unexpected costume of von aslingen appeared only to increase the young lords admiration of his character and accomplishments and instead of feeling that he was an insolent pretender whose fame originated in his insulting their tastes and existed only by their sufferance all cantered away with the determination of wearing on the next day even if it were to cost them each a calenture furs enough to keep a man warm during a winter party at st petersburg not that winter parties ever take place there on the contrary before the winter sets in the court moves on to moscow which from its situation and its climate will always in fact continue the real capital of russia  the royal carriage drawn by six horses and backed by three men servants who would not have disgraced the fairy equipage of cinderella has now left the gardens     chapter iii   madame carolina held her soirée in her own private apartments the grand duke himself appearing in the capacity of a visitor the company was numerous and brilliant his royal highness surrounded by a select circle dignified one corner of the saloon madame carolina at the other end of the room in the midst of poets philosophers and politicians in turn decided upon the most interesting and important topics of poetry philosophy and politics boston and zwicken and whist interested some and puzzles and other ingenious games others a few were above conversing or gambling or guessing superior intelligences who would neither be interested nor amused among these emilius von aslingen was most prominent he leant against a door in full uniform with his vacant eyes fixed on no object the others were only awkward copies of an easy original and among these stiff or stretching lounging on a chaiselounge or posted against the wall vivians quick eye recognised more than one of the unhappy votaries of white hats lined with crimson  when vivian made his bow to the grand duke he was surprised by his royal highness coming forward a few steps from the surrounding circle and extending to him his hand his royal highness continued conversing with him for upwards of a quarter of an hour expressed the great pleasure he felt at seeing at his court a gentleman of whose abilities he had the highest opinion and after a variety of agreeable compliments compliments are doubly agreeable from crowned heads the grand duke retired to a game of boston with his royal visitors vivians reception made a sensation through the room various rumours were immediately afloat  who can he be  dont you know oh most curious story killed a boar as big as a bonasus which was ravaging half reisenburg and saved the lives of his excellency the grand marshal and his whole suite  what is that about the grand marshal and a boar as big as a bonasus quite wrong natural son of beckendorff know it for a fact dont you see he is being introduced to von sohnspeer brothers you know managed the whole business about the leagued princes not a son of beckendorff only a particular friend the son of the late general i forget his name exactly killed at leipsic you know that famous general what was his name that very famous general dont you remember never mind well he is his son father particular friend of beckendorff college friend brought up the orphan very handsome of him they say he does handsome things sometimes  ah well ive heard so too and so this young man is to be the new undersecretary very much approved by the countess von s  no it cant be your story is quite wrong he is an englishman  an englishman no  yes he is i had it from madame high rank incog going to vienna secret mission  something to do with greece of course independence recognised  oh certainly pay a tribute to the porte and governed by a hospodar admirable arrangement have to support their own government and a foreign one besides  it was with pleasure that vivian at length observed mr sievers enter the room and extricating himself from the enlightened and enthusiastic crowd who were disserting round the tribunal of madame he hastened to his amusing friend  ah my dear sir how glad i am to see you i have since we met last been introduced to your fashionable ruler and some of her most fashionable slaves i have been honoured by a long conversation with his royal highness and have listened to some of the most eloquent of the carolina coterie what a babel there all are at the same time talkers and listeners to what a pitch of perfection may the science of conversation be carried my mind teems with original ideas to which i can annex no definite meaning what a variety of contradictory theories which are all apparently sound i begin to suspect that there is a great difference between reasoning and reason  your suspicion is well founded my dear sir said mr sievers and i know no circumstance which would sooner prove it than listening for a few minutes to this little man in a snuffcoloured coat near me but i will save you from so terrible a demonstration he has been endeavouring to catch my eye these last ten minutes and i have as studiously avoided seeing him let us move  willingly who may this fearinspiring monster be  a philosopher said mr sievers as most of us call ourselves here that is to say his profession is to observe the course of nature and if by chance he can discover any slight deviation of the good dame from the path which our ignorance has marked out as her only track he claps his hands cries greek euraeka and is dubbed illustrious on the spot such is the worlds reward for a great discovery which generally in a twelvemonths time is found out to be a blunder of the philosopher and not an eccentricity of nature i am not underrating those great men who by deep study or rather by some mysterious inspiration have produced combinations and effected results which have materially assisted the progress of civilisation and the security of our happiness no no to them be due adoration would that the reverence of posterity could be some consolation to these great spirits for neglect and persecution when they lived i have invariably observed of great natural philosophers that if they lived in former ages they were persecuted as magicians and in periods which profess to be more enlightened they have always been ridiculed as quacks the succeeding century the real quack arises he adopts and develops the suppressed and despised and forgotten discovery of his unfortunate predecessor and fame trumpets this resurrectionman of science with as loud a blast of rapture as if instead of being merely the accidental animator of the corpse he were the cunning artist himself who had devised and executed the miraculous machinery which the other had only wound up  but in this country said vivian surely you have no reason to complain of the want of moral philosophers or of the respect paid to them the country of kant of   yes yes we have plenty of metaphysicians if you mean them watch that livelylooking gentleman who is stuffing kalte schale so voraciously in the corner the leader of the idealists a pupil of the celebrated fichte to gain an idea of his character know that he outherods his master and fichte is to kant what kant is to the unenlightened vulgar you can now form a slight conception of the spiritual nature of our friend who is stuffing kalte schale the first principle of his school is to reject all expressions which incline in the slightest degree to substantiality existence is in his opinion a word too absolute being principle essence are terms scarcely sufficiently ethereal even to indicate the subtile shadowings of his opinions some say that he dreads the contact of all real things and that he makes it the study of his life to avoid them matter is his great enemy when you converse with him you lose all consciousness of this world my dear sir continued mr sievers observe how exquisitely nature revenges herself upon these capricious and fantastic children believe me nature is the most brilliant of wits and that no repartees that were ever inspired by hate or wine or beauty ever equalled the calm effects of her indomitable power upon those who are rejecting her authority you understand me methinks that the best answer to the idealism of m fichte is to see his pupil devouring kalte schale  and this is really one of your great lights  verily his works are the most famous and the most unreadable in all germany surely you have heard of his treatise on man a treatise on a subject in which everyone is interested written in a style which no one can understand  you think then said vivian that posterity may rank the german metaphysicians with the later platonists  i hardly know they are a body of men not less acute but i doubt whether they will be as celebrated in this age of print notoriety is more attainable than in the age of manuscript but lasting fame certainly is not that tall thin man in black that just bowed to me is the editor of one of our great reisenburg reviews the journal he edits is one of the most successful periodical publications ever set afloat among its contributors may assuredly be classed many men of eminent talents yet to their abilities the surprising success and influence of this work is scarcely to be ascribed it is the result rather of the consistent spirit which has always inspired its masterly critiques one principle has ever regulated its management it is a simple rule but an effective one every author is reviewed by his personal enemy you may imagine the point of the critique but you would hardly credit if i were to inform you the circulation of the review you will tell me that you are not surprised and talk of the natural appetite of our species for malice and slander be not too quick the rival of this review both in influence and in sale is conducted on as simple a principle but not a similar one in this journal every author is reviewed by his personal friend of course perfect panegyric each number is flattering as a lovers tale every article an eloge what say you to this these are the influential literary and political journals of reisenburg there was yet another it was edited by an eloquent scholar all its contributors were at the same time brilliant and profound it numbered among its writers some of the most celebrated names in germany its critiques and articles were as impartial as they were able as sincere as they were sound it never paid the expense of the first number as philanthropists and admirers of our species my dear sir these are gratifying results they satisfactorily demonstrate that mankind have no innate desire for scandal calumny and backbiting it only proves that they have an innate desire to be gulled and deceived  and who is that said vivian  that is von chronicle our great historical novelist when i first came to reisenburg now eight years ago the popular writer of fiction was a man the most probable of whose numerous romances was one in which the hero sold his shadow to a demon over the dicebox then married an unknown woman in a churchyard afterwards wedded a river nymph and having committed bigamy finally stabbed himself to enable his first wife to marry his own father he and his works are quite obsolete and the star of his genius with those of many others has paled before the superior brilliancy of that literary comet mr von chronicle according to von chronicle we have all for a long time been under a mistake we have ever considered that the first point to be studied in novel writing is character miserable error it is costume variety of incident novelty and nice discrimination of character interest of story and all those points which we have hitherto looked upon as necessary qualities of a fine novel vanish before the superior attractions of variety of dresses exquisite descriptions of the cloak of a signer or the trunkhose of a serving man  amuse yourself while you are at reisenburg by turning over some volumes which every one is reading von chronicles last great historical novel the subject is a magnificent one rienzi yet it is strange that the hero only appears in the first and the last scenes you look astonished ah i see you are not a great historical novelist you forget the effect which is produced by the contrast of the costume of master nicholas the notary in the quarter of the jews and that of rienzi the tribune in his robe of purple at his coronation in the capitol conceive the effect the contrast with that coronation von chronicles novel terminates for as he well observes after that what is there in the career of rienzi which would afford matter for the novelist nothing all that afterwards occurs is a mere contest of passions and a development of character but where is a procession a triumph or a marriage  one of von chronicles great characters in this novel is a cardinal it was only last night that i was fortunate enough to have the beauties of the work pointed out to me by the author himself he entreated and gained my permission to read to me what he himself considered the great scene i settled myself in my chair took out my handkerchief and prepared my mind for the worst while i was anticipating the terrors of a heroine he introduced me to his cardinal thirty pages were devoted to the description of the prelates costume although clothed in purple still by a skilful adjustment of the drapery von chronicle managed to bring in six other petticoats i thought this beginning would never finish but to my surprise when he had got to the seventh petticoat he shut his book and leaning over the table asked me what i thought of his great scene my friend said i you are not only the greatest historical novelist that ever lived but that ever will live  i shall certainly get rienzi said vivian it seems to me to be an original work  von chronicle tells me that he looks upon it as his masterpiece and that it may be considered as the highest point of perfection to which his system of novelwriting can be carried not a single name is given in the work down even to the rabble for which he has not contemporary authority but what he is particularly proud of are his oaths nothing he tells me has cost him more trouble than the management of the swearing and the romans you know are a most profane nation the great difficulty to be avoided was using the ejaculations of two different ages the sblood of the sixteenth century must not be confounded with the zounds of the seventeenth enough of von chronicle the most amusing thing continued mr sievers is to contrast this mode of writing works of fiction with the prevalent and fashionable method of writing works of history contrast the rienzi of von chronicle with the haroun al raschid of madame carolina here we write novels like history and history like novels all our facts are fancy and all our imagination reality so saying mr sievers rose and wishing vivian good night quitted the room he was one of those prudent geniuses who always leave off with a point  mr sievers had not left vivian more than a minute when the little prince maximilian came up and bowed to him in a condescending manner our hero who had not yet had an opportunity of speaking with him thanked him cordially for his handsome present and asked him how he liked the court  oh delightful i pass all my time with the grand duke and madame and here the young apostate settled his military stock and arranged the girdle of his sword madame carolina continued he has commanded me to inform you that she desires the pleasure of your attendance  the summons was immediately obeyed and vivian had the honour of a long conversation with the interesting consort of the grand duke he was for a considerable time complimented by her enthusiastic panegyric of england her original ideas of the character and genius of lord byron her veneration for sir humphry davy and her admiration of sir walter scott not remiss was vivian in paying in his happiest manner due compliments to the fair and royal authoress of the court of charlemagne while she spoke his native tongue he admired her accurate english and while she professed to have derived her imperfect knowledge of his perfect language from a study of its best authors she avowed her belief of the impossibility of ever speaking it correctly without the assistance of a native conversation became more interesting  when vivian left the palace he was not unmindful of an engagement to return there the next day to give a first lesson in english pronunciation to madame carolina    chapter iv   vivian duly kept his appointment with madame carolina the chamberlain ushered him into a library where madame carolina was seated at a large table covered with books and manuscripts her costume and her countenance were equally engaging fascination was alike in her smile and her sash her bow and her buckle what a delightful pupil to perfect in english pronunciation madame pointed with a pride pleasing to vivians feelings as an englishman to her shelves graced with the most eminent of english writers madame carolina was not like one of those admirers of english literature whom you often meet on the continent people who think that beatties minstrel is our most modern and fashionable poem that the night thoughts is the masterpiece of our literature and that richardson is our only novelist oh no madame carolina would not have disgraced may fair she knew childe harold by rote and had even peeped into don juan her admiration of the edinburgh and quarterly reviews was great and similar to a continental liberal indeed even the toryism of the quarterly is philosophy and not an undersecretary ever yet massacred a radical innovator without giving loose to some sentiments and sentences which are considered rank treason in the meridian of vienna  after some conversation in which madame evinced eagerness to gain details about the persons and manners of our most eminent literary characters she naturally began to speak of the literary productions of other countries and in short ere an hour was passed vivian grey instead of giving a lesson in english pronunciation to the consort of the grand duke of reisenburg found himself listening in an easychair and with folded arms to a long treatise by that lady de lesprit de conversation it was a most brilliant dissertation her kindness in reading it to him was most particular nevertheless for unexpected blessings we are not always sufficiently grateful  another hour was consumed by the treatise how she refined what unexpected distinctions what exquisite discrimination of national character what skilful eulogium of her own nothing could be more splendid than her elaborate character of a repartee it would have sufficed for an epic poem at length madame carolina ceased de lesprit de conversation and vivian was successful in concealing his weariness and in testifying his admiration the evil is over thought he i may as well gain credit for my good taste the lesson in english pronunciation however was not yet terminated madame was charmed with our heros uncommon discrimination and extraordinary talents he was the most skilful and the most agreeable critic with whom she had ever been acquainted how invaluable must the opinion of such a person be to her on her great work no one had yet seen a line of it but there are moments when we are irresistibly impelled to seek a confidant that confidant was before her the morocco case was unlocked and the manuscript of haroun al raschid revealed to the enraptured eye of vivian grey  i flatter myself said madame carolina that this work will create a great sensation not only in germany it abounds i think with interesting story engaging incidents and animated and effective descriptions i have not of course been able to obtain any new matter respecting his sublimity the caliph between ourselves i do not think this very important so far as i have observed we have matter enough in this world on every possible subject already it is manner in which the literature of all nations is deficient it appears to me that the great point for persons of genius now to direct their attention to is the expansion of matter this i conceive to be the great secret and this must be effected by the art of picturesque writing for instance my dear mr grey i will open the arabian nights entertainments merely for an exemplification at the one hundred and eightyfifth night good let us attend to the following passage  in the reign of the caliph haroun al raschid there was at bagdad a druggist called alboussan ebn thaher a very rich handsome man he had more wit and politeness than people of his profession ordinarily have his integrity sincerity and jovial humour made him beloved and sought after by all sorts of people the caliph who knew his merit had entire confidence in him he had so great an esteem for him that he entrusted him with the care to provide his favourite ladies with all the things they stood in need of he chose for them their clothes furniture and jewels with admirable taste his good qualities and the favour of the caliph made the sons of emirs and other officers of the first rank be always about him his house was the rendezvous of all the nobility of the court  what capabilities lurk in this dry passage exclaimed madame carolina i touch it with my pen and transform it into a chapter it shall be one of those that i will read to you the description of alboussan alone demands ten pages there is no doubt that his countenance was oriental the tale says that he was handsome i paint him with his eastern eye his thin arched brow his fragrant beard his graceful mustachio the tale says he was rich i have authorities for the costume of men of his dignity in contemporary writers in my history he appears in an upper garment of green velvet and loose trousers of pink satin a jewelled dagger lies in his golden girdle his slippers are of the richest embroidery and he never omits the bath of roses daily on this system which in my opinion elicits truth for by it you are enabled to form a conception of the manners of the age on this system i proceed throughout the paragraph conceive my account of his house being the rendezvous of all the nobility of the court what a brilliant scene what variety of dress and character what splendour what luxury what magnificence imagine the detail of the banquet which by the bye gives me an opportunity of inserting after the manner of your own gibbon a dissertation on sherbet what think you of the art of picturesque writing  admirable said vivian von chronicle himself  how can you mention the name of that odious man almost shrieked madame carolina forgetting the dignity of her semiregal character in the jealous feelings of the author how can you mention him a scribbler without a spark not only of genius but even of common invention a miserable fellow who seems to do nothing but clothe and amplify in his own fantastic style the details of a parcel of old chronicles  madames indignation reminded vivian of a true but rather vulgar proverb of his own country and he extricated himself from his very awkward situation with a dexterity worthy of his former years  von chronicle himself said vivian von chronicle himself as i was going to observe will be the most mortified of all on the appearance of your work he cannot be so blinded by selfconceit as to fail to observe that your history is a thousand times more interesting than his fiction ah madame if you can thus spread enchantment over the hitherto weary page of history what must be your work of imagination     chapter v   vivian met emilius von aslingen in his ride through the gardens as that distinguished personage at present patronised the english nation and astounded the reisenburg natives by driving an english mail riding english horses and ruling english grooms he deigned to be exceedingly courteous to our hero whom he had publicly declared at the soirée of the preceding night to be very good style such a character from such a man raised vivian even more in the estimation of the reisenburg world than his flattering reception by the grand duke and his cordial greeting by madame carolina  shall you be at the grand marshals tonight asked vivian  ah that is the new man the man who was mediatised is not it  the prince of little lilliput  yes drawled out mr von aslingen i shall go if i have courage enough but they say his servants wear skins and he has got a tail  the ballroom was splendidly illuminated the whole of the royal family was present and did honour to their new officer of state his royal highness all smiles and his consort all diamonds stars and uniforms ribbons and orders abounded the diplomatic body wore the dresses of their respective courts emilius von aslingen having given out in the morning that he should appear as a captain in the royal guards the young lords and fops of fashion were consequently ultra military they were not a little annoyed when late in the evening their model lounged in wearing the rich scarlet uniform of a knight of malta of which newlyrevived order von aslingen who had served half a campaign against the turks was a member  the royal family had arrived only a few minutes dancing had not yet commenced vivian was at the top of the room honoured by the notice of madame carolina who complained of his yesterdays absence from the palace suddenly the universal hum and buzz which are always sounding in a crowded room were stilled and all present arrested in their conversation and pursuits stood with their heads turned towards the great door thither also vivian looked and wonderstruck beheldmr beckendorff his singular appearance for with the exception of his cavalry boots he presented the same figure as when he first came forward to receive the prince of little lilliput and vivian on the lawn immediately attracted universal attention but in this crowded room there were few who either from actual experience or accurate information were not ignorant that this personage was the prime minister the report spread like wildfire even the etiquette of a german ballroom honoured as it was by the presence of the court was no restraint to the curiosity and wonder of all present yes even emilius von aslingen raised his glass to his eye but great as was vivians astonishment it was not only occasioned by this unexpected appearance of his former host mr beckendorff was not alone a woman was leaning on his left arm a quick glance in a moment convinced vivian that she was not the original of the mysterious picture the companion of beckendorff was very young her full voluptuous growth gave you for a moment the impression that she was somewhat low in stature but it was only for a moment for the lady was by no means short her beauty it is impossible to describe it was of a kind that baffles all phrases nor have i a single simile at command to make it more clearer more confused her luxurious form her blonde complexion her silken hair would have all become the languishing sultana but then her eyes they banished all idea of the seraglio and were the most decidedly european though the most brilliant that ever glanced eagles might have proved their young at them to a countenance which otherwise would have been calm and perhaps pensive they gave an expression of extreme vivacity and unusual animation and perhaps of restlessness and arrogance it might have been courage the lady was dressed in the costume of a chanoinesse of a couvent des dames nobles an institution to which protestant and catholic ladles are alike admitted the orangecoloured cordon of her canonry was slung gracefully over her plain black silk dress and a diamond cross hung below her waist  mr beckendorff and his fair companion were instantly welcomed by the grand marshal and arnelm and halfadozen chamberlains all in new uniforms and extremely agitated did their utmost by their exertions in clearing the way to prevent the prime minister of reisenburg from paying his respects to his sovereign at length however mr beckendorff reached the top of the room and presented the young lady to his royal highness and also to madame carolina vivian had retired on their approach and now found himself among a set of young officers idolators of von aslingen and of white hats lined with crimson who can she be was the universal question though all by the query acknowledged their ignorance yet it is singular that at the same time every one was prepared with a response to it such are the sources of accurate information  and that is beckendorff is it exclaimed the young count of eberstein and his daughter of course well there is nothing like being a plebeian and a prime minister i suppose beckendorff will bring an anonymous friend to court next  she cannot be his daughter said bernstorff to be a chanoinesse of that order remember she must be noble  then she must be his niece answered the young count of eberstein i think i do remember some confused story about a sister of beckendorff who ran away with some wirtemberg baron what was that story gernsbach  no it was not his sister said the baron of gernsbach it was his aunt i think  beckendorffs aunt what an idea as if he ever had an aunt men of his calibre make themselves out of mud they have no relations well never mind there was some story i am sure about some woman or other depend upon it that this girl is the child of that woman whether she be aunt niece or daughter i shall go and tell every one that i know the whole business this girl is the daughter of some woman or other so saying away walked the young count of eberstein to disseminate in all directions the important conclusion to which his logical head had allowed him to arrive  von weinbren said the baron of gernsbach how can you account for this mysterious appearance of the premier  oh when men are on the decline they do desperate things i suppose it is to please the renegado  hush theres the englishman behind you  on dit another child of beckendorff  oh no secret mission  ah indeed  here comes von aslingen well great emilius how solve you this mystery  what mystery is there one  i allude to this wonderful appearance of beckendorff  beckendorff what a name who is he  nonsense the premier  well  you have seen him of course he is here have you just come in  beckendorff here said von aslingen in a tone of affected horror i did not know that the fellow was to be visited it is all over with reisenburg i shall go to vienna tomorrow  but hark the sprightly music calls to the dance and first the stately polonaise in easy gradation between walking and dancing to the surprise of the whole room and the indignation of main of the high nobles the crown prince of reisenburg led off the polonaise with the unknown fair one such an attention to beckendorff was a distressing proof of present power and favour the polonaise is a dignified promenade with which german balls invariably commence the cavaliers with an air of studied grace offer their right hands to their fair partners and the whole party in a long file accurately follow the leading couple through all their scientific evolutions as they wind through every part of the room waltzes in sets speedily followed the polonaise and the unknown who was now an object of universal attention danced with count von sohnspeer another of beckendorffs numerous progeny if the reader remember how scurvily are poor single gentlemen who live alone treated by the candid tongues of their fellowcreatures the commanderinchief of the reisenburg troops was certainly a partner of a different complexion from the young ladys previous one the crown prince had undertaken his duty with reluctance and had performed it without grace not a single word had he exchanged with his partner during the promenade and his genuine listlessness was even more offensive than affected apathy von sohnspeer on the contrary danced in the true vienna style and whirled like a dervish all our good english prejudices against the soft the swimming the sentimental melting undulating dangerous waltz would quickly disappear if we only executed the dreaded manoeuvres in the true austrian style one might as soon expect our daughters to get sentimental in a swing  vivian did not choose to presume upon his late acquaintance with mr beckendorff as it had not been sought by that gentleman and he consequently did not pay his respects to the minister mr beckendorff continued at the top of the room standing between the state chairs of his royal highness and madame carolina and occasionally addressing an observation to his sovereign and answering one of the ladys had mr beckendorff been in the habit of attending balls nightly he could not have exhibited more perfect nonchalance there he stood with his arms crossed behind him his chin resting on his breast and his raised eyes glancing  my dear prince said vivian to the grand marshal you are just the person i wanted to speak to how came you to invite beckendorff and how came he to accept the invitation  my dear friend said his highness shrugging his shoulders wonders will never cease i never invited him i should just as soon have thought of inviting old johannisberger  were you not aware then of his intention  not in the least you should rather say attention for i assure you i consider it a most particular one it is quite astonishing my dear friend how i mistook that mans character he really is one of the most gentlemanlike polite and excellent persons i know no more mad than you are and as for his power being on the decline we know the nonsense of that  better than most persons i suspect sievers of course is not here  no you have heard about him i suppose  heard heard what  not heard well he told me yesterday and said he was going to call upon you directly to let you know  know what  he is a very sensible man sievers and i am very glad at last that he is likely to succeed in the world all men have their little imprudences and he was a little too hot once what of that he has come to his senses so have i and i hope you will never lose yours  but pray my dear prince tell me what has happened to sievers  he is going to vienna immediately and will be very useful there i have no doubt he has got a good place and i am sure he will do his duty they cannot have an abler man  vienna that is the last city in the world in which i should expect to find mr sievers what place can he have and what services can he perform there  many he is to be editor of the austrian observer and censor of the austrian press i thought he would do well at last all men have their imprudent day i had i cannot stop now i must go and speak to the countess von s  as vivian was doubting whether he should most grieve or laugh at this singular termination of mr sievers career his arm was suddenly touched and on turning round he found it was by mr beckendorff  there is another strong argument sir said the minister without any of the usual phrases of recognition there is another strong argument against your doctrine of destiny and then mr beckendorff taking vivian by the arm began walking up and down part of the saloon with him and in a few minutes quite forgetting the scene of the discussion he was involved in metaphysics this incident created another great sensation and whispers of secret mission secretary of state decidedly a son c c c were in an instant afloat in all parts of the room  the approach of his royal highness extricated vivian from an argument which was as profound as it was interminable and as mr beckendorff retired with the grand duke into a recess in the ballroom vivian was requested by von neuwied to attend his excellency the grand marshal  my dear friend said the prince i saw you talking with a certain person i did not say anything to you when i passed you before but to tell you the truth now i was a little annoyed that he had not spoken to you i knew you were as proud as lucifer and would not salute him yourself and between ourselves i had no great wish you should for not to conceal it he did not even mention your name but the reason of this is now quite evident and you must confess he is remarkably courteous you know if you remember we thought that incognito was a little affected rather annoying if you recollect i remember in the green lane you gave him a gentle cut about it it was spirited and i dare say did good well what i was going to say about that is this i dare say now after all continued his excellency with a knowing look a certain person had very good reasons for that not that he ever told them to me nor that i have the slightest idea of them but when a person is really so exceedingly polite and attentive i always think he would never do anything disagreeable without a cause and it was exceedingly disagreeable if you remember my dear friend i never knew to whom he was speaking von philipson indeed well we did not think the day we were floundering down that turf road that it would end in this rather a more brilliant scene than the giants hall at turriparva i think eh but all men have their imprudent days the best way is to forget them there was poor sievers who ever did more imprudent things than he and now it is likely he will do very well in the world eh what i want of you my dear friend is this there is that girl who came with beckendorff who the deuce she is i dont know let us hope the best we must pay her every attention i dare say she is his daughter you have not forgotten the portrait well we all were gay once all men have their imprudent day why should not beckendorff speaks rather in his favour i think well this girl his royal highness very kindly made the crown prince walk the polonaise with her very kind of him and very proper what attention can be too great for the daughter or friend of such a man a man who in two words may be said to have made reisenburg for what was reisenburg before beckendorff ah what perhaps we were happier then after all and then there was no royal highness to bow to no person to be condescending except ourselves but never mind we will forget after all this life has its charms what a brilliant scene but this girl every attention should be paid her the crown prince was so kind as to walk the polonaise with her and von sohnspeer he is a brute to be sure but then he is a field marshal now i think considering what has taken place between beckendorff and yourself and the very distinguished manner in which he recognised you i think that after all this and considering everything the etiquette is for you particularly as you are a foreigner and my personal friend indeed my most particular friend for in fact i owe everything to you my life and more than my life i think i repeat considering all this that the least you can do is to ask her to dance with you and i as the host will introduce you i am sorry my dear friend continued his excellency with a look of great regret to introduce you to but we will not speak about it we have no right to complain of mr beckendorff no person could possibly behave to us in a manner more gentlemanlike  after an introductory speech in his excellencys happiest manner and in which an eulogium of vivian and a compliment to the fair unknown got almost as completely entangled as the origin of slavery and the history of the feudal system in his more celebrated harangue vivian found himself waltzing with the anonymous beauty the grand marshal during the process of introduction had given the young lady every opportunity of declaring her name but every opportunity was thrown away she must be incog whispered his excellency miss von philipson i suppose  vivian was not a little desirous of discovering the nature of the relationship or connection between beckendorff and his partner the rapid waltz allowed no pause for conversation but after the dance vivian seated himself at her side with the determination of not quickly deserting it the lady did not even allow him the satisfaction of commencing the conversation for no sooner was she seated than she begged to know who the person was with whom she had previously waltzed the history of count von sohnspeer amused her and no sooner had vivian finished his anecdote than the lady said ah i so you are an amusing person now tell me the history of everybody in the room  really said vivian i fear i shall forfeit my reputation of being amusing very speedily for i am almost as great a stranger at this court as you appear to be yourself count von sohnspeer is too celebrated a personage at reisenburg to have allowed even me to be long ignorant of his history and as for the rest as far as i can judge they are most of them as obscure as myself and not nearly as interesting as you are  are you an englishman asked the lady  i am  i supposed so both from your travelling and your appearance i think the english countenance very peculiar  indeed we do not flatter ourselves so at home  yes it is peculiar said the lady in a tone which seemed to imply that contradiction was unusual and i think that you are all handsome i admire the english which in this part of the world is singular the south you know is generally francisé  i am aware of that said vivian there for instance pointing to a pompouslooking personage who at that moment strutted by there for instance is the most francisé person in all reisenburg that is our grand chamberlain he considers himself a felicitous copy of louis the fourteenth he allows nothing in his opinions and phrases but what is orthodox as it generally happens in such cases his orthodoxy is rather obsolete  who is that knight of malta asked the lady  the most powerful individual in the room answered vivian  who can he be asked the lady with eagerness  behold him and tremble rejoined vivian for with him it rests to decide whether you are civilised or a savage whether you are to be abhorred or admired idolised or despised nay do not be alarmed there are a few heretics even in reisenburg who like myself value from conviction and not from fashion and who will be ever ready in spite of a von aslingen anathema to evince our admiration where it is due  the lady pleaded fatigue as an excuse for not again dancing and vivian did not quit her side her lively remarks piquant observations and singular questions highly amused him and he was flattered by the evident gratification which his conversation afforded her it was chiefly of the principal members of the court that she spoke she was delighted with vivians glowing character of madame carolina whom she said she had this evening seen for the first time who this unknown could be was a question which often occurred to him and the singularity of a man like beckendorff suddenly breaking through his habits and outraging the whole system of his existence to please a daughter or niece or female cousin did not fail to strike him  i have the honour of being acquainted with mr beckendorff said vivian this was the first time that the ministers name had been mentioned  i perceived you talking with him was the answer  you are staying i suppose at mr beckendorffs  not at present  you have of course been at his retreat delightful place  yes  are you an ornithologist asked vivian smiling  not at all scientific but i of course can now tell a lory from a java sparrow and a bullfinch from a canary the first day i was there i never shall forget the surprise i experienced when after the noon meal being finished the aviary door was opened after that i always let the creatures out myself and one day i opened all the cages at once if you could but have witnessed the scene i am sure you would have been quite delighted with it as for poor mr beckendorff i thought even he would have gone out of his mind and when i brought in the white peacock he actually left the room in despair pray how do you like madame clara and owlface too which do you think the most beautiful i am no great favourite with the old lady indeed it was very kind of mr beckendorff to bear with everything as he did i am sure he is not much used to lady visitors  i trust that your visit to him will not be very short  my stay at reisenburg will not be very long said the young lady with rather a grave countenance have you been here any time  about a fortnight it was a mere chance my coming at all i was going on straight to vienna  to vienna indeed well i am glad you did not miss reisenburg you must not quit it now you know that this is not the vienna season  i am aware of it but i am such a restless person that i never regulate my movements by those of other people  but surely you find reisenburg agreeable  very much so but i am a confirmed wanderer  why are you asked the lady with great naïveté  vivian looked grave and the lady as if she were sensible of having unintentionally occasioned him a painful recollection again expressed her wish that he should not immediately quit the court and trusted that circumstances would not prevent him from acceding to her desire  it does not even depend upon circumstances said vivian the whim of the moment is my only principle of action and therefore i may be off tonight or be here a month hence  oh pray stay then said his companion eagerly i expect you to stay now if you could only have an idea what a relief conversing with you is after having been dragged by the crown prince and whirled by that von sohnspeer heigho i could almost sigh at the very remembrance of that doleful polonaise  the lady ended with a faint laugh a sentence which apparently had been commenced in no light vein she did not cease speaking but continued to request vivian to remain at reisenburg at least as long as herself her frequent requests were perfectly unnecessary for the promise had been pledged at the first hint of her wish but this was not the only time during the evening that vivian had remarked that his interesting companion occasionally talked without apparently being sensible that she was conversing  the young count of eberstein who to use his own phrase was sadly involved and consequently desirous of being appointed a forest councillor thought that he should secure his appointment by condescending to notice the person whom he delicately styled the ministers female relative to his great mortification and surprise the honour was declined and the female relative being unwilling to dance again but perhaps feeling it necessary to break off her conversation with her late partner it having already lasted an unusual time highly gratified his excellency the grand marshal by declaring that she would dance with prince maximilian this to say the least was very attentive of miss von philipson  little max who had just tact enough to discover that to be the partner of the fair incognita was the place of honour of the evening now considered himself by much the most important personage in the room in fact he was only second to emilius von aslingen the evident contest which was ever taking place between his natural feelings as a boy and his acquired habits as a courtier made him an amusing companion he talked of the gardens and the opera in a style not unworthy of the young count of eberstein he thought that madame carolina was as charming as usual tonight but on the contrary that the countess von s was looking rather ill and this put him in mind of her ladyships new equipage and then apropos to equipages what did his companion think of the new fashion of the hungarian harness his lively and kind companion encouraged the boys tattle and emboldened by her good nature he soon forgot his artificial speeches and was quickly rattling on about turriparva and his horses and his dogs and his park and his guns and his grooms soon after the waltz the lady taking the arm of the young prince walked up to mr beckendorff he received her with great attention and led her to madame carolina who rose seated mr beckendorffs female relative by her side and evidently said something extremely agreeable     chapter vi   vivian had promised madame carolina a second english lesson on the day after the grand marshals fete the progress which the lady had made and the talent which the gentleman had evinced during the first had rendered madame the most enthusiastic of pupils and vivian in her estimation the ablest of instructors madame carolinas passion was patronage to discover concealed merit to encourage neglected genius to reveal the mysteries of the world to a novice in mankind or in short to make herself very agreeable to any one whom she fancied to be very interesting was the great business and the great delight of her existence no sooner had her eyes lighted on vivian grey than she determined to patronise his country his appearance the romantic manner in which he had become connected with the court all pleased her lively imagination she was intuitively acquainted with his whole history and in an instant he was the hero of a romance of which the presence of the principal character compensated we may suppose for the somewhat indefinite details his taste and literary acquirements completed the spell by which madame carolina was willingly enchanted a low dutch professor whose luminous genius rendered unnecessary the ceremony of shaving and a dumb dwarf in whose interesting appearance was forgotten its perfect idiocy prosy improvisatore and a south american savage were all superseded by the appearance of vivian grey  as madame carolina was in fact a charming woman our hero had no objection to humour her harmless foibles and not contented with making notes in an interleaved copy of her charlemagne he even promised to read haroun al raschid in manuscript the consequence of his courtesy and the reward of his taste was unbounded favour apartments in the palace were offered him and declined and when madame carolina had income acquainted with sufficient of his real history to know that on his part neither wish nor necessity existed to return immediately to his own country she tempted him to remain at reisenburg by an offer of a place at court and doubtless had he been willing vivian might in time have become a lord chamberlain or perhaps even a field marshal  on entering the room the morning in question he found madame carolina writing at the end of the apartment a lady ceased on his appearance humming an air to which she was dancing and at the same time imitating castanets madame received vivian with expressions of delight saying also in a peculiar and confidential manner that she was just sealing up a packet for him the preface of haroun and then she presented him to the baroness the lady who was lately dancing came forward it was his unknown partner of the preceding night the baroness extended her hand to vivian and unaffectedly expressed her great pleasure at seeing him again vivian trusted that she was not fatigued by the fête and asked after mr beckendorff madame carolina was busily engaged at the moment in duly securing the precious preface the baroness said that mr beckendorff had returned home but that madame carolina had kindly insisted upon her staying at the palace she was not the least wearied last night had been one of the most agreeable she had ever spent at least she supposed she ought to say so for if she had experienced a tedious or mournful feeling for a moment it was hardly for what was then passing so much as for  pray mr grey said madame carolina interrupting them have you heard about our new ballet  no  i do not think you have ever been to our opera tomorrow is opera night and you must not be again away we pride ourselves here very much upon our opera  we estimate it even in england said vivian as possessing perhaps the most perfect orchestra now organised  the orchestra is perfect his royal highness is such an excellent musician and he has spared no trouble or expense in forming it he has always superintended it himself but i confess i admire our ballet department still more i expect you to be delighted with it you will perhaps be gratified to know that the subject of our new splendid ballet which is to be produced tomorrow is from a great work of your illustrious poet my lord byron  from which  the corsair ah what a sublime work what passion what energy what knowledge of feminine feeling what contrast of character what sentiments what situations i wish this were opera night gulnare my favourite character beautiful how do you think they will dress her  are you an admirer of our byron asked vivian of the baroness  i think he is a very handsome man i once saw him at the carnival at venice  but his works his grand works ma chère petite said madame carolina in her sweetest tone you have read his works  not a line answered the baroness with great naïveté i never saw them  pauvre enfant said madame carolina i will employ you then while you are here  i never read said the baroness i cannot bear it i like poetry and romances but i like somebody to read to me  very just said madame carolina we can judge with greater accuracy of the merit of a composition when it reaches our mind merely through the medium of the human voice the soul is an essence invisible and indivisible in this respect the voice of man resembles the principle of his existence since few will deny though there are some materialists who will deny everything that the human voice is both impalpable and audible only in one place at the same time hence i ask is it illogical to infer its indivisibility the soul and the voice then are similar in two great attributes there is a secret harmony in their spiritual construction in the early ages of mankind a beautiful tradition was afloat that the soul and the voice were one and the same we may perhaps recognise in this fanciful belief the effect of the fascinating and imaginative philosophy of the east that mysterious portion of the globe continued madame carolina from which we should frankly confess that we derive everything for the south is but the pupil of the east through the mediation of egypt of this opinion said madame with fervour i have no doubt of this opinion continued the lady with enthusiasm i have boldly avowed myself a votary in a dissertation appended to the second volume of haroun for this opinion i would die at the stake oh lovely east why was i not oriental land where the voice of the nightingale is never mute land of the cedar and the citron the turtle and the myrtle of everblooming flowers and evershining skies illustrious east cradle of philosophy my dearest baroness why do not you feel as i do from the east we obtain everything  indeed said the baroness with simplicity i thought we only got shawls  this puzzling answer was only noticed by vivian for the truth is madame carolina was one of those individuals who never attend to any persons answers always thinking of herself she only asked questions that she herself might supply the responses and now having made as she flattered herself a splendid display to her favourite critic she began to consider what had given rise to her oration lord byron and the ballet again occurred to her and as the baroness at least was not unwilling to listen and as she herself had no manuscript of her own which she particularly wished to be perused she proposed that vivian should read to them part of the corsair and in the original tongue madame carolina opened the volume at the first prison scene between gulnare and conrad it was her favourite vivian read with care and feeling madame was in raptures and the baroness although she did not understand a single syllable seemed almost equally delighted at length vivian came to this passage       my love stern seyds oh no no not my love      yet much this heart that strives no more once strove      to meet his passion but it would not be      i felt i feel love dwells with with the free      i am a slave a favourd slave at best      to share his splendour and seem very blest      oft must my soul the question undergo      of dost thou love and burn to answer no      oh hard it is that fondness to sustain      and struggle not to feel averse in vain      but harder still the hearts recoil to bear      and hide from one perhaps another there      he takes the hand i give not nor withhold      its pulse nor checked nor quickened calmly cold      and when resignd it drops a lifeless weight      from one i never loved enough to hate      no warmth these lips return by his imprest      and chilld remembrance shudders oer the rest      yes had i ever provd that passions zeal      the change to hatred were at least to feel      but still he goes unmournd returns unsought      and oft when present absent from my thought      or when reflection comes and come it must      i fear that henceforth twill but bring disgust      i am his slave but in despite of pride      twere worse than bondage to become his bride  superb said madame in a voice of enthusiasm how true what passion what energy what sentiments what knowledge of feminine feeling read it again i pray it is my favourite passage  what is this passage about asked the baroness with some anxiety tell me  i have a french translation ma mignonne said madame you shall have it afterwards  no i detest reading said the young lady with an imperious air translate it to me at once  you are rather a selfwilled beauty thought vivian but your eyes are so brilliant that nothing must be refused you and so he translated it  on its conclusion madame was again in raptures the baroness was not less affected but she said nothing she appeared agitated she changed colour raised her beautiful eyes with an expression of sorrow looked at vivian earnestly and then walked to the other end of the room in a few moments she returned to her seat  i wish you would tell me the story she said with earnestness  i have a french translation ma belle said madame carolina at present i wish to trouble mr grey with a few questions madame carolina led vivian into a recess  i am sorry we are troubled with this sweet little savage but i think she has talent though evidently quite uneducated we must do what we can for her her ignorance of all breeding is amusing but then i think she has a natural elegance we shall soon polish her his royal highness is so anxious that every attention should be paid to her beckendorff you know is a man of the greatest genius madame carolina had lowered her tone about the minister since the prince of little lilliputs apostasy the country is greatly indebted to him this between ourselves is his daughter at least i have no doubt of it beckendorff was once married to a lady of great rank died early beautiful woman very interesting his royal highness had a great regard for her the premier in his bereavement turned humorist and has brought up this lovely girl in the oddest possible manner nobody knows where now that he finds it necessary to bring her forward he of course is quite at a loss his royal highness has applied to me there was a little coldness before between the minister and myself it is now quite removed i must do what i can for her i think she must marry von sohnspeer who is no more beckendorffs son than you are or young eberstein or young bernstorff or young gernsbach we must do something for her i offered her last night to emilius von aslingen but he said that unfortunately he was just importing a savage or two of his own from the brazils and consequently was not in want of her  a chamberlain now entered to announce the speedy arrival of his royal highness the baroness without ceremony expressed her great regret that he was coming as now she should not hear the wishedfor story madame carolina reproved her and the reproof was endured rather than submitted to  his royal highness entered and was accompanied by the crown prince he greeted the young lady with great kindness and even the crown prince inspired by his fathers unusual warmth made a shuffling kind of bow and a stuttering kind of speech vivian was about to retire on the entrance of the grand duke but madame carolina prevented him from going and his royal highness turning round very graciously seconded her desire and added that mr grey was the very gentleman with whom he was desirous of meeting  i am anxious said he to vivian in rather a low tone to make reisenburg agreeable to mr beckendorffs fair friend as you are one of the few who are honoured by his intimacy and are familiar with some of our state secrets added the grand duke with a smile i am sure it will give you pleasure to assist me in the execution of my wishes  his royal highness proposed that the ladies should ride and he himself with the crown prince and mr grey would attend them madame carolina expressed her willingness but the baroness like all forward girls unused to the world suddenly grew at the same time both timid and disobliging she looked sullen and discontented and coolly said that she did not feel in the humour to ride for at least these two hours to vivians surprise even the grand duke humoured her fancy and declared that he should then be happy to attend them after the court dinner until that time vivian was amused by madame and the grand duke exclusively devoted himself to the baroness his royal highness was in his happiest mood and his winning manners and elegant conversation soon chased away the cloud which for a moment had settled on the young ladys fair brow     chapter vii   the grand duke of reisenburg was an enthusiastic lover of music and his people were consequently music mad the whole city were fiddling day and night or blowing trumpets oboes and bassoons sunday however was the most harmonious day in the week the opera amused the court and the wealthiest citizens and few private houses could not boast their family concert or small party of performers in the teagardens of which there were many in the suburbs of the city bearing the euphonious romantic and fashionable titles of tivoli arcadia and vauxhall a strong and amateur orchestra was never wanting strolling through the city on a sunday afternoon many a pleasing picture of innocent domestic enjoyment might he observed in the arbour of a garden a very stout man with a fair broad goodnatured solid german face may be seen perspiring under the scientific exertion of the french horn himself wisely disembarrassed of the needless incumbrance of his peagreen coat and showy waistcoat which lay neatly folded by his side while his large and sleepy blue eyes actually gleam with enthusiasm his daughter a soft and delicate girl touches the light guitar catching the notes of the music from the opened opera which is placed before the father on a massy musicstand her voice joins in melody with her mother who like all german mothers seems only her daughters self subdued by an additional twenty years the bow of one violin is handled with the air of a master by an elder brother while a younger one an university student grows sentimental over the flute the same instrument is also played by a tall and tenderlooking young man in black who stands behind the parents next to the daughter and occasionally looks off his musicbook to gaze on his young mistresss eyes he is a clerk in a public office and on next michaelmas day if he succeed as he hopes in gaining a small addition to his salary he will be still more entitled to join in the sunday family concert such is one of the numerous groups the sight of which must assuredly give pleasure to every man who delights in seeing his fellowcreatures refreshed after their weekly labours by such calm and rational enjoyment we would gladly linger among such scenes and moreover the humours of a guinguette are not unworthy of our attention but we must introduce the reader to a more important party  the court chapel and the court dinner are over we are in the operahouse of reisenburg and of course rise as the royal party enters the house which is of moderate size was fitted up with splendour we hardly know whether we should say with great taste for although not merely the scenery but indeed every part of the house was painted by eminent artists the style of the ornaments was rather patriotic than tasteful the house had been built immediately after the war at a period when reisenburg flushed with the success of its thirty thousand men imagined itself to be a great military nation trophies standards cannon eagles consequently appeared in every corner of the operahouse and quite superseded lyres and timbrels and tragic daggers and comic masks the royal box was constructed in the form of a tent and held nearly fifty persons it was exactly in the centre of the house its floor over the back of the pit and its roof reaching to the top of the second circle its crimson hangings were restrained by ropes of gold and the whole was surmounted by a large and radiant crown the house was merely lighted by a chandelier from the centre  the opera for the evening was rossinis otello as soon as the grand duke entered the overture commenced his royal highness coming forward to the front of the box and himself directing the musicians keeping time earnestly with his right hand in which was a long black operaglass this he occasionally used but merely to look at the orchestra not assuredly to detect a negligent or inefficient performer for in the schooled orchestra of reisenburg it would have been impossible even for the eagle eye of his royal highness assisted as it was by his long black operaglass or for his fine ear matured as it was by the most complete study to discover there either inattention or feebleness the house was perfectly silent for when the monarch directs the orchestra the world goes to the opera to listen perfect silence at reisenburg then was etiquette and the fashion between the acts of the opera however the ballet was performed and then everybody might talk and laugh and remark as much as they chose  the grand duke prided himself as much upon the accuracy of his scenery and dresses and decorations as upon the exquisite skill of his performers in truth an opera at reisenburg was a spectacle which could not fail to be interesting to a man of taste when the curtain drew up the first scene presented a view of old brabantios house it was accurately copied from one of the sumptuous structures of scamozzi or sansovino or palladio which adorn the grand canal of venice in the distance rose the domes of st mark and the lofty campanile vivian could not fail to be delighted with this beautiful work of art for such indeed it should be styled he was more surprised however but not less pleased on the entrance of othello himself in england we are accustomed to deck this adventurous moor in the costume of his native country but is this correct the grand duke of reisenburg thought not othello was an adventurer at an early age he entered as many foreigners did into the service of venice in that service be rose to the highest dignities became general of her armies and of her fleets and finally the viceroy of her favourite kingdom is it natural to suppose that such a man should have retained during his successful career the manners and dress of his original country ought we not rather to admit that had he done so his career would in fact not have been successful in all probability he imitated to affectation the manners of the country which he had adopted it is not probable that in such or in any age the turbaned moor would have been treated with great deference by the common christian soldier of venice or indeed that the scandal of a heathen leading the armies of one of the most powerful of european states would have been tolerated for an instant by indignant christendom if shylock even the jew merchant confined to his quarter and herding with his own sect were bearded on the rialto in what spirit would the venetians have witnessed their doge and nobles whom they ranked above kings holding equal converse and loading with the most splendid honours of the republic a follower of mahound such were the sentiments of the grand duke of reisenburg on this subject a subject interesting to englishmen and i confess i think that they are worthy of attention in accordance with his opinions the actor who performed othello appeared in the full dress of a venetian magnifico of the middle ages a fit companion for cornaro or grimani or barberigo or foscari  the first act of the opera was finished the baroness expressed to vivian her great delight at its being over as she was extremely desirous of learning the story of the ballet which she had not yet been able to acquire his translation of yesterday had greatly interested her vivian shortly gave her the outline of the story of conrad she listened with much attention but made no remark  the ballet at reisenburg was not merely a vehicle for the display of dancing it professed by gesture and action aided by music to influence the minds of the spectators not less than the regular drama of this exhibition dancing was a casual ornament as it is of life it took place therefore only on fitting occasions and grew out in a natural manner from some event in the history represented for instance suppose the story of othello the subject of the ballet the dancing in all probability would be introduced at a grand entertainment given in celebration of the moors arrival at cyprus all this would be in character our feelings would not be outraged by a husband chassezing forward to murder his wife or by seeing the pillow pressed over the innocent desdemona by the impulse of a pirouette in most cases therefore the chief performers in this species of spectacle are not even dancers this however may not always be the case if diana be the heroine poetical probability will not be offended by the goddess joining in the chaste dance with her huntress nymphs and were the baiadere of goethe made the subject of a ballet the indian dancing girl would naturally be the heroine both of the drama and the poem there are few performances more affecting than the serious pantomime of a master in some of the most interesting situations it is in fact even more natural than the oral drama logically it is more perfect for the soliloquy is actually thought before us and the magic of the representation not destroyed by the sound of the human voice at a moment when we all know man never speaks  the curtain again rises sounds of revelry and triumph are heard from the pirate isle they celebrate recent success various groups accurately attired in the costume of the greek islands are seated on the rocky foreground on the left rises medoras tower on a craggy steep and on the right gleams the blue aegean a procession of women enters it heralds the presence of conrad and medora they honour the festivity of their rude subjects the pirates and the women join in the national dance and afterwards eight warriors completely armed move in a warlike measure keeping time to the music with their bucklers and clattering sabres suddenly the dance ceases a sail is in sight the nearest pirates rush to the strand and assist the disembarkation of their welcome comrades the commander of the vessel comes forward with an agitated step and gloomy countenance he kneels to conrad and delivers him a scroll which the chieftain reads with suppressed agitation in a moment the faithful juan is at his side the contents of the scroll revealed the dance broken up and preparations made to sail in an hours time to the city of the pacha the stage is cleared and conrad and medora are alone the mysterious leader is wrapt in the deepest abstraction he stands with folded arms and eyes fixed on the yellow sand a gentle pressure on his arm calls him back to recollection he starts and turns to the intruder with a gloomy brow he sees medora and his frown sinks into a sad smile and must we part again this hour this very hour it cannot be she clings to him with agony and kneels to him with adoration no hope no hope a quick return promised with an air of foreboding fate his stern arm encircles her waist he chases the heavy tear from her fair cheek and while he bids her be glad in his absence with her handmaids peals the sad thunder of the signal gun she throws herself upon him the frantic quickness of her motion strikingly contrasts with the former stupor of her appearance she will not part her face is buried in his breast her long fair hair floats over his shoulders he is almost unnerved but at this moment the ship sails on the crew and their afflicted wives enter the page brings to lord conrad his cloak his carbine and his bugle he tears himself from her embrace and without daring to look behind him bounds over the rocks and is in the ship the vessel moves the wives of the pirates continue on the beach waving their scarfs to their desolate husbands in the foreground medora motionless stands rooted to the strand and might have inspired phidias with a personification of despair  in a hall of unparalleled splendour stern seyd reclines on innumerable pillows placed on a carpet of golden cloth his bearded chiefs are ranged around the chambers are brilliantly illuminated and an opening at the farther end of the apartments exhibits a portion of the shining city and the glittering galleys gulnare covered with a silver veil which reaches even to her feet is ushered into the presence of the pacha even the haughty seyd rises to honour his beautiful favourite he draws the precious veil from her blushing features and places her on his right hand the dancing girls now appear and then are introduced the principal artists now takes place the scientific part of the ballet and here might bias or noblet or ronzi vestris or her graceful husband or the classical albert or the bounding paul vault without stint and attitudinise without restraint and not in the least impair the effect of the tragic tale the dervise of course appears the galleys of course are fired and seyd of course retreats a change in the scenery gives us the blazing harem the rescue of its inmates the deliverance of gulnare the capture of conrad  it is the prison scene on a mat covered with irons lies the forlorn conrad the flitting flame of a solitary lamp hardly reveals the heavy bars of the huge grate that forms the entrance to its cell for some minutes nothing stirs the mind of the spectator is allowed to become fully aware of the hopeless misery of the hero his career is ended secure is his dungeon trusty his guards overpowering his chains tomorrow he wakes to be impaled a gentle noise so gentle that the spectator almost deems it unintentional is now heard a white figure appears behind the dusky gate is it a guard or a torturer the gate softly opens and a female conies forward gulnare was represented by a girl with the body of a peri and the soul of a poetess the harem queen advances with an agitated step she holds in her left hand a lamp and in the girdle of her light dress is a dagger she reaches with a soundless step the captive he is asleep ay he sleeps while thousands are weeping over his ravage or his ruin and she in restlessness is wandering here a thousand thoughts are seen coursing over her flushed brow she looks to the audience and her dark eye asks why this corsair is so dear to her she turns again and raises the lamp with her long white arm that the light may fall on the captives countenance she gazes without moving on the sleeper touches the dagger with a slow and tremulous hand and starts from the contact with terror she again touches it it is drawn from her vest it falls to the ground he wakes he stares with wonder he sees a female not less fair than medora confused she tells him her station she tells him that her pity is as certain as his doom he avows his readiness to die he appears undaunted he thinks of medora he buries his face in his hands she grows pale as he avows he lovesanother she cannot conceal her own passion he wondering confesses that he supposed her love was his enemys was seyds gulnare shudders at the name she draws herself up to her full stature she smiles in bitterness       my love stern seyds oh no no not my love  the acting was perfect the house burst into unusual shouts of admiration madame carolina applauded with her little finger on her fan the grand duke himself gave the signal for applause vivian never felt before that words were useless his hand was suddenly pressed he turned round it was the baroness she was leaning back in her chair and though she did her utmost to conceal her agitated countenance a tear coursed down her cheek big as the miserable medoras     chapter viii   on the evening of the opera arrived at court part of the suite of the young archduchess the betrothed of the crown prince of reisenburg these consisted of an old greyheaded general who had taught her imperial highness the manual exercise and her tutor and confessor an ancient and toothless bishop their youthful mistress was to follow them in a few days and this arrival of such a distinguished portion of her suite was the signal for the commencement of a long series of sumptuous festivities after interchanging a number of compliments and a few snuffboxes the new guests were invited by his royal highness to attend a review which was to take place the next morning of five thousand troops and fifty generals  the reisenburg army was the best appointed in europe never were men seen with breasts more plumply padded mustachios better trained or such spotless gaiters the grand duke himself was a military genius and had invented a new cut for the collars of the cavalry his royal highness was particularly desirous of astonishing the old greyheaded governor of his future daughter by the skilful evolutions and imposing appearance of his legions the affair was to be of the most refined nature and the whole was to be concluded by a mock battle in which the spectators were to be treated by a display of the most exquisite evolutions and complicated movements which human beings ever yet invented to destroy others or to escape destruction field marshal count von sohnspeer the commanderinchief of all the forces of his royal highness the grand duke of reisenburg condescended at the particular request of his sovereign to conduct the whole affair himself  at first it was rather difficult to distinguish between the army and the staff for darius in the straits of issus was not more sumptuously and numerously attended than count von sohnspeer wherever he moved he was followed by a train of waving plumes and radiant epaulettes and foaming chargers and shining steel in fact he looked like a large military comet had the fate of reisenburg depended on the result of the day the field marshal and his generals and aidesdecamp and orderlies could not have looked more agitated and more in earnest von sohnspeer had not less than four horses in the field on every one of which he seemed to appear in the space of five minutes now he was dashing along the line of the lancers on a black charger and now round the column of the cuirassiers on a white one he exhorted the tirailleurs on a chestnut and added fresh courage to the ardour of the artillery on a bay  it was a splendid day the bands of the respective regiments played triumphant tunes as each marched on the field the gradual arrival of the troops was picturesque distant music was heard and a corps of infantry soon made its appearance a light bugle sounded and a body of tirailleurs issued from the shade of a neighbouring wood the kettledrums and clarions heralded the presence of a troop of cavalry and an advanced guard of light horse told that the artillery were about to follow the arms and standards of the troops shone in the sun military music sounded in all parts of the field unceasing was the bellow of the martial drum and the blast of the bloodstirring trumpet clouds of dust ever and anon excited in the distance denoted the arrival of a regiment of cavalry even now one approaches it is the red lancers how gracefully their colonel the young count of eberstein bounds on his barb has theseus turned centaur his spur and bridle seem rather the emblems of sovereignty than the instruments of government he neither chastises nor directs the rider moves without motion and the horse judges without guidance it would seem that the man had borrowed the beasts body and the beast the mans mind his regiment has formed upon the field their stout lances erected like a young and leafless grove but although now in line it is with difficulty that they can subject the spirit of their warlike steeds the trumpet has caught the ear of the horses they stand with open nostrils already breathing war ere they can see an enemy and now dashing up one leg and now the other they seem to complain of nature that she has made them of anything earthly  the troops have all arrived there is an unusual bustle in the field von sohnspeer is again changing his horse giving directions while he is mounting to at least a dozen aidesdecamp orderlies are scampering over every part of the field another flag quite new and of large size is unfurled by the fieldmarshals pavilion a signal gun the music in the whole field is hushed a short silence of agitating suspense another gun and another all the bands of all the regiments burst forth at the same moment into the national air the court dash into the field  madame carolina the baroness the countess von s and some other ladies wore habits of the uniform of the royal guards both madame and the baroness were perfect horsewomen and the excited spirits of mr beckendorffs female relative both during her ride and her dashing run over the field amidst the firing of cannon and the crash of drums and trumpets strikingly contrasted with her agitation and depression of the preceding night  your excellency loves the tented field i think said vivian who was at her side  i love war it is a diversion for kings was the answer how fine the breastplates and helmets of those cuirassiers glisten in the sun continued the lady do you see von sohnspeer i wonder if the crown prince be with him  i think he is  indeed ah can he interest himself in anything he seemed apathy itself at the opera last night i never saw him smile or move and have scarcely heard his voice but if he love war if he be a soldier if he be thinking of other things than a pantomime and a ball tis well very well for his country perhaps he is a hero  at this moment the crown prince who was of von sohnspeers staff slowly rode up to the royal party  rudolph said the grand duke do you head your regiment today  no was the muttered answer  the grand duke moved his horse to his son and spoke to him in a low tone evidently with earnestness apparently he was expostulating with him but the effect of the royal exhortation was only to render the princes brow more gloomy and the expression of his withered features more sullen and more sad the baroness watched the father and son as they were conversing with keen attention when the crown prince in violation of his fathers wishes fell into the party and allowed his regiment to be headed by the lieutenantcolonel the young lady raised her lustrous eyes to heaven with that same expression of sorrow or resignation which had so much interested vivian on the morning that he had translated to her the moving passage in the corsair  but the field is nearly cleared and the mimic war has commenced on the right appears a large body of cavalry consisting of cuirassiers and dragoons a vanguard of light cavalry and lancers under the command of the count of eberstein is ordered out from this body to harass the enemy a strong body of infantry supposed to be advancing several squadrons of light horse immediately spring forward they form themselves into line they wheel into column and endeavour by welldirected manoeuvres to outflank the strong wing of the advancing enemy after succeeding in executing all that was committed to them and after having skirmished in the van of their own army so as to give time for all necessary dispositions of the line of battle the vanguard suddenly retreats between the brigades of the cavalry of the line the prepared battery of cannon is unmasked and a tremendous concentric fire opened on the line of the advancing foe taking advantage of the confusion created by this unexpected salute of his artillery von sohnspeer who commands the cavalry gives the word to charge  the whole body of cavalry immediately charge in masses the extended line of the enemy is as immediately broken but the infantry who are commanded by one of the royal relatives and visitors the prince of pike and powdren dexterously form into squares and commence a masterly retreat in square battalions at length they take up a more favourable position than the former one they are again galled by the artillery who have proportionately advanced and again charged by the cavalry in their huge masses and now the squares of infantry partially give way they admit the cavalry but the exulting horse find to their dismay that the enemy are not routed but that there are yet inner squares formed at salient angles the cavalry for a moment retire but it is only to give opportunity to their artillery to rake the obstinate foes the execution of the battery is fearful headed by their commander the whole body of cuirassiers and dragoons again charge with renewed energy and concentrated force the infantry are thrown into the greatest confusion and commence a rout increased and rendered irremediable by the lancers and hussars the former vanguard who now seizing on the favourable moment again rush forward increasing the effect of the charge of the whole army overtaking the fugitives with their lances and securing the prisoners  the victorious von sohnspeer followed by his staff now galloped up to receive the congratulations of his sovereign  where are your prisoners field marshal asked his royal highness with a flattering smile  what is the ransom of our unfortunate guest asked madame carolina  i hope we shall have another affair said the baroness with a flushed face and glowing eyes  but the commanderinchief must not tarry to bandy compliments he is again wanted in the field the whole troops have formed in line some most scientific evolutions are now executed with them we will not weary the reader nor dilate on the comparative advantages of forming en cremaillière and en echiquier nor upon the duties of tirailleurs nor upon concentric fires and eccentric movements nor upon deploying nor upon enfilading nor upon oblique fronts nor upon échellons the day finished by the whole of the troops again forming in line and passing in order before the commanderinchief to give him an opportunity of observing their discipline and inspecting their equipments  the review being finished count von sohnspeer and his staff joined the royal party and after walking their horses round the field they proceeded to his pavilion where refreshments were prepared for them the field marshal flattered by the interest which the young baroness had taken in the business of the day and the acquaintance which she evidently possessed of the more obvious details of military tactics was inclined to be particularly courteous to her but the object of his admiration did not encourage attentions by which half the ladies of the court would have thought themselves as highly honoured as by those of the grand duke himself so powerful a person was the field marshal and so little inclined by temper to cultivate the graces of the fair sex  in the tent keep by my side said the baroness to vivian although i am fond of heroes von sohnspeer is not to my taste i know not why i flatter you so by my notice for i suppose like all englishmen you are not a soldier i thought so never mind you ride well enough for a field marshal i really think i could give you a commission without much stickling of my conscience no no i should like you nearer me i have a good mind to make you my master of the horse that is to say when i am entitled to have one  as vivian acknowledged the young baroness compliment by becoming emotion and vowed that an office near her person would be the consummation of all his wishes his eye caught the ladys she blushed deeply looked down upon her horses neck and then turned away her head  von sohnspeers pavilion excellently became the successful leader of the army of reisenburg trophies taken from all sides decked its interior the black eagle of austria formed part of its roof and the brazen eagle of gaul supported part of the side the greyheaded general looked rather grim when he saw a flag belonging to a troop which perhaps he had himself once commanded he vented his indignation to the toothless bishop who crossed his breast with his fingers covered with diamonds and preached temperance and moderation in inarticulate sounds  during the collation the conversation was principally military madame carolina who was entirely ignorant of the subject of discourse enchanted all the officers present by appearing to be the most interested person in the tent nothing could exceed the elegance of her eulogium of petit guerre the old grey general talked much about the good old times by which he meant the thirty years of plunder bloodshed and destruction which were occasioned by the french revolution he gloated on the recollections of horror which he feared would never occur again the archduke charles and prince schwartzenburg were the gods of his idolatry and nadastis hussars and wurmsers dragoons the inferior divinities of his bloody heaven one evolution of the morning a discovery made by von sohnspeer himself in the deploying of cavalry created a great sensation and it was settled that it would have been of great use to desaix and clairfait in the netherlands affair of some eightandtwenty years ago and was not equalled even by seidlitz cavalry in the affair with the russians at zorndorff in short every affair of any character during the late war was fought over again in the tent of field marshal von sohnspeer at length from the archduke charles and prince schwartzenburg the old greyheaded general got to polybius and monsieur folard and the grand duke now thinking that the affair was taking too serious a turn broke up the party madame carolina and most of the ladies used their carriages on their return they were nearly fifteen miles from the city but the baroness in spite of the most earnest solicitations would remount her charger  they cantered home the baroness in unusual spirits vivian thinking very much of his fair companion her character puzzled him that she was not the lovely simpleton that madame carolina believed her to be he had little doubt some people have great knowledge of society and little of mankind madame carolina was one of these she viewed her species through only one medium that the baroness was a woman of acute feeling vivian could not doubt her conduct at the opera which had escaped every ones attention made this evident that she had seen more of the world than her previous conversation had given him to believe was equally clear by her conduct and conversation this morning he determined to become more acquainted with her character her evident partiality to his company would not render the execution of his purpose very difficult at any rate if he discovered nothing it was something to do it would at least amuse him  in the evening he joined a large party at the palace he looked immediately for the baroness she was surrounded by the dandies their attentions she treated with contempt and ridiculed their compliments without mercy without obtruding himself on her notice vivian joined her circle and witnessed her demolition of the young count of eberstein with great amusement emilius von aslingen was not there for having made the interesting savage the fashion she was no longer worthy of his attention and consequently deserted the young lady soon observed vivian and saying without the least embarrassment that she was delighted to sec him she begged him to share her chaiselongue her envious levée witnessed the preference with dismay and as the object of their attention did not now notice their remarks even by her expressed contempt one by one fell away vivian and the baroness were left alone and conversed much together the lady displayed on every subject engaging ignorance and requested information on obvious topics with artless naïveté vivian was convinced that her ignorance was not affected and equally sure that it could not arise from imbecility of intellect for while she surprised him by her crude questions and her want of acquaintance with all those topics which generally form the staple of conversation she equally amused him with her poignant wit and the imperious and energetic manner in which she instantly expected satisfactory information on every possible subject     chapter ix   on the day after the review a fancydress ball was to be given at court it was to be an entertainment of a peculiar nature the lively genius of madame carolina wearied of the commonplace effect generally produced by this species of amusement in which usually a stray turk and a wandering pole looked sedate and singular among crowds of spanish girls swiss peasants and gentlemen in uniforms had invented something novel her idea was ingenious to use her own sublime phrase she determined that the party should represent an age great difficulty was experienced in fixing upon the century which was to be honoured at first a poetical idea was started of having something primeval perhaps antediluvian but noah or even father abraham were thought characters hardly sufficiently romantic for a fancydress ball and consequently the earliest postdiluvian ages were soon under consideration nimrod or sardanapalus were distinguished personages and might be well represented by the master of the staghounds or the master of the revels but then the want of an interesting ladycharacter was a great objection semiramis though not without style in her own way was not sufficiently parisian for madame carolina new ages were proposed and new objections started and so the committee of selection which consisted of madame herself the countess von s and a few other dames of fashion gradually slided through the four great empires athens was not aristocratic enough and then the women were nothing in spite of her admiration of the character of aspasia madame carolina somewhat doubted the possibility of persuading the ladies of the court of reisenburg to appear in the characters of greek hetairai rome presented great capabilities and greater difficulties finding themselves after many days sitting and study still very far from coming to a decision madame called in the aid of the grand duke who proposed something national the proposition was plausible but according to madame carolina germany until her own time had been only a land of barbarism and barbarians and therefore in such a country in a national point of view what could there be interesting the middle ages as they are usually styled in spite of the emperor charlemagne that oasis in the desert of barbarism to use her own eloquent and original image were her particular aversion the age of chivalry is past was as constant an exclamation of madame carolina as it was of mr burke the age of chivalry is past and very fortunate that it is what resources could they have had in the age of chivalry an age without either moral or experimental philosophy an age in which they were equally ignorant of the doctrine of association of ideas and of the doctrine of electricity and when they were as devoid of a knowledge of the incalculable powers of the human mind as of the incalculable powers of steam had madame carolina been the consort of an italian grand duke selection would not be difficult and to inquire no farther the court of the medici alone would afford them everything they wanted but germany never had any character and never produced nor had been the resort of illustrious men and interesting persons what was to be done the age of frederick the great was the only thing and then that was so recent and would offend the austrians it could not be thought of  at last when the committee of selection was almost in despair some one proposed a period which not only would be german not only would compliment the house of austria but what was of still greater importance would allow of every contemporary character of interest of every nation the age of charles the fifth the suggestion was received with enthusiasm and adopted on the spot the committee of selection was immediately dissolved and its members as immediately formed themselves into a committee of arrangement lists of all the persons of any fame distinction or notoriety who had lived either in the empire of germany the kingdoms of spain portugal france or england the italian states the netherlands the american and in short in every country in the known world were immediately formed von chronicle rewarded for his last historical novel by a ribbon and the title of baron was appointed secretary to the committee of costume all guests who received a card invitation were desired on or before a certain day to send in the title of their adopted character and a sketch of their intended dress that their plans might receive the sanction of the ladies of the committee of arrangement and their dresses the approbation of the secretary of costume by this method the chance and inconvenience of two persons selecting and appearing in the same character were destroyed and prevented after exciting the usual jealousies intrigues dissatisfaction and illblood by the influence and imperturbable temper of madame carolina everything was arranged emilius von aslingen being the only person who set both the committees of arrangement and costume at defiance and treated the repeated applications of their respected secretary with contemptuous silence the indignant baron von chronicle entreated the strong interference of the committee of arrangement but emilius von aslingen was too powerful an individual to be treated by others as he treated them had the fancydress ball of the sovereign been attended by all his subjects with the exception of this captain in his guards the whole affair might have been a failure would have been dark in spite of the glare of ten thousand lamps and the glories of all the jewels of his state would have been dull although each guest were wittier than pasquin himself and very vulgar although attended by lords of as many quarterings as the ancient shield of his own antediluvian house all therefore that the ladies of the committee of arrangement could do was to enclose to the rebellious von aslingen a list of the expected characters and a resolution passed in consequence of his contumacy that no person or persons was or were to appear as either or any of these characters unless he or they could produce a ticket or tickets granted by a member of the committee of arrangement and countersigned by the secretary of the committee of costume at the same time that these vigorous measures were resolved on no persons spoke of emilius von aslingens rebellious conduct in terms of greater admiration than the ladies of the committee themselves if possible he in consequence became even a more influential and popular personage than before and his conduct procured him almost the adoration of persons who had they dared to imitate him would have been instantly crushed and would have been banished society principally by the exertions of the very individual whom they had the presumption to mimic  in the gardens of the palace was a spacious amphitheatre cut out in green seats for the spectators of the plays which during the summer months were sometimes performed there by the court there was a stage in the same taste with rows of trees for sidescenes and a great number of arbours and summerrooms surrounded by lofty hedges of laurel for the actors to retire and dress in connected with this rural theatre for such was its title were many labyrinths and groves and arched walks in the same style more than twelve large fountains were in the immediate vicinity of this theatre at the end of one walk a seahorse spouted its element through its nostrils and in another neptune turned an ocean out of a vase seated on a rock arcadias halfgoat god the deity of silly sheep and silly poets sent forth trickling streams through his rustic pipes and in the centre of a green grove an enamoured salmacis bathing in a pellucid basin seemed watching for her hermaphrodite  it was in this rural theatre and its fanciful confines that madame carolina and her councillors resolved that their magic should for a night not only stop the course of time but recall past centuries it was certainly rather late in the year for choosing such a spot for the scene of their enchantment but the season as we have often had occasion to remark in the course of these volumes was singularly fine and indeed at this moment the nights were as warm and as clear from mist and dew as they are during an italian midsummer  but it is eight oclock we are already rather late is that a figure by holbein just started out of the canvas that i am about to meet stand aside it is a page of the emperor charles the fifth the court is on its way to the theatre the theatre and the gardens are brilliantly illuminated the effect of the thousands of coloured lamps in all parts of the foliage is very beautiful the moon is up and a million stars if it be not quite as light as day it is just light enough for pleasure you could not perhaps endorse a bill of exchange or engross a parchment by this light but then it is just the light to read a loveletter by and do a thousand other things besides  all hail to the emperor we would give his costume were it not rather too much in the style of the von chronicles reader you have seen a portrait of charles by holbein very well what need is there of a description no lack was there in this gay scene of massy chains and curious collars nor of cloth of gold nor of cloth of silver no lack was there of trembling plumes and costly hose no lack was there of crimson velvet and russet velvet and tawny velvet and purple velvet and plunket velvet and of scarlet cloth and green taffeta and cloth of silk embroidered no lack was there of garments of estate and of quaint chemews nor of short crimson cloaks covered with pearls and precious stones no lack was there of partycoloured splendour of purple velvet embroidered with white and white satin dresses embroidered with black no lack was there of splendid koyfes of damask or kerchiefs of fine cyprus nor of points of venice silver of ducat fineness nor of garlands of friars knots nor of coloured satins nor of bleeding hearts embroidered on the bravery of dolorous lovers nor of quaint sentences of wailing gallantry but for the details are they not to be found in those muchneglected and muchplundered persons the old chroniclers and will they not sufficiently appear in the most inventive portion of the next great historical novel  the grand duke looked the emperor our friend the grand marshal was francis the first and arnelm and von neuwied figured as the marshal of montmorency and the marshal lautrec the old toothless bishop did justice to clement the seventh and his companion the ancient general looked grim as pompeo colonna a prince of the house of nassau one of the royal visitors represented his adventurous ancestor the prince of orange von sohnspeer was that haughty and accomplished rebel the constable of bourbon the young baron gernsbach was worthy of the seraglio as he stalked along as solyman the magnificent with all the family jewels belonging to his dowager mother shining in his superb turban our friend the count of eberstein personified chivalry in the person of bayard the younger bernstorff the intimate friend of gernsbach attended his sumptuous sovereign as that turkish paul jones barbarossa an italian prince was andrew doria the grand chamberlain our francisé acquaintance and who affected a love of literature was the protestant elector of saxony his train consisted of the principal litterateurs of reisenburg the editor of the attackall review who originally had been a catholic but who had been skilfully converted some years ago when he thought catholicism was on the decline was martin luther an individual whom both in his apostasy and fierceness he much and only resembled on the contrary the editor of the praiseall review appeared as the mild and meek melanchthon mr sievers not yet at vienna was erasmus ariosto guicciardini ronsard rabelais machiavel pietro aretino garcilasso de la vega sannazaro and paracelsus afforded names to many nameless critics two generals brothers appeared as cortes and pizarro the noble director of the gallery was albert durer and his deputy hans holbein the court painter a wretched mimic of the modern french school did justice to the character of correggio and an indifferent sculptor looked sublime as michel angelo  von chronicle had persuaded the prince of pike and powdren one of his warmest admirers to appear as henry the eighth of england his highness was one of those true north german patriots who think their own country a very garden of eden and verily believe that original sin is to be finally put an end to in a large sandy plain between berlin and hanover the prince of pike and powdren passed his whole life in patriotically sighing for the concentration of all germany into one great nation and in secretly trusting that if ever the consummation took place the north would be rewarded for their condescending union by a monopoly of all the privileges of the empire such a character was of course extremely desirous of figuring tonight in a style peculiarly national the persuasions of von chronicle however prevailed and induced his highness of pike and powdren to dismiss his idea of appearing as the ancient arminius although it was with great regret that the prince gave up his plan of personating his favourite hero with hair down to his middle and skins up to his chin nothing would content von chronicle but that his kind patron should represent a crowned head anything else was beneath him the patriotism of the prince disappeared before the flattery of the novelist like the bloom of a plum before the breath of a boy when he polishes the powdered fruit ere he devours it no sooner had his highness agreed to be changed into bluff harry than the secret purpose of his adviser was immediately detected no court confessor seduced by the vision of a red hat ever betrayed the secrets of his sovereign with greater fervour than did von chronicle labour for the cardinals costume which was the consequence of the prince of pike and powdren undertaking the english monarch tonight proud as was the part of the prince as regal harry his strut was a shamble compared with the imperious stalk of von chronicle as the arrogant and ambitious wolsey the cardinal in rienzi was nothing to him for tonight wolsey had as many pages as the other had petticoats  but most ungallant of scribblers place aux dames surely madame carolina as the beautiful and accomplished margaret of navarre might well command even without a mandate your homage and your admiration the lovely queen seemed the very goddess of smiles and repartee young max as her page carried at her side a painted volume of her own poetry the arm of the favourite sister of francis who it will be remembered once fascinated even the emperor was linked in that of caesars natural daughter her beautiful namesake the brighteyed margaret of austria conversing with these royal dames and indeed apparently in attendance upon them was a young gallant of courtly bearing and attired in a fantastic dress it is clement marot the poet of princes and the prince of poets as he was styled by his own admiring age he offers to the critical inspection of the nimblewitted navarre a few lines in celebration of her beauty and the nights festivity one of those short marotique poems once so celebrated perhaps a page culled from those gay and airy psalms which with characteristic gallantry he dedicated to the dames of france observe well the fashionable bard marot was a true poet and in his day not merely read by queens and honoured by courtiers observe him well for the character is supported by our vivian grey it was with great difficulty that madame carolina had found a character for her favourite for the lists were all filled before his arrival at reisenburg she at first wished him to appear as some celebrated englishman of the time but no character of sufficient importance could be discovered all our countrymen in contact or connection with the emperor charles were churchmen and civilians and sir nicholas carew and the other fops of the reign of henry the eighth who after the visit to paris were even more ridiculously francisé than the grand chamberlain of reisenburg himself were not after mature deliberation considered entitled to the honour of being ranked in madame carolinas age of charles the fifth  but who is this surrounded by her ladies and her chamberlains and her secretaries four pages in dresses of cloth of gold and each the son of a prince of the french blood support her train a crown encircles locks grey as much from thought as from time but which require no show of loyalty to prove that they belong to a mother of princes that ample forehead aquiline nose and the keen glance of her piercing eye denote the queen as much as the regality of her gait and her numerous and splendid train the young queen of navarre hastens to proffer her duty to the mother of francis the celebrated louise of savoy and exquisitely did the young and lovely countess of s personate the most celebrated of female diplomatists  we have forgotten one character the repeated commands of his father and the constant entreaties of madame carolina had at length prevailed upon the crown prince to shuffle himself into a fancy dress no sooner had he gratified them by his hardwrung consent than baron von chronicle called upon him with drawings of the costume of the prince of asturias afterwards philip the second of spain if we for a moment forgot so important a personage as the future grand duke it must have been because he supported his character so ably that no one for an instant believed that it was an assumed one standing near the side scenes of the amphitheatre with his gloomy brow sad eye protruding underlip and arms hanging straight by his sides he looked a bigot without hope and a tyrant without purpose  the first hour is over and the guests are all assembled as yet they content themselves with promenading round the amphitheatre for before they can think of dance or stroll each of them must be duly acquainted with the others dress it was a most splendid scene the queen of navarre has now been presented to the emperor and leaning on his arm they head the promenade the emperor had given the hand of margaret of austria to his legitimate son but the crown prince though he continued in silence by the side of the young baroness soon resigned a hand which did not struggle to retain his clement marot was about to fall back into a less conspicuous part of the procession but the grand duke witnessing the regret of his loved consort condescendingly said we cannot afford to lose our poet and so vivian found himself walking behind madame carolina and on the left side of the young baroness louise of savoy followed with her son the king of france most of the ladies of the court and a crowd of officers among them montmorency and de lautrec after their majesties the king of england moves by his state unnoticed in the superior magnificence of wolsey pompeo colonna apologises to pope clement for having besieged his holiness in the castle of st angelo the elector of saxony and the prince of orange follow solyman the magnificent is attended by his admiral and bayards pure spirit almost quivers at the whispered treason of the constable of bourbon luther and melanchthon erasmus and rabelais cortez and pizarro correggio and michael angelo and a long train of dames and dons of all nations succeed so long that the amphitheatre cannot hold them and the procession that they may walk over the stage makes a short progress through an adjoining summerroom  just as the emperor and the fair queen are in the middle of the stage a wounded warrior with a face pale as an eclipsed moon a helmet on which is painted the sign of his sacred order a black mantle thrown over his left shoulder but not concealing his armour a sword in his right hand and an outstretched crucifix in his left rushes on the scene the procession suddenly halts all recognise emilius von aslingen and madame carolina blushes through her rouge when she perceives that so celebrated so interesting a character as ignatius loyola the founder of the jesuits has not been included in the allcomprehensive lists of her committee     chapter x   henry of england led the polonaise with louise of savoy margaret of austria would not join in it waltzing quickly followed the emperor seldom left the side of the queen of navarre and often conversed with her majestys poet the prince of asturias hovered for a moment round his fathers daughter as if he were summoning resolution to ask her to waltz once indeed he opened his mouth could it have been to speak but the young margaret gave no encouragement to this unusual exertion and philip of asturias looking if possible more sad and sombre than before skulked away the crown prince left the gardens and now a smile lit up every face except that of the young baroness the gracious grand duke unwilling to see a gloomy countenance anywhere tonight turned to vivian who was speaking to madame carolina and said gentle poet would that thou hadst some chanson or courtly compliment to chase the cloud which hovers on the brow of our muchloved daughter of austria your popularity sir continued the grand duke dropping his mock heroic vein and speaking in a much lower tone your popularity sir among the ladies of the court cannot be increased by any panegyric of mine nor am i insensible believe me to the assiduity and skill with which you have complied with my wishes in making our court agreeable to the relative of a man to whom we owe so much as mr beckendorff i am informed mr grey continued his royal highness that you have no intention of very speedily returning to your country i wish that i could count you among my peculiar attendants if you have an objection to live in the palace without performing your quota of duty to the state we shall have no difficulty in finding you an office and clothing you in our official costume think of this so saying with a gracious smile his royal highness leading madame carolina commenced a walk round the gardens  the young baroness did not follow them solyman the magnificent and bayard the irreproachable and barbarossa the pirate and bourbon the rebel immediately surrounded her few persons were higher ton than the turkish emperor and his admiral few persons talked more agreeable nonsense than the knight sans peur et sans reproche no person was more important than the warlike constable but their attention their amusement and their homage were tonight thrown away on the object of their observance the baroness listened to them without interest and answered them with brevity she did not even condescend as she had done before to enter into a war of words to mortify their vanity or exercise their wit she treated them neither with contempt nor courtesy if no smile welcomed their remarks at least her silence was not scornful and the most shallowheaded prater that fluttered around her felt that he was received with dignity and not with disdain awed by her conduct not one of them dared to be flippant and every one of them soon became dull the ornaments of the court of reisenburg the arbiters of ton and the lords of taste stared with astonishment at each other when they found to their mutual surprise that at one moment in such a select party universal silence pervaded in this state of affairs every one felt that his dignity required his speedy disappearance from the ladys presence the orientals taking advantage of bourbons returning once more to the charge with an often unanswered remark coolly walked away the chevalier made an adroit and honourable retreat by joining a passing party and the constable was the only one who being left in solitude and silence was finally obliged to make a formal bow and retire discomforted from the side of the only woman with whom he had ever condescended to fall in love leaning against the trunk of a tree at some little distance vivian grey watched the formation and dissolution of the young baroness levée with lively interest his eyes met the ladys as she raised them from the ground on von sohnspeer quitting her she immediately beckoned to vivian but without her usual smile he was directly at her side but she did not speak at last he said this is a most brilliant scene  you think so do you answered the lady in a tone and manner which almost made vivian believe for a moment that his friend mr beckendorff was at his side  decidedly his daughter thought he  you are not gay tonight said vivian  why should i be said the lady in a manner which would have made vivian imagine that his presence was as disagreeable to her as that of count von sohnspeer had not the lady herself invited his company  i suppose the scene is very brilliant continued the baroness after a few moments silence at least all here seem to think so except two persons  and who are they asked vivian  myself andthe crown prince i am almost sorry that i did not dance with him there seems a wonderful similarity in our dispositions  you are pleased to be severe tonight  and who shall complain when the first person that i satirize is myself  it is most considerate in you said vivian to undertake such an office for it is one which you yourself are alone capable of fulfilling the only person that can ever satirize your excellency is yourself and i think even then that in spite of your candour your selfexamination must please us with a selfpanegyric  nay a truce to compliments at least let me hear better things from you i cannot any longer endure the glare of these lamps and dresses your arm let us walk for a few minutes in the more retired and cooler parts of the gardens  the baroness and vivian left the amphitheatre by a different path to that by which the grand duke and madame carolina had quitted it they found the walks quite solitary for the royal party which was small contained the only persons who had yet left the stage  vivian and his companions strolled about for some time conversing on subjects of casual interest the baroness though no longer absent either in her manner or her conversation seemed depressed and vivian while he flattered himself that he was more entertaining than usual felt to his mortification that the lady was not entertained  i am afraid you find it dull here said he shall we return  oh no do not let us return we have so short a time to be together that we must not allow even one hour to be dull  as vivian was about to reply he heard the joyous voice of young maximilian it sounded very near the royal party was approaching the baronet expressed her earnest desire to avoid it and as to advance or to retreat in these labyrinthine walks was almost equally hazardous they retired into one of those green recesses which we have before mentioned indeed it was the very evergreen grove in the centre of which the nymph of the fountain watched for her loved carian youth a shower of moonlight fell on the marble statue and showed the nymph in an attitude of consummate skill her modesty struggling with her desire and herself crouching in her hitherto pure waters while her anxious ear listens for the bounding step of the regardless huntsman  the air is cooler here said the baroness or the sound of the falling water is peculiarly refreshing to my senses they have passed i rejoice that we did not return i do not think that i could have remained among those lamps another moment how singular actually to view with aversion a scene which appears to enchant all  a scene which i should have thought would have been particularly charming to you said vivian you are dispirited tonight  am i said the baroness i ought not to be not to be more dispirited than i ever am tonight i expected pleasure nothing has happened which i did not expect and everything which i did and yet i am sad do you think that happiness can ever be sad i think it must be so but whether i am sorrowful or happy i can hardly tell for it is only within these few days that i have known either grief or joy  it must be counted an eventful period in your existence which reckons in its brief hours a first acquaintance with such passions said vivian with a searching eye and an inquiring voice  yes an eventful period certainly an eventful period answered the baroness with a thoughtful air and in measured words  i cannot bear to see a cloud upon that brow said vivian have you forgotten how much was to be done tonight how eagerly you looked forward to its arrival how bitterly we were to regret the termination of the mimic empire  i have forgotten nothing would that i had i will not look grave i will be gay and yet when i remember how soon other mockery besides this splendid pageant must be terminated why should i look gay why may i not weep  nay if we are to moralise on worldly felicity i fear that instead of inspiriting you which is my wish i shall prove but a too congenial companion but such a theme is not for you  and why should it be for one who though he lecture me with such gravity and gracefulness can scarcely be entitled to play the part of mentor by the weight of years said the baroness with a smile for one who i trust who i should think as little deserved and was as little inured to sorrow as myself  to find that you have cause to grieve said vivian and to learn from you at the same time your opinion of my own lot prove what i have too often had the sad opportunity of observing that the face of man is scarcely more genuine and less deceitful than these masquerade dresses which we now wear  but you are not unhappy asked the baroness with a quick voice  not now said vivian  his companion seated herself on the marble balustrade which surrounded the fountain she did not immediately speak again and vivian was silent for he was watching her motionless countenance as her large brilliant eyes gazed with earnestness on the falling water sparkling in the moonlight surely it was not the mysterious portrait at beckendorffs that he beheld  she turned she exclaimed in an agitated voice o friend too lately found why have we met to part  to part dearest said he in a low and rapid voice and he gently took her hand to part and why should we part why  ask not your question is agony she tried to withdraw her hand he pressed it with renewed energy it remained in his she turned away her head and both were silent  o lady said vivian as he knelt at her side why are we not happy  his arm is round her waist gently he bends his head their speaking eyes meet and their trembling lips cling into a kiss  a seal of love and purity and faith i and the chaste moon need not have blushed as she lit up the countenances of the lovers  o lady why are we not happy  we are we are is not this happiness is not this joy is not this bliss bliss she continued in a low broken voice to which i have no right no title oh quit quit my hand happiness is not for me she extricated herself from his arm and sprang upon her feet alarm rather than affection was visible on her agitated features it seemed to cost her a great effort to collect her scattered senses the effort was made with pain but with success  forgive me she said in a hurried and indistinct tone forgive me i would speak but cannot not now at least we have been long away too long our absence will be remarked tonight tonight we must give up to the gratification of others but i will speak for yours for my own sake let us let us go you know that we are to be very gay tonight and gay we will be who shall prevent us at least the present hour is our own and when the future ones must be so sad why why trifle with this     chapter xi   the reader is not to suppose that vivian grey thought of the young baroness merely in the rapid scenes which we have sketched there were few moments in the day in which her image did not occupy his thoughts and which indeed he did not spend in her presence from the first her character had interested him his accidental but extraordinary acquaintance with beckendorff made him view any individual connected with that singular man with a far more curious feeling than could influence the young nobles of the court who were ignorant of the ministers personal character there was an evident mystery about the character and situation of the baroness which well accorded with the eccentric and romantic career of the prime minister of reisenburg of the precise nature of her connection with beckendorff vivian was wholly ignorant the world spoke of her as his daughter and the affirmation of madame carolina confirmed the worlds report her name was still unknown to him and although during the few moments that they had enjoyed an opportunity of conversing together alone vivian had made every exertion of which good breeding impelled by curiosity is capable and had devised many little artifices with which a schooled address is well acquainted to obtain it his exertions had hitherto been unsuccessful if there was a mystery the young lady was competent to preserve it and with all her naïveté her interesting ignorance of the world and her evidently uncontrollable spirit no hasty word ever fell from her cautious lips which threw any light on the objects of his inquiry though impetuous she was never indiscreet and often displayed a caution which was little in accordance with her youth and temper the last night had witnessed the only moment in which her passions seemed for a time to have struggled with and to have overcome her judgment but it was only for a moment that display of overpowering feeling had cost vivian a sleepless night and he is at this instant pacing up and down the chamber of his hotel thinking of that which he had imagined could exercise his thoughts no more  she was beautiful she loved him she was unhappy to be loved by any woman is flattering to the feelings of every man no matter how deeply he may have quaffed the bitter goblet of worldly knowledge the praise of a fool is incense to the wisest of us and though we believe ourselves brokenhearted it still delights us to find that we are loved the memory of violet fane was still as fresh as sweet to the mind of vivian grey as when he pressed her blushing cheek for the first and only time to love again really to love as he had done he once thought was impossible he thought so still the character of the baroness had interested him from the first her ignorance of mankind and her perfect acquaintance with the polished forms of society her extreme beauty her mysterious rank her proud spirit and impetuous feelings her occasional pensiveness her extreme waywardness had astonished perplexed and enchanted him but he had never felt in love it never for a moment had entered into his mind that his lonely bosom could again be a fit restingplace for one so lovely and so young scared at the misery which had always followed in his track he would have shuddered ere he again asked a human being to share his sad and blighted fortunes the partiality of the baroness for his society without flattering his vanity or giving rise to thoughts more serious than how he could most completely enchant for her the passing hour had certainly made the time passed in her presence the least gloomy which he had lately experienced at the same moment that he left the saloon of the palace he had supposed that his image quitted her remembrance and if she had again welcomed him with cheerfulness and cordiality he had felt that his reception was owing to not being perhaps quite as frivolous as the count of eberstein and rather more amusing than the baron of gernsbach  it was therefore with the greatest astonishment that last night he had found that he was loved loved too by this beautiful and haughty girl who had treated the advances of the most distinguished nobles with illconcealed scorn and who had so presumed upon her dubious relationship to the bourgeois minister that nothing but her own surpassing loveliness and her parents allengrossing influence could have excused or authorised her conduct  vivian had yielded to the magic of the moment and had returned the feelings apparently no sooner expressed than withdrawn had he left the gardens of the palace the baronesss plighted lover he might perhaps have deplored his rash engagement and the sacred image of his first and hallowed love might have risen up in judgment against his violated affection but how had he and the interesting stranger parted he was rejected even while his affection was returned and while her flattering voice told him that he alone could make her happy she had mournfully declared that happiness could not be hers how was this could she be anothers her agitation at the opera often the object of his thought quickly occurred to him it must be so ah anothers and who this rival this proud possessor of a heart which could not beat for him madame carolinas declaration that the baroness must be married off was at this moment remembered her marked observation that von sohnspeer was no son of beckendorffs not forgotten the field marshal too was the valued friend of the minister and it did not fail to occur to vivian that it was not von sohnspeers fault that his attendance on the baroness was not as constant as his own indeed the unusual gallantry of the commanderinchief had been the subject of many a joke among the young lords of the court and the reception of his addresses by their unmerciful object not unobserved or unspared but as for poor von sohnspeer what could be expected as emilius von aslingen observed from a man whose softest compliment was as long loud and obscure as a birthday salute  no sooner was the affair clear to vivian no sooner was he convinced that a powerful obstacle existed to the love or union of himself and the baroness than he began to ask what right the interests of third persons had to interfere between the mutual affection of any individuals he thought of her in the moonlight garden struggling with her pure and natural passion he thought of her exceeding beauty her exceeding love he beheld this rare and lovely creature in the embrace of von sohnspeer he turned from the picture in disgust and indignation she was his nature had decreed it she should be the bride of no other man sooner than yield her up he would beard beckendorff himself in his own retreat and run every hazard and meet every danger which the ardent imagination of a lover could conceive was he madly to reject the happiness which providence or destiny or chance had at length offered him if the romance of boyhood could never be realised at least with this engaging being for his companion he might pass through his remaining years in calmness and in peace his trials were perhaps over alas this is the last delusion of unhappy men  vivian called at the palace but the fatigues of the preceding night prevented either of the ladies from being visible in the evening he joined a small and select circle the party indeed only consisted of the grand duke madame their visitors and the usual attendants himself and von sohnspeer the quiet of the little circle did not more strikingly contrast with the noise and glare and splendour of the last night than did vivians subdued reception by the baroness with her agitated demeanour in the garden she was cordial but calm he found it quite impossible to gain even one moments private conversation with her madame carolina monopolised his attention as much to favour the views of the field marshal as to discuss the comparative merits of pope as a moralist and a poet and vivian had the mortification of observing his odious rival whom he now thoroughly detested discharge without ceasing his royal salutes in the impatient ear of beckendorffs lovely daughter  towards the conclusion of the evening a chamberlain entered the room and whispered his mission to the baroness she immediately rose and quitted the apartment as the party was breaking up she again entered her countenance was agitated madame carolina was in the art of being overwhelmed with the compliments of the grand marshal and vivian seized the opportunity of reaching the baroness after a few hurried sentences she dropped her glove vivian gave it her so many persons were round them that it was impossible to converse except on the most common topics the glove was again dropped  i see said the baroness with a meaning look that you are but a recreant knight or else you would not part with a ladys glove so easily  vivian gave a rapid glance round the room no one was observing him and the glove was immediately concealed he hurried home rushed up the staircase of the hotel ordered lights locked the door and with a sensation of indescribable anxiety tore the precious glove from his bosom seized opened and read the enclosed and following note it was written in pencil in a hurried hand and some of the words were repeated  i leave the court tonight he is here himself no art can postpone my departure much much i wish to see you to say to say to you he is to have an interview with the grand duke tomorrow morning dare you come to his place in his absence you know the private road he goes by the high road and calls in his way on a forest councillor it is the white house by the barrier you know it watch him tomorrow morning about nine or ten i should think here here and then for heavens sake let me see you dare everything fail not mind by the private road beware the other you know the ground god bless you  sybilla     chapter xii   vivian read the note over a thousand times he could not retire to rest he called essper george and gave him all necessary directions for the morning about three oclock vivian lay down on a sofa and slept for a few hours he started often in his short and feverish slumber his dreams were unceasing and inexplicable at first von sohnspeer was their natural hero but soon the scene shifted vivian was at ems walking under the wellremembered limetrees and with the baroness suddenly although it was midday the sun became large bloodred and fell out of the heavens his companion screamed a man rushed forward with a drawn sword it was the idiot crown prince of reisenburg vivian tried to oppose him but without success the infuriated ruffian sheathed his weapon in the heart of the baroness vivian shrieked and fell upon her body and to his horror found himself embracing the cold corpse of violet fane  vivian and essper mounted their horses about seven oclock at eight they had reached a small inn near the forest councillors house where vivian was to remain until essper had watched the entrance of the minister it was a few minutes past nine when essper returned with the joyful intelligence that owlface and his master had been seen to enter the courtyard vivian immediately mounted max and telling essper to keep a sharp watch he set spurs to his horse  now max my good steed each minute is golden serve thy master well he patted the horses neck the animals erected ears proved how well it understood its masters wishes and taking advantage of the loose bridle which was confidently allowed it the horse sprang rather than galloped to the ministers residence nearly an hour however was lost in gaining the private road for vivian after the caution in the baronesss letter did not dare the high road  he is galloping up the winding rural lane where he met beckendorff on the second morning of his visit he has reached the little gate and following the example of the grand duke ties max at the entrance he dashes over the meadows not following the path but crossing straight through the long dewy grass he leaps over the light iron railing he is rushing up the walk he takes a rapid glance in passing at the little summerhouse the blue passionflower is still blooming the house is in sight a white handkerchief is waving from the drawingroom window he sees it fresh wings are added to its course he dashes through a bed of flowers frightens the white peacock darts through the library window and is in the drawing room  the baroness was there pale and agitated she stood beneath the mysterious picture with one arm leaning on the old carved mantelpiece overcome by her emotions she did not move forward to meet him as he entered but vivian observed neither her constraint nor her agitation  sybilla dearest sybilla say you are mine  he seized her hand she struggled not to disengage herself her head sank upon her arm which rested upon his shoulder overpowered she sobbed convulsively he endeavoured to calm her but her agitation increased and minutes elapsed ere she seemed to be even sensible of his presence at length she became more calm and apparently making a struggle to compose herself she raised her head and said this is very weak let us walk for a moment about the room  at this moment vivian was seized by the throat with a strong grasp he turned round it was mr beckendorff with a face deadly white his full eyes darting from their sockets like a hungry snakes and the famous italian dagger in his right hand  villain said he in the low voice of fatal passion villain is this your destiny  vivians first thoughts were for the baroness and turning his head from beckendorff he looked with the eye of anxious love to his companion but instead of fainting instead of being overwhelmed by this terrible interruption she seemed on the contrary to have suddenly regained her natural spirit and selfpossession the blood had returned to her hitherto pale cheek and the fire to an eye before dull with weeping she extricated herself immediately from vivians encircling arm and by so doing enabled him to have struggled had it been necessary more equally with the powerful grasp of his assailant  stand off sir said the baroness with an air of inexpressible dignity and a voice which even at this crisis seemed to anticipate that it would be obeyed stand off sir stand off i command you  beckendorff for one moment was motionless he then gave her a look of piercing earnestness threw vivian rather than released him from his hold and flung the dagger with a bitter smile into the corner of the room well madam said he in a choking voice you are obeyed  mr grey continued the baroness i regret that this outrage should have been experienced by you because you have dared to serve me my presence should have preserved you from this contumely but what are we to expect from those who pride themselves upon being the sons of slaves you shall hear further from me so saying the lady bowing to vivian and sweeping by the minister with a glance of indescribable disdain quitted the apartment as she was on the point of leaving the room vivian was standing against the wall with a pale face and folded arms beckendorff with his back to the window his eyes fixed on the ground and vivian to his astonishment perceived what escaped the ministers notice that while the lady bade him adieu with one hand she made rapid signs with the other to some unknown person in the garden  mr beckendorff and vivian were left alone and the latter was the first to break silence  mr beckendorff said he in a calm voice considering the circumstances under which you have found me in your house this morning i should have known how to excuse and to forget any irritable expressions which a moment of ungovernable passion might have inspired i should have passed them over unnoticed but your unjustifiable behaviour has exceeded that line of demarcation which sympathy with human feelings allows even men of honour to recognise you have disgraced both me and yourself by giving me a blow it is as that lady well styled it an outrage an outrage which the blood of any other man but yourself could only obliterate from my memory but while i am inclined to be indulgent to your exalted station and your peculiar character i at the same time expect and now wait for an apology  an apology said beckendorff now beginning to stamp up and down the room an apology shall it be made to you sir or the archduchess  the archduchess said vivian good god what can you mean did i hear you right  i said the archduchess answered beckendorff with firmness a princess of the house of austria and the pledged wife of his royal highness the crown prince of reisenburg perhaps you may now think that other persons have to apologise  mr beckendorff said vivian i am overwhelmed i declare upon my honour  stop sir you have said too much already  but mr beckendorff surely you will allow me to explain  sir there is no need of explanation i know everything more than you do yourself you can have nothing to explain to me and i presume you are now fully aware of the impossibility of again speaking to her it is at present within an hour of noon before sunset you must be twenty miles from the court so far you will be attended do not answer me you know my power a remonstrance only and i write to vienna your progress shall be stopped throughout the south of europe for her sake this business will be hushed up an important and secret mission will be the accredited reason of your leaving reisenburg this will be confirmed by your official attendant who will be an envoys courier farewell  as mr beckendorff quitted the room his confidential servant the messenger of turriparva entered and with the most respectful bow informed vivian that the horses were ready in about three hours time vivian grey followed by the government messenger stopped at his hotel the landlord and waiters bowed with increased obsequiousness on seeing him so attended and in a few minutes reisenburg was ringing with the news that his appointment to the undersecretaryship of state was now a settled thing     book viii   chapter i   the landlord of the grand hotel of the four nations at reisenburg was somewhat consoled for the sudden departure of his distinguished guest by selling the plenipotentiary a travelling carriage lately taken for a doubtful bill from a gambling russian general at a large profit in this convenient vehicle in the course of a couple of hours after his arrival in the city was mr vivian grey borne through the gate of the allies essper george who had reached the hotel about half an hour after his master followed behind the carriage on his hack leading max the courier cleared the road before and expedited the arrival of the special envoy of the grand duke of reisenburg at the point of his destination by ordering the horses clearing the barriers and paying the postilions in advance vivian had never travelled before with such style and speed  our hero covered himself up with his cloak and drew his travelling cap over his eyes though it was one of the hottest days of this singularly hot autumn entranced in a reverie the only figure that occurred to his mind was the young archduchess and the only sounds that dwelt on his ear were the words of beckendorff but neither to the person of the first nor to the voice of the second did he annex any definite idea  after some hours travelling which to vivian seemed both an age and a minute he was roused from his stupor by the door of his calèche being opened he shook himself as a man does who has awakened from a benumbing and heavy sleep although his eyes were the whole time wide open the disturbing intruder was his courier who bowing with his hat in hand informed his excellency that he was now on the frontier of reisenburg regretting that he was under the necessity of quitting his excellency he begged to present him with his passport it is made out for vienna continued the messenger a private pass sir of the prime minister and will entitle you to the greatest consideration  the carriage was soon again advancing rapidly to the next posthouse when after they had proceeded about half a mile essper george calling loudly from behind the drivers suddenly stopped just as vivian to whose tortured mind the rapid movement of the carriage was some relief for it produced an excitement which prevented thought was about to inquire the cause of this stoppage essper george rode up to the calèche  kind sir said he with a peculiar look i have a packet for you  a packet from whom speak give it me  hush softly good master here am i about to commit rank treason for your sake and a hasty word is the only reward of my rashness  nay nay good essper try me not now  i will not kind sir but the truth is i could not give you the packet while that doublefaced knave was with us or even while he was in sight in good truth as master rodolph was wont to say  but of this packet  fairly and softly good sir as hunsdrich the porter said when i would have drunk the mulled wine while he was on the cold staircase  essper do you mean to enrage me  by st hubert as that worthy gentleman the grand marshal was in the habit of swearing i  this is too much what are the idle sayings of these people to me  nay nay kind sir they do but show that each of us has his own way of telling a story and that he who would hear a tale must let the tellers breath come out of his own nostrils  well essper speak on stranger things have happened to me than to be reproved by my own servant  nay kind master say not a bitter word to me because you have slipped out of a scrape with your head on your shoulders the packet is from mr beckendorffs daughter  ah why did you not give it me before  why do i give it you now because i am a fool that is why what you wanted it when that doublefaced scoundrel was watching every eyelash of yours as it moved from the breath of a fly a fellow who can see as well at the back of his head as from his face i should like to poke out his front eyes to put him on an equality with the rest of mankind he it was who let the old gentleman know of your visit this morning and i suspect that he has been nearer your limbs of late than you have imagined every dog has his day and the oldest pig must look for the knife the devil was once cheated on sunday and i have been too sharp for puss in boots and his mousetrap prowling about the forest councillors house i saw your new servant sir gallop in and his old master soon gallop out i was off as quick as they but was obliged to leave my horse within two miles of the house and then trust to my legs i crept through the shrubs like a land tortoise but of course too late to warn you however i was in for the death and making signs to the young lady who directly saw that i was a friend bless her she is as quick as a partridge i left you to settle it with papa and after all did that which i suppose you intended sir to do yourself made my way into the young ladys bedchamber  hold your tongue sir and give me the packet  there it is and now we will go on but we must stay an hour at the next post if your honour pleases not to sleep there for both max and my own hack have had a sharp days work  vivian tore open the packet it contained a long letter written on the night of her return to beckendorffs she had stayed up the whole night writing it was to have been forwarded to vivian in case of their not being able to meet in the enclosure were a few hurried lines written since the catastrophe they were these may this safely reach you can you ever forgive me the enclosed you will see was intended for you in case of our not meeting it anticipated sorrow yet what were its anticipations to our reality  the archduchess letter was evidently written under the influence of agitated feelings we omit it because as the mystery of her character is now explained a great portion of her communication would be irrelevant to our tale she spoke of her exalted station as a woman that station which so many women envy in a spirit of agonising bitterness a royal princess is only the most flattered of state victims she is a political sacrifice by which enraged governments are appeased wavering allies conciliated and ancient amities confirmed debarred by her rank and her education from looking forward to that exchange of equal affection which is the great end and charm of female existence no individual finds more fatally and feels more keenly that pomp is not felicity and splendour not content  deprived of all those sources of happiness which seem inherent in woman the wife of the sovereign sometimes seeks in politics and in pleasure a means of excitement which may purchase oblivion but the political queen is a rare character she must possess an intellect of unusual power and her lot must be considered as an exception in the fortunes of female royalty even the political queen generally closes an agitated career with a broken heart and for the unhappy votary of pleasure who owns her cold duty to a royal husband we must not forget that even in the most dissipated courts the conduct of the queen is expected to be decorous and that the instances are not rare where the wife of the monarch has died on the scaffold or in a dungeon or in exile because she dared to be indiscreet where all were debauched but for the great majority of royal wives they exist without a passion they have nothing to hope nothing to fear nothing to envy nothing to want nothing to confide nothing to hate and nothing to love even their duties though multitudinous are mechanical and while they require much attention occasion no anxiety amusement is their moment of great emotion and for them amusement is rare for amusement is the result of equal companionship thus situated they are doomed to become frivolous in their pursuits and formal in their manners and the court chaplain or the court confessor is the only person who can prove they have a soul by convincing them that it will be saved  the young archduchess had assented to the proposition of marriage with the crown prince of reisenburg without opposition as she was convinced that requesting her assent was only a courteous form of requiring her compliance there was nothing outrageous to her feelings in marrying a man whom she had never seen because her education from her tenderest years had daily prepared her for such an event moreover she was aware that if she succeeded in escaping from the offers of the crown prince of reisenburg she would soon be under the necessity of assenting to those of some other suitor and if proximity to her own country accordance with its sentiments and manners and previous connection with her own house were taken into consideration an union with the family of reisenburg was even desirable it was to be preferred at least to one which brought with it a foreign husband and a foreign clime a strange language and strange customs the archduchess a girl of ardent feelings and lively mind had not however agreed to become that allcommanding slave a queen without a stipulation she required that she might be allowed previous to her marriage to visit her future court incognita this singular and unparalleled proposition was not easily acceded to but the opposition with which it was received only tended to make the young princess more determined to be gratified in her caprice her imperial highness did not pretend that any end was to be obtained by this unusual procedure and indeed she had no definite purpose in requesting it to be permitted it was originally the mere whim of the moment and had it not been strongly opposed it would not have been strenuously insisted upon as it was the young archduchess persisted threatened and grew obstinate and the greyheaded negotiators of the marriage desirous of its speedy completion and not having a more tractable tool ready to supply her place at length yielded to her bold importunity great difficulty however was experienced in carrying her wishes into execution by what means and in what character she was to appear at court so as not to excite suspicion or occasion discovery were often discussed without being resolved upon at length it became necessary to consult mr beckendorff the upper lip of the prime minister of reisenburg curled as the imperial minister detailed the caprice and contumacy of the princess and treating with the greatest contempt this girlish whim mr beckendorff ridiculed those by whom it had been humoured with no suppressed derision the consequence of his conduct was an interview with the future grand duchess and the consequence of his interview an unexpected undertaking on his part to arrange the visit according to her highnesss desires  the archduchess had not yet seen the crown prince but six miniatures and a whole length portrait had prepared her for not meeting an adonis or a baron trenck and that was all for never had the correggio of the age of charles the fifth better substantiated his claims to the office of court painter than by these accurate semblances of his royal highness in which his hump was subdued into a grecian bend and his lacklustre eyes seemed beaming with tenderness and admiration his betrothed bride stipulated with mr beckendorff that the fact of her visit should be known only to himself and the grand duke and before she appeared at court she had received the personal pledge both of himself and his royal highness that the affair should be kept a complete secret from the crown prince  most probably on her first introduction to her future husband all the romantic plans of the young archduchess to excite an involuntary interest in his heart vanished but how this may be it is needless for us to inquire for that same night introduced another character into her romance for whom she was perfectly unprepared and whose appearance totally disorganised its plot  her inconsiderate her unjustifiable conduct in tampering with that individuals happiness and affection was what the young and haughty archduchess deplored in the most energetic the most feeling and the most humble spirit and anticipating that after this painful disclosure they would never meet again she declared that for his sake alone she regretted what had passed and praying that he might be happier than herself she supplicated to be forgiven and forgotten  vivian read the archduchesss letter over and over again and then put it in his breast at first he thought that he had lived to shed another tear but he was mistaken in a few minutes he found himself quite roused from his late overwhelming stupor remorse or regret for the past care or caution for the future seemed at the same moment to have fled from his mind he looked up to heaven with a wild smile half of despair and half of defiance it seemed to imply that fate had now done her worst and that he had at last the satisfaction of knowing himself to he the most unfortunate and unhappy being that ever existed when a man at the same time believes in and sneers at his destiny we may be sure that he considers his condition past redemption     chapter ii   they stopped for an hour at the next post according to esspers suggestion indeed he proposed resting there for the night for both men and beasts much required repose but vivian panted to reach vienna to which city two days travelling would now carry him his passions were so roused and his powers of reflection so annihilated that while he had determined to act desperately he was unable to resolve upon anything desperate whether on his arrival at the austrian capital he should plunge into dissipation or into the danube was equally uncertain he had some thought of joining the greeks or turks no matter which probably the latter or perhaps of serving in the americas the idea of returning to england never once entered his mind he expected to find letters from his father at vienna and he almost regretted it for in his excessive misery it was painful to be conscious that a being still breathed who was his friend  it was a fine moonlight night but the road was mountainous and in spite of all the encouragement of vivian and all the consequent exertions of the postilion they were upwards of two hours and a half going these eight miles to get on any farther tonight was quite impossible esspers horse was fairly knocked up and even max visibly distressed the posthouse was fortunately an inn it was not at a village and as far as the travellers could learn not near one and its appearance did not promise very pleasing accommodation essper who had scarcely tasted food for nearly eighteen hours was not highly delighted with the prospect before them his anxiety however was not merely selfish he was as desirous that his young master should be refreshed by a good nights rest as himself and anticipating that he should have to exercise his skill in making a couch for vivian in the carriage he proceeded to crossexamine the postmaster on the possibility of his accommodating them the host was a piouslooking personage in a black velvet cap with a singularly meek and charitable expression of countenance his long black hair was exquisitely braided and he wore round his neck a collar of pewter medals all of which had been recently sprinkled with holy water and blessed under the petticoat of the saintly virgin for the postmaster had only just returned from a pilgrimage to the celebrated shrine of the black lady of altoting  good friend said essper looking him cunningly in the face i fear that we must order horses on you can hardly accommodate two  good friend answered the innkeeper and he crossed himself very reverently at the same time it is not for man to fear but to hope  if your beds were as good as your adages said essper george laughing in good truth as a friend of mine would say i would sleep here tonight  prithee friend continued the innkeeper kissing a medal of his collar very devoutly what accommodation dost thou lack  why said essper in the way of accommodation little for two excellent beds will content us but in the way of refreshment by st hubert as another friend of mine would swear he would be a bold man who would engage to be as hungry before his dinner as i shall be after my supper  friend said the innkeeper our lady forbid that thou shouldst leave our walls tonight for the accommodation we have more than sufficient and as for the refreshment by holy mass we had a priest tarry here last night and he left his rosary behind i will comfort my soul by telling my beads over the kitchenfire and for every paternoster my wife shall give thee a rasher of kid and for every ave a tumbler of augsburg which our lady forget me if i did not myself purchase but yesterday sennight from the pious fathers of the convent of st florian  i take thee at thy word honest sir said essper by the creed i liked thy appearance from the first nor wilt thou find me unwilling when my voice has taken its supper to join thee in some pious hymn or holy canticle and now for the beds  there is the green room the best bedroom in my house said the innkeeper holy mary forget me if in that same bed have not stretched their legs more valorous generals more holy prelates and more distinguished councillors of our lord the emperor than in any bed in all austria  that then for my master and for myself  hum said the host looking very earnestly in esspers face i should have thought that thou wert one more anxious after dish and flagon than curtain and eiderdown  by my mother i love good cheer said essper earnestly and want it more at this moment than any knave that ever yet starved but if thou hast not a bed to let me stretch my legs on after fourandtwenty hours hard riding by holy virgin i will have horses on to vienna  our black lady forbid said the innkeeper with a quick voice and with rather a dismayed look said i that thou shouldst not have a bed st florian desert me if i and my wife would not sooner sleep in the chimneycorner than thou shouldst miss one wink of thy slumbers  in one word have you a bed  have i a bed where slept i should like to know the viceprincipal of the convent of molk on the day before the last holy ascension the waters were out in the morning and when will my wife forget what his reverence was pleased to say when he took his leave good woman said he my duty calls me but the weather is cold and between ourselves i am used to great feasts and i should have no objection if i were privileged to stay and to eat again of thy red cabbage and cream what say you to that do you think we have got beds now you shall sleep tonight sir like an aulic councillor  this adroit introduction of the red cabbage and cream settled everything when men are wearied and famished they have no inclination to be incredulous and in a few moments vivian was informed by his servant that the promised accommodation was satisfactory and having locked up the carriage and wheeled it into a small outhouse he and essper were ushered by their host into a room which as is usual in small german inns in the south served at the same time both for kitchen and saloon the fire was lit in a platform of brick raised in the centre of the floor the sky was visible through the chimney which although of a great breadth below gradually narrowed to the top a family of wandering bohemians consisting of the father and mother and three children were seated on the platform when vivian entered the man was playing on a coarse wooden harp without which the bohemians seldom travel the music ceased as the new guests came into the room and the bohemian courteously offered his place at the fire to our hero who however declined disturbing the family group a small table and a couple of chairs were placed in a corner of the room by the innkeepers wife a bustling active dame who apparently found no difficulty in laying the cloth dusting the furniture and cooking the supper at the same time at this table vivian and his servant seated themselves nor indeed did the cookery discredit the panegyric of the reverend viceprincipal of the convent of molk  alike wearied in mind and body vivian soon asked for his bed which though not exactly fitted for an aulic councillor as the good host perpetually avowed it to be nevertheless afforded decent accommodation  the bohemian family retired to the hayloft and essper george would have followed his masters example had not the kind mistress of the house tempted him to stay behind by the production of a new platter of rashers indeed he never remembered meeting with such hospitable people as the postmaster and his wife they had evidently taken a fancy to him and though extremely wearied the lively little essper endeavoured between his quick mouthfuls and long draughts to reward and encourage their kindness by many a good story and sharp joke with all these both mine host and his wife were exceedingly amused seldom containing their laughter and frequently protesting by the sanctity of various saints that this was the pleasantest night and essper the pleasantest fellow that they had ever met with  eat eat my friend said his host by the mass thou hast travelled far and fill thy glass and pledge with me our black lady of altoting by holy cross i have hung up this week in her chapel a garland of silk roses and have ordered to be burnt before her shrine three pounds of perfumed was tapers fill again fill again and thou too good mistress a bard days work hast thou had a glass of wine will do thee no harm join me with our new friend pledge we together the holy fathers of st florian my worldly patrons and my spiritual pastors let us pray that his reverence the subprior may not have his christmas attack of gout in the stomach and a better health to poor father felix fill again fill again this augsburg is somewhat acid we will have a bottle of hungary mistress fetch us the bellglasses and here to the reverend viceprincipal of molk our good friend when will my wife forget what he said to her on the morning of last holy ascension fill again fill again  inspired by the convivial spirit of the pious and jolly postmaster essper george soon forgot his threatened visit to his bedroom and ate and drank laughed and joked as if he were again with his friend master rodolph but wearied nature at length avenged herself for this unnatural exertion and leaning back in his chair he was in the course of an hour overcome by one of those dead and heavy slumbers the effect of the united influence of fatigue and intemperance in short it was like the midnight sleep of a foxhunter  no sooner had our pious votary of the black lady of altoting observed the effect of his hungary wine than making a wellunderstood sign to his wife be took up the chair of essper in his brawny arms and preceded by mrs postmistress with a lantern he left the room with his guest esspers hostess led and lighted the way to an outhouse which occasionally served as a coachhouse a stable and a lumberroom it had no window and the lantern afforded the only light which exhibited its present contents in one corner was a donkey tied up belonging to the bohemian under a hayrack was a large childs cradle it was of a remarkable size having been made for twins near it was a low wooden sheeptank half filled with water and which had been placed there for the refreshment of the dog and his feathered friends who were roosting in the rack  the pious innkeeper very gently lowered to the ground the chair on which essper was soundly sleeping and then having crossed himself he took up our friend with great tenderness and solicitude and dexterously fitted him in the huge cradle  about an hour past midnight essper george awoke he was lying on his back and very unwell and on trying to move found that he was rocking his late adventure was obliterated from his memory and the strange movement united with his peculiar indisposition left him no doubt that he was on board ship as is often the case when we are tipsy or nervous essper had been woke by the fright of falling from some immense height and finding that his legs had no sensation for they were quite benumbed he concluded that he had fallen down the hatchway that his legs were broken and himself jammed in between some logs of wood in the hold and so he began to cry lustily to those above to come down to his rescue  o essper george thought he how came you to set foot on salt timber again had not you had enough of it in the mediterranean and the turkish seas that you must be getting aboard this lubberly dutch galliot for i am sure shes dutch by being so low in the water well they may talk of a sealife but for my part i never saw the use of the sea many a sad heart it has caused and many a sick stomach has it occasioned the boldest sailor climbs on board with a heavy soul and leaps on land with a light spirit o thou indifferent ape of earth thy houses are of wood and thy horses of canvas thy roads have no landmarks and thy highways no inns thy hills are green without grass and wet without showers and as for food what art thou o bully ocean but the stable of horsefishes the stall of cowfishes the sty of hogfishes and the kennel of dogfishes commend me to a freshwater dish for meagre days seaweeds stewed with chalk may be savoury stuff for a merman but for my part give me red cabbage and cream and as for drink a man may live in the midst of thee his whole life and die for thirst at the end of it besides thou blasphemous salt lake where is thy religion where are thy churches thou heretic so saying essper made a desperate effort to crawl up the hold his exertion set the cradle rocking with renewed violence and at lust dashing against the sheeptank that pastoral piece of furniture was overset and part of its contents poured upon the inmate of the cradle  sprung a leak in the hold by st nicholas bawled out essper george caulkers ahoy  at this moment three or four fowls roused by the fall of the tank and the consequent shouts of essper began fluttering about the rack and at last perched upon the cradle the live stock got loose shouted essper and the breeze getting stiffer every instant where is the captain i will see him i am not one of the crew i belong to the court i must have cracked my skull when i fell like a lubber down that confounded hatchway egad i feel as if i had been asleep and been dreaming i was at court  the sound of heavy footsteps was now over his head these noises were at once an additional proof that he was in the hold and an additional stimulus to his calls to those on deck in fact these sounds were occasioned by the bohemians who always rose before break of day and consequently in a few minutes the door of the stable opened and the bohemian with a lantern in his hand entered  what do you want cried essper  i want my donkey  you do said essper youre the purser i suppose detected keeping a jackass among the poultry eating all the food of our live stock and we having kid every day though both my legs are off ill have a fling at you and so saying essper aided by the light of the lantern scrambled out of the cradle and taking up the sheeptank sent it straight at the astonished bohemians head the aim was good and the man fell more however from fright than injury seizing his lantern which had fallen out of his hand essper escaped through the stable door and rushed into the house he found himself in the kitchen the noise of his entrance roused the landlord and his wife who had been sleeping by the fire since not having a single bed beside their own they had given that up to vivian the countenance of the innkeeper effectually dispelled the clouds which had been fast clearing off from esspers intellect giving one wide stare and then rubbing his eyes the truth lighted upon him and so he sent the bohemians lantern at his landlords head the postmaster seized the poker and the postmistress a faggot and as the bohemian who had now recovered himself had entered in the rear essper george stood a fair chance of receiving a thorough drubbing had not his master roused by the suspicious noises and angry sounds which had reached his room entered the kitchen with his pistols     chapter iii   as it was now morning vivian did not again retire to rest but took advantage of the disturbance in the inn to continue his route at an earlier hour than he had previously intended  essper when he found himself safely mounted lagged behind a few minutes to vent his spleen against the innkeepers wife  may st florian confound me madam said essper addressing himself to the lady in the window if ever i beheld so ugly a witch as yourself pious friend thy chaplet of roses was ill bestowed and thou needest not have travelled so far to light thy wax tapers at the shrine of the black lady at altoting for by the beauty of holiness an image of ebony is mother of pearl to that sootface whom thou callest thy wife fare thee well thou couple of saintly sinners and may the next traveller who tarries in the den of thieves qualify thee for canonisation by thy wifes admiring pastor the cabbageeating viceprincipal of molk  before the end of an hour they had to ford a rivulet running between two high banks the scenery just here was particularly lovely and vivians attention was so engrossed by it that he did not observe the danger which he was about to incur  on the left of the road a high range of rocky mountains abruptly descended into an open but broken country and the other side of the road was occasionally bounded by low undulating hills partially covered with dwarf woods not high enough to obstruct the view of the distant horizon rocky knolls jutted out near the base of the mountains and on the top of one of them overlooked by a gigantic grey peak stood an ancient and still inhabited feudal castle round the base of this insulated rock a rustic village peeped above the encircling nutwoods its rising smoke softening the hard features of the naked crag on the side of the village nearest to vivian a bold sheet of water discharged itself in three separate falls between the ravine of a wooded mountain and flowing round the village as a fine broad river expanded before it reached the foundation of the castled rock into a long and deep lake which was also fed by numerous streams the gulleys only of which were now visible down the steep sides of the mountains their springs having been long dried up  vivians view was interrupted by his sudden descent into the bed of the rivulet one of the numerous branches of the mountain torrent and by a crash which as immediately ensued the spring of his carriage was broken the carriage fell over but vivian sustained no injury and while essper george rode forward to the village for assistance his master helped the postilion to extricate the horses and secure them on the opposite bank they had done all that was in their power some time before essper returned and vivian who had seated himself on some tangled beechroots was prevented growing impatient by contemplating the enchanting scenery the postilion on the contrary who had travelled this road even day of his life and who found no gratification in gazing upon rocks woods and waterfalls lit his pipe and occasionally talked to his horses so essential an attribute of the beautiful is novelty essper at length made his appearance attended by five or six peasants dressed in holiday costume with some fanciful decorations their broad hats wreathed with wild flowers their short brown jackets covered with buttons and fringe and various coloured ribbons streaming from their knees  well sir the grandson is born the day the grandfather dies a cloudy morning has often a bright sunset and though we are now sticking in a ditch by the aid of st florian we may be soon feasting in a castle come my merry men i did not bring you here to show your ribbons the sooner you help us out of this scrape the sooner you will be again dancing with the pretty maidens on the green lend a hand  the calèche appeared to be so much shattered that they only ventured to put in one horse and vivian leaving his carriage in charge of essper and the postilion mounted max and rode to the village attended by the peasants he learnt from them on the way that they were celebrating the marriage of the daughter of their lord who having been informed of the accident had commanded them to go immediately to the gentlemans assistance and then conduct him to the castle  they crossed the river over a light stone bridge of three arches the keystone of the centre one being decorated with a splendidly sculptured shield  this bridge appears to be very recently built said vivian to one of his conductors  it was opened sir for the first time yesterday to admit the bridegroom of my young lady and the foundation stone was laid on the day she was born  i see that your good lord was determined that it should be a solid structure  why sir it was necessary that the foundation should be strong because three succeeding winters it was washed away by the rush of that mountain torrent turn this way if you please sir through the village  vivian was much struck by the appearance of the little settlement as he rode through it it did not consist of more than fifty houses but they were all detached and each beautifully embowered in trees the end of the village came upon a large rising green leading up to the only accessible side of the castle it presented a most animated scene being covered with various groups all intent upon different rustic amusements an immense pole the stem of a gigantic firtree was fixed nearly in the centre of the green and crowned with a chaplet the reward of the most active young man of the village whose agility might enable him to display his gallantry by presenting it to his mistress she being allowed to wear it during the remainder of the sports the middleaged men were proving their strength by raising weights while the elders of the village joined in the calmer and more scientific diversion of skittles which in austria are played with bowls and pins of very great size others were dancing others sitting under tents chattering or taking refreshments some were walking in pairs anticipating the speedy celebration of a wedding day happier to them if less gay to others even the tenderest infants on this festive day seemed conscious of some unusual cause of excitement and many an urchin throwing himself forward in a vain attempt to catch in elder brother or a laughing sister tried the strength of his leadingstrings and rolled over crowing in the soft grass  at the end of the green a splendid tent was erected with a large white bridal flag waving from its top embroidered in gold with a true lovers knot from this pavilion came forth to welcome the strangers the lord of the village he was a tall but thin bending figure with a florid benevolent countenance and a quantity of long white hair this venerable person cordially offered his hand to vivian regretted his accident but expressed much pleasure that he had come to partake of their happiness yesterday continued he was my daughters wedding day and both myself and our humble friends are endeavouring to forget in this festive scene our approaching loss and separation if you had come yesterday you would have assisted at the opening of my new bridge pray what do you think of it but i will show it to you myself which i assure you will give me great pleasure at present let me introduce you to my family who will be quite happy to see you it is a pity that you have missed the regatta my daughter is just going to reward the successful candidate you see the boats upon the lake the one with the white and purple streamer was the conqueror you will have the pleasure too of seeing my soninlaw i am sure you will like him he quite enjoys our sports we shall have a fête champêtre tomorrow and a dance on the green tonight  the old gentleman paused for want of breath and having stood a moment to recover himself he introduced his new guests to the inmates of the tent first his maiden sister a softened facsimile of himself behind her stood his beautiful and blushing daughter the youthful bride wearing on her head a coronal of white roses and supported by three bridesmaids the only relief to whose snowy dresses were large bouquets on their left side the bridegroom was at first shaded by the curtain but as he came forward vivian started when he recognised his heidelburg friend eugene von konigstein  their mutual delight and astonishment were so great that for an instant neither of them could speak but when the old man learnt from his soninlaw that the stranger was his most valued and intimate friend and one to whom he was under great personal obligations he absolutely declared that he would have the wedding to witness which appeared to him the height of human felicity solemnised over again the bride blushed the bridesmaids tittered the joy was universal  vivian inquired after the baron he learnt from eugene that he had quitted europe about a month having sailed as minister to one of the new american states my uncle continued the young man was neither well nor in spirits before his departure i cannot understand why he plagues himself so about politics however i trust he will like his new appointment you found him i am sure a delightful companion  come you two young gentlemen said the fatherinlaw put off your chat till the evening the business of the day stops for i see the procession coming forward to receive the regatta prize now my dear where is the scarf you know what to say remember i particularly wish to do honour to the victor the sight of all these happy faces makes me feel quite young again i declare i think i shall live a hundred years  the procession advanced first came a band of young children strewing flowers then followed four stout boys carrying a large purple and white banner the victor proudly preceding the other candidates strutted forward with his hat on one side a light scull decorated with purple and white ribbons in his right hand and his left arm round his wifes waist the wife a beautiful young woman to whom were clinging two fat flaxenheaded children was the most interesting figure in the procession her tight dark bodice set off her round full figure and her short red petticoat displayed her springy foot and ancle her neatly braided and plaited hair was partly concealed by a silk cap covered with gold spangled gauze flattened rather at the top and finished at the back of the head with a large bow this costly headgear the highest fashion of her class was presented to the wearer by the bride and was destined to be kept for festivals after the victor and his wife came six girls and six boys at the side of whom walked a very bustling personage in black who seemed extremely interested about the decorum of the procession a long train of villagers succeeded  well said the old lord to vivian this must be a very gratifying sight to you how fortunate that your carriage broke down just at my castle i think my dear girl is acquitting herself admirably ah eugene is a happy fellow and i have no doubt that she will be happy too the young sailor receives his honours very properly they are as nice a family as i know observe they are moving off now to make way for the pretty girls and boys that person in black is our abbé as benevolent worthy a creature as ever lived and very clever too you will see in a minute now they are going to give us a little bridal chorus after the old fashion and it is all the abbés doing i understand that there is an elegant allusion to my new bridge in it which i think will please you who ever thought that bridge would be opened for my girls wedding well i am glad that it was not finished before but we must be silent you will notice that part about the bridge it is in the fifth verse i am told beginning with something about hymen and ending with something about roses  by this time the procession had formed a semicircle before the tent the abbé standing in the middle with a paper in his hand and dividing the two hands of choristers he gave a signal with his cane and the girls commenced       chorus of maidens  hours fly it is morn he has left the bed of love she follows him with a strained eye when his figure is no longer seen she leans her head upon her arm she is faithful to him as the lake to the mountain       chorus of youths  hours fly it is noon fierce is the restless sun while he labours he thinks of her while he controls others he will obey her a strong man subdued by love is like a vineyard silvered by the moon       chorus of youths and maidens  hours fly it is eve the soft star lights him to his home she meets him as his shadow falls on the threshold she smiles and their child stretching forth its tender hands from its mothers bosom struggles to lisp father       chorus of maidens  years glide it is youth they sit within a secret bower purity is in her raptured eyes faith in his warm embrace he must fly he kisses his farewell the fresh tears are on her cheek he has gathered a lily with the dew upon its leaves       chorus of youths  years glide it is manhood he is in the fierce camp he is in the deceitful court he must mingle sometimes with others that he may be always with her in the false world she is to him like a green olive among rocks       chorus of youths and maidens  years glide it is old age they sit beneath a branching elm as the moon rises on the sunset green their children dance before them her hand is in his they look upon their children and then upon each other  the fellow has some fancy said the old lord but given i think to conceits i did not exactly catch the passage about the bridge but i have no doubt it was all right  vivian was now invited to the pavilion where refreshments were prepared here our hero was introduced to many other guests relations of the family who were on a visit at the castle and who had been on the lake at the moment of his arrival  this gentleman said the old lord pointing to vivian is my sons friend and i am quite sure that you are all delighted to see him he arrived here accidentally his carriage having fortunately broken down in passing one of the streams all those rivulets should have bridges built over them i could look at my new bridge for ever i often ask myself now how can such a piece of masonry ever be destroyed it seems quite impossible does not it we all know that everything has an end and yet whenever i look at that bridge i often think that it can only end when all things end  in the evening they all waltzed upon the green the large yellow moon had risen and a more agreeable sight than to witness two or three hundred persons so gaily occupied and in such a scene is not easy to imagine how beautiful was the stern old castle softened by the moonlight the illumined lake the richlysilvered foliage of the woods and the white brilliant cataract  as the castle was quite full of visitors its hospitable master had lodged vivian for the night at the cottage of one of his favourite tenants nothing would give greater pleasure to vivian than this circumstance nor more annoyance to the worthy old gentleman  the cottage belonged to the victor in the regatta who himself conducted the visitor to his dwelling vivian did not press esspers leaving the revellers so great an acquisition did he seem to their sports teaching them a thousand new games and playing all manner of antics but perhaps none of his powers surprised them more than the extraordinary facility and freedom with which he had acquired and used all their names the cottagers pretty wife had gone home an hour before her husband to put her two fairhaired children to bed and prepare her guests accommodation for the night nothing could be more romantic and lovely than the situation of the cottage it stood just on the gentle slope of the mountains base not a hundred yards from the lower waterfall it was in the middle of a patch of highlycultivated ground which bore creditable evidence to the industry of its proprietor fruit trees turkey corn vines and flax flourished in luxuriance the dwelling itself was covered with myrtle and arbutus and the tall lemonplant perfumed the window of the sittingroom the casement of vivians chamber opened full on the foaming cataract the distant murmur of the mighty waterfall the gentle sighing of the trees the soothing influence of the moonlight and the faint sounds occasionally caught of dying revelry the joyous exclamation of some successful candidate in the days games the song of some returning lover the plash of an oar in the lake all combined to produce that pensive mood in which we find ourselves involuntarily reviewing the history of our life  as vivian was musing over the last harassing months of his burthensome existence he could not help feeling that there was only one person in the world on whom his memory could dwell with solace and satisfaction and this person was lady madeleine trevor  it was true that with her he had passed some agonising hours but he could not forget the angelic resignation with which her own affliction had been borne and the soothing converse by which his had been alleviated this train of thought was pursued till his aching mind sunk into indefiniteness he sat for some little time almost unconscious of existence till the crying of a child waked by its fathers return brought him back to the present scene his thoughts naturally ran to his friend eugene surely this youthful bridegroom might reckon upon happiness again lady madeleine recurred to him suddenly he observed a wonderful appearance in the sky the moon was paled in the high heavens and surrounded by luminous rings almost as vividly tinted as the rainbow spreading and growing fainter till they covered nearly half the firmament it was a glorious and almost unprecedented halo     chapter iv   the sun rose red the air was thick and hot anticipating that the day would be very oppressive vivian and essper were on their horses backs at an early hour already however many of the rustic revellers were about and preparations were commencing for the fête champêtre which this day was to close the wedding festivities many and sad were the looks which essper george cast behind him at the old castle on the lake no good luck can come of it said he to his horse for vivian did not encourage conversation o master of mine when wilt thou know the meaning of good quarters to leave such a place and at such a time why turriparva was nothing to it the day before marriage and the hour before death is when a man thinks least of his purse and most of his neighbour o man man what art thou that the eye of a girl can make thee so pass all discretion that thou wilt sacrifice for the whim of a moment good cheer enough to make thee last an age  vivian had intended to stop and breakfast after riding about ten miles but he had not proceeded half that way when from the extreme sultriness of the morning he found it impossible to advance without refreshment max also to his riders surprise was much distressed and on turning round to his servant vivian found esspers hack panting and puffing and breaking out as if instead of commencing their days work they were near reaching their point of destination  why how now essper one would think that we had been riding all night what ails the beast  in truth sir that which ails its rider the poor dumb brute has more sense than some who have the gift of speech who ever heard of a horse leaving good quarters without much regretting the indiscretion  the closeness of the air is so oppressive that i do not wonder at even max being distressed perhaps when the sun is higher and has cleared away the vapours it may be more endurable as it is i think we had better stop at once and breakfast here this wood is as inviting as i trust are the contents of your basket  st florian devour them said essper in a very pious voice if i agree not with you sir and as for the basket although we have left the land of milk and honey by the blessing of our black lady i have that within it which would put courage in the heart of a caught mouse although we may not breakfast on bridecake and beccaficos yet is a neats tongue better than a foxs tail and i have ever held a bottle of rhenish to be superior to rainwater even though the element be filtered through a gutter nor by all saints have i forgotten a bottle of kerchen wasser from the black forest nor a keg of dantzic brandy a glass of which when travelling at night i am ever accustomed to take after my prayers for i have always observed that though devotion doth sufficiently warm up the soul the body all the time is rather the colder for stopping under a tree to tell its beads  the travellers accordingly led their horses a few yards into the wood and soon met as they had expected with a small green glade it was surrounded except at the slight opening by which they had entered it with fine spanish chestnut trees which now loaded with their large brown fruit rich and ripe clustered in the starry foliage afforded a retreat as beautiful to the eye as its shade was grateful to their senses vivian dismounted and stretching out his legs leant back against the trunk of a tree and essper having fastened max and his own horse to some branches proceeded to display his stores vivian was silent thoughtful and scarcely tasted anything essper george on the contrary was in unusual and even troublesome spirits and had not his appetite necessarily produced a few pauses in his almost perpetual rattle the patience of his master would have been fairly worn out at length essper had devoured the whole supply and as vivian not only did not encourage his remarks but even in a peremptory manner had desired his silence he was fain to amuse himself by trying to catch in his mouth a large brilliant fly which every instant was dancing before him two individuals more singularly contrasting in their appearance than the master and the servant could scarcely be conceived and vivian lying with his back against a tree with his legs stretched out his arms folded and his eyes fixed on the ground and essper though seated in perpetual motion and shifting his posture with feverish restlessness now looking over his shoulder for the fly then making an unsuccessful bite at it and then wearied with his frequent failures amusing himself with acting punch with his thumbs altogether presenting two figures which might have been considered as not inapt personifications of the rival systems of ideality and materialism  at length essper became silent for the sake of variety and imagining from his masters example that there must be some sweets in meditation hitherto undiscovered by him he imitated vivians posture so perverse is human nature that the moment vivian was aware that essper was perfectly silent he began to feel an inclination to converse with him  why essper said he looking up and smiling this is the first time during our acquaintance that i have ever seen thought upon your brow what can now be puzzling your wild brain  i was thinking sir said essper with a very solemn look that if there were a deceased fieldmouse here i would moralise on death  what turned philosopher  ay sir it appears to me said he taking up a husk which lay on the turf that there is not a nutshell in christendom which may not become matter for very grave meditation  can you expound that  verily sir the whole philosophy of life seems to me to consist in discovering the kernel when you see a courtier out of favour or a merchant out of credit when you see a soldier without pillage a sailor without prize money and a lawyer without paper a bachelor with nephews and an old maid with nieces be assured the nut is not worth the cracking and send it to the winds as i do this husk at present  why essper said vivian laughing considering that you have taken your degree so lately you wear the doctors cap with authority instead of being in your noviciate one would think that you had been a philosopher long enough to have outlived your system  bless you sir for philosophy i sucked it in with my mothers milk nature then gave me the hint which i have ever since acted on and i hold that the sum of all learning consists in milking another mans cow so much for the recent acquisition of my philosophy i gained it you see sir with the first wink of my eye and though i lost a great portion of it by seasickness in the mediterranean nevertheless since i served your lordship i have resumed my old habits and do opine that this vain globe is but a large football to be kicked and cuffed about by moody philosophers  you must have seen a great deal in your life essper said vivian  like all great travellers said essper i have seen more than i remember and remember more than i have seen  have you any objection to go to the east again asked vivian it would require but little persuasion to lead me there  i would rather go to a place where the religion is easier i wish sir you would take me to england  nay not there with me if with others  with you or with none  i cannot conceive essper what can induce you to tie up your fortunes with those of such a sadlooking personage as myself  in truth sir there is no accounting for tastes my grandmother loved a brindled cat  your grandmother essper nothing would amuse me more than to be introduced to your family  my family sir are nothing more nor less than what all of us must be counted worms of five feet long mortal angels the worlds epitome heaps of atoms which nature has kneaded with blood into solid flesh little worlds of living clay sparks of heaven inches of earth natures quintessence moving dust the little all smoothfaced cherubim in whose souls the ring of stars has drawn the image of himself  and how many years has breathed the worm of five feet long that i am now speaking to  good my lord i was no head at calculating from a boy but i do remember that i am two days older than one of the planets  how is that  there was one born in the sky sir the day i was christened with a turkish crescent  come essper said vivian who was rather interested by the conversation essper having until this morning skilfully avoided any discourse upon the subject of his birth or family adroitly turning the conversation whenever it chanced to approach these subjects and silencing inquiries if commenced by some ludicrous and evidently fictitious answer come essper said vivian i feel by no means in the humour to quit this shady retreat you and i have now known each other long and gone through much together it is but fair that i should become better acquainted with one who to me is not only a faithful servant but what is more valuable a faithful friend i might now almost add my only one what say you to whiling away a passing hour by giving me some sketch of your curious and adventurous life if there be anything that you wish to conceal pass it over but no invention nothing but the truth if you please the whole truth if you like  why sweet sir as for this odd knot of soul and body which none but the hand of heaven could have twined it was first seen i believe near the very spot where we are now sitting for my mother when i saw her first and last lived in bohemia she was an egyptian and came herself from the levant i lived a week sir in the seraglio when i was at constantinople and i saw there the brightest women of all countries georgians and circassians and poles in truth sir natures masterpieces and yet by the gods of all nations there was not one of them half so lovely as the lady who gave me this tongue here essper exhibited at full length the enormous feature which had so much enraged the oneeyed sergeant at frankfort  when i first remember myself he continued i was playing with some other gipsyboys in the midst of a forest here was our settlement it was large and powerful my mother probably from her beauty possessed great influence particularly among the men and yet i found not among them all a father on the contrary every one of my companions had a man whom he reverenced as his parent and who taught him to steal but i was called by the whole tribe the motherson and was honest from my first year out of mere wilfulness at least if i stole anything it was always from our own people many were the quarrels i occasioned since presuming on my mothers love and power i never called mischief a scrape but acting just as my fancy took me i left those who suffered by my conduct to apologise for my illbehaviour being thus an idle unprofitable impudent and injurious member of this pure community they determined one day to cast me out from their bosom and in spite of my mothers exertions and entreaties the ungrateful vipers succeeded in their purpose as a compliment to my parent they allowed me to tender my resignation instead of receiving my expulsion my dear mother gave me a donkey a wallet and a ducat a great deal of advice about my future conduct and what was more interesting to me much information about my birth  sweet child of my womb said my mother pressing me to her bosom be proud of thy white hands and straight nose thou gottest them not from me and thou shalt take them from whence they came thy father is a hungarian prince and though i would not have parted with thee had i thought that thou wouldst ever have prospered in our life even if he had made thee his child of the law and lord of his castle still as thou canst not tarry with us haste thou to him give him this ring and this lock of hair tell him none have seen them but the father the mother and the child he will look on them and remember the days that are passed and thou shalt be unto him as a hope for his lusty years and a prop for his old age  my mother gave me all necessary directions which i well remembered and much more advice which i directly forgot  although tempted now that i was a free man to follow my own fancy i still was too curious to sec what kind of a person was my unknown father to deviate either from my route or my maternal instructions and in a fortnights time i had reached my future principality  the sun sank behind the proud castle of my princely father as trotting slowly along upon my humble beast with my wallet slung at my side i approached it through his park a guard consisting of twenty or thirty men in magnificent uniforms were lounging at the portal ibut sir sir what is the meaning of this darkness i always made a vow to myself that i never would tell my history ah what ails me  a large eagle fell dead at their feet  protect me master screamed essper seizing vivian by the shoulder what is coming i cannot stand the earth seems to tremble is it the wind that roars and rages or is it ten thousand cannon blowing this globe to atoms  it is it must be the wind said vivian agitated we are not safe under these trees look to the horses  i will said essper if i can stand out of the forest ah look at max  vivian turned and beheld his spirited horse raised on his hind legs and dashing his fore feet against the trunk of a tree to which they had tied him the terrified and furious creature was struggling to disengage himself and would probably have sustained or inflicted some terrible injury had not the wind suddenly hushed covered with foam he stood panting while vivian patted and encouraged him esspers less spirited beast had from the first crouched upon the earth covered with sweat his limbs quivering and his tongue hanging out  master said essper what shall we do is there any chance of getting back to the castle i am sure our very lives are in danger see that tremendous cloud it looks like eternal night whither shall we go what shall we do  make for the castle said vivian mounting  they had just got into the road when another terrific gust of wind nearly took them off their horses and blinded them with the clouds of sand which it drove out of the crevices of the mountains  they looked round on every side and hope gave way before the scene of desolation immense branches were shivered from the largest trees small ones were entirely stripped of their leaves the long grass was bowed to the earth the waters were whirled in eddies out of the little rivulets birds deserting their nests to shelter in the crevices of the rocks unable to stem the driving air flapped their wings and fell upon the earth the frightened animals in the plain almost suffocated by the impetuosity of the wind sought safety and found destruction some of the largest trees were torn up by the roots the sluices of the mountains were filled and innumerable torrents rushed down before empty gulleys the heavens now open and lightning and thunder contend with the horrors of the wind  in a moment all was again hushed dead silence succeeded the bellow of the thunder the roar of the wind the rush of the waters the moaning of the beasts the screaming of the birds nothing was heard save the splashing of the agitated lake as it beat up against the black rocks which girt it in  master again said essper is this the day of doom  keep by my side essper keep close make the best of this pause let us but reach the village  scarcely had vivian spoken when greater darkness enveloped the trembling earth again the heavens were rent with lightning which nothing could have quenched but the descending deluge cataracts poured down from the lowering firmament in an instant the horses dashed round beast and rider blinded and stifled by the gushing rain and gasping for breath shelter was nowhere the quivering beasts reared and snorted and sank upon their knees the horsemen were dismounted vivian succeeded in hoodwinking max who was still furious the other horse appeared nearly exhausted essper beside himself with terror could only hang over his neck  another awful calm  courage essper said vivian we are still safe look up man the storm cannot last long thus and see i am sure the clouds are breaking  the heavy mass of vapour which had seemed to threaten the earth with instant destruction suddenly parted the red and lurid sun was visible but his light and heat were quenched in the still impending waters  mount essper said vivian this is our only chance five minutes good speed will take us to the village  encouraged by his masters example essper once more got upon his horse and the panting animals relieved by the cessation of the hurricane carried them at a fair pace towards the village considering that their road was now impeded by the overflowing of the lake  master said essper cannot we get out of these waters  he had scarcely spoken before a terrific burst a noise they knew not what a rush they could not understand a vibration which shook them on their horses made them start back and again dismount every terror sank before the appalling roar of the cataract it seemed that the mighty mountain unable to support its weight of waters shook to the foundation a lake had burst on its summit and the cataract became a falling ocean the source of the great deep appeared to be discharging itself over the range of mountains the great grey peak tottered on its foundations it shook it fell and buried in its ruins the castle the village and the bridge  vivian with starting eyes beheld the whole washed away instinct gave him energy to throw himself on the back of his horse a breath and he had leaped up the nearest hill essper george in a state of distraction was madly laughing as he climbed to the top of a high tree his horse was carried off in the drowning waters which had now reached the road  the desolation is complete thought vivian at this moment the wind again rose the rain again descended the heavens again opened the lightning again flashed an amethystine flame hung upon rocks and waters and through the raging elements a yellow fork darted its fatal point at esspers restingplace the tree fell vivians horse with a maddened snort dashed down the hill his master senseless clung to his neck the frantic animal was past all government he stood upright in the air flung his rider and fell dead  here leave we vivian it was my wish to have detailed in the present portion of this work the singular adventures which befell him in one of the most delightful of modern cities lighthearted vienna but his history has expanded under my pen and i fear that i have even now too much presumed upon an attention which i am not entitled to command i am as yet but standing without the gate of the garden of romance true it is that as i gaze through the ivory bars of its golden portal i would fain believe that following my roving fancy i might arrive at some green retreats hitherto unexplored and loiter among some leafy bowers where none have lingered before me but these expectations may be as vain as those dreams of youth over which all have mourned the disappointment of manhood succeeds to the delusion of youth let us hope that the heritage of old age is not despair   the end
