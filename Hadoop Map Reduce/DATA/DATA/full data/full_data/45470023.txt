mr and mrs hector archibald were prosperous and happy dwellers in a suburb of one of our large towns fortune had favored them in many waysin health and in a good average happiness they had reached early middle age and their daughter kate their only child had grown up to be a beautiful and good young woman and was on the point of marrying a young lawyerrodney bringhurst by namein every way worthy of her  hector archibald was a little man with small bright eyes and hair slightly touched with gray and very much inclined to curl his disposition was lively he had a strong liking for cheerful occurrences and was always willing to do his part in the bringing about of such events novelty had a charm for him he was not bound by precedence and tradition and if he had found himself at a dinner which began with coffee and ended with oysters on the halfshell he would have given the unusual meal a most animated consideration although he might have utterly withheld any subsequent approbation as a general thing he revolved in an orbit where one might always be able to find him were the proper calculations made but if any one drew a tangent for him and its direction seemed suitable and interesting he was perfectly willing to fly off on it  the disposition of mrs hector archibald was different she was born to be guided by customs fashions and forms she believed it was the duty of a married woman to make her home happy and she did it but she also believed that in the best domestic circles there were rules and usages for domestic happiness which would apply to every domestic condition and contingency it frequently troubled her however to find that certain customs forms or usages of domestic society had changed and being of a conservative turn of mind it was difficult for her to adapt herself to these changes but thoroughly loyal to the idea that what was done by people she loved and people she respected ought also to be done by her she earnestly strove to fit herself to new conditions especially when she saw that by not doing so she would be out of touch with her family and her friends  now of course the wedding of their daughter was the only thing in the world that seemed of real importance to mr and mrs archibald and for this all preparations and plans had been agreed upon and made with great goodwill and harmony excepting one thing and that was the weddingtrip strange to say the young people did not wish to take a weddingtrip they believed that this oldfashioned custom was unnecessary troublesome commonplace and stupid in the gardens and grounds of the archibald mansion and in the beautiful surrounding country they had loved each other as lovers and among these scenes they wished to begin to love each other as a married couple why should such distasteful and unpleasant ingredients as railroadcars steamboats and hotels be dashed into the pleasing mixture of their new lives it had been arranged that for a year or two at least they should live in kates dear old home and why should they not immediately begin that life there  mr archibald did not favor this plan and his wife was strongly opposed to it a wedding without a weddingtrip ought not to be thought of  during the honeymoon a young couple should live for each other with each other apart from the rest of the world it is a beautiful custom which should not be rudely trampled upon said mrs archibald  but although mrs archibald cherished a belief that she ought to conform her ideas to the domestic customs of the day her daughter kate cherished the belief that the domestic customs of the day ought to conform themselves to her ideas  of course we should like to be alone in the honeymoon she exclaimed we dont object to that and if there must be a weddingjourney you and father can take it and we will stay here here are servants books things to eat and everything our hearts can desire and here we would really feel as if we were beginning life as man and wife as for you two you both need a vacation and nothing could be more perfectly appropriate and more delightful to everybody than that you should take our weddingtrip we dont want it we will make it a present to you take it and be happy and leave us here to be happy people have done this sort of thing before so that it is not absolutely wild and unheard of  mr archibald welcomed this plan with open arms and hugged it and his daughter to his breast it suited him admirably and he declared that all business and engagements of every kind should be set aside and that he would be ready to start on the weddingjourney with mrs archibald the moment the ceremony should be completed  you will wait until the reception is over father said kate laughing  yes said he i will wait for that  this novel proposition sent a chill through every fibre of mrs archibalds physical organism at first she did not exactly comprehend it but when she did the chills increased when she had recovered herself a little she began to make objections this was easy enough for they crowded into her mind like sheep into a pen but every objection as she brought it forth was ruthlessly set aside or crushed to earth by her daughter or her husband assisted by her expectant soninlaw of whom she declared she never would have believed such a thing had she been told it  the discussion ended of course by mrs archibald agreeing to go on this absurd weddingjourney but the good ladys mental troubles were not over when she had given her consent as this scheme had been devised by those dearest to her on earth and as it was certain these dearest persons assured her to meet with the approbation of all people of advanced thoughtat least of those whose thought had advanced far enough to make it worthy of their considerationshe felt that in doing her part she ought to do it honestly and with her whole heart and at her time of life to act as a proxy for a young bride by taking a weddingjourney in that young brides place was a very difficult thing for mrs archibald to do honestly and with her whole heart but she would try to do it whatever else happened her family must be kept happy and it should never be said of her that she hung like a millstone around the combined neck of that family when it was unitedly climbing towards altitudes of felicity which although she was not able to discern them must exist since that fact had been so earnestly insisted upon by mr archibald kate and rodney bringhurst  thus was this exceptional hymeneal performance decided upon and at eleven oclock on wednesday the 6th of june the marriage service was performed at noon the guests sat down to breakfast and at two oclock that afternoon mr and mrs hector archibald departed on the weddingtrip leaving behind mr and mrs bringhurst at home with each other and not at home to the world     chapter ii  enter margery   at four oclock on the afternoon of june 6th mr and mrs hector archibald arrived at a family hotel in the capital of their state where they should go from there had not been decided upon nothing in regard to their weddingjourney had been decided upon except that they were to return to their home on the 6th of july of that year and not before it would have been impossible with their minds filled with bridal arrangements for them to make plans for their journey but at this first stoppingplace where they were free from all responsibility and interruptions they could at their leisure decide where they should go how they should go and what they should do when they got there  after the unrest and turmoil of their own home during the past few weeks the quiet and repose of this city hotel were delightful that evening they went to the theatre and after the performance they had a little supper at a restaurant  people may not think we are a newly married pair said mr archibald as he poured out a glass of wine for his wife but it is not impossible that they may see we know how to enjoy ourselves quite as much as if we were  the next morning mr archibald procured a number of railroad maps timetables circulars of steamboat excursions advertisements of mountain retreats and seaside resorts and he and his wife sat down to study these and to decide upon a destination and a route after an hour or two of indeterminate examination mr archibald declared himself a little tired and proposed that they should take a recess from their labors and go and call upon their old friends the stanley dearborns  people on weddingtours do not make calls said mrs archibald  that may be true said her husband in ordinary cases and although i do not care to announce to everybody the peculiarities of the expedition which we have undertaken i do not mind in the least telling the stanley dearborns all about it stanley himself would not appreciate it he would consider it absurd but then he is not at home at this time of day and mrs dearborn is just the woman to enjoy a reform movement of this sort besides she is full of ideas about everything and she may propose some good place for us to go to  mrs dearborn was at home and very glad to see the archibalds she was a woman whose soul was in touch with the higher education of womenwith female suffrage the emancipation of the enslaved mind wherever it might be found and with progress generally she was a member of many societies belonged to committees without end wrote reports and minutes by day and by night and was one of that everincreasing class of good people who continually walk forward in order that their weight may help the world to turn over  in spite of her principles and the advanced position of her thought mrs dearborn actually leaned back in her chair and laughed heartily when she learned what sort of a journey the archibalds were taking in this merriment mr archibald joined with great glee  ever since i left home he said i have wanted to have a chance for a good laugh at this trip we are taking it is the most delightful joke i have ever known  mrs archibald could not help smiling but her brow was clouded if this expedition is merely a joke she said i do not think we should have undertaken it but if it is an earnest assertion of our belief that there should be a change in the customs of society then i think we should take it seriously and i see nothing to laugh at  my dear harriet said mrs dearborn we can be good and glad at the same time and that is what i am i am sure what you are doing is the initiation of one of the most worthy reforms of the day and if it should have an effect in breaking up that wretched custom of the bridal tramp which is considered so necessary in this country society should rise up and call you blessed but it is funny for all that i am sure that the first woman who dared to go without crinoline was very funny and when i heard of a hospital for cats i could not help laughing but i believed in it and worked for it and now where are you going  that is what we want to talk to you about said mr archibald and for half an hour they talked about it  at the end of that time it was decided that the mountains were better than the sea or than a quiet lowland nook and mrs dearborn strongly recommended sadlers where she and her husband had spent a part of a summer a few years before  we camped out said she and had a fine time you can camp out at sadlers more easily and satisfactorily than anywhere else in the world  camping suited mr archibald admirably and to his surprise his wife said she might like it very well  if people are going to laugh at us she said when they find out we are on a weddingjourneyand they will be sure to find it out in some way or otheri think the fewer people we mingle with the better i do not think i shall like camping altogether but i know it is healthful and i suppose i ought to get used to it it would be dreadfully lonely for just mr archibald and me but i suppose we can take some one with us to guide and cook  my dear harriet said mrs dearborn if you are at sadlers you can go into any sort of camp you please i will tell you all about sadlers sadler is a man of progress his hotel or inn is on the very edge of the forest country and away from all the centres of resort he calls his place the terminal link of public travel in that direction when you leave him you travel privately in any way you like he has established what he has named a bureau of camping and he furnishes his patrons with any sort of a camp they may desire if the party is few in number and of a timid disposition they can have a camp within shouting distance of his house if they are brave and adventurous he will send them out into the depths of the forest if they like water he locates them by the shores of a lake if climbing is their passion he puts them at the foot of a mountain those who want to hunt can do so and those who dislike firearms are placed in a camp where the popping of guns is never heard he provides tents guides provisions and even dangers and sensations  safety is what i want interrupted mrs archibald  and that he furnishes said the other for those who desire it  sadler is the man for me cried mr archibald we will go to him look over his list of camps and select one to suit us  bytheway said mrs dearborn a thought has struck me how would you like to take margery with you  margery exclaimed mr archibald that delightful little girl whom i taught to ride a tricycle when you were visiting us i would like it ever so much  it struck mrs archibald that people on bridal trips did not generally take children or young girls with them but it also struck her that if they were going into camp it might be pleasant and in many ways advantageous to have some one of her own sex with her but she had no time to formulate these advantages in her mind before mrs dearborn explained in full  since mr dearborn and i came home from sadlers she said margery has been perfectly wild to go there and as soon as the leaves began to bud in the parks she began to talk about it we saw no possible chance of her going there for her father is too busy to leave home for any length of time this season and i cannot go to the mountains this year for i must visit my sister who is not well and there are three summer conventions that i am obliged to attend but if you could take her with you i do not believe she would trouble you in the least and you would give her great pleasure moreover to speak practically which i think we always ought to do it would not be a bad thing on the score of economy for things are always proportionately cheaper for three people in a camp than for two  a great many advantages of female companionship now began to creep into mrs archibalds mind if her husband should take it into his head to go out and hunt at night by the light of a torch if there should be thunderstorms and he away with the guide if he should want to go off and talk to indians or trappers and he always did want to go off and talk to people of every classit would be very pleasant to have even margery dearborn with her so she consented with great goodwill to her friends proposition and mrs dearborn was much pleased and thankful  margery is a true creature of impulse she said that is really her predominating characteristic and she will want to bound to the ceiling when she hears she is to go to sadlers she is not at home now but she will be in very soon you must take luncheon with us  about a quarter of an hour after that margery dearborn came home she was very glad indeed to see the archibalds whom she remembered as the kindest of people and when she heard they were going to take her to sadlers she gave a scream of delight and threw herself upon mrs archibalds neck  you are an angel she cried an angel of blessedness my dear aunt harriet dont you remember i used to call you that wont you let me call you so still and without waiting for an answer she rushed to mr archibald with outstretched hands dear uncle archibald you are just as good as ever i see you know i wouldnt call you uncle hector because hectoring meant scolding which never had anything to do with you sadlers oh when do we start  tomorrow is saturday replied mr archibald we must get together some things we will need for camplife and we can start on monday  when the visitors were left to themselves for a few moments mr archibald said to his wife harriet i am astounded this girl who used to ride bareback and jump over fences is a young lady now and a handsome one too she is quite a different person from the girl i agreed to take with us  mr archibald said his wife you never can remember that in this world people of all ages grow older she was fourteen when she was visiting us and that was four years ago so of course she is a young lady  no he answered i dont feel that i am growing any older and i dont see that you are and so i totally forget that proclivity in other people but what do you think now can we take this young woman with us to camp will she not be a dreadful drag  my dear said mrs archibald i much prefer the young lady to the girl i dont want to be the only woman in camp and the nearer the other woman is to my age the better  all right said mr archibald if you are satisfied i am and if she will agree to it we will add our ages for the time being and divide by three and then we will all stand on a level     chapter iii  sadlers   it was in the afternoon of monday the 11th of june when mr and mrs archibald accompanied by miss margery dearborn arrived at sadlers and with feelings of relief alighted from the cramped stagecoach which had brought them eight miles from the railroad station  can this be sadlers said mr archibald in a tone of surprise  of course it must be said his wife since they brought us here  it certainly is the place said margery for there is the name over that door  how do you feel about it said mr archibald to his wife  i feel very well about it said she why shouldnt i  how do you feel about it he asked of the younger lady  well she answered i dont exactly understand it i had visions of forests and wilds and tumbling mountain streams and a general air of primevalism and i am surprised to see this fine hotel with piazzas and croquetgrounds and tenniscourts and gravelled walks and babies in their carriages and elderly ladies carrying sunshades  but it seems to me that there is a forest behind it said mr archibald  yes replied margery a little dolefully it has that to back it up  dont let us stand here at the bottom of the steps talking said mrs archibald i must say i am very agreeably surprised  in the wide hall which ran through the middle of the hotel and not far from the clerks desk there sat a large handsome man a little past middle age who in a hearty voice greeted the visitors as they entered but without rising from his chair this was peter sadler the owner of the hotel the legal owner of a great deal of the neighboring country and the actual ruler of more of said country than could be easily marked out upon a map or stated in surveyors terms  in fact peter sadler was king of that portion of the vast district of mountain and forest which could be reached in a days journey in any direction if he had wished to extend his domain to points at a greater distance than this he would have done so but so far he was satisfied with the rights he had asserted he ruled supreme in that region because he had lived longer in the vicinity than any other white man because he had a powerful will which did not brook opposition and because there was no one to oppose him  illustration can this be sadlers  on the arable land which lay outside of the forest and which really belonged to him there were the houses of the men who farmed his fields and on the outskirts of the woods were scattered here and there the cabins of the hunters and guides he employed and these men knew no law but his will of course the laws of the state covered the district but such promulgation and enforcement of these as he might consider necessary were generally left to peter sadler and as to his own laws he was always there to see that these were observed  his guests submitted themselves to his will or they left his hotel very soon to people of discernment and judgment it was not difficult to submit to the will of this fullbearded broadchested man who knew so much better than they did what they ought to do if they wanted to get all the good out of sadlers which they were capable of assimilating  this man who sat all day in a big rollingchair and who knew everything that was going on in the hotel the farm and the forest about him had been a hunter and a guide in his youth an indianfighter in later years and when he had been wounded in both legs so that it was impossible for him ever to walk again he came back to the scenes of his youth and established an inn for sportsmena poor little house at first which grew and grew and grew until it was the large wellkept hotel so widely known by his name  after dinner at which meal they were waited upon by women and not by men in eveningdress as margery had begun to fear mr archibald sought peter sadler and made known to him the surprise of his party at finding themselves in this fine hotel  what did you expect asked peter eying him from head to foot  from what we had heard replied the other we supposed we should find some sort of a preparatory campingground in the woods from which we could go out and have a camp of our own  thats just what you have found said sadler in this house you prepare to camp if you need preparation if any man woman or child comes here and wants to go out to camp and i see that they are sickly or weak or in any way not fit to live in the woods i dont let them go one step until they are fit for it the air and the food and the water they get here will make them fit if anything will do it and if these three things dont set them up they simply have to go back where they came from they cant go into camp from this house but if they fancy this hoteland there isnt any reason why anybody shouldnt fancy itthey can stay here as long as they like and ill take care of them now sir if you want to go into camp the first thing for you to do is to bring your family here and let me take a look at them ive seen them of course but i havent made up my mind yet whether they are the right sort for camp life as for you i think you will do there isnt much of you but you look tough  mr archibald laughed thats good rough talk he said and smacks more of camp life than anything i have noticed here i will go and bring my wife and miss dearborn  there is another reason why i want to see them said the bluff peter as you are bent on camping youll like to choose a camp and when anything of that kind is on hand i want to talk to the whole party i dont care to settle the business with one of them and then have him come back and say that what has been agreed upon dont suit the others i want a full meeting or no session  when mr archibald returned with his wife and margery he found peter sadler had rolled his chair up to a large circular table at the back of the hall on which was spread a map of the forest he greeted the ladies in a loud voice and with a cheery smile  and so you want to go camping do you said he sit down and let us talk it over i think the young lady is all right she looks spry enough and i expect she could eat pinecones like a squirrel if she was hungry and had nothing else as for you madam you dont appear as if anything in particular was the matter with you and i should think you could stand a number three camp well enough and be all the better for a week or two of it  what is a number three camp asked margery before the astonished mrs archibald could speak  well said sadler it is a camp with a good deal of comfort in it our number one camps are pretty rough they are for hunters and scientific people we give them game enough in season and some bare places where they can make fires and stretch a bit of canvas that is all they want to have a truly good time that is the best camp of all i think number two camps are generally for fishermen they always want a chance for pretty good living when they are out in the woods they stay in camp in the evenings and like to sit around and have a good time number threes are the best camps we put families into so you see madam im rating you pretty high theres always a logcabin in these camps with cots and straw mattresses and plenty of traps for cooking and more than that there is a chance for people who dont tramp or fish to do things such as walking or boating according to circumstances theres one of our camps has a croquetground  oh we dont want that cried margery it would simply ruin every illusion that is left to me  glad to hear that said peter if you want to play croquet stay at the hotel thats what i say now then here are the camps and theres plenty of them to choose from youve come in a good time for the season isnt fairly begun yet next month every camp will be full with the hotel crowded with people waiting for their turns  what we want said margery rising and looking over the map is the wildest number three you have  oh ho said peter not so fast miss perhaps well wait and see what this lady has to say first if im not mistaken madam i think youre inclined the other way and i dont put people into camps that they will be wanting to leave after the first rainy day now let me show you what ive got here is one four hours walk horses for women with a rocky stream through the middle of it  that is grand cried margery is it really in the woods  now let me do the talking said peter they are all in the woods we dont make camps in pasturefields even the number sevens where the meals are sent to the campers from the hotel and they have bathtubs are in the woods now here is another one about three miles west from the one i just showed you but the same distance from here this you see is on the shore of a lake with fishing boating and bathing if you can stand cold water  glorious cried margery that is exactly what we want a lake will be simply heavenly  everything seems to suit you miss said peter just as soon as you hear of it but suppose we consider more of them before you choose some two miles north of here in the thickest of the forest in a clearing that i made there is a small camp that strikes the fancy of some people there is a little stream there and it has fish in it too and it runs through one corner of the logcabin so there are seven or eight feet of the stream inside the house and on rainy days you can sit there and fish and some people like to go to sleep with the running water gurgling close to them where they can hear it when they are in bed then theres an owl to this camp the men heard him there when they were making the clearing and hes never left the spot some people who were out there said they never felt as much away from the world as they did listening to that little stream gurgling and that owl hooting  i believe exclaimed margery that in a place like that i could write poetry  it would give me the rheumatism and the blues said mrs archibald upon which peter sadler exclaimed  that settles that now then here is another  several other camps were considered but it was the general conclusion that the one by the lake was the most desirable it had a good cabin with three rooms with plenty of open space near by for the tents of the guides there was a boat which belonged to the camp and in every way it seemed so suitable that mr archibald secured it he thought the price was rather high but as it included guides provisions fishingtackle and in fact everything needed he considered that although it might cost as much as lodgings in a city hotel they would get more good out of it  has this camp any name asked the enthusiastic margery in the course of the conference  thats about your twentyseventh question miss said peter but its one i can answer yes its got a name its called camp rob  oh ejaculated margery in a disappointed tone what a name  yes said peter it isnt much of a name the first people who went out there named it that and it stuck to it and its all its got camps are like horsesweve got to tell them apart and so we give them names and thats camp rob     chapter iv  a cataract of information   peter sadler would have been glad to have the archibald party stay at his hotel for a few days and mrs archibald would have been perfectly satisfied to remain there until they were ready to return to their own house but her husband and margery were impatient to be in the woods and it was therefore decided to start for the camp the next day peter sadler was a man of system and his arrangements were made promptly and rapidly  youve got to have a guide said he and another man to help him and i think ill give you phil matlack phil is an old hand at the business and if you dont know what you want hell tell you if you are in phils hands you neednt be afraid anything will happen to you whatever you want ask him for it and ten to one hell have it whether its information or fishhooks i tell you again youre lucky to be here early and get the best of everything camp rob with phil matlack will stand at a premium in three or four weeks from now  that evening after supper mr archibald lighted a cigar and went out into the grounds in front of the hotel where he was presently joined by his wife  where is margery asked he  she is in her room replied mrs archibald but she called to me that she would be down directly  in about ten minutes down came margery and floated out upon the lawn she was dressed in white with flowers in her hair and she was more charming mr archibald said as she approached than even the sunset sky  you should not speak in that way of works of nature said his wife  isnt she a work of nature he asked  not altogether was the wise reply why did you dress yourself in that fashion she asked margery i did not suppose you would bring such a fine gown as we started out to go into camp and even in this hotel a travellingsuit is good enough for any one  oh i tucked this into one of my bags replied margery i always like to have something nice to fall back upon dont you want to take a little stroll aunt harriet  mr archibald leaned back in his gardenchair and slowly puffed his cigar and as he puffed he took his eyes from the sunset sky and watched his wife and margery  a little beyond them as they walked sat two elderly ladies on a bench wearing shawls and near by stood a girl in a short dress with no hat on and a long plait down her back a little farther on was a tenniscourt and four people apparently young were playing tennis there were two men and neither of them wore a tennissuit one was attired as a bicyclist and the other wore ordinary summer clothes the young women were dressed in darkblue flannel and little round hats which suggested to mr archibald the deck of a yacht  near the hotel was an elderly gentleman walking up and down by himself and on the piazza were the rest of the guests he had seen at the table not very many of them for it was early in the season  mr archibald now turned his eyes again to the sky it was still beautiful although its colors were fading and after a time he looked back towards his wife she was now talking to the two elderly ladies on the bench and margery was engaged in conversation with the girl with the plait down her back  when i finish my cigar thought mr archibald i will go myself and take a stroll and it struck him that he might talk to the old gentleman who was still walking up and down in front of the hotel after contemplating the tops of some forest trees against the greenishyellow of the middle sky he turned his eyes again towards his wife and found that the two elderly ladies had made room for her on the bench that the tennisgame had ceased and that one of the girls in blue flannel had joined this group and was talking to margery  in a few moments all the ladies on the bench rose and mrs archibald and one of them walked slowly towards an opening in the woods the other lady followed with the little girl and margery and the young woman in blue walked in the same direction but not in company with the rest of the party the two young men with the other tennisplayer between them walked over from the tenniscourt and joined the first group and they all stopped just as they reached the woods there they stood and began talking to each other after which one of the young men and the young woman approached a large tree and he poked with a stick into what was probably a hole near its roots and mr archibald supposed that the discussion concerned a snakehole or a hornets nest then margery and the other young woman came up and they looked at the hole now the whole company walked into the woods and disappeared in about ten minutes mr archibald finished his cigar and was thinking of following his wife and margery when the two elderly ladies and mrs archibald came out into the open and walked towards the hotel then came the little girl running very fast as she passed the tree with the hole near its roots in a few minutes mrs archibald stopped and looked back towards the woods then she walked a little way in that direction leaving her companions to go to the hotel now the young man in the bicycle suit emerged from the woods with a girl in darkblue flannel on each side of him  upon my word exclaimed mr archibald and rising to his feet advanced towards his wife but before he reached her margery emerged from the wood road escorted by the young man in the summer suit  upon my word mr archibald remarked this time to his wife that ward of ours is not given to wasting time  it seems so truly said she and i think her mother was right when she called her a creature of impulse let us wait here until they come up we must all go in it is getting chilly  in a few minutes margery and the young man had reached them  thank you very much said this creature of impulse to her escort my uncle and aunt will take care of me now aunt harriet and uncle archibald this is mr clyde he saw a great snake go into a hole over there just before suppertime and i think we ought all to be very careful how we pass that way  i dont think there is very much danger after nightfall said mr clyde who was a pleasant youth with brown hair and tomorrow ill see if i can kill him its a bad place for a snake to have a hole just where ladies would be apt to take their walks  i dont think the snake will trouble us much said mrs archibald for we leave tomorrow still it would be a good thing to kill it  after this there were a few remarks made about snakes and then mr clyde bade them goodevening  how in the world margery said mrs archibald did you get acquainted so quickly with that young manand who is he  oh it all happened quite naturally said she as we turned to go out of the woods he was the gentleman nearest to me and so of course he came with me those two girls are sisters and their name is dodworth they introduced mr clyde and the other gentleman mr raybold to me but that was after you had been talking to mrs dodworth their mother who is mr raybolds aunt the other lady with the shawl on is mrs henderson andwould you believe itshes grandmother to that girl in the short dress she doesnt begin to look old enough the dodworths dont go into camp at all but expect to stay here for two weeks longer and then they go to the seashore mrs henderson leaves day after tomorrow  mr clyde and his friend live in boston they are both just beginning to practise law though mr clyde says that mr raybold would rather be an actor but his family objects the old gentleman who is walking up and down in front of the hotel has heartdisease some people saybut that is not certain he stayed here all last summer and perhaps he will this year in two weeks hardly any of the people now in this hotel will be here one family is going into camp when the father and two sons come on to join them and the rest are going to the seashore except one lady you may have noticed herthe one with a darkpurple dress and a little purple cap shes a schoolteacher and she will spend the rest of the summer with her sister in pennsylvania  that man phil matlack who is going with us tomorrow is quite a character and i expect i shall like him awfully they say that about five years ago he killed a man who made an attack on him in the woods but he was never tried for it nor was anything whatever done to him because mr sadler said he was right and he would not have any nonsense about it there are people about here who believe that phil matlack would fight a bear singlehanded if it happened to be necessary mr sadler would do it himself if he could walk nobody knows how many men he killed when he was fighting indians and would you believe it his wife is a plain little quiet woman who lives in some part of the hotel where nobody ever sees her because she is rather bashful and dislikes company  the other person who is going with us is not very much more than a boy though they say he is very strong and a good hunter his name is martin sanders and i forgot to say that the old gentleman with the heartdisease is named parker  its generally thought that phil matlack would rather have some one else than martin sanders to go with him because he says martin knows too much the fact is that martin is well educated and could have gone into some good business but he was so fond of the woods that he gave up everything to come out here and learn guiding you know we were told that our camp in the woods has three rooms in it well it really has four for there was an artist there last year who built a little room for a studio for rainy days i expect mr sadler forgot that or didnt think it worth counting there are no snakes at all where we are going to camp but two miles farther on there are lots of them  over the brink of niagara interjected mr archibald they say eighteen million cubic feet of water pour every minute where on earth margery did you fill your mind with all that information  i got it from those two dodworth girls and mr clyde said she mr raybold told me some things too but mostly about his bicycle he feels badly about it because he brought it here and now he finds there is no place to use it i should think he ought to have known that the primeval forest isnt any place for a bicycle  mr archibald said mrs archibald when they had retired to their room i did not agree with you when you wished we could have started for camp today but now i am quite of your mind  tuesday was fine and preparations were made for the archibald party to start for their camp after an early luncheon  the bluff and hearty peter took such an interest in everything that was being done for their comfort giving special heed to all the possible requirements of mrs archibald that the heart of mr archibald was touched  i wish said he to his goodnatured host that you were going with us i do not know any one i would rather camp with than you  if i could do it replied peter id like it ever so well so far as i have been able to make you out you are the sort of a man id be willing to run a camp for what i like about you is that you havent any mind of your own there is nothing i hate worse than to run against a man with a mind of his own of course there have to be such fellows but let them keep away from me there is no room here for more than one mind and i have preempted the whole section  mr archibald laughed your opinion of me does not sound very complimentary he said  it is complimentary roared peter sadler striking the table with his fist why i tell you sir i couldnt say anything more commendable of you if i tried it shows that you are a man of commonsense and thats pretty high praise everything ive told you to do youve done everything ive proposed youve agreed to you see for yourself that i know what is better for you and your party than you do and you stand up like a man and say so yes sir if a rollingchair wasnt as bad for the woods as the bicycle that boston chap brought down here id go along with you  mr archibald had a very sharp sense of the humorous and in his enjoyment of a comical situation he liked company his heart was stirred to put his expedition in its true light before this man who was so honest and plainspoken mr sadler said he if you will take it as a piece of confidential information and not intended for the general ear i will tell you what sort of a holiday my wife and i are taking we are on a weddingjourney and then he told the story of the proxy bridal tour  peter sadler threw himself back in his chair and laughed with such great roars that two huntingdogs who were asleep in the hall sprang to their feet and dashed out of the back door their tails between their legs  by the lord harry cried peter sadler you and your wife are a pair of giants i dont say anything about that young woman for i dont believe it would have made any difference to her whether you were on a weddingtrip or travelling into the woods to bury a child i tell you sir you maynt have a mind that can give out much but youve got a mind that can take in the biggest kind of thing and that is what i call grand it is the difference between a canyon and a mountain there are lots of good mountains in this world and mighty few good canyons tom you tom come here  in answer to the loud call a boy came running up  go into my room said peter sadler and bring out a barrel bottle large size and one of the stone jars with a red seal on it now sir said he to mr archibald i am going to give you a bottle of the very best whiskey that ever a human being took into the woods and a jar of smokingtobacco a great deal too good for any king on any throne they belong to my private stock and i am proud to make them a present to a man who will take a weddingtrip to save his grownup daughter the trouble as for your wife therell be a basket that will go to her with my compliments that will show her what i think of her bytheway sir have you met phil matlack  no i have not exclaimed mr archibald with animation i have heard something about him and before we start i should like to see the man who is going to take charge of us in camp  well there he is just passing the back door hello phil come in here  when the eminent guide phil matlack entered the hall mr archibald looked at him with some surprise for he was not the conventional tall gaunt wiry keeneyed backwoodsman who had naturally appeared to his mental vision this man was of medium height a little roundshouldered dressed in a gray shirt faded brown trousers very baggy at the knees a pair of conspicuous blue woollen socks and slippers made of carpet his short beard and his hair were touched with gray and he wore a small jockey cap with the exception of his eyes mr matlacks facial features were large and the expression upon them was that of a mild and generally goodnatured tolerance of the world and all that is in it it may be stated that this expression combined with his manner indicated also a desire on his part that the world and all that is in it should tolerate him mr archibalds first impressions of the man did not formulate themselves in these terms he simply thought that the guide was a slipshod sort of a fellow  phil said mr sadler here is the gentleman you are going to take into camp  glad to see him said matlack hope hell like it  and i want to say to you phil continued sadler right before him that he is a firstclass man for you to have in charge i dont believe you ever had a better one hes a city man and its my opinion he dont know one thing about hunting fishing making a campfire or even digging bait i dont suppose he ever spent a night outside of a house and doesnt know any more about the weather than he does about planting cabbages hes just clean bright and empty like a new peachbasket what you tell him hell know and what you ask him to do hell do and if you want a better man than that to take into camp you want too much thats all ive got to say  matlack looked at peter sadler and then at mr archibald who was leaning back in his chair his bright eyes twinkling  how did you find out all that about him he asked  humph exclaimed peter sadler dont you suppose i can read a mans character when ive had a good chance at him now how about the storeshave they all gone on  they were sent out early this mornin said matlack and we can start as soon as the folks are ready     chapter v  camp rob   it was early in the afternoon when the archibald party took up the line of march for camp rob the two ladies supplied by mrs sadler with coarse ridingskirts sat each upon a farmhorse and mr archibald held the bridle of the one that carried his wife matlack and martin sanders the young man who was to assist him led the way while a led horse loaded with the personal baggage of the travellers brought up the rear  their way wound through a forest over a wood road very rough and barely wide enough for the passage of a cart the road was solemn and still except where here and there an open space allowed the sunlight to play upon a few scattered wild flowers and brighten the sombre tints of the undergrowth  after a ride which seemed a long one to the ladies who wished they had attired themselves in walkingcostume the road and the forest suddenly came to an end and before them stretched out the waters of a small lake camp rob was not far from the head of the lake and for some distance above and below the forest stood back from the waters edge in the shade of a great oak tree there stood a small loghouse rude enough to look at but moderately comfortable within and from this house to the shore a wide space was cleared of bushes and undergrowth  the lake was narrow in proportion to its length which was about two miles and on the other side the forest looked like a solid wall of green reflected in the water beneath even mrs archibald whose aching back began to have an effect upon her disposition was delighted with the beauty of the scene which delight endured until she had descended from her horse and entered the logcabin in which she was to dwell for a time  it is not necessary to describe the house nor is it necessary to dive into the depths of mrs archibalds mind as she gazed about her passing silently from room to room of the little house she was a good woman and she had made up her mind that she would not be a millstone around the necks of her companions many people have been happy in camps and indeed camplife has become one of the features of our higher civilization and this from what she had heard must be a camp above the common so think what she might she determined to make no open complaint if it were possible for her to be happy here she would be happy  as for margery no determination was needed in her case everything was better than she had expected to find it the cabin with the bark on almost everything even the furniture was just what a house in the woods ought to be and when she entered the little studio which was nearer allied to the original forest than any other part of the house she declared that that must be her room and that living there she would feel almost like a dryad in an oak  youve camped out before said phil matlack to mr archibald as he was taking a survey of the scene  oh yes said the other ive been out a few days at a time with fishingparties but we never had such a fine camp as thisso well located and such good accommodations  you are a fisherman then said the guide  yes i am very fond of it ive fished ever since i was a boy and know a good deal about bait in spite of what mr sadler said  i had an idea of that sort remarked phil but it aint no use to contradict peter it helps keep up his spirits for him to think he can read the characters of people just as quick as he can aim a rifle and its a mighty important thing to keep peters spirits up if peters spirits was to go down things round here would flatten out worse than a rotten punkin when its dropped  it did not take long to establish the newcomers in their woodland quarters the tent for the two men which had arrived in the morning was pitched not far from the cabin and then matlack and martin went to work to prepare supper the diningroom in pleasant weather was the small space in front of the house where there was a table made of a wide board supported by stakes with a low and narrow board on each side also resting on stakes and forming seats  the supper was a better one and better served than any of the party had expected the camp outfit included tablecloths and even napkins  tomorrow said matlack as he brought a dish of hot and savory broiled ham after mr archibald gets to work well have some fish  mrs archibald had been a little fearful that under these primitive conditions the two men might expect to sit at the table with them but she need have had no such fears matlack and martin cooked and waited with a skill and deftness which would have surprised any one who did not reflect that this was as much their business as hunting or woodcraft  after supper a campfire was built at a safe distance from the house for although the evening air was but slightly cool a camp without a campfire would not be a camp the party ranged themselves around it mrs archibald on a rug brought from the cabin and her husband and margery on the ground mr archibald lighted his pipe the fire lighted the trees and the lake and joy inexpressible lighted the heart of margery  if i could smoke a pipe said she and get mr matlack to come here and tell me how he killed a man i should be perfectly happy  that night mrs archibald lay awake on her straw mattress absolute darkness was about her but through the open window she could see over the tops of the trees on the other side of the lake one little star  if i could get any comfort out of that little star thought the good lady i would do it but i cant do it and there is nothing else to comfort me  on the other side of the room on another straw mattress she could hear her husband breathing steadily then upon the bare boards of the floor which were but a few inches below her little cotbed she thought she heard the patter of small feet a squirrel perhaps or horrible to think of it might be a rat she was sure rats would eat straw beds and her first impulse was to wake mr archibald but she hesitated he was sleeping so soundly still she listened and now she became almost certain that what she heard was not the patter of small feet it sounded more like something soft which was dragging itself over the floorpossibly a snake this idea was simply awful and she sat up in bed still she did not call mr archibald for should he suddenly spring on the floor he would be in more danger from the snake than she was  she listened and she listened but she heard nothing more and then her reason began to assure her that a snakes movements on a bare floor would be absolutely noiseless but in a moment all thoughts of serpents were driven from her head outside of the cabin she heard a sound that could be nothing less than the footsteps of some living creaturea wild beast perhaps a panther the door was shut and fastened but the window was open to call mr archibald and tell him a wild beast was walking outside the house would be positively wicked halfawakened he would probably rush out of the door to see what it was what could she do for an instant she thought of lighting a candle and standing it in the window she knew that wild beasts were afraid of fire and she did not believe that even a panther would dare jump over a lighted candle but if she struck a match and got up she would waken her husband and besides if the wind of which she could feel a puff every now and then did not blow out the candle it might blow it over and set fire to the cabin  she heard the footsteps no more and lay down again but not to sleep the wind seemed to be rising and made a wild unearthly sound as it surged through the trees which surrounded and imprisoned her and shut her out from the world in which she was born and in which she ought to live there was a faraway sound which came to her ears once twice thrice and which might have been the call of some ghostly bird or the warwhoop of an indian at last she drew the covering over her head determined that so long as she could not see she would not hear  a weddingjourney she said to herself and the idea coupled with the sense of her present grewsome and doleful condition was so truly absurd and ridiculous that she could not restrain a melancholy laugh  what is the matter my dear exclaimed mr archibald suddenly turning over in his bed are you choking is the room too close shall i open the door  no indeed she said for that was a laugh you heard i couldnt help laughing at the thought that there should be two such idiots in the world as you and myself  it is idiotic isnt it said mr archibald it is gloriously idiotic and it will do us both a world of good it is such a complete and perfect change that i dont wonder you laugh then he laughed himself clearly and loudly and turned over on his side and went to sleep  mrs archibald felt certain that she would not sleep another wink that night but she did sleep seven hours and a half and was awakened by margery singing outside her window     chapter vi  camp roy   no thoughts of idiocy crossed the minds of any of the camping party during their first breakfast under the great oaktree the air the sunlight the rippling waters of the lake the white clouds in the blue sky the great trunks of the trees the rustling of the leaves the songs of the birds the hum of insects the brightness of everything their wonderful appetitesthe sense of all these things more than filled their minds  for the greater part of that day mr archibald fished sometimes in a stream which ran into the head of the lake about a quarter of a mile above the camp and sometimes on the shores of the lake itself margery sketched her night in the studio had filled her with dreams of art and she had discovered in a corner a portable easel made of hickory sticks with the bark on and she had tucked some drawing materials into one of her bags  mrs archibald was a little tired with her journey of the day before and contented herself with sitting in the shade in pleasant places occupied with some needlework she had brought with her and trying to discipline her mind to habits of happiness in camp this was not very difficult during the first part of this beautiful day but towards the end of the afternoon she began to think less of the joys of a free life in the heart of nature and more of the pleasure of putting on her bonnet and going out to make some calls upon her friends in this state of mind it pleased her to see phil matlack coming towards her  would you like a cup of tea maam said he  no thank you she answered it would seem rather odd to have afternoon tea in the woods and i really dont care for it  we can have most anything in the woods maam said matlack that we can have anywhere else providin you dont mind what sort of fashion you have it in i thought it might be sort of comfortin to you to have a cup of tea ive noticed that in most campin parties of the family order theres generally one or two of them thats lonesome the first day and the fact is i dont count on anything particular bein done on the first day in camp except when the party is regular hunters or fishermen its just as well for some of them to sit round on the first day and let things soak into them provided it isnt rain and the next day they will have a more natural feelin about what they really want to do now i expect you will be off on some sort of a tramp tomorrow maam or else be out in the boat and as for that young lady shes not goin to sketch no more after today shes got young martin out in the boat restin on his oars while shes puttin him into her picture shes rubbed him out so often that i expect hell fall asleep and tumble overboard or else drop one of his oars  mr matlack said mrs archibald will you please sit down a moment i want to ask you something  certainly maam said he and forthwith seated himself on a log near by picking up a stick as he did so and beginning to shave the bark from it with his pocketknife  do you know said she if there are panthers in these woods  matlack looked up at her quickly i expect you heard them walkin about your cabin last night said he and not only panthers but most likely a bear or two and snakes rustlin in the leaves and for all i know coons or possums climbin in and out of the window  oh nothing so bad as that she replied i only thought  excuse me maam he interrupted i didnt mean that you heard all those things but most likely a part of them hardly any family parties goes into camp that some of them dont hear wild beasts the first night but they never come no more them kind of wild beasts i call firstnighters and theyre about the worst kind weve got because they really do hurt people by scratchin and clawin at their nerves whereas the real wild beasts in these partsand theyre mighty scarce and never come near campdont hurt nobody  i am glad to hear it said she but what on earth can be keeping mr archibald when he started out after dinner he said he would be back very soon  oh hes got the fever maam said matlack  fever exclaimed mrs archibald dropping her work in her lap  oh dont be frightened said he it is only the fishin fever it dont hurt anybody it only keeps the meals waitin you see we are pretty nigh the first people out this year and the fish bite lively are you fond of fishin maam  no indeed said she i dislike it i think it is cruel and slimy and generally unpleasant  i expect youll spend most of your time in the boat suggested matlack your husband rows dont he  he doesnt row me said mrs archibald with earnestness i never go out in a boat except with a regular boatman i suppose you have a larger boat than the one that young man is in i can see it from here and it looks very small  no maam said matlack thats the only one weve got and now i guess ill go see about supper this has been a lazy day for us but we always do calclate on a lazy day to begin with  it strikes me said matlack to himself as he walked away that this here camp will come to an end pretty soon the man and the young woman could stand it for a couple of weeks but theres nothing here for the old lady and it cant be long before shell have us all out of the woods again  you can come in called margery about ten minutes after this conversation and young martin who had not the least idea of going to sleep in the boat dipped his oars in the water and rowed ashore pulled the boat up on the beach and then advanced to the spot where margery was preparing to put away her drawing materials  would you mind letting me see your sketch said he  oh no said she but youll see it isnt very much like the scene itself when i make a drawing from nature i never copy everything i see just as if i were making a photograph i suppose you think i ought to draw the boat just as it is but i always put something of my own in my pictures and that you see is a different kind of a boat from the one you were in it is something like venetian boats  it isnt like anything in this part of the world that is true said the young man as he held the drawing in his hand and if it had been more like a gondola it would not have suited the scene i think you have caught the spirit of the landscape very well but if you dont object to a little criticism i should say that the shore over there is too near the foreground it seems to me that the picture wants atmosphere that would help the distance very much  do you draw asked margery in surprise  i used to be very fond of sketching said he i stayed at sadlers a good part of the last winter and when i wasnt out hunting i made a good many drawings of winter scenes i would be glad to show them to you when we go back  well said she if i had known you were an artist i would not have asked you to go out there and sit as a model  oh i am not an artist replied martin i only draw thats all but if you make any more water sketches and would like me to put some ducks or any other kind of wildfowl in the foreground i will be glad to do it for you i have made a specialty of naturalhistory drawings dont bother yourself about that easel ill carry up your things for you  about halfway to the cabin margery suddenly stopped and turned round towards the young man who was following her how did you come to be a guide she asked  he smiled thats because i was born a naturalist and a sportsman i went into business when i finished my education but i couldnt stand that and as i couldnt afford to become a gentleman sportsman i came here as a guide im getting a lot of experience in this sort of life and when ive saved money enough im going on an exploring expedition most likely to central america thats the kind of life that will suit me  and write a book about it asked margery  most likely said he  that night after supper margery remarked our two guides are american citizens and i dont see why they cant eat at the table with us instead of waiting until we have finished we are all free and equal in the woods  margery dearborn exclaimed mrs archibald what are you talking about  she was going to say that if there were one straw more needed to break her back that straw would be the sight of the two guides sitting at the table with them but she restrained herself she did not want mr archibald to know anything about the condition of her back  so long as they dont want to do it and dont do it said she pray dont let us say anything about it lets try to make things as pleasant as we can  mr archibald was lighting his pipe and when he was sure the tobacco was sufficiently ignited he took the pipe from his mouth and turned towards his wife  harriet said he you have been too much alone today i dont know what i shall do tomorrow but whatever it is i am going to take you with me  of course that depends on what it is you do she answered but i will try to do everything i can  mr archibald heaved a little sigh which was not noticed by any one because it sounded like a puff  i am afraid he thought that this camping business is not going to last very much longer and we shall be obliged to make the rest of our weddingjourney in a different style  the next morning when mr archibald went out of his cabin door he looked over the lake and saw a bird suddenly swoop down upon the water breaking the smooth surface into sparkles of silver and then rise again a little silvery fish glittering in its claws  beautifully done said he a splendid stroke and then turning he looked up the lake and not far from the waters edge he saw margery walking with mr clyde while mr raybold followed a little in the rear  harriet he cried quickly stepping into the cabin again look out here what is the meaning of this  mrs archibald was dressed and came out when she saw the trio approaching them she was not so much surprised as was her husband  i dont know the meaning of anything that happens in these woods she said but if a lot of people have come from the hotel with those young men i cannot say i am sorry  come said her husband we must look into this  in two minutes the archibalds had met the newcomers who advanced with outstretched hands as if they had been old friends mr archibald not without some mental disquietude at this intrusion upon the woodland privacy of his party was about to begin a series of questions when he was forestalled by margery  oh uncle archibald and aunt harriet she exclaimed mr clyde and mr raybold have come out here to camp their camp is right next to ours and it is called camp roy you see some years ago there was a large camping party came here and they called the place camp rob roy but it was afterwards divided and one part called camp rob and the other camp roy  indeed interrupted mr archibald mr sadler did not tell us that ours was only half a camp with only half a name  i dont suppose he thought of it said margery and the line between the two camps is just three hundred feet above our cabin i dont suppose anybody ever measures it off but there it is and mr clyde and mr raybold have taken camp roy which hasnt any house on it they started before daybreak this morning and brought a tent along with them which they have pitched just back of that little peninsula and they havent any guide because they want to attend to their own cooking and everything and the man who brought the tent and other things has gone back they are going to live there just like real backwoodsmen and they have a boat of their own which is to be brought up from the bottom of the lake somewherei mean from the lower end of the lake and aunt harriet may i speak to you a moment  with this the young woman drew mrs archibald aside and in a low voice asked if she thought it would be out of the way to invite the two young men to take breakfast with them as it was not likely they had all their cooking things in order so early  five people sat down to breakfast under the great oaktree and it was a lively meal mr archibalds mental disquiet in which were now apparent some elements of resentment had not subsided but the state of his mind did not show itself in his demeanor and he could not help feeling pleased to see that his wife was in better spirits he had always known that she liked company  after breakfast he took matlack aside i dont understand this business said he when i hired this camp i supposed we were to have it to ourselves but if there are other camps jammed close against it we may be in the midst of a great public picnic before a week is out  oh that camp over there isnt much of a camp replied the guide the fact is it is only the tail end of a camp and i dont suppose peter sadler thought anybody would be likely to take it just now and so didnt think it worth while to speak of it of course its jammed up against this one as you say but then the people in one camp havent the right to cross the line into another camp if the people in the other camp dont want them to  line said mr archibald it is absurd to think of lines in a place like this and i have no intention of making myself disagreeable by ordering people off my premises but i would like to know if there is another camp three hundred feet on this side of our cabin or three hundred feet back of it  no sir said matlack speaking promptly there isnt another camp between this and the lower end of the lake theres a big one there and its taken but the people arent coming until next month  if a larger party had taken camp roy said mr archibald to his wife a little later i should not mind it so much but two young men i do not like it     chapter vii  a stranger   it was at the close of a pleasant afternoon four days after the arrival of the young men at camp roy and mrs archibald was seated on a campstool near the edge of the lake intently fishing by her side stood phil matlack who had volunteered to interpose himself between her and all the disagreeable adjuncts of angling he put the bait upon her hook he told her when her cork was bobbing sufficiently to justify a jerk and when she caught a little fish he took it off the hook fishing in this pleasant wise had become very agreeable to the good lady and she found pleasures in camp life which she had not anticipated her husband was in a boat some distance out on the lake and he was also fishing but she did not care for that style of sport the fish were too big and the boat too small  a little farther down the lake martin sanders sat busily engaged in putting some waterfowl into the foreground of margerys sketch a critical observer might have noticed that he had also made a number of changes in said sketch all of which added greatly to its merits as a picture of woodland scenery at a little distance margery was sitting at her easel making a sketch of martin as an artist at work in the woods the two young men had gone off with their guns not perhaps because they expected to find any legitimate game at that season but hoping to secure some ornithological specimens or to get a shot at some minor quadrupeds unprotected by law another reason for their expedition could probably have been found in some strong hints given by mr archibald that it was unwise for them to be hanging around the camps and taking no advantage of the opportunities for sport offered by the beautiful weather and the forest  it was not long before margery became convinced that the sketch on which she was working did not resemble her model nor did it very much resemble an artist at work in the woods  it looks a good deal more like a cobbler mending shoes she said to herself and ill keep it for that some day i will put a bench under him and a shoe in his hand instead of a sketch with that she rose and went to see how martin was getting on i think she said those dark ducks improve the picture very much they throw the other things back then she stopped went to one side and gazed out over the lake i wonder she said if there is really any fun in fishing uncle archibald has been out in that boat for more than two hours and he has fished almost every day since hes been here i should think he would get tired of it  oh no said martin looking up with animation if you know how to fish and there is good sport you never get tired of it  i know how to fish said margery and i do not care about it at all  you know how to fish said martin can you make a cast with a fly  i never tried that said she but i have fished as aunt harriet does and it is easy as can be  oh said he you dont know anything about fishing unless you have fished with a fly that is the only real sport it is as exciting as a battle if you would let me teach you how to throw a fly i am sure you would never find fishing tiresome and these woods would be like a new world to you  why dont you do it yourself then she asked  because i am paid to do other things he replied we are not sent here simply to enjoy ourselves though i must say that i and then he suddenly stopped i wish you would let me teach you flyfishing i know you would like it  margery looked at the eager face turned towards her and then she gazed out over the water  perhaps i might like it she said but it wouldnt be necessary for you to take that trouble uncle archibald has two or three times asked me to go out with him and of course he would teach me how to fish as he does isnt that somebody calling you  yes said martin rising its phil i suppose its nearly suppertime  as they walked towards the camp margery in front and martin behind her carrying the drawingmaterials and the easel margery suddenly turned  illustration they throw the other things back  it was very good of you to offer to teach me to fish with flies she said and perhaps if uncle archibald doesnt want to be bothered i may get you to show me how to do it  the young mans face brightened and he was about to express his pleasure with considerable warmth but he checked himself and merely remarked that whenever she was ready he would provide a rod and flies and show her how to use them  mrs archibald had gone into the cabin and margery went up to matlack who was on his way to the little tent in which the camp cooking was done  did mrs archibald tell you said she that we have invited mr clyde and mr raybold to supper tonight  the guide stopped and smiled she told me said he but i dont know that it was altogether necessary  i suppose you mean said margery that they are here so much but i dont wonder they must do awfully poor cooking for themselves i dont suppose they will bring anything back that is good to eat  not at this time of year said he but i shall be satisfied if they bring themselves home  what do you mean by that asked margery quickly  well said matlack i dont doubt the bicycle fellow will always come back all right but im afeard about the other one that bicycle chap dont know no more about a gun than he does about makin bread and i wouldnt go out huntin with him for a hundred dollars hes just as likely to take a crack at his pardners head as at anything else thats movin in the woods  that is dreadful exclaimed margery  yes it is returned the guide and if i had charge of their camp he wouldnt go out with a gun again but it will be all right in a day or two peter will settle that  mr sadler do you mean asked margery whats he got to do with it  hes got everything to do with it said matlack hes got everything to do with everything in this part of the country hes got his laws and he sees to it that people stand by them one of his rules is that people who dont know how to use guns shant shoot in his camps  but how can he know about the people out here in the woods asked margery  i tell you miss said matlack speaking slowly and decisively peter sadlers ways of knowing things is like gasthe kind you burn i mean i was avisitin once in a city house and slept in a room on the top floor and there was a leak in the pipe in the cellar and that gas just went over the whole house into every room and closet and even under the beds and ive often thought that that was just like peters way of doin things and knowin things you take my word for it that bicycleman wont go out huntin many more days even if he dont shoot his pardner fust  he wont go tomorrow thought margery and then she said to matlack i think we ought to know mr sadlers rules has he any more of them  oh they aint very many said matlack but theres one i think of now and that is that no woman shall go out in a boat by herself on this lake  that is simply horrid exclaimed margery women can row as well as men  i dont say they cant said matlack im only tellin you what peters rules are and thats one of them  margery made no reply but walked away her head thrown back a little more than was usual with her  ive got to keep my eye on her said matlack to himself as he went to the cabin shes never been broke to no harness                                                   mr raybold did not shoot mr clyde nor did he shoot anything else mr clyde did shoot a bird but it fell into the water at a place where the shore was very marshy and it was impossible for him to get it he thought it was a heron or a bittern or perhaps a fishhawk but whatever it was both ladies said that it was a great pity to kill it as it was not good to eat and must have been very happy in its life in the beautiful forest  it is very cruel to shoot them when they are not strictly game said mr clyde and i dont believe i will do it if i had the things to stuff them with that would be different but i havent i believe fishing is just as much fun and more sensible  i do not exclaimed mr raybold i hold that hunting is a manly art and that a foresters life is as bold and free to him as it is to the birds in the air i believe i have the blood of a hunter in me my voice is for the woods  i expect you will change your voice thought margery when mr sadler takes your gun away from you but she did not say so  mr archibald stood with his hands in his pockets reflecting he had hoped that these two young men were inveterate hunters and that they would spend their days in long tramps he did not at all approve of their fishing fishing could be done anywherehere for instance right at this very door  supper was over and the five inhabitants of camps rob and roy had seated themselves around the fire which martin had carefully built keeping in view a cheery blaze without too much heat pipes had been filled and preparations made for the usual evening smoke and talk when a man was seen emerging from the woods at the point where the road opened into the clearing about the camp it was still light for these hungry campers supped early and the man could be distinctly seen as he approached and it was plain that he was not a messenger from sadlers  he was rather a large man dressed in black and wearing a felt hat with a wide straight brim hanging by a strap from his shoulder was a small leather bag and in his hand he carried a closed umbrella advancing towards the fire he took off his hat bowed and smiled he wore no beard his face was round and plump and his smile was pleasant  goodevening ladies and gentlemen said he and his voice was as pleasant as his smile  goodevening said mr archibald and then for a moment there was a pause  i presume said the newcomer looking about him that this is a camp  it is a camp said mr archibald  the fact is so obvious said the man in black that it was really unnecessary for me to allude to it may i ask to be allowed to sit down for a few moments i am fatigued  at this juncture phil matlack arrived on the scene well sir said he have you any business with anybody here who do you wish to see  i have no business said the other and  and you are a stranger to everybody here interrupted matlack  yes but i hope  now then said the guide quickly ive got to ask you to move on this is one of peter sadlers camps and he has strict rules against strangers stoppin in any of them if youve lost your way ill tell you that this road if you dont turn to the right or the left will take you straight to sadlers and theres time enough for you to get there before dark  mr matlack exclaimed mrs archibald who had risen to her feet i want to speak to you its a shame she said when the guide had approached her to send that man away without even giving him a chance to rest himself he may be a very respectable person on a walking tour  i guess he is on a walkin tour said matlack and i guess hes a regular tramp and theres no orders weve got thats stricter than them against tramps  well i dont care who he is said mrs archibald or what your rules are but when a perfectly goodmannered man comes to us and asks simply to be allowed to rest i dont want him to be driven away as if he were a stray pig on a lawn mr archibald shouldnt he be allowed to rest a while  her husband rose and approached the stranger where are you going sir said he  the man looked at matlack at martin who stood behind him and then at the rest of the company and after this comprehensive glance he smiled  from present appearances he said i think i am going to go  mr archibald laughed when do you expect to get there he asked  it seems to me said the other reflectively that i am always going there and i suppose i shall have to keep on doing it  look here said mr archibald turning to matlack give him some supper and let him rest there will be time enough for him to get to sadlers after that if sadler has anything to say against it refer him to me  all right sir said matlack if you say so im no harder on my fellowbeins than other people but rules is rules and it isnt for me to break them  my dear sir said the stranger to mr archibald your words are more grateful to me than the promise of food i see that you consider me a tramp but it is a mistake i am not a tramp if you will allow me after i have eaten a little suppera meal which i must admit i greatly needi will explain to you how i happen to be here and with a bow he walked towards the table where matlack and martin had been eating their supper  do you know what i think he is said mr clyde when mr archibald had resumed his seat and his pipe i believe he is a wandering actor actors always have smoothly shaven faces and he looks like one  actor exclaimed arthur raybold thats nonsense hes not in the least like an actor anybody could see by his tread and his air that hes never been on the stage hes more like a travelling salesman the next thing hell do will be to pull out of that bag some samples of spool thread or patent thimbles  you are both wrong said margeryentirely wrong i have been looking at him and i believe he is a methodist minister with a dead horse they ride circuits and of course when their horses die they walk just wait a little and see if i am not right  they waited a little and then they waited a little longer and they had begun to be tired of waiting before the stranger finished his meal and approached the fire his face was brighter his smile was more pleasant and his step had a certain jauntiness in it  i thank you all he said for the very good meal i have just enjoyed i am now going to go but before i start i would like very muchindeed i crave it as a favorto place myself before you in my proper light may i have permission to do so madam and sir he said addressing mrs and mr archibald but with a respectful glance at the others as if he would not ignore any one of them  certainly said mrs archibald sit down and tell us about yourself  the stranger seated himself with alacrity a little back from the circle and nearer to the young men than to the archibald party     chapter viii  the bishops tale   the stranger placed his broadbrimmed hat on the ground beside him exposing a large round head somewhat bald in front but not from age and the rest of it covered with closecut brown hair his black clothes fitted him very closely their extreme tightness suggesting that they had shrunken in the course of wearing or that he had grown much plumper since he had come into possession of them and their general worn and dull appearance gave considerable distance to the period of their first possession but there was nothing worn or dull about the countenance of the man upon which was an expression of mellow geniality which would have been suitably consequent upon a good dinner with plenty of wine but his only beverage had been coffee and in his clear bright eye there was no trace of any exhilaration except that caused by the action of a hearty meal upon a good digestion and an optimistic disposition  i am very glad he said looking about him at the company and then glancing with a friendly air towards the two guides who stood a little back of mr archibald to have this opportunity to explain my appearance here in the first place i must tell you that i am a bishop whose diocese has been inundated and who consequently has been obliged to leave it  oh exclaimed mr archibald and margery looked at mr clyde with the remark  there you see i was very near to it  i presume this statement will require some explanation continued the man in black and i will make it presently i am going to be exceedingly frank and open in all that i say to you and as frankness and openness are so extremely rare in this world it may be that i shall obtain favor in your eyes from the fact of my possessing those unusual qualities originally i was a teacher and for a year or two i had a very good country school but my employment at last became so repugnant to me that i could no longer endure it and this repugnance was due entirely to my intense dislike for children  that is not at all to your credit observed mrs archibald and i do not see how you became a bishop or why you should have been made one  was your diocese entirely meadowland inquired mr archibald  i am coming to all that said the stranger with a smile of polite consideration towards mrs archibald i know very well that it is not at all to my credit to dislike children but i said i would be honest and i am i do dislike themnot their bodies but their minds children considered physically are often pleasant to the view and even interesting as companions providing their innate juvenility is undisturbed but when their personalities are rudely thrown open by a teacher and the innate juvenility prematurely exposed to the air it is something so clammy so chilly to the mental marrow that i shrink from it as i would shrink from the touch of any cold clammy thing  horrible exclaimed mrs archibald  i am not sure observed margery that there is not some truth in that i had a sundayschool class for a little while and although i cant say there was a clamminess there waswell i dont know what there was but i gave it up  i am glad said the man in black that my candor is not sinking me in the estimation of every one present but even if it did i am obliged to tell the truth i do not know what would have become of me if i had not had the goodfortune to catch the measles from a family with whom i was spending sunday in another town as soon as the disease plainly showed itself upon me my school was broken up and it was never gathered together again at least under me  i must make my story brief and can only say that not long after this i found myself in another town where it became necessary for me to do something to support myself this was difficult for i am an indefinite man and definiteness seems necessary to success in any line happening one day to pass a house with open lower windows i heard the sound of childrens voices speaking in unison and knowing that this must be a school i looked in compelled entirely by that curiosity which often urges us to gaze upon human suffering i found however that this was a kindergarten conducted by a young woman unobserved by scholars or teacher i watched the proceedings with great interest and soon became convinced that kindergartening was a much less repellent system of tuition than any i had known but i also perceived that the methods of the young woman could be greatly improved i thought a good deal upon this subject after leaving the open window soon afterwards becoming acquainted with the young person in charge of the children i offered to teach her a much better system of kindergartening than she was using my terms were very low and she became my scholar i soon learned that there were other kindergartens in the town and some of the teachers of these joined my class moreover there were young women in the place who were not kindergartners but who would like to become such and these i also taught sometimes visiting them at their houses and sometimes giving my lessons in a room loaned by one of my patrons my system became very popular because it was founded upon commonsense  what was your system asked mrs archibald i am interested in kindergartens myself  my object he answered was to make the operation of teaching interesting to the teacher it struck me very forcibly that a continuance of a few years in the present inane performances called kindergartening would infallibly send to our lunatic asylums a number of women more or less young with more or less depleted intellects the various games and exercises i devised were very interesting and i am sure i had scholars who never intended to become kindergartners and who studied with me solely for their own advantage it was at this time that i adopted the clerical dress as being more suitable to my vocation than any other costume and some one having called me the bishop the name soon became popular and i was generally known by it  but what is your real name asked mrs archibald  madam said the man you must excuse me if i ask you to recall your question i have a good name and i belong to a very good family but there are reasons why i do not at present wish to avow that name some of these reasons are connected with the report that i purposely visited the family with the measles in order to get rid of my school others are connected with the inundation of my diocese of which i shall speak others refer to my present indefinite method of life there is reason to suppose that the time is not far distant when my resumption of my family name will throw no discredit upon it but that period has not yet arrived do you press your question madam  oh no said mrs archibald it really makes no difference and out here in the woods a man may call himself a bishop or a cardinal or anything he likes  thank you very much said he and i will continue to speak in figures and call myself a bishop  where i was brought up interpolated phil matlack still standing behind mr archibald i was taught that figures dont lie  my good sir said the speaker with a smile in mathematics they dont in poetry and literature they often do well as i was saying my diocese extended itself my revenues were satisfactory and i had begun to believe that i had found my true work in life when suddenly there was a misfortune there arrived in our town three apostles of kindergarteningtwo of them were women and one was a man they had heard of my system and had come to investigate it they did so with the result that in an astonishingly short time my diocese was inundated with a flood of froebelism which absolutely swept me away with this bag this umbrella and this costume which has now become my wardrobe i was cast out in all my indefiniteness upon a definite world  and how did you get here asked mrs archibald  i had heard of sadler and his camps said he and in this beautiful month and in this beautiful weather i thought it would be well to investigate them i accordingly went to mr sadlers where i arrived yesterday afternoon i found mr sadler a very definite man and i am sorry to say that as he immediately defined me as a tramp he would listen to no other definition you have no money to pay for food and lodgings said he and you come under my tramp laws i dont harbor tramps but i dont kick them out into the woods to starve for labor on this place i pay one dollar and a half a day of ten hours for meals to daylaborers i charge fifteen cents each if you want your supper you can go out to that woodshed and split wood for one hour i was very hungry i went out into the woodshed i split wood for one hour and at the end of that time i had a sufficient meal when i had finished mr sadler sent for me do you want to stay here all night he said i do i answered go then and split wood for another hour i did so and it was almost dark when i had finished in the morning i split wood for my breakfast and when i had finished i went to mr sadler and asked him how much he would charge for a luncheon wrapped in a piece of paper seven and a half cents he said i split wood for half an hour and left sadlers ostensibly to return to the station by the way i had come but while i had been at work i found from the conversation of some of the people that one of the camps was occupied and i also discovered in what direction it lay consequently after i had passed out of the sight of the definite peter sadler i changed my course and took a path through the woods which i was told would lead to this road and i came here because i might just as well pass this way as any other and because having set out to investigate camp life i wished to do so and i hope i may be allowed to say that although i have seen but little of it i like it very much  now then said phil matlack walking around the circle and approaching the stranger you said when you first came here that you were going to go and the time has come when youve got to go  very well said the other looking up with a smile if ive got there id better stop  mr archibald and the young men laughed but matlack and martin who had now joined him did not laugh  youve barely time enough said the former to get to sadlers before it is pitchdark and  excuse me said the other but i am not going back to sadlers tonight i would rather have no bed than split wood for an hour after dark in order to procure one i would prefer a couch of dried leaves  you come along into the road with this young man and me i want to talk to you said matlack  now matlack said mr archibald dont be cruel  i am not said the guide i am the tenderesthearted person in the world but even if you say so sir i cant let a stranger stay all night in a camp that ive got charge of  look here matlack exclaimed mr clyde you havent got charge of our camp  no i havent said the other  well then this person can come over and stay with us we have a little tent that we brought to put over the cookingstove and he can sleep in that  very well said matlack if you take him out of this camp i havent anything to saythat is tonight  my dear sir said the stranger rising and approaching mr clyde i accept your offer with pleasure and thank you most heartily for it if you had proffered me the hospitality of a palace i could not be more grateful  all right said clyde and i suppose it is time for us to be off so i will bid you all goodnight come along arthur come along bishop  the face of the lastnamed individual beamed with delight as he heard this appellation and bidding everybody goodnight and thanking them for the kindness with which he had been treated he followed the two young men  the three walked some little distance towards camp roy and then clyde came running back to speak to margery who was now standing by herself watching the young moon descend among the trees then mr raybold also stopped and came back to margery upon which the bishop stopped and waited for them in about ten minutes he was joined by the two young men and the three proceeded to camp roy  there is one thing harriet said mr archibald which i wish you would speak to margery about i dont want her to get up so early and go out for a morning walk i find that those young men are also early risers  i will speak to her said mrs archibald where is she  over there talking to young martin said her husband it isnt quite dark yet but i think it is time we were all in bed  quite time said she margery tells me that that young guide who is a handsome fellow is going to teach her how to fish with flies i wish you would sometimes take her out in the boat with you mr archibald i am sure that you could teach her how to fish  he smiled i suppose i could he said and i also suppose i could pull her out of the water the first time she hooked a big fish it would be like resting a boat on a pivot to put her into it  then you dont take her said mrs archibald decisively and you cant take her with you up the stream because of course she cant wade i dont want her to get tired of camplife but  dont be afraid of the young men interrupted her husband with a laugh so long as there are three of them there is no danger  of course i will not if you dont wish it aunt harriet said margery when mrs archibald had spoken to her about the early morning walks and i will stay in my room until you call me  the next morning when mrs archibald was ready to leave the cabin she did call margery but received no answer then she went to the little studioroom and when she opened the door she found its occupant leaning out of the window talking to mr clyde and mr raybold who stood outside  goodmorning aunt harriet exclaimed margery gayly mr clyde has brought me nearly an armful of birchbark all thin and smooth i am going to make a birchbark bedspread out of it ill cover a sheet with these pieces you see and sew them on then i can have autographs on them and mottoes and when i cover myself up with it i shall really feel like a dryad  and here is what i have brought said mr raybold holding up an armful of bark  oh thank you very much said margery taking the mass but not without dropping a good many of the pieces of course it was kind of him to bring it she said to mrs archibald as they left the room together but he neednt have bothered himself i dont want to sleep under a woodpile     chapter ix  matlacks three troubles   have you asked those two young men to breakfast again inquired mr archibald after examining with a moderate interest the specimen of birchbark which margery had shown him  oh no indeed said she they have had their breakfast they have been telling me about it the bishop got up very early in the morning and cooked it for them hes a splendid cook and he found things in their hampers that they didnt know they had they said his coffee was delicious and they have left him there in their camp now washing the dishes and putting everything in order and do you think uncle archibald that it is going to rain  i do said he for it is sprinkling already  this proved to be the first bad day since the archibald party had gone into camp and the rain soon began to come down in a steady practised way as if the clouds above were used to that sort of thing and could easily keep it up all day  as there was no place under roof to which company could be conveniently invited margery retired to her room and set herself diligently to work on her birchbark quilt  mrs archibald established herself in the division of the cabin which was intended to be used as a sitting and dining room in bad weather and applied herself to some sewing and darning which had been reserved for just such a day as this mr archibald in a waterproof suit tried fishing for half an hour or so but finding it both unpleasant and unprofitable he joined his wife made himself as comfortable as possible on two chairs and began to read aloud one of the novels they had brought with them  mr clyde and mr raybold had considerately gone to their own camp when it began to rain hoping however that the shower would be over in a short time but the rain was not a shower and they spent the morning on their backs in their tent talking and smoking of course they could not expect the bishop to depart in the rain so they had told him to make himself as comfortable as he could in the little kitchen tent and offered him a pipe and a book the first he declined as he never smoked but the latter he accepted with delight  after the midday dinner phil matlack in a pair of high huntingboots and an oilskin coat came to mr archibald and said that as there was nothing he could do that afternoon he would walk over to sadlers and attend to some business he had there  about the bishop asked mr archibald  partly said matlack i understand the fellow is still over there with those two young men i dont suppose theyll send him off in the rain and as he isnt in my camp i cant interfere but it may rain for two or three days  all right said mr archibald and if we want anything well ask martin  just so said matlack if theres anything to do that you dont want to do yourself you can get him to do it but if you want to know anything you dont know yourself youd better wait until i come back  when matlack presented himself before peter sadler he found that ponderous individual seated in his rollingchair near the open door enjoying the smell of the rain  hello phil he cried whats wrong at the camp  the guide left his wet coat and cap on the little piazza outside and after carefully wiping his feet seated himself on a chair near the door  theres three things wrong said he in the first place theres a tramp out there and it looks to me as if he was agoin to stick if he can get allowed to do it  is he too big for you to bounce roared peter thats a pretty story to come tell me  no he aint said the other but i havent got the bouncin of him hes not in my camp the young men have took him in but i expect hell come over with them as soon as its done rainin for when that happens theyre bound to come themselves  look here phil said peter is he dressed in black  yes he is said the guide  mr sadler slapped his hand on the arm of his chair phil matlack he shouted thats my favorite tramp i never had a man here who paid his bill in work as he did it was cash down and good money not a minute of woodsplitting more or less than the marketprice for meals and bed id like to have a tramp like that come along about twice a week but i tell you phil he aint no tramp couldnt you see that none of them loafers ever worked as he did  he may not be a tramp said matlack but hes trampin what are you goin to do about him let him stay there  whats he doin now asked sadler  hes cookin for those two young men  well they need some one to do it for them and they didnt want to go to the expense of a guide let the parson alone for a day or two and if he does anything out of the way just you take him by one ear and martin take him by the other and bring him to me ill attend to him whats the next trouble  thats out of my camp too said matlack but im bound to report it the bicycle fellow that you hired a gun to dont know the fust thing about usin it and the next thing youll hear will be that hes shot his pardner whos worth six of him  mr sadler sat up very straight in his chair and stared at the guide phil matlack he shouted what do you take me for i hired that gun to that young man dont you suppose i know what im about  thats all right said matlack but the trouble is he dont know what hes about  get away man said peter with a contemptuous sniff hell never hurt anybody what do you take me for when he came to me and wanted a gun i handed him two or three so that he might choose one that suited him and by the way he handled them i could see that most likely hed never handled one before and so i set him up all right hes got a good gun and all the cartridges hell be likely to want and the cartridges are all like this theyre a new kind i heard of last winter and i got a case from boston last week i dont see how i ever managed to run my camps without them do you see that shot said he opening one end of a cartridge well take one in your hand and pinch it  phil did so and it crumbled to dust in his hand  when that loads fired said peter all the shot will crumble into dust it wouldnt do to give raw hands blankcartridges because theyd find that out but with this kind they might sit all day and fire at a baby asleep in its cradle and never disturb it provided the baby was deaf and he cant use his pardners cartridges for i gave that fellow a twelvebore gun and his is a tenbore  phil grinned well then said he i suppose i might as well make my mind easy but if that bicycle man hunts much hell get the conviction borne in on him that hes a dreadful bad shot  then hell give up shooting which is what is wanted said sadler whats your third bother  that young woman has made up her mind to go out in the boat by herself the very fust time she feels like it said matlack she didnt say so with her mouth but she said it with the back of her head and her shoulders and i want to know if that rule of yours is going to hold good this summer women is gettin to do so many things they didnt use to that i didnt know but what youd consider theyd got far enough to take themselves out on the lake and if you do think so i dont want to get myself in hot water with those people and then find you dont back me up  if you dont want to get yourself into hot water with me phil matlack youd better get it into your head just as soon as you can that when i make a rule its a rule and i dont want people comin to me and talkin about changes women in my camp dont go out in boats by themselves and its easy enough to have that rule kept if youve got backbone enough to do it keep the boat locked to the shore when it aint in use and put the key in your pocket and if anybody gets it that aint any right to it thats your lookout now thats the end of your troubles i hope hows things goin on generally in the camp  oh well enough said matlack i thought at fust the old ladyd give out in a day or two but ive taught her parlorfishin which shes took to quite lively and shes got used to the woods the boss he sticks to fishin as if it was officework and as for the rest of them i guess theyre all gettin more and more willin to stay  why asked peter  well one of them is a gal and the others isnt replied matlack thats about the pint of it  during matlacks walk back the skies cleared and when he reached the camp he found mrs archibald seated in her chair near the edge of the lake a dry board under her feet and the bishop standing by her putting bait on her hook and taking the fish off of it when any happened to be there out in the boat sat mr archibald trusting that some fish might approach the surface in search of insects disabled by the rain farther on at a place by the waters edge that was clear of bushes and undergrowth martin was giving miss dearborn a lesson in flyfishing  hes a mighty good fisherman thought matlack looking at the young fellow as he brought his rod back from the water with a long graceful sweep and then with another sweep and an easy inclination of his body forward sending the fly far out on the smooth surface of the lake although there aint no need to tell him so and i dont wonder shed rather stand and watch him than try to do it herself  walking up and down near the edge of the wood were messrs clyde and raybold  phil smiled they dont seem to be happy he said to himself i guess theyre hankerin to take a share in her edication but if you dont know nothin yourself you cant edicate other people  matlack directed his steps towards mrs archibald but before he reached her he was met by the bishop who hurried towards him  i shall be obliged to surrender my post to you he said which will be greatly to the ladys satisfaction i imagine for i must appear a poor attendant after you  illustration a lesson in flyfishing  goin to leave us said matlack you look quite spruced up  the bishop smiled you allude i suppose said he to the fact that my hat and clothes are brushed and that i am freshly shaved and have on a clean collar i like to be as neat as i can this is a guttapercha collar and i can wash it whenever i please with a bit of damp rag and it is my custom to shave every day if i possibly can but as to leaving you i shall not do so this evening i have promised those young gentlemen who so kindly invited me to their camp that i would prepare their supper for them and i must now go to make the fire and get things in readiness  have they engaged you as cook and general help asked matlack  oh no said the bishop with a smile they are kind and i am grateful that is all     chapter x  a ladies day in camp   two days after the rainy day in camp mr archibald determined to take the direction of affairs into his own hands so far as he should be able having no authority over the two young men at camp roy he had hitherto contented himself with a disapproval of their methods of employing their time which he communicated only to his wife but now he considered that as they were spending so much of their time in his camp and so little in their own he would take charge of them exactly as if they belonged to his party he would put an end if possible to the aimless strolls up and down the beach with margery and the long conversations of which that young woman had grown to be so fond held sometimes with both young men though more frequently with one if clyde and raybold came into the woods to lounge in the shade and talk to a girl they must go to some other camp to do it but if they really cared to range the forest either as sportsmen or lovers of nature he would do his best to help them so this day he organized an expedition to a low mountain about two miles away taking matlack with him as guide and inviting the two young men to join him they had assented because no good reason for declining had presented itself and because phil matlack earnestly urged them to come along and let him show them what a real forest tramp was like before his recent talk with peter sadler phil would not have dared to go out into the woods in company with the bicycle man  the two ladies were perfectly willing to remain in camp under the charge of martin who was capable of defending them against any possible danger and as the bishop had agreed to take charge of camp roy during the absence of its occupants mr archibald planned for a whole days tramp the first he had taken since they went into camp  when martins morning work was done he approached the shady spot where the two ladies had established themselves and offered to continue his lessons in fishflying if miss dearborn so desired but miss dearborn did not wish to take any lessons today she would rest and stay with mrs archibald even the elder lady did not care to fish that morning the day was hot and the shade was grateful  martin walked away dissatisfied in his opinion there had never been a day more suitable for angling this was a day which would be free from interruptions either from two young fellows who knew nothing about real gamefishing or from matlack who always called him away to do something when he was most interested in his piscatorial pedagogics this was a day when he could stand by that lovely girl give her the rod show her how to raise it wave it and throw it and sometimes even touch her hand as he took it from her or gave it back watching her all the time with an admiration and delight which no speckled trout or gamy black bass had ever yet aroused in him and all this without fear that a gentleman out on the lake might possibly be observing them with the idea that he was more interested in his work than the ordinary guide might be supposed to be but luck was against him and martin who did not in the least consider himself an ordinary guide walked up and down in moody reflection or grimly threw himself upon the ground gazing upward at the skynot half so blue as he wasbut never walking or resting so far away that he could not hear the first cry from her should snake bear dragonfly or danger of any kind approach her  to the ladies about half an hour later came the bishop who newly shaved and brushed wished them goodmorning and offered his services in any manner which might be desired if mrs archibald wished to fish by the side of the lake he was at her service but mrs archibald did not care to fish  this is a most charming day said the bishop removing his hat but i suppose it is more charming to me because it is my last day here  and so you are really going to go said mrs archibald smiling  i suppose you think i am not likely to get there said he but really i have stayed here long enough and for several reasons  sit down said margery and tell us what they are there is a nice little rock with some moss on it  the bishop promptly accepted the invitation and seated himself as he did so martin at a little distance scowled folded his arms and slightly increased the length of his sentinellike walk  yes said the bishop brushing some pine leaves from his threadbare trousers during the time that i have accepted the hospitality of those young gentlemen i feel that i have in a great measure repaid them for their kindness but now i see that i shall become a burden and an expense to them in the first place i eat a great deal more than both of them put together so that the provisions they brought with them will be exhausted much sooner than they expected i am also of the opinion that they are getting tired of eating in their own camp but as i make a point of preparing the meals at stated hours of course they feel obliged to partake of them  by which you mean i suppose said mrs archibald that if they had not you to cook for them they would be apt to take a good many meals with us as they did when they first came and which would be cheaper and pleasanter  i beg madam said the bishop quickly that you will not think that they have said anything of the sort i simply inferred from remarks i have heard that one of them at least is very much of the opinion you have just stated therefore i feel that i cannot be welcome much longer in camp roy there is also another reason why i should go now i have a business prospect before me  i am glad to hear that said mrs archibald is it a good one  i think it is said the bishop i have been considering it earnestly and the more i fix my mind upon it the greater appear its advantages i dont mind in the least telling you what it is a gentleman who is acquainted with my family and whom i have met two or three times but not recently possesses a very fine estate some thirty miles south of this place he has been in europe for some time but is expected to return to his country mansion about the end of this week it is my purpose to offer myself to him in the capacity of private librarian i do not think it will be difficult to convince him that i have many qualifications for the situation  has he so many books that he needs a librarian asked margery  no said the bishop i have no reason to suppose that he has any more books than the ordinary country gentleman possesses but he ought to have he has a very large income and is now engaged in establishing for his family what is intended to become in time an ancestral mansion it is obvious to any one of intelligence that such a grand mansion would not be complete without a wellselected library and that such a library could not be selected or arranged by an ordinary man of affairs consequently unless he has a competent person to perform this duty for him his library for a long time will be insignificant when i shall put the question before him i have no doubt that he will see and appreciate the force and value of my statements such a position will suit me admirably i shall ask but little salary but it will give me something far better than moneyan opportunity to select from the book marts of the whole world the literature in which i delight consequently you will see that it is highly desirable that i should be on hand when this gentleman arrives upon his estate  with a look of gentle pity mrs archibald gazed at the smooth round face of the bishop flushed with the delights of anticipation and brightened by the cheery smile which nearly always accompanied his remarks and is that your only prospect she said i dont want to discourage you but it seems to me that if you had some regular businessand you are not too old to learn something of the sortit would be far better for you than trying to obtain the mythical position you speak of i see that you are a man of intelligence and education and i believe that you would succeed in almost any calling to which you would apply yourself with earnestness and industry you must excuse me for speaking so plainly but i am much older than you are and i do it for your good  madam exclaimed the bishop radiant with grateful emotion i thank you from the bottom of my heart for what you have said i thank you for your appreciation of me and for the generous motive of your words but to be frank with you i am not suited to a calling such as you have mentioned i have many qualities which i well know would promote my fortunes were they properly applied but that application is difficult for the reason that my principal mental characteristic is indefiniteness when but a little child i was indefinite nobody knew what i was going to do or how i would turn out no one has since known and no one knows now in whatever way i have turned my attention in my endeavors to support myself i have been obstructed and even appalled by the definiteness of the ordinary pursuits of life now the making of a private library is in itself an indefinite occupation it has not its lines its rules its limitations but do not think kind lady that i shall always depend upon such employment should i obtain it i should hold it only so long as it would be necessary and it may be necessary for but a little while do you care to hear of my permanent prospects said he looking from one lady to the other  certainly said margery we would like to hear all you have to tell  well then said the bishop folding his arms and smiling effusively but with a gentle curbing of his ordinary cheerfulness i will inform you that i have an uncle who is a man of wealth and well on in years unfortunately or fortunately it may be this uncle greatly dislikes me he objects so strongly to my methods of thought and action and even to my physical presence that he cannot bear to hear me speak or even to look at me and the last time i was in his company about four years ago he told me that he would leave me a legacy on condition that he should never hear from me or see me again he promised to make the proper provision in his will immediately but declared and i know he will keep his word that if he ever received a letter from me or even saw me or heard my voice he would instantly strike out that clause i appreciated and respected his feelings and accepted the condition from that moment i have not written to him nor shall i ever write to him and i shall never go near him so long as he is alive as i said he is of advanced age and it is impossible that he can long survive when his demise takes place my circumstances will i believe be satisfactory  did your uncle say how much he would leave you asked mrs archibald  no madam returned the other he did not but i feel sure that the sum will be measured by his satisfaction in knowing that his existence is entirely freed from me  really said mrs archibald there is nothing about you so indefinite as your prospects  and it seems horrible to me said margery to be hoping that some one may die in order that you may be better off for as you want money so much you must hope that your uncle will die  the bishop smiled and rose and now said he i suppose i must go to prepare the dinner at camp roy there is nobody but myself to eat it but i have assumed the duty and it must be performed goodmorning by your leave i shall look in upon you again  mrs archibald had a mind to ask him to stay and dine with them but having noticed an unfriendly expression on the face of martin when his gloomy walk brought him in her direction she thought it would not be wise to do so     chapter xi  margery takes the oars   after dinner mrs archibald prepared herself for a nap the most delightful thing she could think of during the warm hours of such a day margery after seeing the elder lady comfortably disposed in the shady sittingroom of the cabin went outofdoors with no doubt in her mind as to what would be for her the most delightful thing to do she would take a row on the lake all by herself  she went down to the boat which was partly drawn up on the beach and fastened to a heavy stake but when she reached it she was disgusted to find that the chain was secured to the stake by a padlock the oars were in the boat and she could easily have pushed it into the water but she could not set it free without the key to the padlock  i do believe she exclaimed that the will of that horrid mr sadler is like gas it goes everywhere even to the tops of the houses and under the beds but she did not give up her intention she tried to detach the chain from the boat but finding this impossible she thought of going for martin perhaps he might have a key this idea however she quickly put aside if he had a key and gave it to her she might get him into trouble and besides she did not believe that he would let her go alone and in any other way she did not wish to go standing with her pretty brows knit and one heel deep in the soft ground into which she had stamped it she heard approaching footsteps and turning saw the bishop he came forward with a buoyant step  is there anything i can do for you miss dearborn he said do you wish to go out on the lake do you want some one to row you  yes and no said margery i want to go out in the boat and i dont want anybody to row me but that chain is fastened with an abominable padlock and i cannot launch the boat  one of your guides is here said he perhaps i can get a key from him  no no said margery quickly he must not know about it there is a sadler law against it and he is employed by sadler  it is very securely fastened said the bishop examining the lock and chain it is the work of the guide matlack i have no doubt but miss dearborn said he with a bright smile there is a boat at camp roy that is not locked and i can bring it here in twenty minutes  no said margery i dont want that boat ive seen it it is a clumsy old thing and besides it leaks i want this one this is just the kind of boat i want to row it is too bad if i could get off now there would be nobody to hinder me for martin is washing the dinner dishes or doing something of that kind and whenever he does housework he always keeps himself out of sight  the bishop examined the stake it was a stout little tree trunk driven deep into the ground and projecting about five feet above the surface with the chain so wrapped around it that it was impossible to force it up or down seizing the stake near the top the bishop began to push it backward and forward and being a man of great strength he soon loosened it so much that stooping he was able to pull it from the ground  hurrah exclaimed margery it came up just like pulling a tooth  yes said the radiant bishop the good matlack may be very careful about fastening a boat but i think i have got the better of him this time and now i will put the stake chain and all in the bow that is the best way of disposing of them are you sure that you prefer going alone i shall be delighted to row you if you wish me to  oh no said margery i am just wild to row myself and i want to hurry and get off for fear martin will be coming down here  are you sure you understand rowing and the management of a boat he asked  oh yes she replied i can row of course i can i will get in and then you can push off the boat  allow me said the bishop but before he could reach her to help her margery stepped quickly into the boat and was about to seat herself  if you will take the seat next to the stern said the bishop holding the boat so that it would be steady i think that will be better then the weight of the stake in the bow will put the boat on an even keel  all right said margery accepting his suggestion and seating herself now just wait until i get the oars into the rowlocks and then you can push me off  which way do you intend to row asked the bishop  oh i shall go down towards the lower end of the lake because that way there are more bushes along the banks and martin will be less apt to see me if i go the other way i will be in plain sight of the camp and he may think he ought to do somethingfire a gun across my bows to bring me to maybe as they do at sea  hardly said the bishop but let me advise you not to go very far from the shore so that if you feel tired you can come in easily and if you will allow me i will walk down the shore in the direction in which you intend to row  oh i am not going to get tired said she i could row all day it is splendid to be in a boat all by myself and have the whole management of it now please push me off  with some reluctance but with a sincere desire to make the young girl happy which could not be overcome by prudenceat least by such prudence as he possessedthe bishop with a strong steady push sent the boat well out on the surface of the water  that was beautifully done margery called back to him now i have room enough to turn around without any trouble at all  she turned the boat about with its bow towards the lower end of the lake but it was not done without trouble i have not rowed for a good while she said but i am getting used to the oars already now then im off and she began to pull with a strength which had it been suitably paired with skill would have made her an excellent amateur oarswoman but the place of skill was supplied by enthusiasm and determination once or twice an oar slipped from the rowlock and she nearly went over backward and several times one of the blades got under the water with the flat side up so that she had difficulty in getting it out she raised her oars much too high in the air but she counterbalanced this by sinking them very deep into the water but she got on and although her course was somewhat irregular its general trend was in the direction desired  the bishop walked along the bank keeping as near to the water as he could sometimes masses of shrubbery shut off all view of the lake and then there would be an open space where he would stop and watch the boat  please keep near the shore miss dearborn he called that will be better i think and it is certainly more shady and pleasant than farther out  i know what you mean cried margery pulling away in high goodhumor you think it is safer near the shore but i am not going to row very far this time and after a little while i may pull the boat in and rest for a time before starting back and then she rowed on with renewed energy  the next time the bishop was able to hail the boat it was at a point where he was obliged to push his way through the bushes in order to see out upon the lake  miss dearborn he called i think you are a great deal too far from shore and you must be getting very tired and hot your face is greatly flushed i will hurry along and see if i can find a good place for you to stop and cool yourself  i am all right cried margery resting on her oars i get along very well only the boat doesnt steer properly i think it is because of the weight of that stick in the bow i suppose i cannot get rid of it  oh no cried the bishop in alarm please dont think of it but if you touch shore at the first open space i think i can arrange it better for you  very good said she you go ahead and find such a place and i will come in  if you touch shore said the bishop to himself you dont go out again in that boat alone you dont know how to row at all  the bishop ran a hundred yards or more before he found a place at which a boat could be beached it was not a very good place but if he could reach out and seize the bow that would be enough for him he was strong enough to pull that boat over a paved street  as he looked out over the water he saw that margery had progressed considerably since he had seen her last but she was still farther from shore than before  row straight towards me he shouted here is a fine landingplace cool and shady  she looked around and managed to turn the boats head in his direction then she rowed hard pulling and splashing and evidently a little tired she was strong but this unusual exercise was a trial to her muscles perhaps too she felt that the bishop was watching her and that made her a little nervous for she could not help being aware that she was not handling the oars as well as when she started out with a strong pull at her right oar to turn the boat inland she got her left oar tangled between the water and the boat so it seemed to her and lost her hold of it in a moment it was overboard and floating on the lake  leaning over the side of the boat she made a grasp at the oar but it was too far for her to reach it and then by a spasmodic movement of the other oar the distance was increased  the bishops face grew pale as he looked at her he saw that she was moving away from the floating oar and now he understood why she had progressed so well there was a considerable current in the lake which had carried her along and was now moving the heavy boat much faster than it moved the oar what should he tell her to do if she could put her single oar out at the stern she might scull the boat but he was sure she did not understand sculling and to try it she would have to stand up and this would be madness  she now took the other oar from the rowlock and was about to rise when the bishop shouted to her  what are you going to do he cried  i am going to the stern she said to see if i cannot reach that oar with this one perhaps i can pull it in  for heavens sake dont do that he cried dont stand up or the boat will tip and you will fall overboard  but what can i do she called back i cant row with one oar  try rowing a little on one side and then on the other said he perhaps you can bring in the boat in that way  she followed his suggestion but very awkwardly and he saw plainly that she was tired instead of approaching the shore the boat continued to float down the lake  margery turned again bishop she cried what shall i do i must do something or i cant get ashore at all  she did not look frightened there was more of annoyance in her expression as if she thought it impertinent in fate to treat her in this way and she would not stand it  if i had thought of the current said the bishop to himself i would never have let her go out alone and she cant be trusted in that boat another minute longer she will do something desperate so saying the bishop took off his hat and threw it on the ground then he unbuttoned his coat and began to take it off but he suddenly changed his mind even in that wilderness and under these circumstances he must appear respectable so he buttoned his coat again hastily took off his shoes and without hesitating walked into the water until it was above his waist and then calling to margery that he was coming to her he began to swim out into the lake he did not strike out immediately for the boat but directed his course towards the floating oar turning his head frequently towards margery he could see that she was sitting perfectly still watching him and so he kept on with a good heart  the bishop was a powerful swimmer but he found great difficulty in making his way through the water on account of the extreme tightness of his clothes it seemed to him that his arms and legs were bandaged in splints as if he had been under a surgeons care but still he struck out as well as he could and in time reached the oar pushing this before him to the boat margery took hold of it  you swim splendidly said she you can climb in right here  but the bishop knew better than that and worked his way round to the stern and after holding on a little while to get his breath he managed to clamber into the boat  was the water very cold said she  on his replying that it was she said she thought so because he seemed stiff  now miss dearborn said he i have made the stern seat very wet but i dont believe you will mind that and if you will sit here i will take the oars and row you in  illustration but the bishop knew better  oh i think i can do that myself said margery i am rested now and i am ever so much obliged to you for getting my oar for me  under almost any circumstances the bishop could smile and now he smiled at the ridiculousness of the idea of margerys rowing that boat back against the current and with him in it  indeed said he i must insist i shall freeze to death if i dont warm myself by exercise so reaching out his hand he assisted margery to the stern and seating himself in her place he took the oars which she had drawn in  i dont see why i could not make the boat go along that way said she as they began to move steadily towards the camp i believe i could do it if people would only let me practise by myself but they always want to show me how and i hate to have anybody show me how it is funny she continued that you seem so very wet all but your collar that looks as smooth and nice as if it had just come from the laundry  the bishop laughed that is because it is guttapercha he said intended for rough use in camp but the rest of my habiliments were not intended for wet weather  and you have no hat said she doesnt the sun hurt your head  my head does feel a little warm said he but i didnt want to row back to the place where i left my hat it was not a good landingplace after all besides he said to himself i never thought of my hat or my shoes     chapter xii  the bishop engages the attention of the guides   when the boat touched the shore margery ran to the cabin to assure mrs archibald of her safety if she had been missed  the bishop was sticking the stake in the hole from which he had pulled it when martin came running to him  thats a pretty piece of business cried the young man if you wanted to go out in the boat why didnt you come to me for the key youve got no right to pull up the stakes weve driven down thats the same thing as stealing the boat whats the matter did you tumble overboard you must be a pretty sort of an oarsman if the ladies want to go out in the boat i am here to take them id like you to understand that  as has been said before the bishop could smile under almost any circumstances and he smiled now but at the same time his brow wrinkled which was not common when he smiled  i am going down to the shore to get my hat and shoes he said and i would like you to come along with me i cant stand here and talk to you  what do you want said martin  come along and see said the bishop that is if you are not afraid  that was enough and the young man walked behind him until they reached the spot where the bishop had taken to the water then he stopped and explained to martin all that had happened  now said he what have you got to say  martin now that he knew that the bishop had plunged into the water for the sake of the beautiful margery was more jealously angry than when he had supposed he had merely taken her out to row  i havent anything to say he answered shortly except that parsons had better attend to their own business if they have any and let young ladies and boats alone  oh thats all is it said the bishop and with a quick step forward he clutched the young mans arm with his right hand while he seized his belt with the other and then with a great heave sent him out into the water fully ten feet from the shore with a splash like a dropped anchor martin disappeared from view but soon arose his head and shoulders above the surface where he stood for a moment spluttering and winking and almost dazed  the bishop stood on the bank and smiled did you fall overboard said he you must be a pretty sort of a boatman  without replying martin began to wade ashore  come on said the bishop if you cant get up the bank ill help you  but martin needed no help he scrambled to the bank shook himself and then advanced upon the bishop fire in his eye and his fist clinched  stop young man said the other it would not be fair to you if i did not tell you that i am a boxer and a heavyweight and that i threw you into the water because i didnt want to damage your face and eyes you were impertinent but i am satisfied and the best thing you can do is to go and change your clothes before any one sees you in that plight you are better off than i am because i have no clothes with which to make a change so saying he sat down and began to put on his shoes  martin stood for a moment and looked at the bishop he thought of margery and a possible black eye and then he walked as fast as he could to his tent to get some dry clothes he was very wet he was very hot he was very angry and what made him more angry than anything else was a respect for the bishop which was rising in him in spite of all his efforts to keep it down  when mr archibald and his party came back to camp late in the afternoon margery who had already told her story to mrs archibald told it to each of the others mr archibald was greatly moved by the account of the bishops bravery he thoroughly appreciated the danger to which margery had been exposed there were doubtless persons who could be trusted so sit quietly in a little boat with only one oar and to float upon a lake out of sight and sound of human beings until another boat could be secured and brought to the rescue but margery was not one of these persons her greatest danger had been that she was a child of impulse he went immediately to camp roy to see the bishop and express his gratitude for no matter how great the foolish goodnature of the man had been his brave rescue of the girl was all that could be thought of now  illustration with a great heave sent him out into the water  he found the bishop in bed mr clyde preparing the supper and mr raybold in a very bad humor  its the best place for me said the bishop gayly from under a heavy army blanket my bed is something like the carpets in queen elizabeths time and this sheltertent is not one which can be called commodious but i shall stay here until morning and then i am sure i shall be none the worse for my dip into the cold lake  as mr archibald had seen the black garments of the bishop hanging on a bush as he approached the tent he was not surprised to find their owner in bed  no said the bishop when mr archibald had finished what he had to say there is nothing to thank me for it was a stupid thing to launch a young girl out upon what by some very natural bit of carelessness might have become to her the waters of eternity and it was my very commonplace duty to get her out of the danger into which i had placed her so this my dear sir is really all there is to say about the matter  mr archibald differed with him for about ten minutes and then returned to his camp  phil matlack was also affected by the account of the rescue and he expressed his feelings to martin  he pulled up the stake did he said phil well ill make him pull up his stakes and before he goes ive a mind to teach him not to meddle with other peoples affairs  if i were you said martin i wouldnt try to teach him anything  you think he is too stupid to learn said matlack getting more and more angry at the bishops impertinent and inexcusable conduct well ive taught stupid people before this  hes a bigger man than you are said martin  matlack withdrew the knife from the loaf of bread he was cutting and looked at the young man  bigger said he scornfully whats that got to do with it a load of hay is bigger than a crowbar but i guess the crowbar would get through the hay without much trouble  youd better talk about a load of rocks said martin i dont think youd find it easy to get a crowbar through them  matlack looked up inquiringly has he been thrashing you he asked  no he hasnt said martin sharply  you didnt fight him then  no i didnt was the answer  why didnt you you were here to take charge of this camp and keep things in order why didnt you fight him  i dont fight that sort of a man said martin with an air which if it were not disdainful was intended to be  matlack gazed at him a moment in silence and then went on cutting the bread i dont understand this thing he said to himself i must look into it     chapter xiii  the world goes wrong with mr raybold   the next morning mr archibald started out very early on a fishing expedition by himself he was an enthusiastic angler and had not greatly enjoyed the experience of the day before he did not object to shooting if there were any legitimate game to shoot and he liked to tramp through the mountain wilds under the guidance of such a man as matlack but to keep company all day with raybold who in the very heart of nature talked only of the gossip of the town and who punctuated his small talk by intermittent firing at everything which looked like a bird or suggested the movements of an animal was not agreeable to him clyde was a better fellow and mr archibald liked him but he was young and abstracted and the interest which clings around an abstracted person who is young is often inconsiderable so he determined for one day at least to leave sir cupid to his own devices for he could not spend all his time defending margery from amatory dawdle for this one day he would leave the task to his wife  that day mr raybold was in a moody mood early in the morning he had walked to sadlers his object being to secure from the trunk which he had left there a suit of ordinary summer clothes he had come to think that perhaps his bicycle attire although very suitable for this sort of life failed to make him as attractive in the eyes of youth and beauty as he might be if clothed in more becoming garments it was the middle of the afternoon before he returned and as he carried a large package he went directly to his own camp and in about half an hour afterwards he came over to camp rob dressed in a light suit which improved his general appearance very much  in his countenance however there was no improvement whatever for he looked more out of humor than when he had set out and when he saw that mrs archibald was sitting alone in the shade reading and that at a considerable distance harrison clyde was seated by margery giving her a lesson in drawing upon birch bark or else taking a lesson from her his illhumor increased  it is too bad said he taking a seat by mrs archibald without being asked everything seems to go wrong out here in these woods it is an unnatural way to live anyhow and i suppose it serves us right when i went to sadlers i found a letter from my sister corona who says she would like me to make arrangements for her to come here and camp with us for a time now that suits me very well indeed my sister corona is a very fine young woman and i think it would be an excellent thing to have two young ladies here instead of one  yes said mrs archibald that might be very pleasant i should be glad for margery to have a companion of her own sex  i understand precisely said raybold nodding his head sagaciously of her own sex yes i see your drift and i agree with you absolutely there is a little too much of that thing over there and i dont wonder you are annoyed  i did not say i was annoyed said mrs archibald rather surprised  no he answered you did not say so but i can read between the lines even spoken lines now when i heard that my sister wanted to come out here he continued at first i did not like it for i thought she might be some sort of a restraint upon me but when i considered the matter further i became very much in favor of it and i sent a telegram by the stage telling her to come immediately and that everything would be ready for her my sister has a sufficient income of her own and she likes to have everything suited to her needs i am different i am a man of the world and although i do not always care to conform to circumstances i can generally make circumstances conform to me as shakespeare says the world is my pottle and i stir my spoon you must excuse my quoting but i cannot help it my life work is to be upon the stage and where ones mind is there will his words be also  mr raybold was now in a much more pleasant mood than when he came to sit in the shade with mrs archibald he was talking he had found some one who listened and who had very little to say for herself  consequently he remarked i ordered from mr sadler the very best tent that he had it has two compartments in it and it is really as comfortable as a house and as my sister wrote that she wished a female attendant not caring to have her meals cooked by boysa very flippant expression bythewayi have engaged for her a sheguide  a what asked mrs archibald  a person said he who is a guide of the female gender she was the wife of a hunter who was accidentally shot sadler told me by a young man who was with him on a gunning expedition i told sadler that it was reprehensible to allow such fellows to have guns but he said that they are not as dangerous now as they used to be this is because the guides have learned to beware of them i suppose this woman has lived in the woods and knows all about camp life and sadler says there could not be a better person found to attend a young lady in camp so i engaged her and i must say she charged just as much as if she were a man  why shouldnt she said mrs archibald if she is just as good  to this remark raybold paid no attention i will tell you he said confidentially of course and i think you have as much reason to be interested in it as i have why i came to view with so much favor my sisters coming here she is a very attractive young woman and i think she cannot fail to interest clyde and that of course will be of advantage to your niece  she is not my niece you know said mrs archibald  well said he it is all the same let it be a bird wing or a flower so it pleasesa quotation which is also avonianand if clyde likes corona he will let miss dearborn alone thats the sort of man he is  and in that case said mrs archibald i suppose you would not be unwilling to provide margery with company  madam said the young man leaning forward and fixing his eyes upon the ground and then turning them upon her without moving his face towards her with me all that is a different matter i may have occasion later to speak to you and your husband upon the subject of miss dearborn  in which case said mrs archibald quickly i am sure that my husband will be very glad to speak to you but why may i ask were you so disturbed when you came here just now you said the world was going wrong  i declare said he knitting his brows and clapping one hand on his knee i actually forgot the world wrong i should say it was wrong my sister cant come and i dont know what to do about it  cant come asked mrs archibald  of course not said he all his illhumor having returned that fellow the bishop is in our camp and in clydes bed clyde foolishly gave him his bed because he said the cooktent was too cramped for a man to stay in it all day  why need he stay asked mrs archibald has he taken cold is he sick  no indeed said raybold if he were sick we might send for a cart and have him taken to sadlers but the trouble is worse than that his clothes in which he foolishly jumped into the water have shrunken so much that he cannot get them on and as he has no others he is obliged to stay in bed  but surely something can be done said mrs archibald  no he interrupted nothing can be done the clothes have dried and if you could see them as they hang up on the bushes you would understand why that man can never get into them again the material is entirely unsuitable for outdoor life clyde proposes that we shall lend him something but there are no clothes in this party into which such a sausage of a man could get himself so there he is and there i suppose he will remain indefinitely and i dont want to bring my sister to a camp with a permanently occupied hospital bed in it as soon as i agreed to coronas coming i determined to bounce that man but now so saying mr raybold rose folded his arms and knit his brows and as he did so he glanced towards the spot where margery and clyde had been sitting and perceived that the latter had departed probably to get some more birch bark and so with a nod to mrs archibald he sauntered away bending his steps as it were accidentally in the direction of the young lady left alone  when mr archibald heard that evening of the bishops plight and raybolds discomfiture he was amused but also glad to know there was an opportunity for doing something practical for the bishop he was beginning to like the man in spite of his indefiniteness so he went to see the bedridden prelate who was neither sick nor clerical and with very little trouble induced him to take a few general measurements of his figure  it is so good of you said the delighted recumbent that i shall not say a word but step aside in deference to your conscience whose encomiums will far transcend anything i can say you will pardon me i am sure if i make my measurements liberal the cost will not be increased and to live move and breathe in a suit of clothes which is large enough for me is a joy which i have not known for a long time shoes did you say sir truly this is generosity supereminent  yes said mr archibald laughing and you also shall have a new hat i will fit you out completely and if this helps you to make a new and a good start in life i shall be greatly gratified  sir said the bishop the moisture of genuine gratitude in his eyes you are doing i think far more good than you can imagine and pardon me if i suggest since you are going to get me a hat that it be not of clerical fashion if everything is to be new i should like everything different and i am certain the cost will be less  all right said mr archibald i will now make a list of what you need and i will write to one of my clerks who will procure everything  when mr archibald went back to his camp he met raybold stalking moodily having been told what had been done for the bishops relief the young man was astonished  a complete outfit and for him i would not have dreamed of it and besides it is of no use it must be days before the clothes arrive and my sister wishes to come immediately  do you suppose exclaimed mr archibald that i am doing this for the sake of your sister i am doing it for the man himself  when mr archibald told his wife of this little interview they both laughed heartily  if mr raybolds sister said she is like him i do not think we shall care to have her here but sisters are often very different from their brothers however the bishop need not prevent her coming if his clothes do not arrive before she does i am sure there could be no objection to her tent being set up for a time in some of the open space in our camp and then we shall become sooner acquainted with her if she is a suitable person i shall be very glad indeed for margery to have a companion  all right said mr archibald let her pitch her tent where she pleases i am satisfied     chapter xiv  the assertion of individuality   it was a week after her brother had sent her his telegram before miss corona raybold arrived at camp rob with her tent her outfit and her female guide mrs archibald had been surprised that she did not appear sooner for considering mr raybolds state of mind she had supposed that his sister had wished to come at the earliest possible moment  but said raybold in explaining the delay corona is very different from me in my actions the thunders roar doth crowd upon the lightnings heels as william has told us  where in shakespeare is that asked mrs archibald  mr raybold bent his brow for the nonce said he i do not recall the exact position of the lines and after that he made no more avonian quotations to mrs archibald  the arrival of the young lady was of course a very important event and even mr archibald rowed in from the lake when he saw her caravan approaching herself walking in the lead she proved to be a young person of medium height slight and dressed in a becoming suit of dark blue her hair and eyes were dark her features regular and of a classic cut and she wore eyeglasses her manner was quiet and at first she appeared reserved but she soon showed that if she wished to speak she could talk very freely she wore an air of dignified composure but was affable and very attentive to what was said to her  altogether she made in a short time an extremely favorable impression upon mr and mrs archibald and in a very much less time an extremely unfavorable impression upon margery  miss raybold greeted everybody pleasantly even informing matlack that she had heard of him as a famous guide and after thanking mr and mrs archibald for their permission to set up her tent on the outskirts of their camp she proceeded to said tent which was speedily made ready for her  mrs perkenpine her guide was an energetic woman and under her orders the men who brought the baggage bestirred themselves wonderfully  just before supper to which meal the raybolds and mr clyde had been invited the latter came to mr archibald evidently much troubled and annoyed  i am positively ashamed to mention it to you sir he said but i must tell you that raybold has ordered the men who brought his sisters tent to bring our tent over here and put it up near hers i was away when this was done and i wish to assure you most earnestly that i had nothing to do with it the men have gone and i dont suppose we can get it back tonight  mr archibald opened his eyes very wide your friend is certainly a remarkable young man said he but we must not have any bad feeling in camp so let everything remain as it is for tonight i suppose he wished to be near his sister but at least he might have asked permission  i think said clyde that he did not so much care to be near his sister as he did to be away from the bishop who is now left alone in our little sheltertent  mr archibald laughed well said he he will come to no harm and we must see that he has some supper  oh i shall attend to that said clyde and to his breakfast also and now i come to think of it i believe that one reason raybold moved our tent over here was to get the benefit of his sisters cook the bishop did our cooking you know before he took to his bed  that evening miss raybold joined the party around the campfire she declared that in the open air she did not in the least object to the use of tobacco and then she asked mr archibald if his two guides came to the campfire after their work was done  they do just as they please was the answer sometimes they come over here and smoke their pipes a little in the background and sometimes they go off by themselves we are very democratic here in camp you know  i like that said miss raybold and i will have mrs perkenpine come over when she has arranged the tent for the night arthur will you go and tell her  her brother did not immediately rise to execute this commission he hoped that mr clyde would offer to do the service but the latter did not improve the opportunity to make himself agreeable to the newcomer and raybold did the errand  harrison clyde was sitting by margery and margery was giving a little attention to what he said to her and a great deal of attention to corona raybold  more selfconceit and a betterfitting dress i never saw thought margery its loose and easy and yet it seems to fit perfectly and i do believe she thinks she is some sort of an upper angel who has condescended to come down here just to see what common people are like  corona talked to mr archibald it was her custom always to talk to the principal personage of a party  it gives me pleasure sir said she to meet with you and your wife it is so seldom that we find any one she was interrupted by mrs perkenpine who stood behind her  the sheguide was a large woman apparently taller than matlack her sunburnt face was partly shaded by a mans straw hat secured on her head by strings tied under her chin she wore a very plain gown coarse in texture and of a lightblue color which showed that it had been washed very often her voice and her shoes the latter well displayed by her short skirt creaked but her gray eyes were bright and moved about after the manner of searchlights  well said she to miss raybold what do you want  corona turned her head and placidly gazed up at her i simply wished to let you know that you might join this company here if you liked the two men guides are coming you see  mrs perkenpine glanced around the group is there any hunting stories to be told she asked  mr archibald laughed i dont know he said but perhaps we may have some i am sure that matlack here has hunting stories to tell  mrs perkenpine shook her head no sir said she i dont want none of his stories ive heard them all mostly two or three times over  i dare say you have said phil seating himself on a fallen trunk a little back from the fire but you see mrs perkenpine you are so obstinate about keepin on livin if youd died when you was younger you wouldnt have heard so many of those stories  theres been times said she when you was tellin the story of the bear cubs and the condensed milk when i wished i had died when i was younger or else you had  perhaps said miss raybold in a clear decisive voice mr matlack may know hunting stories that will be new to all of us but before he begins them i have something which i would like to say  all right said mrs perkenpine seating herself promptly upon the ground if youre goin to talk ill stay id like to know what kind of things you do talk about when you talk  i was just now remarking said miss corona that i am very glad indeed to meet with those who like mr and mrs archibald are willing to set their feet upon the modern usages of society which would crowd us together in a common herd and assert their individuality  mr archibald looked at the speaker inquiringly  of course said she i refer to the fact that you and mrs archibald are on a weddingjourney  at this remark phil matlack rose suddenly from the treetrunk and martin dropped his pipe mr clyde turned his gaze upon margery who thereupon burst out laughing and then he looked in amazement from mr archibald to mrs archibald and back again mrs perkenpine sat up very straight and leaned forward her hands upon her knees  is it them two sittin over there she said pointing to margery and clyde are they on a honeymoon  no exclaimed arthur raybold in a loud sharp voice what an absurdity corona what are you talking about  to this his sister paid no attention whatever i think she said it was a noble thing to do an assertion of ones inner self is always noble and when i heard of this assertion i wished very much to know the man and the woman who had so asserted themselves and this was my principal reason for determining to come to this camp  but where on earth asked mr archibald did you hear that we were on a weddingjourney  i read it in a newspaper said corona  i do declare exclaimed mrs archibald everything is in the newspapers i did think that we might settle down here and enjoy ourselves without people talking about our reason for coming  you dont mean to say cried mrs perkenpine now on her feet that you two elderly ones is the honeymooners  yes said mr archibald looking with amusement on the astonished faces about him we truly are  well said the sheguide seating herself if id stayed an old maid as long as that i think id stuck it out but perhaps you was a widow mum  no indeed cried mr archibald she was a charming girl when i married her but just let me tell you how the matter stands and he proceeded to relate the facts of the case i thought he said in conclusion turning to matlack that perhaps you knew about it for i told mr sadler and i supposed he might have mentioned it to you  no sir said matlack relighting his pipe he knows me better than that if hed called me and said phil i want you to take charge of a couple thats goin honeymoonin about twentyfive years after they married and adoin it for somebody else and not for themselves id said to him theyre lunatics and i wont take charge of them and peter he knows i would have thought that and would have said it and so he did not mention the particulars to me he knows that the only things that im afraid of in this world is lunatics tisnt only what they might do to me but what they might do to themselves and i wont touch em  i hope said mrs archibald that you dont consider us lunatics now that you have heard why we are here  oh no said the guide ive found that youre regular commonsense people and i dont change my opinions even when ive heard particulars but if id heard particulars first it would have been all up with my takin charge of you  and you knew it all the time said clyde to margery speaking so that she only could hear  i knew it she said but i didnt think it worth talking about do you know mr raybolds sister do you like her  i have met her said clyde but she is too lofty for me  what is there lofty about her said margery  well said he she is lofty because she has elevated ideas she goes in for reform and for pretty much all kinds from what i have heard  i think she is lofty remarked margery because she is stuckup i dont like her  it is so seldom corona now continued that we find people who are willing to assert their individuality and when they are found i always want to talk to them i suppose mr matlack that your life is one long assertion of individuality  what maam asked the guide  i mean said she that when you are out alone in the wild forest holding in your hand the weapon which decides the question of life or death for any living creature over whom you may choose to exercise your jurisdiction absolutely independent of every social trammel every bond of conventionalism you must feel that you are a predominant whole and not a mere integral part  well said matlack speaking slowly i may have had them feelins but if i did they must have struck in and not come out on the skin like measles where i could see em  corona said her brother in a peevish undertone what is the good of all that youre wasting your words on such a man  his sister turned a mild steady gaze upon him i dont know any man but you she said on whom i waste my words  is assertin like persistin inquired mrs perkenpine at this point  the two actions are somewhat alike said corona  well then said the sheguide im in for assertin when my husband was alive there was a good many things i wanted to do and when i wanted to do a thing or get a thing i kept on sayin so and one day after id been keepin on sayin so a good while he says to me jane says he it seems to me that youre persistin yes says i i am and i intend to be then you are goin to keep on insistin on persistin says he yes says i and then says he if you keep on insistin on persistin ill be thinkin of listin by which he meant goin into the army as a regular and gettin rid of me and as i didnt want to be rid of him i stopped persistin but now i wish i had persisted for then hed listed and most likely would be alive now through not bein shot in the back by a city fool with a gun  i do not believe said mrs archibald to her husband when they had retired to their cabin that that young woman is going to be much of a companion for margery i think she will prefer your society to that of any of the rest of us it is very plain that she thinks it is your individuality which has been asserted  well said he rubbing his spectacles with his handkerchief before putting them away for the night dont let her project her individuality into my sport thats all i have to say     chapter xv  a net of cobwebs to cage a lion   i think theres something besides a lunatic that you are afraid of said martin to matlack the next morning as they were preparing breakfast  whats that inquired the guide sharply  its that fellow they call the bishop said martin he put a pretty heavy slur on you you drove down a stake and you locked your boat to it and you walked away as big as if you were the sheriff of the county and here he comes along and snaps his fingers at you and your locks and as cool as a cucumber he pulls up the stake and shoves out on the lake all alone by herself a young lady that you are paid to take care of and protect from danger  i want you to know martin sanders said matlack that i dont pitch into a man when hes in his bed no matter what it is that made him take to his bed or stay there but ill just say to you now that when he gets up and shows himself therell be the biggest case of bounce in these parts that you ever saw  bounce said martin to himself as he turned away i have heard so much of it lately that id like to see a little  matlack also communed with himself hes awful anxious to get up a quarrel between me and the parson he thought i wonder if he was too free with his tongue and did get thrashed he dont show no signs of it except hes so concerned in his mind to see somebody do for the parson what he aint able to do himself but ill find out about it ill thrash that fellow in black and before i let him up ill make him tell me what he did to martin id do a good deal to get hold of something that would take the conceit out of that fellow  mr arthur raybold was a deepminded person and sometimes it was difficult for him with the fathoming apparatus he had on hand to discover the very bottom of his mind now far below the surface his thoughts revolved he had come to the conclusion that he would marry margery in the first place he was greatly attracted by her and again he considered it would be a most advantageous union she was charming to look upon and her mind was so uncramped by conventionalities that it could adapt itself to almost any sphere to which she might direct it he expected his lifework to be upon the stage and what an actress miss dearborn would make if properly educatedas he could educate her with this most important purpose in view why should he waste his time the archibalds could not much longer remain in camp they had limited their holiday to a month and that was more than half gone he must strike now  the first thing to do was to get clyde out of the way then he would speak to mr archibald and ask for authority to press his suit and he would press that suit as few men on earth he said to himself would be able to press it what girl could deny herself to him when he came to her clad not only with his own personal attributes but with the fervor of a romeo the intellectuality of a hamlet and the force of an othello  the clyde part of the affair seemed very simple as his party would of course have their own table clyde would see his sister at every meal and as corona did not care to talk to him and must talk to somebody she would be compelled to talk to clyde and if she talked to clyde and looked at him as she always did when she talked to people he did not see how he could help being attracted by her and when once that sort of thing began the margeryfield would be open to him  he excused himself that morning for hurriedly leaving the breakfasttable by saying that he wished to see mr archibald before he started out fishing  he found that gentleman talking to matlack can i see you alone sir said raybold i have something of importance i wish to say to you  very good said the other for i have something i wish to say to you and they retired towards the lake  what is it inquired mr archibald  it is this said raybold folding his arms as he spoke i am a man of but few words when i have formed a purpose i call upon my actions to express it rather than my speech i will not delay therefore to say to you that i love your ward and my sole object in seeking this interview is to ask your permission to pay my addresses to her that permission given i will attend to the rest  after you have dropped your penny in the slot remarked mr archibald i must say he continued that i am rather surprised at the nature of your communication i supposed you were going to explain your somewhat remarkable conduct in bringing your tent into my camp without asking my permission or even speaking to me about it but as what you have said is of so much more importance than that breach of good manners i will let the latter drop but why did you ask my permission to address miss dearborn why didnt you go and do it just as you brought your tent here did you think that if you had a permit from me for that sort of sport you could warn off trespassers  it was something of that kind said raybold although i should not have put it in that trifling way  then i will remark said mr archibald that i know nothing of your matrimonial availability and i do not want to know anything about it my wife and i brought miss dearborn here to enjoy herself in the woods not to be sought in marriage by strangers for the present i am her guardian and as such i say to you that i forbid you to make her a proposal of marriage or indeed to pay her any attentions which she may consider serious if i see that you do not respect my wishes in this regard i shall ask you to consider our acquaintance at an end and shall dispense with your visits to this camp have i spoken plainly  the knitted brows of raybold were directed towards the ground you have spoken plainly he said and i have heard and with a bow he walked away  as he approached his tent a smile intended to be bitter played about his features  a net of cobwebs he muttered to cage a lion  the weather had now grown sultry the afternoon was very hot and there was a general desire to lie in the shade and doze margerys plans for a siesta were a little more complicated than those of the others she longed to lie in a hammock under great trees surrounded by the leafy screens of the woodlands to gaze at the blue sky through the loopholes in the towering branches above her and to dream of the mysteries of the forest  martin said she to the young guide is there a hammock among the things we brought with us  his face brightened of course there are hammocks he said i wonder none of you asked about them before  i never thought of it said margery i havent had time for lounging and as for aunt harriet she would not get into one for five dollars  where shall i hang it he asked  not anywhere about here couldnt you find some nice place in the woods not far away but where i would not be seen and might have a little time to myself if you can come and tell me quietly where it is  i know what she means said martin to himself its a shame that she should be annoyed i can find you just such a place he said to margery i will hang the hammock there and i will take care that nobody else shall know where it is and away he went bounding heart and foot  in less than a quarter of an hour he returned its all ready miss dearborn he said i think i have found a place you will like its generally very close in the woods on a day like this but there is a little bluff back of us and at the end of it the woods are open so that there is a good deal of air there  that is charming said margery and with a book in her hand she accompanied martin  they were each so interested in the hammock business that they walked side by side instead of one following the other as had been their custom heretofore  oh this is a delightful place cried margery i can lie here and look down into the very heart of the woods it is a solitude like robinson crusoes island  i am glad you like it said martin i thought you would i have put up the hammock strongly so that you need not be afraid of it but if there is any other way you want it i can change it there is not a thing here that can hurt you and if a little snake should happen along it would be glad to get away from you if you give it a chance but if you should be frightened or should want anything you have only to call for me i shall hear you for i shall be out in the open just at the edge of the woods  thank you very much said margery nothing could be nicer than this and you did it so quickly  he smiled with pleasure as he answered that he could have done it more quickly if it had been necessary and then he retired slowly that she might call him back if she thought of anything she wanted  margery lay in the hammock gazing out over the edge of the bluff into the heart of the woods her closed book was in her hand and the gentle breeze that shook the leaves around her and disturbed the loose curls about her face was laden with a moist spiciness which made her believe it had been wandering through some fragrant foliage of a kind unknown to her far away in the depths of the forest where she could not walk on account of the rocks the great bushes and the tall ferns it was lovely to lie and watch the leafy boughs which seemed as if they were waving their handkerchiefs to the breeze as it passed  i dont believe she said to herself as she cast her eyes upward towards an open space above her that if i were that little white cloud and could float over the whole world and drop down on any spot i chose that i could drop into a lovelier place than this then she brought her gaze again to earth and her mind went out between the shadowy trunks which stretched away and away and away towards the mysteries of the forest which must always be mysteries to her because it was impossible for her to get to them and solve themthat is if she remained awake but if master morpheus should happen by she might yet know everythingfor there are no mysteries which cannot be solved in dreams  master morpheus came but with him came also arthur raybold not by the little pathway that approached from the direction of the lake but parting the bushes as if he had been exploring when she heard footsteps behind her margery looked up quickly  mr raybold she exclaimed how on earth did you happen here  i did not happen said he wiping his brow with his handkerchief i have been looking for you and i have had tough work of it i saw you go into the woods and i went in also although some distance below here and i have had a hard and tiresome job working my way up to you but i have found you i knew i should for i had bent my mind to the undertaking  well i wish you hadnt said margery in a vexed tone i came here to be alone and take a nap and i wish you would find some other nice place and go and take a nap yourself  he smiled deeply that would not answer my purpose at all said he napping is far from my desires  but i dont care anything about your desires said margery in a tone which showed she was truly vexed i have preempted this place and i want it to myself i was just falling into a most delightful doze when you came and i dont think you have any right to come here and disturb me  the sense of right miss dearborn said he comes from the heart and we do not have to ask other people what it is my heart has given me the right to come here and here i am  and what in the name of commonsense are you here for said margery speaking about your heart makes me think you came here to make love to me is that it  it is said he and i wish you to hear me  mr raybold said she her eyes as bright he thought as if they had belonged to his sister when she was urging some of her favorite views upon a company i wont listen to one word of such stuff this is no place for lovemaking and i wont have it if you want to make love to me you can wait until i go home and then you can come and speak to my mother about it and when you have spoken to her you can speak to me but i wont listen to it here not one word  thus did the indignant craftiness of margery express itself its a good deal better she thought than telling him no and having him keep on begging and begging  miss dearborn said raybold what i have to say cannot be postponed the words within me must be spoken and i came here to speak them  with a sudden supple twist margery turned herself hammock and all and stood on her feet on the ground martin she cried at the top of her voice  raybold stepped back astonished what is this he exclaimed am i to understand  before he had time to complete his sentence martin sanders sprang into the scene  what is it he exclaimed with a glare at raybold as if he suspected why he had been called  martin said margery with a good deal of sharpness in her voice i want you to take down this hammock and carry it away i cant stay here any longer i thought that at least one quiet place outofdoors could be found where i would not be disturbed but it seems there is no such place perhaps you can hang the hammock somewhere near our cabin  martins face grew very red i think said he that you ought not to be obliged to go away because you have been disturbed whoever disturbed you should go away and not you  now mr raybolds face also grew red there has been enough of this he exclaimed guide you can go where you came from you are not wanted here if miss dearborn wishes her hammock taken down i will do it then turning to margery he continued you do not know what it is i have to say to you if you do not hear me now you will regret it all your life send this man away  i would very much like to send a man away if i knew how to do it said margery  do it cried martin oh miss dearborn if you want it done ask me to do it for you  you shouted raybold making two steps towards the young guide then he stopped for margery stood in front of him  i have never seen two men fight said she and i dont say i wouldnt like it just once but you would have to have on boxinggloves i couldnt stand a fight with plain hands so you neednt think of it martin take down the hammock just as quickly as you can and if you want to stay here mr raybold you can stay but if you want to talk you can talk to the trees  martin heaved a sigh of disappointment and proceeded to unfasten the hammock from the trees to which it had been tied for a moment raybold looked as if he were about to interfere but there was something in the feverish agility of the young guide which made his close proximity as undesirable as that of a package of dynamite  margery turned to leave the place but suddenly stopped she would wait until martin was ready to go with her she would not leave those two young men alone  raybold was very angry he knew well that such a chance for a private interview was not likely to occur again and he would not give up he approached the young girl  margery he said if you  martin she cried to the guide who was now ready to go put down that hammock and come here now sir she said turning to raybold let me hear you call me margery again  she waited for about a half a minute but she was not called by name then she and martin went away she had nearly reached the cabin before she spoke and then she turned to the young man and said martin you neednt trouble yourself about putting up that hammock now i dont want to lie in it im going into the house i am very much obliged to you for the way you stood by me  stood by you he exclaimed in a low voice which seemed struggling in the grasp of something which might or might not be stronger than itself you dont know how glad i am to stand by you and how i would always  thank you said margery thank you very much and she walked away towards the cabin  oh dear she sighed as she opened the door and went in     chapter xvi  a man who feels himself a man   towards the end of the afternoon when the air had grown cooler mr archibald proposed a boating expedition to the lower end of the lake his boat was large enough for matlack the three ladies and himself and if the two young men wished to follow they had a boat of their own  when first asked to join the boating party miss corona raybold hesitated she did not care very much about boating but when she found that if she stayed in camp she would have no one to talk to she accepted the invitation  mr archibald took the oars nearest the stern while matlack seated himself forward and this arrangement suited miss corona exactly  the boat kept down the middle of the lake greatly aided by the current and corona talked steadily to mr archibald mrs archibald who always wanted to do what was right and who did not like to be left out of any conversation on important subjects made now and then a remark and whenever she spoke corona turned to her and listened with the kindest attention but the moment the elder lady had finished the other resumed her own thread of observation without the slightest allusion to what she had just heard  as for mr archibald he seldom said a word he listened sometimes his eyes twinkled and he pulled easily and steadily doubtless he had a good many ideas but none of them was expressed as for margery she leaned back in the stern and thought that after all she liked miss raybold better than she did her brother for the young lady did not speak one word to her nor did she appear to regard her in any way  but how on earth thought margery she can float over this beautiful water and under this lovely sky with the grandeur of the forest all about her and yet pay not the slightest attention to anything she sees but keep steadily talking about her own affairs and the society she belongs to i cannot imagine she might as well live in a cellar and have pamphlets and reformers shoved down to her through the coalhole  messrs clyde and raybold accompanied the larger boat in their own skiff it was an unwieldy craft with but one pair of oars and as the two young men were not accustomed to rowing together and as mr raybold was not accustomed to rowing at all and did not like it mr clyde pulled the boat but do what he could it was impossible for him to get near the other boat matlack who was not obliged to listen to miss corona kept his eye upon the following skiff and seemed to fear a collision if the two boats came close together for if clyde pulled hard he pulled harder arthur raybold was not satisfied  i thought you were a better oarsman he said to the other but now i suppose we shall not come near them until we land  but the archibald party did not land under the guidance of matlack they swept slowly around the lower end of the lake they looked over the big untenanted campground there they stopped for a moment to gaze into the rift in the forest through which ran the stream which connected this lake with another beyond it and then they rowed homeward keeping close to the farther shore so as to avoid the strength of the current  clyde who had not reached the end of the lake now turned and determined to follow the tactics of the other boat and keep close to the shore but on the side nearest to the camp this exasperated raybold  what are you trying to do he said if you keep in the middle we may get near them and why should we be on one side of the lake and they on the other  i want to get back as soon as they do said clyde and i dont want to pull against the current  stop said raybold if you are tired let me have the oars  harrison clyde looked for a minute at his companion and then deliberately changed the course of the boat and rowed straight towards the shore paying no attention whatever to the excited remonstrances of raybold he beached the boat at a rather poor landingplace among some bushes and then jumping out he made her fast  what do you mean cried raybold as he scrambled on shore is she leaking more than she did what is the matter  she is not leaking more than usual said the other but i am not going to pull against that current with you growling in the stern i am going to walk back to camp  in consequence of this resolution the two young men reached camp rob about the same time that the archibald boat touched shore and at least an hour before they would have arrived had they remained in their boat  the party was met by mrs perkenpine bearing letters and newspapers a man had arrived from sadlers in their absence and he had brought the mail nearly every one had letters there was even something for martin standing where they had landed seated on bits of rock on the grass or on campchairs all read their letters  while thus engaged a gentleman approached the party from the direction of camp roy he was tall well built handsomely dressed in a suit of lightbrown tweed and carried himself with a buoyant uprightness a neat straw hat with a broad ribbon shaded his smoothshaven face which sparkled with cordial goodhumor a blue cravat was tied tastefully under a broad white collar and in his hand he carried a hickory walkingstick cut in the woods but good enough for a city sidewalk margery was the first to raise her eyes at the sound of the quickly approaching footsteps  goodness gracious she exclaimed and then everybody looked up  for a moment the newcomer was gazed upon in silence from what gigantic bandbox could this welldressed stranger have dropped then with a loud laugh mr archibald cried the bishop  no wonder there had not been instant recognition the loose easyfitting clothes gave no hint of redundant plumpness no soiled shovelhat cast a shadow over the smiling face and a glittering shirt front banished all thought of guttapercha  madam exclaimed the bishop raising his hat and stepping quickly towards mrs archibald i cannot express the pleasure i feel in meeting you again and as for you sir holding out his hand to mr archibald i have no words in which to convey my feelings look upon a man sir who feels himself a man and then remember from what you raised him i can say no more now but i can never forget what you have done and as he spoke he pressed mr archibalds hand with an honest fervor which distorted for a moment the features of that gentleman  from one to the other of the party the bishop glanced as he said how glad how unutterably glad i am to be again among you turning his eyes towards miss raybold he stopped that young lady had put down the letter she was reading and was gazing at him through her spectacles with calm intensity this lady said the bishop turning towards raybold is your sister i presume may i have the honor  raybold looked at him without speaking here was an example of the silly absurdity of throwing pearls before swine he had never wanted to have anything to do with the fellow when he was in the gutter and he wanted nothing to do with him now  with a little flush on her face mrs archibald rose  miss raybold she said let me present to youand she hesitated for a momentthe gentleman we call the bishop i think you have heard us speak of him  yes said miss raybold rising with a charming smile on her handsome face and extending her hand i have heard of him and i am very glad to meet him  i have also heard of you said the bishop as he stood smiling beside coronas campchair and i have regretted that i have been the innocent means of preventing you for a time from occupying your brothers camp  oh do not mention that said corona sweetly i walked over there yesterday and i think it is a great deal pleasanter here so you have really done me a favor i am particularly glad to see you because from the little i have heard said about you i think you must agree with some of my cherished opinions for one thing i am quite certain you favor the assertion of individuality your actions prove that  really said the bishop seating himself near her i have not given much thought to the subject but i suppose i have asserted my individuality if i have however i have done it indefinitely everybody about me having some definite purpose in life and i having none i am in a negative way a distinctive individual it is a pity i am so different from other people but  no it is not a pity interrupted corona the color coming into her cheeks and a brighter light into her eyes our individuality is a sacred responsibility it is given to us for us to protect and encouragei may say to revere it is a trust for which we should be called to account by ourselves and we shall be false and disloyal to ourselves if we cannot show that we have done everything in our power for the establishment and recognition of our individuality  it delights me to hear you speak in that way exclaimed the bishop it encourages and cheers me we are what we are and if we can be more fully what we are than we have been then we are more truly ourselves than before  and what can be nobler cried corona than to be in the most distinctive sense of the term ourselves  mr and mrs archibald walked together towards their cabin  i want to be neighborly and hospitable said he but it seems to me that now that the way is clear for miss raybold to move her tent to her own camp and set up housekeeping there we should not be called upon to entertain her and if we want to enjoy ourselves in our own way we can do it without thinking of her  we shall certainly not do it said his wife if we do think of her i am very much disappointed in her she is not a companion at all for margery she never speaks to her and on the other hand i should think you would wish she would never speak to you  well said her husband that feeling did grow upon me somewhat this afternoon up to a certain point she is amusing  here he was interrupted by mrs perkenpine who planted herself before him  i spose you think i didnt do right she said cause when that big bundle came it had your name on it but i knew it was clothes and that they was for that man in our camp and so i took them to him myself i heard phil say that the sooner that man was up and dressed the better it would be for all parties and as martin had gone off and there wasnt nobody to take his clothes to him i took them to him and thats the long and short of it  i wondered how he got them said mr archibald but i am glad you carried them to him then speaking to his wife he added it may be a good thing that i gave him a chance to assert his individuality     chapter xvii  mrs perkenpine asserts her individuality   about half an hour after the beginning of the conversation between the bishop and miss corona mrs perkenpine came to the latter and informed her that supper was ready and three times after that first announcement did she repeat the information at last the bishop rose and said he would not keep miss raybold from her meal  will you not join us she asked i shall be glad to have you do so  the bishop hesitated for a moment and then he accompanied corona  as mrs perkenpine turned from the camp cookingstove a longhandled pan well filled with slices of hot meat in her hand she stood for a moment amazed slowly approaching the little table outside of the tent were the bishop and miss raybold and glancing beyond them towards the lake she saw clyde and raybold to whom she had yelled that supper was ready the one with his arms folded gazing out over the water and the other strolling backward and forward as if he had thought of going to his supper but had not quite made up his mind to it  mrs perkenpines face grew red they are waitin for a chance to speak to that archibald gal she thought well let them wait and shes bringing him she neednt spose i dont know him ive seen him splittin wood at sadlers and i dont cook for sech so saying she strode to some bushes a little back of the stove and dashed the panful of meat behind them then she returned and seizing the steaming coffeepot she poured its contents on the ground then she took up a smaller pan containing some fried potatoes hot and savory and these she threw after the meat  the bishop and corona now reached the table and seated themselves mrs perkenpine her face as hard and immovable as the trunk of an oak approached and placed before them some slices of cold bread some butter and two glasses of water  still earnestly talking her eyes sometimes dimmed with tears of excitement as she descanted upon her favorite theories corona began to eat what was before her she buttered a slice of bread and if the bishop chanced to say anything she ate some of it she drank some water and she talked and talked and talked she did not know what she was eating it might have been a lord mayors dinner or a beggars crust her mind took no cognizance of such an unimportant matter as for her companion he knew very well what he was eating and as he gazed about him and saw that there were no signs of anything more his heart sank lower and lower but he ate slice after slice of bread for he was hungry and he hoped that when the two young men came to the table they would call for more substantial food  but long before they arrived corona finished her meal and rose  now that we have had our supper she said let us go where we shall not be annoyed by the smell of food and continue our conversation  is it possible thought the bishop that she can be annoyed by the smell of hot meat potatoes and coffee i suppose the delicious odor comes from the other suppertable heavens why wasnt i asked there  there was a dreadful storm when raybold and clyde came to the table but mrs perkenpine remained hard and immovable through it all  your sister and that tramp has been here said she and this is all there is left if you keep your hogs in your house you cant expect to count on your victuals  some more coffee was made and that with bread composed the young mens supper  when arthur raybold had finished his meal he walked to the spot where corona and the bishop were conversing and stood there silently he was afraid to interrupt his sister by speaking to her but he thought that his presence might have an effect upon her companion it did have an effect for the bishop seized the opportunity created by the arrival of a third party excused himself and departed at the first break in coronas flow of words  i wish arthur she said that when you see i am engaged in a conversation you would wait at least a reasonable time before interrupting it  a reasonable time said raybold with a laugh i like that but i came here to interrupt your conversation do you know who that fellow is you were talking to hes a common goodfornothing tramp he goes round splitting wood for his meals clyde and i kept him here to cook our meals because we had no servant and hes been in bed for days because he had no clothes to wear now you are treating him as if he were a gentleman and you actually brought him to our table where like the halfstarved cur that he is he has eaten up everything fit to eat that we were to have for our supper  he did not eat all of it said corona for i ate some myself and if he is the goodfornothing tramp and the other things you call him i wish i could meet with more such tramps i tell you arthur that if you were to spend the next five years in reading and studying you could not get into your mind onetenth of the serious information the power to reason intelligently upon your perceptions the ability to collate compare and refer to their individual causes the impressions  oh bosh said her brother what i want to know is are you going to make friends with that man and invite him to our table  i shall invite him if i see fit said she he is an extremely intelligent person  well answered he if you do i shall have a separate table and he walked away  as soon as he had left corona the bishop repaired to the archibalds cookingtent where he saw matlack at work  i have come he said with a pleasant smile to ask a very great favor would it be convenient for you to give me something to eat anything in the way of meat hot or cold and some tea or coffee as i see there is a pot still steaming on your stove i have had an unlucky experience you know i have been preparing my own meals at the other camp but today when mrs perkenpine brought me my clothes she carried away with her all the provisions that had been left there i supped it is true with miss raybold but her appetite is so delicate and her fare so extremely simple that i confidentially acknowledge that i am half starved  during these remarks matlack had stood quietly gazing at the bishop do you see that pile of logs and branches there said he thats the firewood thats got to be cut for tomorrow which is sunday when we dont want to be cuttin wood and if youll go to work and cut it into pieces to fit this stove ill give you your supper you can go to the other camp and sleep where you have been sleepin if you want to and in the mornin ill give you your breakfast i aint got no right to give you mr archibalds victuals but what you eat ill pay for out of my own pocket considerin that youll do my work then tomorrow ill give you just one hour after youve finished your breakfast to get out of this camp altogether entirely out of my sight i tried to have you sent away before but other people took you up and so i said no more but now things are different when a man pulls up what ive drove down and sets loose what ive locked up and the same as snaps his fingers in my face when im attendin to my business then i dont let that man stay in my camp  excuse me said the bishop but in case i should not go away within the time specified what would be your course  in a few brief remarks inelegant but expressive the guide outlined his intentions of taking measures which would utterly eliminate the physical energy of the other  i havent taken no advantage of you he said i havent come down on you when you hadnt no clothes to go away in and now that youve got good clothes i dont want to spile them if i can help it but theyre not goin to save youmind my words what ive said ill stick to  mr matlack said the bishop i consider that you are entirely correct in all your positions as to that unfortunate affair of the boat i had intended coming to you and apologizing most sincerely for my share in it it was an act of great foolishness but that does not in the least excuse me i apologize now and beg that you will believe that i truly regret having interfered with your arrangements  that wont do exclaimed the guide when a man as much as snaps his fingers in my face its no use for him to come and apologize thats not what i want  nevertheless said the bishop you will pardon me if i insist upon expressing my regrets i do that for my own sake as well as yours but we will drop that subject when you ask me to cut wood to pay for my meals you are entirely right and i honor your sound opinion upon this subject i will cut the wood and earn my meals but there is one amendment to your plan which i would like to propose tomorrow is sunday for that reason we should endeavor to make the day as quiet and peaceable as possible and we should avoid everything which may be difficult of explanation or calculated to bring about an unpleasant difference of opinion among other members of the party therefore will you postpone the time at which you will definitely urge my departure until monday morning  well said matlack now i come to think of it it might be well not to kick up a row on sunday and i will put it off until monday morning but mind theres no nonsense about me what i say i mean and on monday morning you march of your own accord or ill attend to the matter myself  very good said the bishop thank you very much tomorrow i will consider your invitation to leave this place and if you will come to camp roy about halfpast six on monday morning i will then give you my decision will that hour suit you  all right said matlack you might as well make it a business matter its going to be business on my side id have you know  goodvery good said the bishop and now let me get at that wood  so saying he put down his cane took off his hat his coat his waistcoat his collar and his cravat and his cuffs he rolled up his sleeves he turned up the bottoms of his trousers and then taking an axe he set to work  in a few minutes martin arrived on the scene whats up now said he  hes cuttin wood for his meals replied matlack  i thought you were going to bounce him as soon as he got up  thats put off until monday morning said matlack then he marches ive settled that  did he agree asked martin  taint necessary for him to agree hell find that out monday morning  martin stood and looked at the bishop as he worked  i wish you would get him to cut wood every day said he by george how he makes that axe fly  when the bishop finished his work he drove his axehead deep into a stump washed his hands and his face resumed the clothing he had laid aside and then sat down to supper there was nothing stingy about matlack and the woodchopper made a meal which amply compensated him for the deficiencies of the perkenpine repast  when he had finished he hurried to the spot where the party was in the habit of assembling around the campfire he found there some feebly burning logs and mr clyde who sat alone smoking his pipe  what is the matter asked the bishop where are all our friends  illustration where are all our friends  i suppose they are all in bed said clyde with the bedclothes pulled over their headsthat is except one and i suspect she is talking in her sleep they were all here as usual and mr archibald thought he would break the spell by telling a fishing story he told me he was going to try to speak against time but it wasnt of any use she just slid into the middle of his remarks as a duck slides into the water and then she began an oration i really believe she did not know that any one else was talking  that may have been the case said the bishop she has a wonderful power of selfconcentration  very true said clyde and this time she concentrated herself so much upon herself that the rest of us got away one by one and when all the others had gone she went then when i found she really had gone i came back bytheway bishop he continued there is something i would like to do and i want you to help me  name it said the other  i am getting tired of the way the raybolds are trespassing on the goodnature of the archibalds and whatever they do i dont intend to let them make me trespass any longer i havent anything to do with miss raybold but the other tent belongs as much to me as it does to her brother and i am going to take it back to our own camp and what is more i am going to have my meals there i dont want that woodenheaded mrs perkenpine to cook for me  how would you like me to do it asked the bishop quickly  that would be fine said clyde i will help and we will set up housekeeping there again and if raybold doesnt choose to come and live in his own camp he can go wherever he pleases i am not going to have him manage things for me dont you think that you and i can carry that tent over  with ease exclaimed the bishop when do you want to movemonday morning  yes said clyde after breakfast     chapter xviii  the hermits associate   during the next day no one in camp had reason to complain of corona raybold she did not seem inclined to talk to anybody but spent the most of her time alone she wrote a little and reflected a great deal sometimes walking sometimes seated in the shade gazing far beyond the sky  when the evening fire was lighted her mood changed so that one might have supposed that another fire had been lighted somewhere in the interior of her mental organism her fine eyes glistened her cheeks gently reddened and her whole body became animated with an energy created by warm emotions  i have something i wish to say to you all she exclaimed as she reached the fire where is arthur will somebody please call him and i would like to see both the guides it is something very important that i have to say mrs perkenpine will be here in a moment i asked her to come if mr matlack is not quite ready can he not postpone what he is doing i am sure you will all be interested in what i have to say and i do not want to begin until every one is here  mr archibald saw that she was very much in earnest and so he sent for the guides and clyde went to call raybold  in a few minutes clyde returned and told corona that her brother had said he did not care to attend services that evening  where is he asked miss raybold  he is sitting over there looking out upon the lake replied clyde  i will be back almost immediately said she to mr archibald and in the mean time please let everybody assemble  arthur raybold was in no mood to attend services of any sort he had spent nearly the whole day trying to get a chance to speak to margery but never could he find her alone  if i can once put the matter plainly to her he said to himself she will quickly perceive what it is that i offer her and when she clearly sees that i will undertake to make her accept it she is only a woman and can no more withstand me than a mound of sand built by a babys hand could withstand the rolling wave  at this moment corona arrived and told him that she wanted him at the campfire he was only a man and could no more withstand her than a mound of sand built by a babys hand could withstand the rolling wave  when everybody in the camp had gathered around the fire corona her eyeglasses illumined by the light of her soul gazed around the circle and began to speak  my dear friends she said i have been thinking a great deal today upon a very important subject and i have come to the conclusion that we who form this little company have before us one of the grandest opportunities ever afforded a group of human beings we are here apart from our ordinary circumstances and avocations free from all the trammels and demands of society alone with nature and ourselves in our ordinary lives surrounded by our ordinary circumstances we cannot be truly ourselves each of us is but part of a whole and very often an entirely unharmonious part it is very seldom that we are able to do the things we wish to do in the manner and at times and places when it would best suit our natures try as we may to be true to ourselves it is seldom possible we are swept away in a current of conventionality it may be one kind of conventionality for some of us and another kind for others but we are borne on by it all the same sometimes a person like myself or mr archibald clings to some rock or point upon the bank and for a little while is free from the coercion of circumstances but this cannot be for long and we are soon swept with the rest into the ocean of conglomerate commonplace  thats when we die remarked mrs perkenpine who sat reverently listening  no said the speaker it happens while we are alive but now she continued we have a chance as i said before to shake ourselves free from our enthralment for a little while each one of us may assert his or her individuality we are a varied and representative party we come from different walks of life we are men women and looking at margery she was about to say children but she changed her expression to young people i think you will all understand what i mean when we are at our homes we do things because other people want us to do them and not because we want to do them a family sits down to a meal and some of them like what is on the table some do not some of them would have preferred to eat an hour before some of them would prefer to eat an hour later but they all take their meals at the same time and eat the same things because it is the custom to do so  i mention a meal simply as an instance but the slavery of custom extends into every branch of our lives we get up we go to bed we read we work we play just as other people do these things and not as we ourselves would do them if we planned our own lives now we have a chance all of us to be ourselves each of us may say i am myself one think of that my friends each one each of us a unit responsible only to his or her unity if i may so express it  do you mean that i am that inquired mrs perkenpine  oh yes replied corona  is phil matlack one  yes  all right said the female guide if he is one i dont mind  now what i propose is this said corona i understand that the stay in this camp will continue for about a week longer and i earnestly urge upon you that for this time we shall each one of us assert our individuality let us be what we are show ourselves what we are and let each other see what we are  it would not be safe nor pleasant to allow everybody to do that said mr archibald he was more interested in miss raybolds present discourse than he had been in any other he had heard her deliver  of course said she it would not do to propose such a thing to the criminal classes or to people of evil inclinations but i have carefully considered the whole subject as it relates to us and i think we are a party singularly well calculated to become the exponent of the distinctiveness of our several existences  that gits me said matlack  i am afraid said the speaker gazing kindly at him that i do not always express myself plainly to the general comprehension but what i mean is this that during the time we stay here let each one of us do exactly what he or she wants to do without considering other people at all except of course that we must not do anything which would interfere with any of the others doing what they please for instanceand i assure you i have thought over this matter in all its detailsif any of us were inclined to swear or behave disorderly which i am sure could not be the case he or she would not do so because he or she would feel that being responsible to himself or herself that responsibility would prevent him or her from doing that which would interfere with the pleasure or comfort of his or her associates  i think said mrs archibald somewhat severely that our duty to our fellowbeings is far more important than our selfish consideration of ourselves  but reflect cried corona how much consideration we give to our fellowbeings and how little to ourselves as ourselves each one can we not for the sake of knowing ourselves and honoring ourselves give ourselves to ourselves for a little while the rest of our lives may then be given to others and the world  i hardly believe said mr archibald that all of us clearly understand your meaning but it seems to me that you would like each one of us to become for a time a hermit i do not know of any other class of persons who so thoroughly assert their individuality  you are right exclaimed corona a hermit does it a hermit is more truly himself than any other man he may dwell in a cave and eat watercresses he may live on top of a tall pillar or he may make his habitation in a barrel if a hermit should so choose he might furnish a cave with eastern rugs and bricàbrac if he liked that sort of thing he would be himself yes i would have all of us in the truest sense of the word hermits each a hermit but we need not dwell apart some of us would certainly wish to assert our individuality by not dwelling apart from others  we might then said mr archibald become a company of associate hermits  exactly cried corona stretching out her hands that is the very wordassociate hermits my dear friends from tomorrow morning until we leave here let us be associate hermits let us live for ourselves be true to ourselves after all if we think of it seriously ourselves are all that we have in this world everything else may be taken from us but no one can take from me myself or from any one of you yourself  the bishop now rose he as well as the others had listened attentively to everything that had been said even arthur raybold had shown a great deal of interest in his sisters remarks  you mean said the bishop that while we stay here each one of us shall act exactly as we think we ought to act if we were not influenced by the opinions and examples of others around us and thus we shall have an opportunity to find out for ourselves and show others exactly what we are  that is it said corona you have stated it very well  well then said the bishop i move that for the time stated we individually assert our individuality  second the motion said mr archibald  all in favor of this motion please say aye said corona now let everybody vote and i hope you will all say aye and if any one does not understand i will be happy to explain  i want to know said phil matlack rising if one man asserts what you call his individality in such a way that it runs up agin another mans and that second man aint inclined to stand it if that  oh i assure you interrupted the bishop that that will be all right i understand you perfectly and the individualities will all run along together without interfering with each other and if one happens to get in the way of another it will be gently moved aside  gently said matlack somewhat satirically well all right it will be moved aside i am satisfied if the rest are  now all in favor say aye said corona  they all said aye except mrs perkenpine who said me     chapter xix  margerys breakfast   very early the next morning margery pushed wide open the window of her studio chamber the sash was a large one and opened outward on hinges she looked out upon the dewy foliage she inhaled the fragrance of the moist morning air she listened to the song of some early birds and then being dressed for the day she got on a chair stepped on the windowsill and jumped out she walked quietly round the cabin and went out towards the lake she had never seen the woods so early in the day all the space between the earth and the sky seemed filled with an intoxicating coolness she took off her hat and carried it in her hand the sun was not yet high enough to make it necessary to put anything between him and her  this is what i am said margery to herself as she stepped blithely on i never knew before what i am i am really a dryad under difficulties  presently to her amazement and his amazement she saw martin she went towards him  oh martin she said are you up so early  he smiled this is not early for me he answered  and mr matlack is he up  oh yes he is up and gone off to attend to some business  well really exclaimed margery i thought i was the first one out in the world today and now martin dont you want to do something for me i did not think it would happen but i am really dreadfully hungry and couldnt you give me my breakfast now by myself before anybody else i am not particular what i haveanything that is easy to get ready will doand i would like it down at the very edge of the lake  you shall have it exclaimed martin eagerly i will get it ready for you very soon and will bring it to you i know you like bread and butter and jam and there is some cold meat and i will boil you an egg and make some coffee  that will be lovely said margery and i will go down by the lake and wait i do believe she said to herself as she hurried away that this hermit business is the only sensible thing that ever came into the head of that classic statue with the glass fronts  very soon martin appeared with a rug which he said she would want if she were going to sit on the ground and then he ran away but soon came back with the breakfast margery was surprised to see how tastefully it was served  you could not have done it better she said if you had been ashe was about to say waiter but as she gazed at the bright handsome face of the young man she felt that it would hurt his feelings to use such a word so she suddenly changed it to woman  if it is done well he said it is not because i am like a woman but because you are one  what does that mean thought margery but she did not stop to consider thank you very much she said here is where i am going to eat and nobody will disturb me  do you wish anything else he asked  no said she i have everything i want you know i take only one cup of coffee  he did know it he knew everything she took and as he felt that there was no excuse for him to stay there any longer he slowly walked away  the place margery had chosen was a nice little nook for a nice little hermit it was a bit of low beach very narrow and flanked on the shore side by a row of bushes which soon turned and grew down to the waters edge thus completely cutting off one end of the beach at the other end the distance between the shrubbery and the water was but a few feet so that margery could eat her breakfast without being disturbed by the rest of the world  reclining on the rug with the little tray on the ground before her and some green leaves and a few pale wild flowers peeping over the edge of it to see what she had for breakfast margery gave herself up to the enjoyment of life  each one she said aloud i am one and beautiful nature is another just two of us and each one go away sir she said to a big buzzing creature with transparent wings you are another but you dont count  arthur raybold was perhaps the member of the party who was the best satisfied to be himself he had vowed as he left the campfire the night before that his sister had at last evolved an idea which had some value be himself he should think so he firmly believed that he was the only person in the camp capable of truly acting his own part in life  clyde had told him that on this morning he was going to move the tent over to their own camp and though he had objected very forcibly he found that clyde was not to be moved and that the tent would be in an angry mood he had been the first one of the associated hermits to assert his individuality he made up his mind that he would not leave the immediate atmosphere of margery he would revolve about her in his waking hours and in his dreams and in the latter case he would revolve in a hammock hung between two trees not far from his sisters tent and as he was not one who delayed the execution of his plans he had put up the hammock that night although his tent was still in camp rob he had not slept very well because he was not used to repose in a hammock and he had risen early for though wrapped in a blanket he had found himself a little chilly  starting out for a brisk walk to warm himself he had not gone far before he thought he heard something which sounded like the clicking of knife and fork and dish he stopped listened and then approached the source of the sounds and soon stood at the open end of margerys little beach for a few moments she did not know he was there so engrossed was her mind with the faraway shadows on the lake and with the piece of bread and jam she held in her hand  oh happy fates he exclaimed how have ye befriended me could i have believed such rare fortune was in store for me  at the sound of his voice margery turned her head and started and in the same instant she was on her feet  margery he said without approaching her but extending his arms so that one hand touched the bushes and the other reached over the water i have you a gentle prisoner i consider this the most fortunate hour of my whole existence all i ask of you is to listen to me for ten minutes and then i will cease to stand guard at the entrance to your little haven and although you will be free to go where you please i know you will not go away from me  margerys face was on fire she was so angry she could scarcely speak but she managed to bring some words to her lips to express her condition of mind  mr raybold she cried if i ever hear any more of that horrid trash from you i will speak to mr archibald and have him drive you out of this camp i havent spoken to him before because i thought it would make trouble and interfere with people who have not done anything but what is perfectly right but this is the last time i am going to let you off and i would like you to remember that now go away this instant or else step aside and let me pass  raybold did not change his position but with a smile of indulgent condescension he remarked  now then you are angry but i dont mind that and i am quite sure you do not mean it you see you have never heard all that i have to say to you when i have fully spoken to you then i have no fear  he had not finished his sentence when margery dashed into the water utterly regardless of her clothes and before the astonished intruder could advance towards her she had rushed past him and had run up on dry land a yard or two behind him the water on the shelving beach was not more than a foot deep but her mad bounds made a splashing and a spattering of spray as if a live shark bad been dropped into the shallow water in a moment she had left the beach and was face to face with martin pale with fright  i thought you had tumbled in he cried what on earth is the matter  she had no breath to answer but she turned her head towards the lake and as martin looked that way he saw raybold advancing from behind the bushes it required no appreciable time for the young guide to understand the situation his whole form quivered his hands involuntarily clinched his brows knitted and he made one quick step forward but only one for margery seized him by the wrist without knowing what he was doing he struggled to free himself from her but she was strong and held him fast  i must go to my tent she gasped i am all wet now promise me that you will not say a thing or do a thing until i see you again promise  for a moment he seemed undecided and then he ceased his efforts to get away and said i promise  margery dropped his arm and hurried towards the cabin hoping earnestly that the archibalds were not yet up  this is a gay and lively beginning for a hermit she thought as she made her way around the house and i dont see how on earth i am ever going to get through that window again there is nothing to stand on i did not expect to go back until they were all up  but when she reached the window there was a stout wooden stool placed below it  martin did that she thought while i was at my breakfast he knew i must have come through the window and might want to go back that way oh dear she sighed but i am sure i cant help it and so mounting from the stool to the windowsill she entered her room  having given his promise martin turned his back upon the sombre young man who with folded arms and clouded brow was stalking towards the tents at the other end of the camp  if i look at him said martin it may be that i could not keep my promise  it was about half an hour afterwards when martin still excited and still pale was getting ready for the general breakfast forgetting entirely that he was a hermit and that some of the other hermits might have peculiar ideas about their morning meal that phil matlack arrived on the scene martin was very much engrossed in his own thoughts but he could not repress an inquiring interest in his companion  well said he did you bounce him  matlack made no answer but began to cut out the top of a tin can  i say repeated martin did you bounce him or did he go without it  without turning towards the younger man matlack remarked i was mistaken that aint fat its muscle  you dont mean to say exclaimed martin in astonishment that he bounced you out of that camp  i dont mean to say nothin was the reply except what i do say and what i say is that that aint fat its muscle when i make a mistake i dont mind standin up and sayin so  martin could not understand the situation he knew matlack to be a man of great courage and strength and one who if he should engage in a personal conflict would not give up until he had done his very best but the guides appearance gave no signs of any struggle his clothes were in their usual order and his countenance was quiet and composed  look here cried martin how did you find out all that about the bishop  matlack turned on him with a grim smile didnt you tell me that day you was talkin to me about the boat that he was a tough sort of a fellow  yes i did said the other  well said matlack how did you find that out  martin laughed i shouldnt wonder he said if we were about square well if you will tell me how you found it out i will tell you how i did  go ahead said the other  the long and short of my business with him said martin was this i went with him down to the lake and there i gave him a piece of my mind and when i had finished he turned on me and grabbed me with his two hands and chucked me out into the water just as if i had been a bag of bad meal that he wanted to get rid of when i got out i was going to fight him but he advised me not to and when i took a look at him and remembered the feel of the swing he gave me i took his advice now what did he do to you  he didnt do nothin said matlack when i got to the little tent he sleeps in there he was sittin in front of it as smilin as a basket of chips and he bade me goodmornin as if i had been a tenant comin to pay him his rent and then he said that before we went on with the business between us there was some things he would like to show me and he had em all ready so he steps off to a place a little behind the tent and there was three great bowlders whopping big stones which he said he had brought out of the woods i could hardly believe him but there they was you dont mean says i that you are goin to fight with stones because if you are you ought to give me a chance to get some and i thought to myself that i would pick up rocks that could be heaved oh no says he with one of them smiles of hisoh no i just want to open our conference with a little gymnastic exhibition and so sayin he rolled up his shirtsleeveshe hadnt no coat onand he picked up one of them rocks with both hands and then he gave it a swing with one hand like you swing a tenpin ball and he sent that rock about thirty feet  it nearly took my breath away for if i had to move such a stone id want a wheelbarrow then he took another of the rocks and hurled it right on top of the first one and it came down so hard that it split itself in half and then he took up the third one which was the biggest and threw it nearly as far but it didnt hit the others now mr matlack says he this is the first part of my little programme i have only one or two more things and i dont want to keep you long then he went and got a hickory sapling that hed cut down it was just the trunk part of it and must have been at least three inches thick he put the middle of it at the back of his neck and then he took hold of the two ends with his hands and pulled forward and by george he broke that stick right in half  then says he would you mind steppin down to the lake i didnt mind and went with him and when we got down to the water there was their boat drawed up on the shore and pretty nigh full of water mr clyde brought this boat back the other day says he from a place where he left it some distance down the lake and i wonder he didnt sink before he got here we must try and calk up some of the open seams but first weve got to get the water out of her so sayin he squatted down on the ground in front of the boat and took hold of it one hand on one side of the bow and one on the other and then he gave a big twist and just turned the boat clean over water and all so that it lay with its bottom up and the water running down into the lake like a little deluge  that ought to have been done long ago says he and ill come down after a while and calk it before the sun gets on it then he walked back to camp as spry as a robin and then says he mr matlack my little exhibition is over and so well go ahead with the business you proposed i looked around and says i do you find that little tent you sleep in comfortable it seems to me as if your feet must stick out of it they do says he and i sometimes throw a blanket over them to keep them dry but we are goin to make different arrangements here mr clyde and i will bring down his tent after breakfast and if mr raybold doesnt choose to occupy it mr clyde says i may share it with him at any rate ive engaged to attend to the cookin and to things in general in this camp durin the rest of the time we stay here  and so mr clyde is tired of trespassin is he says i yes he is says he hes a highminded young fellow and doesnt fancy that sort of thing mr raybold slept last night in a hammock and if that suits him he may keep it up if i was you says i if he does come back to the camp id make him sleep in that little tent it would fit him better than it does you oh no says he i dont want to make no trouble im willin to sleep anywhere im used to roughin it and i could make myself comfortable in any tent i ever saw well says i that was a very pretty exhibition you gave me and i am much obliged to you but i must be goin over to my camp to help get breakfast if you see mr clyde says he will you kindly tell him that i will come over and help him with his tent in about an hour to which i said i would and i left now then hurry up them hermits will want their breakfasts     chapter xx  martin asserts his individuality   goodmorning said mr clyde as he approached mr and mrs archibald seated opposite each other at their breakfasttable so you still eat together dont ask me to join you i have had my breakfast  yes said mr archibald we did think that as we were hermits we ought to eat in some separate outoftheway fashion but we could not think of any and as we were both hungry and liked the same things we concluded to postpone the assertion of our individualities  and miss dearborn asked clyde  oh she had her breakfast long ago so she told us said mrs archibald i suppose she took some bread and jam for i do not know what else she could have had  as for me said clyde i thought i would do something of the sort i like an early breakfast and so i turned out more than an hour ago and went to look up mrs perkenpine and i might as well say sir that i am now looking for the bishop to come and help me carry our tent back to our own camp where he is going to cook for us i never wanted to be a trespasser on your premises and i dont intend to be such any longer  thats the right feeling said mr archibald although in fact it doesnt make any difference to us whether your party camps here or not at first i thought it would but i find it does not  by which he means said mrs archibald that if you want to go away he is perfectly willing to have you stay but if you dont want to go away he doesnt like it and would have you move  clyde laughed i havent anything to say for the others he answered but as long as i have a camp of my own i think i ought to live there  but how about mrs perkenpine asked mrs archibald did you find her willing to wait on you one at a time  not exactly said clyde i discovered her by her kitchen tent hard at work eating her own breakfast i must have looked surprised for she lost no time in telling me that she was a hermit and was living for one person at a timeherself firstand that she was mighty glad to get a chance to have her breakfast before anybody else for she was always hungry and hated waiting i looked at the table and saw that she had the breakfast ready for the whole party so i said i am a hermit too and i am living for myself and so i am going to sit down and eat squat said she and down i sat and i had the best meal of her cooking that i have yet tasted i told her so and she said she shouldnt wonder because said she i cooked this breakfast for myselfme oneand as i wasnt thinkin what other people d like i got things a little more tasty than common i guess  and what does she expect miss raybold and her brother to do asked mrs archibald  when she had finished she got up clyde answered and went away merely remarking that the victuals were there and when the others were ready for them they might come and get them  i hope said mr archibald that matlack will not fancy that sort of a hermit life but as for me i am greatly taken with the scheme i think i shall like it is miss raybold about yet  i see nothing of her said clyde looking over towards her tent  good said mr archibald rising harriet if you want me i shall be in my cave  and where is that she asked  oh i cant say exactly where it will be he answered but if you will go down to the shore of the lake and blow four times on the dinnerhorn ill come to you cave and all i can easily pull it over the water  you forget said mrs archibald with a smile that we are associate hermits  no i do not said her husband i remember it and that is the reason i am off before miss raybold emerges upon the scene  i do not know said mrs archibald to clyde exactly how i am going to assert myself today but i shall do it one way or the other i am not going to be left out in the cold  clyde smiled but he had no suggestion to offer his mind was filled with the conjecture as to what sort of a hermit life margery was going to lead and if she had already begun it but just then the bishop came up and together they went to carry the tent back to camp roy  it was at least an hour afterwards and mrs archibald was comfortably seated in the shade darning stockings with an open book in her lap sometimes she would read a little in the book and then she would make some long and careful stitches in the stocking and then she would look about her as if she greatly enjoyed combining her work and her recreation in such a lovely place on such a lovely summer morning during one of these periods of observation she perceived corona raybold approaching  goodmorning said the elder lady is this your first appearance  yes said corona with a gentle smile when i woke this morning i found myself to be an individual who liked to lie in bed and gaze out through an open fold in my tent upon the world beyond and so i lay and dozed and gazed until i felt like getting up and then i got up and you cannot imagine how bright and happy i felt as i thought of what i had been doing for one morning at least i had been true to myself without regard to other people or what they might think about it tomorrow if i feel like it i shall rise at dawn and go out and look at the stars struggling with aurora whatever my personal instincts happen to be i shall be loyal to them now how do you propose to assert your individuality  unfortunately said mrs archibald i cannot do that exactly as i would like to if we had not promised my daughter and her husband that we would stay away for a month i should go directly home and superintend my jellymaking and fruitpreserving but as i cannot do that i have determined to act out my own self here i shall darn stockings and sew or read and try to make myself comfortable and happy just as i would if i were sitting on my broad piazza at home  good said corona i think it likely that you will be more true to yourself than any of us doubtless you were born to be the head of a domestic household and if you followed your own inclination you would be that if you were adrift with your family on a raft in the middle of the ocean now i am going away to see what further suggestions my nature has to offer me what is mr archibald doing  mrs archibald smiled she knew what coronas nature would suggest if she met a man who could talk or rather listen oh his nature has prompted him to hie away to the haunts of game and to stay there until he is half starved  miss raybold heaved a little sigh i see very few persons about here she saidonly the two guides in fact  yes said mrs archibald the bishop has gone to help mr clyde with his tent  corona moved slowly away and as she walked her nature suggested that she would better eat something so she repaired to the scene of mrs perkenpines ordinary operations there she found that good woman stretched flat on her back on the ground fast asleep her face and body were shaded by some overhanging branches but her great feet were illumined and gilded by the blazing sun on a camp table near by were the remains of the breakfast it had been there for two or three hours arthur raybold had taken what he wanted and had gone and before composing herself for her nap mrs perkenpine had thrown over it a piece of mosquitonetting  corona smiled their natures are coming out beautifully she said it really does me good to see how admirably the scheme is unfolding itself she sat down and ate what she could find to her taste but it was not much i shall send for some fruit and some biscuit and some other little things she thought that i can keep in my tent and eat when i please that will suit me much better than the ordinary meals then without awakening mrs perkenpine she strolled away directing her steps towards camp roy  when margery had gone to her room and had changed her wet clothes she was thoroughly miserable for some time she sat on the side of her little cot unwilling to go out on account of a nervous fear that she might meet mr raybold of course if he should again speak to her as he had done she would immediately appeal to mr archibald but she did not want to do this for she had a very strong desire not to make any trouble or divisions in the camp so she lay down to think over the matter and in less than two minutes she was asleep mrs archibald had come to call her to breakfast but upon being told that she had been up ever so long and had had her breakfast she left the girl to her nap  i shall sleep here thought margery until they have all gone to do whatever it is they want to do and then perhaps i may have a little peace  when she awoke it was nearly eleven oclock and she went immediately to her little side window from which she could see the lake and a good deal of the campground the first thing which met her reconnoitering gaze was a small boat some distance out on the lake its oars were revolving slowly something like a pair of wheels with one paddle each and it was occupied by one person this person was arthur raybold who had found the bishop calking the boat and as soon as this work was finished had moodily declared that he would take a row in her he had not yet had a chance to row a boat which was in a decent condition he wanted to be alone with his aspirations he thought it would be scarcely wise to attempt to speak to margery again that morning he would give her time for her anger to cool she was only a woman and he knew women  its that raybold said margery he knows no more about rowing than a cat and hes floating sideways down the lake good now i can go out and hope to be let alone i dont know when he will ever get that boat back again perhaps never  she was not a wicked girl and she did not desire that the awkward rower might never get back but still she did not have that dread of an accident which might have come over her had the occupant of the boat been a brother or any one she cared very much about she took a novel of which during her whole stay in camp she had read perhaps ten pages and left the cabin this time by the door  how does your individuality treat you asked mrs archibald as margery approached her  oh horribly so far was the answer but i think it is going to do better i shall find some nice place where i can read and be undisturbed i can think of nothing pleasanter such a morning as this  i am very much mistaken in your nature thought mrs archibald if that is the sort of thing that suits you  martin said margery not in the least surprised that she should meet the young guide within the next three minutes do you know of some really nice secluded spot where i can sit and read and not be bothered i dont mean that place where you hung the hammock i dont want to go there again  martin was pale and his voice trembled as he spoke miss dearborn said he i think it is a wicked and a burning shame that you should be forced to look for a hidingplace where you may hope to rest undisturbed if that scoundrel in the boat out there should happen to fancy to come ashore but you neednt do it there is no necessity for it go where you please sit where you please and do what you please and i will see to it that you are not disturbed  oh no no exclaimed margery that would never do i know very well that you could keep him away from me and i am quite sure that you would be glad to do it but there mustnt be anything of that kind he is miss raybolds brother andand in a way one of our camping party and i dont want any disturbances or quarrels  martins breast heaved and he breathed heavily i have no doubt you are right he saidof course you are but i can tell you this if i see that fellow troubling you again ill kill him or  martin martin exclaimed margery what do you mean what makes you talk in this way  what makes me he exclaimed as if it were impossible to restrain his words my heart makes me my soul makes me i  your heart your soul interrupted margery i dont understand  for a moment he looked at the astonished girl in silence and then he said miss dearborn its of no use for me to try to hide what i feel if i hadnt got so angry i might have been able to keep quiet but i cant do it now if that man thinks he loves you his love is like a grain of sand compared to mine  yours cried margery  yes said martin his face pallid and his eyes sparkling mine you may think it is an insult for me to talk this way but love is love and it will spring up where it pleases and besides i am not the common sort of a fellow you may think i am after saying what i have said i am bound to say more i belong to a good family and am college bred i am poor and i love nature i am working to make money to travel and become a naturalist i prefer this sort of work because it takes me into the heart of nature i am not ashamed of what i am i am not ashamed of my work and my object in life is a nobler one i think than the practice of the law or a great many other things like it  margery stood and looked at him with wideopen eyes do you mean to say she said that you want to marry me it would take years and years for you to become naturalist enough to support a wife  i have made no plans he said quickly i have no purpose i did not intend to tell you now that i love you but since i have said that i will say also that with you to fight for there could be no doubt about my success i should be bound to succeed it would be impossible for me to fail as for the years i would wait no matter how many they should be  he spoke with such hot earnestness that margery involuntarily drew herself a little away from him at this the flush went out of his face  oh miss dearborn he exclaimed dont think that i am like that man out there dont think that i will persecute you if you dont wish to hear me that i will follow you about and make your life miserable if you say to me that you do not wish to see me again you will never see me again say what you please and you will find that i am a gentleman  she could see that now she felt sure that if she told him she did not wish ever to see him again he would never appear before her but what would he do she was not in the least afraid of him but his fierce earnestness frightened her not for herself but for him suddenly a thought struck her  martin said she i dont doubt in the least that what you have said to me about yourself is true you are as good as other people although you do happen now to be a guide and perhaps after a while you may be very well off but for all that you are a guide and you are in mr sadlers employment and mr sadlers rights and powers are just like gas escaping from a pipe they are everywhere from cellar to garret so to speak and you couldnt escape them it would be a bad bad thing for you martin if he were to hear that you make propositions of the kind you have made to the ladies that he pays you to take out into the woods to guide and to protect  martin was on the point of a violent expostulation but she stopped him  now i know what you are going to say she exclaimed but it isnt of any use you are in his employment and you are bound to honor and to respect him that is the way a guide can show himself to be a gentleman  but suppose said martin quickly that he knowing my family as he does should think i had done wisely in speaking to you  a cloud came over her brow it annoyed her that he should thus parry her thrust  well you can ask him she said abruptly and if he doesnt object you can go to see my mother when she gets home and ask her and here comes mr matlack i think he has been calling you now dont say another word unless it is about fish  but matlack did not come he stopped and called and martin went to him  margery walked languidly towards the woods and sat down on the projecting root of a large tree then leaning back against the trunk she sighed  it is a perfectly dreadful thing to be a girl she said but i am glad i did not speak to him as i did to mr raybold i believe he would have jumped into the lake     chapter xxi  the individuality of peter sadler   martin said matlack sharply before the young man had reached him it seems to me that you think that you have been engaged here as ladysmaid but theres other things to do besides teaching young women about trees and fishes if you think continued matlack when the two had reached the woodland kitchen that your bein a hermit is goin to let you throw all the work on me youre mistaken theres a lot of potatoes thats got to be peeled for dinner  without a word martin sat down on the ground with a pan of potatoes in front of him and began to work had he been a proud crusader setting forth to fight the saracens his blood could not have coursed with greater warmth and force his soul could not have more truly spurned the earth and all the common things upon it what he had said to margery had made him feel ennobled if raybold had that instant appeared before him with some jeering insult martin would have pardoned him with lofty scorn and yet he peeled potatoes and did it well but his thoughts were not upon his work they were upon the future which if he proved himself to be the man he thought himself to be might open before him when he had finished the potatoes he put the pan upon a table and stood near by deep in thought  yes said he to himself i should go now after what i have said to her i cannot stay here and live this life before her i would wait on her with bended knee at every step but with love for her in my soul i cannot wash dishes for other people i have spoken and now i must act and the quicker the better if all goes well i may be here again but i shall not come back as a guide then a thought of raybold crossed his mind but he put it aside even if he stayed here he could not protect her for she had shown that she did not wish him to do it in the only way he could do it and he felt sure too that any further annoyance would result in an appeal to mr archibald  well said matlack sharply whats the matter with you dont you intend to move  yes said martin turning quickly i do intend to move i am going to leave this camp just as soon as i can pack my things  and where in the name of thunder are you goin to  im going to sadlers said martin  what for  on my own business was the reply  matlack looked at him for a moment suspiciously have you got any complaints to make of me he said  no said martin promptly not one but i have affairs on hand which will take me off immediately  before dinner asked matlack  yes said the other before dinner now  go ahead then said matlack putting some sticks of wood into the stove and tell sadler that if he dont send me somebody before suppertime to help about this camp hell see me ill be hanged he said to himself as he closed the door of the stove if this isnt hermitism with a vengeance i wonder wholl be the next one to cut and run most likely it will be mrs perkenpine  early in the afternoon warm and dusty martin presented himself before peter sadler who was smoking his pipe on the little shaded piazza at the back of the house  oh ho said peter how in the name of commonsense did you happen to turn up at this minute this is about as queer a thing as ive known of lately what did you come for sit down  mr sadler said martin i have come here on most important business  lake dry asked peter  it is a matter said martin which concerns myself and if all the lakes in the world were dry i would not be able to think about them so full is my soul of one thing  by the lord harry said peter lets have it quick  in a straightforward manner but with an ardent vehemence which he could not repress martin stated his business with peter sadler he told him how he loved margery what he had said to her and what she had said to him  and now said the young man i have come to ask your permission to address her but whether you give it or not i shall go to her mother and speak to her i know her address and i intend to do everything in an honorable way  peter sadler put down his pipe and looked steadfastly at the young man i wish to heaven said he that there was a war goin on id write a letter to the commanderinchief and let you take it to him and id tell him you was the bravest man between hudson bay and patagonia by george i cant understand it i cant understand how you could have the cheek the unutterable brass to come here and ask meme peter sadlerto let you court one of the ladies in a campinparty of mine and whats more i cant understand how i can sit here and hear you tell me that tale without picking up a chair and knocking you down with it  mr sadler said martin rising i have spoken to you fairly and squarely and if thats all youve got to say i will go  sit down roared peter bringing his hand upon the table as if he would drive its legs through the floor sit down and listen to what i have to say to you its the strangest thing that ever happened to me that i am not more angry with you than i am but i cant understand it and i pass it by now that you are seated again i will make some remarks on my side do you see that said he picking up a letter on the table do you see who it is addressed to  to me exclaimed martin in surprise  yes its to you said peter and i wrote it and i intended to send it by bill hammond this afternoon thats the reason i was surprised when i saw you here but im not goin to give it to you id rather tell you whats in it now you are here before i knew you were the abject ninnyhammer that you have just told me you are i had a good opinion of you and thought that you were cut out to make a firstclass traveller and explorerthe sort of a fellow who could lead a surveying expedition through the wilderness or work up new countries and find out what they are made of and whats in them only yesterday i heard of a chance that ought to make you jump and this morning i wrote to you about it a friend of mine whos roughed it with me for many a day is goin to take an expedition down into new mexico in the interests of a railroad and minin company they want to know everything about the countrythe game fish trees and plants as well as the mineralsand it struck me that if you are not just the kind of man they want you could make yourself so in a very short time theyd pay you well enough and youd have a chance to dip into natural history and all that sort of thing that you had no reason to expect for a dozen years to come if it ever came if such a chance had been offered to me at your age i wouldnt have changed lots with a king all youve got to do is to pack up and be off the party starts from new york in just three days ill give you a letter to joe hendricks and thatll be all you want he knows me well enough to take you without a word if you havent got money enough saved to fit yourself out for the trip ill lend you some and you can pay me back when they pay you you can take the train this afternoon and maybe you can see hendricks tonight so pack up what you want and leave what you dont want and ill take care of it ill write to hendricks now  many times did the face of martin flush and pale as he listened a vision of paradise had been opened before him but he felt that he must shut his eyes  mr sadler he said you are very kind you offer me a great thinga thing which two weeks ago i should have accepted in the twinkling of an eye and would have thanked you for all the rest of my life but i cannot take it now with all my heart i love a woman i have told her so and i am now going on the path she told me to take i cannot turn aside from that for any prospects in the world  peter sadlers face grew red and then it grew black and then it turned red again and finally resumed its ordinary brown  martin sanders said he speaking quietly but with one hand fastened upon the arm of his chair with a grasp which a horse could not have loosened if you are cowardly enough and small enough and paltry enough to go to a girl who is living in peace and comfort and ask her to marry you when you know perfectly well that for years to come you could not give her a decent roof over her head and that if her family wanted her to live like a christian they would have to give her the money to do it with and if you are fool enough not to know that when she sent you first to me and then to her mother she was tryin to get rid of you without hurtin your feelins why then i want you to get out of my sight and the quicker the better but if you are not so low down as that go to your room and pack up your bag the coach will start for the train at three oclock and it is now nearly halfpast two that will just give me time to write to hendricks go  martin rose whatever happened afterwards he must go now it seemed to him as if the whole world had suddenly grown colder as if he had been floating in a fog and had neared an iceberg could it be possible that she had spoken as she had spoken simply to get rid of him he could not believe it no one with such honest eyes could speak in that way and yet he did not know what to believe  in any case he would go away in the coach he had spoken to sadler and now whether he spoke to any one else or not the sooner he left the better  when he came to take the coach peter sadler who had rolled himself to the front of the house handed him the letter he had written  i believe you are made of the right kind of stuff he said although youve got a little mouldy by bein lazy out there in the woods but youre all right now and what youve got to do is to go ahead with a will and take my word for it youll come out on top do you want any money no very well then goodbye you neednt trouble yourself to write to me ill hear about you from hendricks and id rather know what he thinks about you than what you think about yourself  how little you know thought martin as he entered the coach what i am or what i think about myself as if my purpose could be changed by words of yours and he smiled a smile which would have done justice to arthur raybold the chill had gone out of him he was warm again  on the train he read the letter to hendricks which peter sadler had given to him unsealed it was a long letter and he read it twice then he sat and gazed out of the window at the flying scenery for nearly half an hour after which he read the letter again then he folded it up and put it into his pocket  if she had given me the slightest reason to hope he said to himself how easy it would be to tear this letter into scraps  now an idea came into his mind if he could see her mother quickly and if she should ignore his honorable intentions and refuse to give him the opportunity to prove that he was worthy of a thought from her and her daughter then it might not be too late to fall back on peter sadlers letter but he shook his head that would be dishonorable and unworthy of him  he shut his eyes he could not bear to look at the brightness of the world outside the window of the car under his closed lids there came to him visions sometimes of margery and sometimes of the forests of new mexico sometimes the visions were wavering uncertain and transitory and again they were strong and vividso plain to him that he could almost hear the leaves rustle as some wild creature turned a startled look upon him  that night he delivered his letter to mr hendricks     chapter xxii  a tranquillizing breeze and a hot wind   after martin had left her margery sat on the root of the tree until mr clyde came up and said he had been wondering what had become of her  i have been wondering that myself she said at least i have been wondering what is going to become of me  dont you intend to be a hermit said he  she shook her head i dont think it is possible she answered there is no one who is better satisfied to be alone and who can make herself happier all by herself and who in all sorts of ways can get along better without other people than i can and yet other people are continually interfering with me and i cannot get away from them  clyde smiled that is a pretty plain hint he said i suppose i might as well take it and go off to some hermitage of my own  oh nonsense said margery dont be so awfully quick in coming to conclusions i do feel worried and troubled and bothered and i want some one to talk to not about things which worry me of course but about common ordinary things that will make me forget  a slight shade came over the face of mr clyde and he seated himself on the ground near margery it is a shame said he that you should be worried what is it in this peaceable beautiful forest troubles you  did you ever hear of a paradise without snakes she asked the very beauty of it makes them come here  i have never yet known any paradise at all he replied but cant you tell me what it is that troubles you  margery looked at him with her clear large eyes ill tell you she said if you will promise not to do a single thing without my permission  i promise that said clyde eagerly  i am troubled by people making love to me  people exclaimed clyde with a puzzled air  yes said she your cousin is one of them  i might have supposed that but who on earth can be the other one  that is martin said margery  for a moment mr clyde did not seem to understand and then he exclaimed you dont mean the young man who cuts wood and helps matlack  yes i do she answered and you need not shut your jaw hard and grit your teeth that way that is exactly what he did when he found out about mr raybold it is of no use to get angry for you cant do anything without my permission and besides i tell you that if i were condemned by a court to be made love to i would much rather have martin make it than mr raybold martin is a good deal more than a guide he has a good education and would not be here if it were not for his love of nature he is going to make nature his object in life and there is something noble in that a great deal better than trying to strut about on the stage  and those two have really been making love to you asked clyde  yes really she answered you never saw people more in earnest in all your life as for mr raybold he was as earnest as a cat after a bird he made me furiously angry martin was different he is just as earnest but he is more of a gentleman and when i told him what i wanted him to do he said he would do it but there is no use in telling your cousin what i want him to do he is determined to persecute me and make me miserable and there is no way of stopping it except by making a quarrel between him and uncle archibald it is a shame she went on who could have thought that two people would have turned up to disturb me in this way  margery said mr clyde and although he called her by her christian name she took no notice of it you think you have too many lovers but you are mistaken you have not enough you ought to have three  she looked at him inquiringly  yes he said quickly and i want to be the third  and so make matters three times as bad as they were at first she asked  not at all said he when you have chosen one of them he could easily keep away the two others  do you mean said margery that if i were to agree to have three and then if i were to ask you to do it you would go away quietly with one of the others and leave me in peace with the third one  mr clyde half smiled but instantly grew serious again and a flush came on his face margery said he i cannot bear trifling any more about this no matter what anybody has said to you whether it is any one in this camp or any one out of it there is not a man in this world who  oh mr clyde interrupted margery you must not sit there and speak to me in such an excited way if any one should see us they would think we were quarrelling let us go down to the lake the air from the water is cool and soothing  together they walked from under the shade of the tree and so wended their way that it brought them to a mass of shrubbery which edged the water a little distance down the lake on the other side of this shrubbery was a pretty bank which they had seen before  it always tranquillizes me said margery as they stood side by side on the bank to look out over the water doesnt it have that effect on you  no exclaimed clyde it does not tranquillize me a bit nothing could tranquillize me at a moment like this margery i want you to know that i love you i did not intend to tell you so soon but what you have said makes it necessary i have loved you ever since i met you at peter sadlers and no matter what you say about it i shall love you to the end of my life  even if i should send you away with one of the others  yes no matter what you did  that would be wrong she said  it doesnt matter right or wrong id do it  margery gave him a glance from which it would have been impossible to eliminate all signs of admiration and if i were to arrange it otherwise she said would you undertake to keep the others away  there was no answer to this question but in a minute afterwards clyde exclaimed do you think any one would dare to come near you if they saw you now  hardly said margery raising her head from his shoulder and looking up into his sparkling eyes really harrison you ought not to speak in such a loud voice if aunt harriet were to hear you she might dare to come  margery was late to dinner although the horn was blown three times  much to the surprise of his wife mr archibald returned to camp about an hour before dinner  how is this she exclaimed wasnt the fishing good  i have had a disagreeable experience he said and i will tell you about it i was fishing in a little cove some distance down the lake and having good sport when i heard a thumping and looking around i saw raybold in a boat rowing towards me i suppose he thought he was rowing but he was really floating with the current but as he neared me he suddenly pulled his boat towards me with such recklessness that i was afraid he would run into me i considered his rowing into the cove to be a piece of bad manners for of course it would spoil my fishing but i had no idea he actually intended to lay alongside of me this he did however and so awkwardly that his boat struck mine with such force that it half tipped it over then he lay hold of my gunwale and said he had something to say to me  i was as angry as if a man in the street had knocked my hat down over my eyes and said that he did so in order to call my attention to a subscription paper but this indignation was nothing to what i felt when the fellow began to speak i cannot repeat his words but he stated his object at once and said that as this was a good opportunity to speak to me alone he wished to ask me to remove what he called the utterly useless embargo which i had placed upon him in regard to margery he said it was useless because he could not be expected to give up his hopes and his plans simply because i objected to them and he went on to say that if i understood him fully and if margery understood him he did not believe that either of us would object and then he actually asked me to use my influence with her to make her listen to him from what he said i am sure he has been speaking to her i did not let him finish but turned and blazed at him in words as strong as would come to me i ordered him never to speak to me again or show himself in my camp and told him that if he did either of these things he would do them at his peril and then for fear he might say something which would make me lose control of myself i jerked up my anchor and rowed away from him i didnt feel like fishing any more and so i came back  his behavior is shameful said mrs archibald and what is more it is ridiculous for margery would not look at him what sort of a man does he think you are to suppose that you would give your permission to any one no matter who he might be to offer marriage to a young lady in your charge but what are you going to do about it i think it very likely he will come to this camp and he may speak to you  in that case i shall have him driven out said mr archibald as if he were a drunken vagabond personally i shall have nothing to do with him but i shall order my guides to eject him  i hope that may not be necessary said his wife it would make bad feeling and deeply wound his sister for it would be the same thing as putting her out she talks too much to be sure but she is a lady and has treated us all very courteously i wish we could get through the rest of our stay here without any disturbance or bad feeling  i wish so too with all my heart said her husband and the only thing necessary to that end is that that ass raybold shall keep out of my sight  it was about two oclock that afternoon and mrs archibald under her tree her basket of stockings all darned and her novel at its culminating point of interest was the only visible occupant of camp rob when corona raybold came walking towards her an obvious purpose in her handsome face which was somewhat flushed by exercise  i do not think she said as soon as she was near enough for mrs archibald to hear her that the true purpose and intention of our plan is properly understood by all of the party i think after some explanation everything will go well but i have been endeavoring for the last halfhour to find mrs perkenpine and have utterly failed i am very hungry but i can discover nothing to eat all our stores appear to be absolutely raw or in some intermediate state of crudity i intend to order some provisions in cans or boxes which will be at all times available but i have not done so yet and so i have come over to speak to you about the matter did your guides prepare your dinner as usual  oh yes said mrs archibald a hermit life seems to make no difference with mr matlack we become associates at mealtimes but as you see we have separated again  i must instil into mrs perkenpines mind said corona that in order thoroughly to act out her own nature she must cook and do other things of a domestic character of course she will do those things in her own way that is to be expected but she must do them it is impossible to imagine a woman of her class whose soul is not set more or less upon domestic affairs i will instance mr matlack his nature belongs to the woods and the outofdoor world and that nature prompts him to cook what he shoots  mrs archibald laughed i think his nature is a very good one she said and i will go with you to find him and see if he cannot give you a luncheon if not a dinner  thank you very much said corona but indeed i do not wish to trouble you i will go to him myself you are very kind but it is not in the least degree necessary for you to accompany me a cup of tea and some little trifle is all i shall ask him for  for a moment mrs archibald hesitated and then she said as we are hermits i suppose we must not keep together any more than we can help and so i will let you go alone  corona found phil matlack by his kitchen tent busily engaged in rubbing the inside of a large kettle he was not in a good humor the departure of martin had thrown all the work of his camp upon him and now the appearance of a person from another camp requesting to be fed aroused him to absolute anger he did not scold for it would have been impossible to look at that beautiful and imperturbable face and say hard words to it he did not refuse the cup of tea or the breadandbutter for which he was asked and he even added some cold meat but he indignantly made up his mind that he would stand no more of this nonsense and that if necessary he would go to sadler and throw up the job he had not engaged to cook for three camps  illustration havent tried it  miss raybold did not appear to notice his state of mind and ate heartily she thought it was fortunate that he happened to have the kettle on the stove and she asked him how he liked the hermit lifethe living for himself alone  havent tried it he answered curtly  i understand said corona you have had to live too much for other people but it is too soon to expect our plan to run smoothly in a short time however we shall be better able to know our own natures and show them to others  oh i can do that said he and i am goin to precious soon  i have no doubt of it she answered and now can you tell me where mr archibald has gone i did not see him this morning and there are some matters i wish to speak to him about  no miss said matlack promptly i dont know where he is hes a real hermit hes off by himself most likely miles away  corona reflected mrthe bishop have you seen him he may be able to  the guide grinned grimly he had seen the man of musclenot fatconversing that morning with corona and an hour afterwards he had seen him not in the same place but in the same companionship and it gave him a certain pleasure to know that the man who could heave rocks and break young trees could not relieve himself from the thralls of the lady of the flowing speech  the bishop said he dont you know where he went to  he left me she answered because he was obliged to go to prepare dinner for my brother and mr clyde but he is not in camp roy now for i went there to look for mrs perkenpine  well said the wicked matlack pointing to the spot where not long before margery had found a tranquillizing breeze i saw him going along with a book a little while ago and i think he went down to the shore just beyond that clump of bushes over there he seems to be a man who likes readin which isnt a bad thing for a hermit  thank you said miss raybold rising i do not care for anything more you are very kind and i am quite sure i shall not have to trouble you again tomorrow everything will be running smoothly  matlack looked at her as she quietly walked away shes a pretty sort of a hermit he said to himself if she really had to live by herself shed cut out a wooden man and talk to it all day it wont be long before she accidentally stumbles over that big fellow with his book     chapter xxiii  mrs perkenpine finds out things about herself   the mind of the guide was comforted and relieved that he had got the better of the bishop in one way although he could not do it in another but he did not relinquish his purpose of putting an end to the nonsense which made him do the work of other people and as soon as he had set his kitchen in order he started out to find mrs perkenpine a certain amount of nonsense from the people in camp might have to be endured but nonsense from mrs perkenpine was something about which peter sadler would have a word to say  matlack was a good hunter he could follow all sorts of tracksrabbit tracks bird tracks deer tracks and the tracks of big ungainly shoesand in less than half an hour he had reached a cluster of mosscovered rocks lying some distance back in the woods and approached by the bed of a now dry stream sitting on one of these rocks her back against a tree her straw hat lying beside her and her dishevelled hair hanging about her shoulders was mrs perkenpine reading a newspaper at the sound of his footsteps she looked up  well ill be bound she said if id crawl into a foxhole i expect youd come and sniff in after me  matlack stood and looked at her for a moment he could not help smiling at the uncomfortable manner in which she was trying to make herself comfortable on those rough rocks  ill tell you what it is mrs perkenpine he said youll get yourself into the worst kind of a hole if you go off this way leavin everything at sixes and sevens behind you  its my nater said she im findin it out and gittin it ready to show to other people youre the fust one thats seed it how do you like it  i dont like it at all said the guide and i have just come to tell you that if you dont go back to your tent and cook supper tonight and attend to your business ill walk over to sadlers and tell peter to send some one in your place im goin over there anyway if he dont send a man to take martins place  peter sadler ejaculated mrs perkenpine letting her tumbled newspaper fall into her lap hes a man that knows his own nater and lets other people see it he lives his own life if anybody does hes individdle down to the heels and just look at him hes the same as a king i tell you phil matlack that the more i knows myself just me the more im tickled it seems like scootin round in the woods findin all sorts of funny hoppin things and flowers that you never seed before why it aint been a whole day since i begun knowin myself and ive found out lots i used to think that i liked to cook and clean up but i dont i hate it  matlack smiled and taking out his pipe he lighted it and sat down on a rock  i do believe he said that you are the most out and out hermit of the whole lot but it wont do and if you dont get over your objections to cookin youll have to walk out of these woods tomorrow  mrs perkenpine sat and looked at her companion a few moments without giving any apparent heed to his remarks  of course said she it isnt only findin out what you be yourself but its lettin other people see what you be if you didnt do that it would be like a pot abilin out in the middle of a prairie with nobody nearer nor a hundred miles  it would be the same as if it hadnt biled remarked matlack  thats jest it said she and so i aint sorry you come along phil sos i can tell you some things ive found out about myself one of them is that i like to lie flat on my back and look up at the leaves of the trees and think about them  what do you think asked matlack  i dont think nothin said she just as soon as i begin to look at them wrigglin in the wind and i am beginnin to wonder what it is i think about them i go slam bang to sleep and when i wake up and try to think again what it is i think off i go again but i like it if i dont know what it is i think i ought to know that i dont know it thats what i call bein really and truly a hermick  what else did you find out inquired matlack  i found out she answered with animation that i admire to read anecdotes i didnt know i cared a pin for anecdotes until i took to hermickin now heres this paper it came round the cheese and its got a good many anecdotes scattered about in it let me read one of them to you its about a man who made his will and afterwards was adrivin a horse along a road and the horse got skeered and ran over his executor who was takin a walk then he sung out oh bless my soul says he but ill read you the rest if i can find it  never mind about the anecdote said matlack who knew very well that it would take mrs perkenpine half an hour to spell out twenty lines in a newspaper what i want to know is if you found out anything about yourself thats likely to give you a boost in the direction of that cookinstove of yourn  mrs perkenpine was a woman whose remarks did not depend upon the remarks of others phil matlack said she gazing fixedly at his pipe if i had a man id let him smoke just as much as he pleased and just where he pleased he could smoke afore he got up and he could smoke at his meals and he could smoke after he went to bed and if he fancied that sort of thing he could smoke at family prayers it wouldnt make no difference to me and i wouldnt say a word to him agin it if that was his individdlety id say viddle  and how about everything else asked matlack would you tell him to cook his own victuals and mend his clothes accordin to his own nater  no sir said she striking with her expansive hand the newspaper in her lapno sir id get up early in the mornin and cook and wash and bake and scour id skin the things he shot and clean his fish and dig bait if he wanted it id tramp into the woods after him and carry the gun and the victuals and fishinpoles and id set traps and row a boat and build fires and let him go along and work out his own nater smokin or in any other way he was born to thats the biggest thing ive found out about myself i never knowed until i began this mornin explorin of my own nater what a powerful hard thing it is when im thinkin of my own individdlety to keep somebody elses individdlety from poppin up in front of it and so says i to myself if i can think of both them individdleties at the same time it will suit me fustrate and when you come along i thought id let you know what sort of a nater ive got for it aint likely youd ever find it out for yourself and now that were in that business  hello cried matlack springing to his feet there is somebody callin me whos there he shouted stepping out into the bed of the stream  a call was now heard and in a few moments the bishop appeared some distance below  mr matlack he said theres a man at your camp inquiring for you he came from sadlers and ive been looking high and low for you  a man from sadlers said matlack turning to mrs perkenpine and i must be off to see him remember what i told you about the supper and so saying he walked rapidly away  out in the open matlack found the bishop obliged to you for lookin me up he said its a pity to give you so much trouble  oh dont mention it exclaimed the bishop you cannot understand perhaps not knowing the circumstances but i assure you i never was more obliged to any one than to that man who wants to see you and couldnt find you there was no one else to look for you and i simply had to go  you are not goin to walk back to camp inquired matlack  no replied the bishop now that i am here i think i will go up the lake and try to find a very secluded spot in the shade and take a nap  the guide smiled as he walked away dont understand said he youve got the boot on the wrong leg  arrived at his tent matlack found bill hammond a young man in sadlers service who informed him that that burly individual had sent martin away in the stagecoach and had ordered him to come and take his place  all right said matlack i guess youre as good as he was and so you can settle down to work bytheway do you know that we are all hermits here  hermits said the other whats that  why hermits said matlack is individals who get up early in the mornin and attend to their own business just as hard as they can without lookin to the right or left until its time to go to bed  the young man looked at him in some surprise theres nothing so very uncommon in that said he  no replied the guide perhaps there aint but as you might hear them talkin about hermits here i thought id tell you just what sort of things they are     chapter xxiv  a dissolving audience   when a strange young man assisted matlack at the suppertable that evening mr archibald asked what had become of martin  peter sadler has sent him away answered the guide i dont know where he sent him or what he sent him for but hes a young man whos above this sort of business and so i suppose hes gone off to take up something thats more elevated  i am sorry said mrs archibald for i liked him  mr archibald smiled this business of insisting upon our own individualities he said seems to have worked very promptly in his case i suppose he found out he was fitted for something better than a guide and immediately went off to get that better thing  thats about the size of it said matlack  margery said nothing her heart sank she could not help feeling that what she had said to the young man had been the cause of his sudden departure could he have done such a thing she thought as really to go and ask mr sadler and having found he did not mind could he have gone to see her mother her appetite for her supper departed and she soon rose and strolled away and as she strolled the thought came again to her that it was a truly dreadful thing to be a girl  having received no orders to the contrary matlack with his new assistant built and lighted the campfire some of the hermits took this as a matter of course and some were a little surprised but one by one they approached the evening air was beginning to be cool and the vicinity of the fire was undoubtedly the pleasantest place in camp soon they were all assembled but one and mrs archibald breathed freer when she found that arthur raybold was not there  i am delighted said corona as soon as she took her usual seat which was a campchair to see you all gather about the fire i was afraid that some of you might think that because we are hermits we must keep away from each other all the time but we must remember that we are associate hermits and so should come together occasionally i was going to say something to the effect that some of us may have misunderstood the true manner and intent of the assertions of our individualities but i do not now believe that this is necessary  do you mean by all that said mrs perkenpine that i cooked the supper  yes said miss raybold turning upon her guide with a pleasant smile that is what i referred to  well said mrs perkenpine i was told that if i didnt cook id be bounced it isnt my individdlety to cook for outsiders but it isnt my individdlety to be bounced nuther so i cooked is that bein a hermick  you have it cried mr archibald youve not only found out what you are but what you have to be your knowledge of yourself is perfect and now he continued isnt there somebody who can tell us a story when we are sitting around a campfire there is nothing better than stories bishop i dare say you have heard a good many in the course of your life dont you feel like giving us one  i think said corona that by the aid of stories it is possible to get a very good idea of ourselves for instance if some one were to tell a good historical story and any one of us should find himself or herself greatly interested in it then that person might discover on subsequent reflection some phase of his or her intellect which he or she might not have before noticed on the other hand if it should be a love story and some of us could not bear to hear it then we might also find out something about ourselves of which we had been ignorant but i really think that before making any tests of this sort we should continue the discussion of what is at present the main object of our livesselfknowledge and selfassertion in other words the emancipation of the individual as i have said before and as we all know there never was a better opportunity offered a group of people of mature minds to subject themselves free of outside influences to a thorough mental inquisition and then to exhibit the results of their selfexaminations to appreciative companions this last is very important if we do not announce to others what we are it is of scarcely any use to be anything i mean this of course in a limited sense  harriet said mr archibald abruptly do you remember where i left my pipe i do not like this cigar  on the shelf by the door of the cabin she replied i saw it as i came out  her husband immediately rose and left the fire corona paused in her discourse to wait until mr archibald came back but then as if she did not wish to lose the floor she turned towards the bishop who sat at a little distance from her and addressed herself to him with the idea of making some collateral remarks on what she had already said in order to fill up the time until mr archibald should return  mrs archibald thought that her husband had been a little uncivil but almost immediately after he had gone she too jumped up and without making any excuse whatever hurried after him  the reason for this sudden movement was that mrs archibald had seen some one approaching from the direction of camp roy she instantly recognized this person as arthur raybold and felt sure that unwilling to stay longer by himself he was coming to the campfire and if her husband should see him she knew there would be trouble what sort of trouble or how far it might extend she did not try to imagine  hector she said as soon as she was near enough for him to hear her dont go after the pipe let us take a moonlight walk along the shore i believe it is full moon tonight and we have not had a walk of that sort for ever so long  very good said her husband turning to her i shall be delighted i dont care for the pipe and the cigar would have been good enough if it had not been for the sermon that would spoil any pleasure i cant stand that young woman harriet i positively cannot  well then let us walk away and forget her said his wife i dont wonder she annoys you  if it were only the young woman thought mrs archibald as the two strolled away beneath the light of the moon we might manage it but her brother  at the next indication of a pause in coronas discourse the bishop suddenly stood on his feet i wonder he said if there is anything the matter with mrs archibald i will step over to her cabin to see  indeed said corona rising with great promptness i hope it is nothing serious i will go with you  margery was not a rude girl but she could not help a little laugh which she subdued as much as possible mr clyde who was sitting near her laughed also  there is nothing on earth the matter with aunt harriet said margery they didnt go into the cabin i saw them walking away down the shore  how would you like to walk that way he asked i think their example is a very good one  it is capital said margery jumping up and lets get away quickly before she comes back  they hurried away but they did not extend their walk down the lake shore even as far as mr and mrs archibald had already gone when they came to the bit of beach behind the clump of trees where the bishop had retired that afternoon to read they stopped and sat down to watch the moonlight on the water  matlack and mrs perkenpine were now the only persons at the campfire for bill hammond as was his custom had promptly gone to bed as soon as his work was done if arthur raybold had intended to come to the campfire he had changed his mind for he now stood near his sisters tent apparently awaiting the approach of corona and the bishop who had not found the archibalds and who were now walking together in what might have been supposed by people who did not know the lady to be an earnest dialogue  mr matlack was seated on his log and he smoked while mrs perkenpine sat on the ground her head thrown back and her arms hugging her knees  phil said she that there moon looks to me like an oyster with a candle behind it and as smooth and slippery as if i could jest swallow it down you may think it is queer for me to think such things as that phil but since ive come to know myself jest as i am me ive found out feelins  mrs perkenpine said matlack knocking the ashes out of his pipe theres a good many things besides moons that i cant swallow and if its all the same to you ill go to bed  well she exclaimed looking after him his individdlety is the snapshortest i ever did see i dont believe he wants to know hisself if he did im dead sure i could help him he never goes out to run a camp without somebody to help him and yet hes so everlastin blind he cant see the very best person there is to help him and she aplumpin herself square in front of him every time she gits a chance with that reflection she rose and walked away  i tell you harriet said mr archibald when he and his wife had returned from their walk and were about to enter the cabin something must be done to enable us to spend the rest of our time here in peace this is our camp and we want it for ourselves if a good companionable fellow like the bishop or that young clyde happens along it is all very well but we do not want all sorts of people forcing themselves upon us and i will not submit to it  of course we ought not to do that said she but i hope that whatever you do it will be something as pleasant as possible  i will try to avoid any unpleasantness said he and i hope i may do so but bytheway where is margery  i think she must be in bed said mrs archibald then stepping inside she called margery are you there  yes aunt harriet replied margery i am here  she must have found it dreadfully stupid poor girl said mr archibald  the lights were all out in the archibalds cabin and still miss raybold and the bishop walked up and down the open space at the farther end of the camp  corona exclaimed her brother suddenly appearing before them i have told you over and over again that i wish to speak to you are you never going to stop that everlasting preaching and give me a chance to talk to you  arthur she exclaimed sharply i wish you would not interrupt me in this way i had just begun to say  oh my dear miss raybold cried the bishop do not let me prevent you from speaking to your brother indeed it is growing late and i will not trespass longer on your time goodnight and with a bow he was gone  now just see what you have done said corona her eyeglasses brighter than the moon  well it is time he was going said her brother i have something very important to say to you i want your good offices in an affair more worthy of your thoughts than anything else at this moment  whatever it is she said turning away from him i do not want to hear it nownot a word of it you have displeased me arthur and i am going to my tent     chapter xxv  a moonlight interview   mrs archibald retired to her cabin but she did not feel in the least like going to bed her husband had long been asleep in his cot and she still sat by the side of the little window looking out upon the moonlighted scene but the beauty of the night if she noticed it at all gave her no pleasure her mind was harassed and troubled by many things chief among which was her husbands unfinished sentence in which he had said that he would try to avoid any unpleasantness but at the same time had intimated that if the unpleasant thing were forced upon him he was ready to meet it  now reason as she would mrs archibald could not banish from her mind the belief that arthur raybold would come to their camp some time during the next day in fact not having heard otherwise she supposed he had come to the campfire that night she was filled with anger and contempt for the young man who was determined to force himself on their party in this outrageous manner and considered it shameful that their peaceful life in these woods had been so wickedly disturbed no wonder she did not want to sleep no wonder she sat at the window thinking and thinking  presently she saw some one walking over the open space towards the cabin and she could not fail to recognize the figure with the long stride the folded arms and the bowed head he passed the window and then he turned and repassed it then he turned and walked by again this time a little nearer than before  this is too much said mrs archibald the next thing he will be tapping at her window i will go out and speak my mind to him  opening the door very softly and without even stopping to throw a shawl over her head and shoulders mrs archibald stepped outside into the night raybold was now at a little distance from the cabin in the direction of camp roy and was just about to turn when she hurried up to him  mr raybold she said speaking low and rapidly if you possessed a spark of gentlemanly feeling you would be ashamed to come into this camp when you have been ordered out of it my husband has told you he does not want you here and now i tell you that i do not want you here it pains me to be obliged to speak to any one in this manner but it is plain that no other sort of speech will affect you now sir i know your object and i will not have you wandering up and down here in front of our cabin i wish you to go to your own camp and that immediately  raybold stood and listened to her without a word until she had finished and then he said  madam there has been a good deal of talk about knowing ourselves and showing ourselves to others now i know myself very well indeed and i will show myself to you by saying that when my heart is interested i obey no orders i pay no attention to mandates of any sort until i can say what i have to say i will watch and i will wait but i shall not draw back  for the first time in fifteen years mrs archibald lost her temper she turned pale with anger you contemptible scoundrel go leave this camp instantly  he stood with arms folded and smiled at her saying nothing she trembled she was so angry but what could she do if she called mr archibald or if he should be awakened by any outcry she feared there would be bloodshed and if she went to call matlack mr archibald would be sure to be awakened but at this moment some one stepped up quickly behind raybold and with a hand upon his shoulder partly turned him around  i think said the bishop that i heard this lady tell you to go if so go  i did say it said mrs archibald hurriedly please be as quiet as you can but make him go  do you hear what mrs archibald says asked the bishop sternly depart or  do you mean to threaten me asked raybold  the bishop stepped close to him will you go of your own accord he asked or do you wish me to take you away  he spoke quietly but with an earnestness that impressed itself upon raybold who made a quick step backward he felt a natural repugnance especially in the presence of a lady to be taken away by this big man who in the moonlight seemed to be bigger than ever  i will speak to you said he when there are no ladies present and with this he retired  i am so much obliged to you said mrs archibald it was a wonderful piece of good fortune that you should have come at this minute  the bishop smiled i am delighted that i happened here he said i heard so much talking this evening that i thought i would tranquillize my mind by a quiet walk by myself before i went to bed and so i happened to see you and raybold of course i had no idea of intruding upon you but when i saw you stretch out your arm and say go i thought it was time for me to come  i feel bound to say to you said mrs archibald that that impertinent fellow is persisting in his attentions to miss dearborn and that mr archibald and i will not have it  i imagined that the discussion was on that subject said the bishop for mr clyde has intimated to me that raybold has been making himself disagreeable to the young lady  i do not know what we are going to do said mrs archibald reflectively there seems to be no way of making an impression upon him he is like his sisterhe will have his own way  yes said the bishop with a sigh he is like his sister but then one might thrash him but what can be done with her i tell you mrs archibald he said turning to her earnestly it is getting to be unbearable the whole evening ever since you left the campfire she has been talking to me on the subject of mental assimilationthat is the treatment of our ideas and thoughts as if they were articles of foodintellectual soda biscuit or plum pudding for instancein order to find out whether our minds can digest these things and produce from them the mental chyme and chyle necessary to our intellectual development the discourse was fortunately broken off for tonight but there is more of it for tomorrow i really cannot stand it  i wouldnt stand it said mrs archibald cant you simply go away and leave her when she begins in that way  the bishop shook his head no he said that is impossible when those beautiful eyes are fixed upon me i cannot go away they charm me and they hold me unless there is an interruption i must stay and listen the only safety for me is to fly from this camp at last he said smiling a little sadly i am going to go i did not want to do this until your camp broke up but i must  and you are really going tomorrow she asked  yes he said i have positively decided upon that  i am sorry to hear it she said goodnight  when mrs archibald entered her cabin she found her husband sleeping soundly and she again sat down by the window there was no such thing as sleep for her her mind was more tossed and troubled than it had been before she went out the fact that the bishop was going away made the matter worse for just as she had found out that he was willing to help her and that he might be able to keep raybold away from them without actual violencefor she saw that the young boaster was afraid of himhe had told her he must leave and in her heart she did not blame him with great fear and anxiety she looked forward to the morrow  it was about two oclock when mrs archibald suddenly arose from her seat by the window and lighted a candle then she pulled down the shades of the windows front and back after which she went to her husbands cot and put her hand upon his shoulder  hector said she wake up  in a moment mr archibald was staring at her what is the matter he exclaimed are you sick  no said she but i have something very important to say to you i want you to get up and go away with me and take margery  mr archibald sat up in bed he was now in full possession of his senses what said he elope and where to  yes said she that is exactly what i mean and we will go to sadlers first and then home  do you mean now said he  yesthat is as soon as it is light she replied  are you positively sure you are awake harriet asked mr archibald  awake she said i have not been asleep tonight dont you see i am dressed and she drew a chair to the bedside and sat down i know more about what is going on than you do hector she said and i tell you if we stay any longer in this camp there is going to be great trouble that young raybold pays no attention to what you said about keeping away from us he comes here when he pleases and he says he intends to come i asked you to take a walk with me this evening because i saw him coming to the campfire and i knew that you would resent it tonight i saw him walking up and down in front of our cabin and i believe he intended to try to speak to margery i went out to him myself and he was positively insulting if the bishop had not happened to come up i believe he would have stayed here and defied me but he made him go  now that you know this hector it is very certain that there will be trouble between you and that young man and i do not want that and besides that there is his sister she is as determined to preach as he is to speak to margery the bishop says he cant stand her any longer and he is going away tomorrow and that will make it all the worse for usespecially for you hector i cannot endure this state of things it has made me so nervous i cannot get to sleep and besides it is not right for us to keep margery where she must be continually guarded from such a man now it may seem foolish to run away but i have thought over the matter for hours and hours and it is the only thing to do and what is more it is very easy to do if we announce that we are going we will all go and the chief cause of quarrels and danger will go with us i know you hector you will not stand his impertinence  it will be daylight between three and four oclock and we three can start out quietly and have a pleasant walk to sadlers it is only four miles and we can take our time we need not carry anything with us but what we choose to put in our pockets we can pack our bags and leave them here and mr sadler will send for them when we get there we can go to bed if we like and have time enough for a good sleep before breakfast and then we can take the morning stage and leave this place and everybody in it now please dont be hasty and tell me all this is foolish remember if you stay here you have a quarrel on your hands and i shall have hours of misery until that quarrel is settled and no matter how it is settled things will be disagreeable afterwards  harriet said mr archibald suddenly twisting himself so that he sat on the side of the bed your idea is a most admirable one it suits me exactly let us run away it is impossible for us to do anything better than that have you told margery  no she answered but i will go to her at once  be quick and quiet then said her husband who had now entered fully into the spirit of the adventure nobody must hear us i will dress and then we will pack  margery said mrs archibald after three times shaking the sleeping girl you must get up your uncle and i are going away and you must go with us  margery turned her great eyes on mrs archibald but asked no questions  yes said mrs archibald we cannot stay in this camp any longer on account of mr raybold and various other things matters have come to a crisis and we must go and more than that we must slip away so that the others may not go with us  when asked margery now speaking for the first time  as soon as it is daylight  so soon as that said the girl a shadow on her brow which was very plain in the light of the candle which mrs archibald had brought with her surely not before breakfast  margery said mrs archibald a little sharply you do not seem to understandyou are not awake we must start as soon as it is light but we cannot discuss it now we are going and you must go with us you must get up and pack your things in your bag which we shall send for  suddenly a light came into margerys eyes and she sat up all right said she i will be ready as soon as you are it will be jolly to run away especially so early in the morning and with that she jumped out of bed     chapter xxvi  an elopement   a little more than an hour after mrs archibald had made known her project to her husband the three inhabitants of the cabin stole softly out into the delicate light of the early dawn  mr archibald had thought of leaving a note for matlack but his wife had dissuaded him she was afraid that the wrong person might get hold of it  when we are safely at sadlers she said we can send for our bags with a note to matlack it will not matter then who knows she had a firm belief in the power of the burly keeper of the inn to prevent trouble on his premises  with careful but rapid steps the little party passed along the open portion of the camp keeping as far as possible from the tent wherein reposed corona and mrs perkenpine and soon reached the entrance of the wood road here it was not quite so light as in the open but still they could make their way without much trouble and after a few minutes walking they felt perfectly safe from observation and slackening their pace they sauntered along at their ease  the experience was a novel one to all of them even mr archibald had never been in the woods so early in the morning in fact under these great trees it could scarcely be said to be morning the young light which made its uncertain way through the foliage was barely strong enough to cast a shadow and although these woodland wanderers knew that it was a roadway in which they were walking that great trees stood on each side of them with branches reaching out over their heads and that there were bushes and vines and here and there a mosscovered rock or a fallen tree they saw these things not clearly and distinctly but as through a veil but there was nothing uncertain about the air they breathed full of the moist aroma of the woods it was altogether different from the noonday odors of the forest  stronger and stronger grew the morning light and more and more clearly perceptible became the greens the browns and the grays about them now the birds began to chatter and chirp and squirrels ran along the branches of the trees while a young rabbit bounced out from some bushes and went bounding along the road this early morning life was something they had not seen in their camp for it was all over before they began their day there was a spring by the roadside which they had noticed when they had come that way before and when they reached it they sat down and ate some biscuit which mrs archibald had brought with her and drank cool water from mr archibalds folding pocketcup  the loveliness of the scene the novelty of the experience the feeling that they were getting away from unpleasant circumstances and in a perfectly original and independent fashion gave them all high spirits even mrs archibald whose sleepless night might have been supposed to interfere with this morning walk declared herself as fresh as a lark and stated that she knew now why a lark or any other thing that got up early in the morning should be fresh  they had not left the spring far behind them when they heard a rustling in the woods to the right of the road and the next moment there sprang out into the open not fifty feet in front of them a fullgrown red deer they were so startled by this apparition that they all stopped as if the beautiful creature had been a lion in their path for an instant it turned its great brown eyes upon them and then with two bounds it plunged into the underbrush on the other side of the road mrs archibald and margery had never before seen a deer in the woods  the young girl clapped her hands it all reminds me of my first night at the opera she cried  two or three times they rested and they never walked rapidly so it was after five oclock when the little party emerged into the open country and approached the inn not a soul was visible about the premises but as they knew that some one soon would be stirring they seated themselves in three armchairs on the wide piazza to rest and wait  peter sadler was an early riser and when the front hall door was open he appeared thereat rolling his wheeled chair out upon the piazza with a bumpthough not with very much of a bump for the house was built to suit him and his chair but he did not take his usual morning roll upon the piazza for turning his head he beheld a gentleman and two ladies fast asleep in three great wicker chairs  upon my soul he exclaimed if they aint the camp robbers at this exclamation they all awoke  ten minutes after that the tale had been told and if the right arm of mr sadlers chair had not been strong and heavy it would have been shivered into splinters  as usual cried the stalwart peter the wrong people ran away if i had seen that bicycle man and his party come running out of the woods i should have been much better satisfied and i should have thought you had more spirit in you sir than i gave you credit for  oh you mistake my husband altogether cried mrs archibald the trouble with him is that he has too much spirit and that is the reason i brought him away  and there is another thing exclaimed margery you should not say mr raybold and his party he was the only one of them who behaved badly  that is true said mrs archibald his sister is somewhat obtrusive but she is a lady gentle and polite and it would have been very painful to her and as painful to us had it been necessary forcibly to eject her brother from our camp it was to avoid all this that we  eloped interjected mr archibald  illustration if they aint the camp robbers  the good peter laughed perhaps you are right said he but i shall have a word with that bicycle fellow when he comes this way you are an original party if there ever was one first you go on somebody elses weddingjourney and then you elope in the middle of the night and now the best thing you can do is to go to bed you can have a good sleep and a nineoclock breakfast and i do not see why you should leave here for two or three days  oh we must go this morning said mrs archibald quickly we must go we really cannot wait until any of those people come here it makes me nervous to think about it  very good then said peter the coach starts for the train at eleven  mrs archibald was a systematic woman and was in the habit of rising at halfpast seven and when that hour arrived she awoke as if she had been asleep all night going to the window to see what sort of a day it was which was also her custom she looked out upon the lawn in front of the house and her jaw dropped and her eyes opened there she beheld margery and mr clyde strolling along in close converse for a moment she was utterly stupefied  what can this mean she thought how could they have missed us so soon we are seldom out of our cabin before eight oclock i cannot comprehend it and then a thought came to her which made her face grow pale is it possible she said to herself that any of the others have come i must go immediately and find out  in ten minutes she had dressed and quietly left the room  when margery saw mrs archibald descending the piazza steps she left mr clyde and came running to meet her  i expect you are surprised to see me here she said but i intended to tell you and uncle archibald as soon as you came down you see i did not at all want to go away and not let mr clyde know what had become of me and so after i had packed my bag i wrote a little note to him and put it in a biscuitbox under a stone not far from my window which we had arranged for a postoffice just the day before  a postoffice cried mrs archibald  yes said margery of course there wasnt any need for oneat least we did not suppose there would bebut we thought it would be nice for you must know we are engaged  what cried mrs archibald engaged impossible what are you talking about  yes said margery we are really engaged and it was absolutely necessary under ordinary circumstances this would not have happened so soon but as things were it could not be delayed mr clyde thought the matter over very carefully and he decided that the only way to keep me from being annoyed and frightened by mr raybold was for him to have the right to defend me if he told mr raybold i was engaged to him that of course would put an end to the young mans attentions we were engaged only yesterday so we havent had any time to tell anybody but we intended to do it today beginning with you and uncle archibald harrison came over early to the postoffice hoping to find some sort of a note and he was wonderfully astonished when he read what was in the one i put there i told him not to say anything to anybody and he didnt but he started off for sadlers immediately and came almost on a run he says he was so afraid i might go away before he saw me  margery exclaimed the elder lady tears coming into her eyes as she spoke i am grieved and shocked beyond expression what can i say to my husband what can i say to your mother from the bottom of my heart i wish we had not brought you with us but how could i dream that all this trouble would come of it  it is indeed a very great pity said margery that mr clyde and i could not have been engaged before we went into camp then mr raybold would have had no reason to bother me and i should have had no trouble with martin  martin cried mrs archibald what of him  oh he was in love with me too replied the young girl and we had talks about it and i sent him away he was really a young man far above his station and was doing the things he did simply because he wanted to study nature but of course i could not consider him at all  and that was the reason he left us exclaimed mrs archibald upon my word it is amazing  yes said margery and dont you see aunt harriet how many reasons there were why mr clyde and i should settle things definitely and become engaged now there need be no further trouble with anybody  distressed as she was mrs archibald could not refrain from smiling no further trouble she said i think you would better wait until mr archibald and your mother have heard this story before you say that  mr archibald was dressing for breakfast when his wife told him of margerys engagement and the announcement caused him to twirl around so suddenly that he came very near breaking a lookingglass with his hairbrush he made a dash for his coat i will see him he said and his eyes sparkled in a way which indicated that they could discover a malefactor without the aid of spectacles  stop said his wife standing in his way dont go to them when you are angry we have just got out of trouble and dont let us jump into it again if they are really and truly engagedand i am sure they arewe have no authority to break it off and the less you say the better what we must do is to take her immediately to her mother and let her settle the matter as best she can if she knows her daughter as well as i do i am sure she will acquit us of all blame  mr archibald was very indignant and said a great deal but his wife was firm in her counsel to avoid any hard words or bad feeling in a matter over which they had now no control  well said he at last i will pass over the whole affair to mrs dearborn but i hope i may eat my breakfast without seeing them whatever happens i need a good meal  when mr archibald came out of the breakfastroom his mind considerably composed by hot rolls and coffee he met margery in the hall  dear uncle archibald she exclaimed i have been waiting and waiting for you i hope you are not angry please be as kind to us as you can and remember it was just the same with us as it was with you and aunt harriet you would not have run away from the camp in the middle of the night if you could have helped it and we should not have been engaged so suddenly if we could have helped it but we all had to do what we did on account of the conduct of others and as it is settled now i think we ought all to try to be as happy as we can and forget our troubles here is harrison and he and i both pray from the bottom of our hearts that you will shake hands with him i know you always liked him for you have said so and now we are both going to mother to tell her all about it  both said mr archibald  yes said margery we must go together otherwise mother would know nothing about him and i should be talking to no purpose but we are going to do everything frankly and openly and go straight to her and put our happiness in her hands  mr archibald looked at her steadfastly such ingenuousness he said presently is overpowering mr clyde how do you do do you think it is going to be a fine day  the young man smiled i think it is going to be a fine lifetime said he  the party was gathered together on the piazza ready to take the coach the baggage had arrived from the camp in a cart but phil matlack had not come with it as he remained to take down his tent and settle affairs generally they were all sorry not to see him again for he had proved himself a good man and a good guide but when grownup married people elope before daybreak something must be expected to go wrong hearty and substantial remembrances were left for him and kind words of farewell for the bishop and even for miss corona when she should appear  peter sadler was loath to part with his guests you are more interesting now than ever you were he said and i want to hear all about that hermit business youve just barely mentioned it  my dear sir said mr archibald with a solemn visage sooner or later miss corona raybold will present herself at this inn on her way home if you want to know anything about her plan to assist human beings to assert their individualities it will only be necessary to mention the fact to her  goodbye then said peter shaking hands with mr and mrs archibald i dont know what outoftheway thing you two will do next but whatever it is i hope it will bring you here     chapter xxvii  mrs perkenpine delights the bishop   it was the bishop who first appreciated the fact that a certain air of loneliness had descended upon the shore of the lake he had prepared breakfast at his camp but as mr clyde did not make his appearance he went to camp rob to look for him there he saw matlack and his assistant busy in their kitchen tent and mrs perkenpine was also engaged in culinary matters he had left arthur raybold asleep at camp roy but of the ladies and gentleman who were usually visible at the breakfasthour at camp rob he saw no signs and he approached mrs perkenpine to inquire for clyde at his question the sturdy woman turned and smiled it was a queer smile reminding the bishop of the opening and shutting of a farm gate  hes a oneer said she do you suppose he could ketch a rabbit no matter how fast he ran  come now said the bishop he wasnt trying to do that  he was either doin that or else he was runnin away i seed him early this mornini wasnt up but i was lookin roundand i thought from the way he was actin that hed set a rabbittrap and was goin to see if hed caught anything and pretty soon i seed him runnin like sam hill as if his rabbit had got away from him but perhaps it wasnt that and maybe somebody skeered him anyway hes clean gone  the bishop stood and reflected the affair looked serious clyde was a practical sensible fellowand he was gone why did he go  have you seen any of the archibalds yet he asked  no said she i guess theyre not up yet though its late for them my young woman aint up nuther but it aint late for her  the bishop walked slowly towards the cabin and regarded it earnestly after a few minutes inspection he stepped up to the door and knocked then he knocked again and again and hearing nothing from within he became alarmed and ran to matlack  hello he cried something has happened to your people or they have gone away come to the cabin quick  in less than a minute matlack the bishop and bill hammond were at the cabin and the unfastened door was opened wide no one was in the house that was plain enough but on the floor were four bags packed for transportation  matlack looked about him and then he laughed all right said he there aint no need of worryin ourselves they havent left a thing of theirs about everythings packed up and ready to be sent for when people do that you may be sure nothings happened to them theyve gone off and i bet its to get rid of that young womans preachin but i dont blame them i dont wonder they couldnt stand it  the bishop made no reply remembering his recent conversation with mrs archibald he believed that if they had quietly gone away there was a better reason for it than miss raybolds fluency of expression it was possible that something might have happened after he had retired from the scene the night before for when he went to sleep raybold was still walking up and down in the moonlight  his mind was greatly disturbed they were gone and he was left what are you going to do he asked matlack  nothin just now said the guide if they dont send for their things pretty soon ill go over to sadlers and find out whats the matter but theyre all right look how careful them bags is strapped up  the bishop left the cabin and walked thoughtfully away in the direction of camp roy in two minutes he had made up his mind he would eat his breakfasthe could not travel upon an empty stomachand then he would depart that was imperative  when he reached the camp he found that raybold had risen and was pouring out for himself a bowl of coffee seeing the bishop approach the young mans face grew dark as might have been expected from the events of the night before and he hurriedly placed some articles of food upon a plate and was about leaving the stove when the bishop reached him raybold turned with a frown and what was meant to be a glare  i shall bide my time said he and with his coffee and his plate he retired to a distance  the bishop smiled but made no answer and sat down and ate his meal in peace then he prepared to depart he had nothing but a little bag and it did not take long to put in order the simple culinary department of the camp when all was done he stood for some minutes thinking there was a path through the woods which led to the road so that he might go on to sadlers without the knowledge of any one at camp rob but he felt that he ought to see matlack and tell him that he was going if anything went wrong at camp roy he did not wish to be held responsible for it mr archibald could afford to go away without saying anything about it but he could not and besides if he should happen to see miss raybold it would be far more gentlemanly to tell her that he was going and to bid her goodbye than to slip off through the woods like a tramp he would go that he was determined upon but he would go like a man  when he reached camp rob the first person he saw was miss raybold standing near her tent with a roll of paper in her hand the moment she perceived him she walked rapidly towards him  goodmorning she said did you know that the archibalds had gone i never was so amazed in all my life i was eating my breakfast when a man and a cart drove up to their cabin and mrs perkenpine running to see what this meant soon came back and told me that the family of three had departed in the night and had sent this cart for their baggage i think this was a very uncivil proceeding and i do not in the least understand it can you imagine any reason for this extremely uncourteous action  the bishop could imagine reasons but he did not care to state them  it may be he said with a smile that they discovered that their natures demanded hotel beds instead of camp cots and that they immediately departed in obedience to the mandates of their individualities  but in so doing said miss raybold they violated the principles of association our scheme included mutual confidence as well as selfinvestigation and assertion i must admit that mr archibald disappointed me i think he misunderstood my project by holding ones self entirely aloof from humanity one encourages selfignorance but perhaps our party was somewhat too largethe elements too many and inharmoniousand i see no reason why we who remain should relinquish our purpose i believe it will be easier for us to become truly ourselves than when our number was greater and so i propose that we make no change whatever in our plans that we live on for the time agreed upon exactly as if the archibalds were here and now if you have a few minutes to spare i would like to read you something i wrote this morning before i left my tent i was awake during the night and thought for a long time upon the subject of mental assimilation the discussion of which we did not finish last evening and this morning while my thoughts were fresh i put them upon paper and now i would like to read them to you isnt there some shady place where we might sit down there are two campchairs will you kindly place them under this tree  the bishop sighed but he went for the chairs it would be too hard for him to tell her he was going to leave the camp and he would not try to do it he would slip off as soon as he had a chance and leave a note for her she would not perhaps like that but it was the best he could do  the reading of the paper occupied at least half an hour and when it was finished and corona had begun to make some remarks on a portion of it which she had not fully elaborated mrs perkenpine approached and stood before her  well miss said she im off  miss raybold fixed her eyeglasses upon her what do you mean she asked  im goin back to sadlers she replied phils goin and im goin hes jest told me that the carts comin back for the kitchen fixins and his things and him and bill hammond is goin to sadlers with it and if he goes i goes  this speech had a very different effect upon its two hearers corona was as nearly angry as her selfcontained nature would permit but although he did not allow his feelings to betray him the bishop was delighted now they must all go and that suited him exactly  it is a positive and absolute breach of contract exclaimed miss raybold you agreed to remain in my service during my stay in camp and you have no right to go away now no matter who else may depart  mrs perkenpine grinned that sort of thing was all very well a week ago said she but it wont work now ive been goin to school to myself pretty steady and ive kept myself in a good deal too for not knowin my lessons and ive drummed into me a pretty good idea of what i be and i can tell you im not a woman as stays here when phil matlacks gone im not a bit scary but i never stayed in camp yet with all greenhorns but me when i find myself in that sort of a mess its my nater to get out of it phil says hes goin to start the fust thing this afternoon and thats the time im goin and so if you would like to go you can send word by that man in the cart to have you and your things sent for and we can all clear out together  positively exclaimed corona turning to the bishop this is the most highhanded proceeding i ever heard of  thats xactly what i think said mrs perkenpine it most takes my breath away to think how highhanded i am before i knowed myself i couldnt have been that way to save my skin there didnt use to be any individdlety about me you might take a quart of huckleberries and ask yourself what it was particular bout any one of them huckleberriesxceptin it might be green and its a long time since i was that wayand youd know jest as much about that huckleberry as i knowed about myself now its different its just the same as if there was only one huckleberry in a quart box and it aint no trouble to see all around that  i think miss raybold said the bishop that this good woman has prosecuted her psychical researches with more effect than any of us  bosh exclaimed miss raybold do you really think i must leave this camp at the dictation of that person  scuse me said mrs perkenpine but im goin to scratch things together for movin well have dinner here and then well pack up and be off as soon as the carts come thats what phil says hes goin to do  with a satisfied mind and internal gratitude to mrs perkenpine who had made everything easy for him the bishop endeavored to make corona feel that as her departure from the camp was inevitable it would be well not to disturb her mind too much about it but it was of no use trying to console the lady  it is too bad she said it is humiliating here i believed that i was truly myself that i was an independent entity that i was free to assert my individual nature and to obey its impulses and now i find that i am nothing but the slave of a female guide actually i must obey her and i must conform to her  it is true said the bishop musingly that although we may discover ourselves and be greatly pleased with the prospect of what we see we may not be permitted to enter into its enjoyment and must content ourselves with looking over the fence and longing for what we see  corona faintly smiled when we have climbed high enough to see over that fence she said it becomes our duty to break it down  when i was in england said the bishop i saw a fencean oak fencewhich they told me had stood for four hundred years it looked awfully tough and it now reminds me of some of the manners and customs of civilization  when you were in england said corona did you visit newnham college  he never had but she told him that she had been there for two years and now she continued there may be time enough before i must pack up my effects to finish what i was going to say to you about approximate assimilations     chapter xxviii  the hermits continue to favor association   when the archibald party reached the capital city of their state the four of them took a carriage and drove immediately to the dearborn residence margery had insisted that mr clyde should go with them so that he and she should present themselves together before her parents in no other way did she believe that the subject could be properly presented the archibalds did not object to this plan in fact under the circumstances they were in favor of it during the journey young clyde had produced a very favorable impression upon them they had always liked him well enough and now that they examined his character more critically they could not fail to see that he was a kindhearted gentlemanly young man intelligent and well educated and according to private information from margery his family was of the best  arrived at the dearborn door they found the house in the possession of one female servant who informed them that mr dearborn was in canada on a fishing expedition that mrs dearborn had gone to attend some sort of a congress at saratoga and that she did not expect to be at home until the following friday three days after which was the day on which she had expected her daughter to be brought back to her this was disheartening and the four stood upon the steps irresolute margery ought to go to her mother but neither of the archibalds wished to go to saratoga nor could they despatch thither the prematurely betrothed couple  i know what we must do said mrs archibald we must go home  but my dear said her husband we agreed to stay away for a month and the month is not yet up  it doesnt matter said she kate and her husband will take us in for the few days left when we explain all that we have gone through she will not be hardhearted enough to make us go to a hotel until friday margery can come with us  margery turned upon mrs archibald a pair of eyes filled with earnest inquiry  i know what you want said mrs archibald no he can go to a hotel in the town and i shall write to your mother to come to us as soon as she returns then you two can present yourselves together according to your plans there is no use talking about it hector it is the only thing we can do  we shall break our word to the newly married said her husband isnt there a state law against that  when we made that arrangement said his wife going down the steps we did not know our individual selves now we do and the case is different kate will understand all that when i explain it to her  they drove back to the station and took a train for home  mr and mrs bringhurst were sitting in the cool library about nine oclock that evening he was reading while she was listening and they were greatly astonished when they heard a carriage drive up to the front door during their domestic honeymoon they had received no visitors and they looked at each other and wondered  it is a mistake said he but dont trouble yourself mary has not gone to bed and she will hear the bell  but there was no bell the door was opened and in came father and mother followed by a strange young couple  it is wonderful exclaimed kate when at last everybody had been embraced or introduced a dozen times during the last week have we talked about the delight it would give us if our father and mother could be here to be entertained a little while as our guests in our own housefor you gave it to us for a month you know but we refrained from sending you an invitation because we did not want to cut off your holiday and now you are here the good fairies could not have arranged the matter better  when all the tales had been told when the assertion of individuality and the plans of hermit association had been described and discussed and the young bringhursts had told how they too without knowing it had been associate hermits devoting their time not to the discovery of their own natures but of the nature of each other and how perfectly satisfied they had been with the results it was very late and young clyde was not allowed to go out into the darkness to find a hotel  it was on thursday afternoon that mrs dearborn arrived at the archibalds house the letter she had received had made her feel that she could not wait until the end of the congress  now mother said margery when the two were alone together you have seen him and you have talked to him and uncle hector has told you how he went to the office of glassborough  clyde and found he was really their nephew and all about him and his family and you have been told precisely why it was necessary that we should engage ourselves so abruptly on account of the violent nature of mr raybold and the trouble he might cause not only to us but to dear aunt harriet and uncle archibald and now we come just like two of your own children and put the whole matter entirely into your hands and leave you to decide out of your own heart exactly when and where we shall be married and all about it then when father comes home you can tell him just what you have decided to do you are our parents and we leave it to you  what in the world said mrs dearborn an hour later when she was talking to the two married ladies of the household can one do with a girl like that i do not believe dynamite would blow them apart and if i thought it would i should not know how to manage it  no said mrs archibald i am afraid the explosion would be as bad for you as it would be for them  dont try it said mrs kate i take a great interest in that budding bit of felicity i consider it an outgrowth of our own marriage and honeymoon when we sent out that wild couple my father and mother on a weddingtour we did not dream that they would bring back to us a pair of lovers who never would have been lovers if it had not been for us and who are now ready for a weddingtour on their own account as soon as circumstances may permit and so feeling a little right and privilege in the matter i am going to ask you mrs dearborn to let them be married here whenever the weddingday shall come and let them start out from this house on their marriage career now dont you think that would be a fine plan i am sure your daughter will like it when she remembers what she owes us and if mr clyde objects i will undertake to make him change his mind  when the plan was proposed in full counsel it was found that there would be no need for the exercise of mrs kates powers of persuasion                                                   about ten days after mrs dearborn and margery had returned to their home and clyde had followed to move like a satellite in an orbit determined by mrs dearborn mr archibald was surprised but also very much pleased to receive a visit from the bishop  i could not refrain said that expansive individual from coming to you as soon as circumstances would allow and while expressing to you the great obligations under which you have placed me to confide to you my plans and my prospects you have been so good to me that i believe you will be pleased to know of the life work to which i have determined to devote myself  i am glad to hear said the other that you have made plans but you owe nothing to me  excuse me said the bishop but i do this suit of clothes sir is the foundation of my fortunes  and well earned said mr archibald but we will say no more about that have you secured a position tell me about yourself  i have a position said the bishop but would you prefer that i tell you of that first or begin at the beginning and briefly relate to you what has happened since i saw you last  oh begin at the beginning by all means said mr archibald i was sorry to be obliged to leave you all so unceremoniously and i greatly desire to know what happened after we left  very good then said the bishop i will give you our history in as few words as i can on the afternoon after your departure we all went to sadlersthat is miss raybold and myself and the three guides for raybold when he heard that miss dearborn and mr clyde had gone immediately left for sadlers hoping i think to find you all there from what i heard i think he and peter sadler must have had words at any rate he discovered that his case was hopeless and he had himself driven to the station in a carriage not choosing to wait until our arrival i have since heard that he has determined to relinquish the law and devote himself to the dramatic arts  for some reason or other peter sadler was very glad to see me and congratulated me heartily on the favorable change in my appearance he called me his favorite tramp and invited me to stop at his hotel for a time but i consented to stay a few days only for i felt i must go to see the gentleman to whom i wished to engage myself as librarian before my new clothes had lost their freshness miss raybold arranged to stay at sadlers for a week she liked the place and as she had planned to remain away from home for a fortnight she did not wish to return before the time fixed upon there were a good many people at sadlers but none of them seemed to interest her she decidedly preferred to talk to sadler or to me but although peter is a jolly fellow and had some lively conversations with her he does not seem to care for protracted mental intercourse and it became so plain to me that she depended upon me in so large a degree for companionship and intellectual stimulus that i did not leave as soon as i intended it was on wednesday in fact that i steeled my heart and told her that i must positively depart early the following morning or i could not expect to reach my destination before the end of the week it was that evening however that we became engaged to be married  what cried mr archibald did you dare to propose yourself to that classic being  no replied the other i cannot with exactness say that i did it would be difficult indeed for me to describe the manner in which we arrived at this most satisfactory conclusion miss raybold is a mistress of expression and without moving a hairsbreadth beyond the lines of maidenly reserve which always environ her she made me aware not only that i desired to propose marriage to her but that it would be well for me to do so there were objections to this course which as an honest man i could not refrain from laying before her and with my proposition i stated these objections but they were overruled to my entire satisfaction and she consented to become mrs bishop  mrs bishop said the other inquiringly  oh yes bishop is my namehenry c bishop it was this name which suggested the title which was playfully given to me before our compact was made i had told miss raybold all about my family she did not ask me to do so but i knew she desired the information for i had learned to read those beautiful eyes  but said mr archibald how about your position did you get the place as librarian  no said the other i did not ask for it the question of my vocation has been settled most admirably there never was a human being more frank more straightforward and pertinent than miss raybold she knows what she wants and she makes her plans to get it with regard to means she is sufficiently endowed but the life work to which she has devoted herself is far more than she can ever accomplish alone she needs the constant assistance of a sympathetic and appreciative nature and that i am happy to say i am able to give to her and were i to devote myself to any other calling which would interfere with that assistance i should be doing her a positive wrong therefore should i state it in definite words i should say that i am to become my wifes private secretary that is my position and it suits me admirably and i may add that corona assures me that she is thoroughly well pleased we are to be married in the fall and i hope it will not be long before we shall have the pleasure of meeting again our former companions of the hermit camp  bytheway said mr archibald as his visitor was about to leave tell me something of matlack i had a great liking for our guide  all that i can tell you is this said mr bishop smiling not long after we arrived at sadlers he went to peter and asked him if he intended to send out a camping party to any considerable distance it so happened that a couple of gentlemen were going to a point on the very limits of sadlers jurisdiction and with them matlack petitioned to go although another guide had been appointed i made inquiries and found that for some reason probably connected with the persistencies of the female sex matlack had become a sort of daniel boone and wanted to go away as far as possible from his kind  i hope said mr archibald that our example has not made a real hermit of him goodbye i am very sorry that mrs archibald is not at home but in both our names i wish you and your future wife the best of good fortunes  father exclaimed mrs kate when she heard of this interview now you must grant me one more favor here is another pair of lovers who owe everything to our honeymoon and your weddingtour we ought to know them for we made them what they are so let us invite them here and let them be married from this house i do not believe miss raybold has a proper home of her own and in any case the only way they can pay us what they owe us is to give us the pleasure of seeing them wedded here  mr archibald rose to his feet no madam said he i am willing to a certain extent to make this house a source of hymeneal felicity but i draw the line at the bishop i do not intend that my home shall become a matrimonial factory  the end     by maria louise pool  the redbridge neighborhood   illustrated by clifford carleton 1 50  in
