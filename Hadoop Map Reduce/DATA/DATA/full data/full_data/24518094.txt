andrea de mancini sprawled ingloriously drunk upon the floor his legs were thrust under the table and his head rested against the chair from which he had slipped his long black hair was tossed and dishevelled his handsome boyish face flushed and garbed in the vacant expression of idiocy  i beg a thousand pardons m de luynes quoth he in the thick monotonous voice of a man whose brain but ill controls his tonguei beg a thousand pardons for the unseemly poverty of our repast t is no fault of mine my lord cardinal keeps a most unworthy table for me faugh uncle giulio is a hebrewif not by birth by instinct he carries his pursestrings in a knot which it would break his heart to unfasten but there some day my lord cardinal will go to heavento the lap of abraham i shall be rich then vastly rich and i shall bid you to a banquet worthy of your most noble blood the cardinals healthperdition have him for the niggardliest rogue unhung  i pushed back my chair and rose the conversation was taking a turn that was too unhealthy to be pursued within the walls of the palais mazarin where there existed albeit the law books made no reference to it the heinous crime of lèseeminencea crime for which more men had been broken than it pleases me to dwell on  your table master andrea needs no apology i answered carelessly your wine for instance is beyond praise  ah yes the wine but ciel monsieur he ejaculated for a moment opening wide his heavy eyelids do you believe t was mazarin provided it pooh t was a present made me by m de la motte who seeks my interest with my lord cardinal to obtain for him an appointment in his eminences household and thus thinks to earn my good will hes a pestilent creature this la motte he added with a hiccougha pestilent creature but sangdieu his wine is good and ill speak to my uncle help me up de luynes help me up i say i would drink the health of this provider of wines  i hurried forward but he had struggled up unaided and stood swaying with one hand on the table and the other on the back of his chair in vain did i remonstrate with him that already he had drunk overmuch  t is a lie he shouted may not a gentleman sit upon the floor from choice  to emphasise his protestation he imprudently withdrew his hand from the chair and struck at the air with his open palm that gesture cost him his balance he staggered toppled backward and clutched madly at the tablecloth as he fell dragging glasses bottles dishes tapers and a score of other things besides with a deafening crash on to the floor  then as i stood aghast and alarmed wondering who might have overheard the thunder of his fall the fool sat up amidst the ruins and filled the room with his shrieks of drunken laughter  silence boy i thundered springing towards him silence or we shall have the whole house about our ears  and truly were my fears well grounded for before i could assist him to rise i heard the door behind me open apprehensively i turned and sickened to see that that which i had dreaded most was come to pass a tall imposing figure in scarlet robes stood erect and scowling on the threshold and behind him his valet bernouin bearing a lighted taper  mancinis laugh faded into a tremulous cackle then died out and with gaping mouth and glassy eyes he sat there staring at his uncle  thus we stayed in silence while a man might count mayhap a dozen then the cardinals voice rang harsh and full of anger  t is thus that you fulfil your trust m de luynes he said  your eminence i began scarce knowing what i should say when he cut me short  i will deal with you presently and elsewhere he stepped up to andrea and surveyed him for a moment in disgust get up sir he commanded get up  the lad sought to obey him with an alacrity that merited a kinder fate had he been in less haste perchance he had been more successful as it was he had got no farther than his knees when his right leg slid from under him and he fell prone among the shattered tableware mumbling curses and apologies in a breath  mazarin stood gazing at him with an eye that was eloquent in scorn then bending down he spoke quickly to him in italian what he said i know not being ignorant of their mother tongue but from the fierceness of his utterance ill wager my soul t was nothing sweet to listen to when he had done with him he turned to his valet  bernouin said he summon m de mancinis servant and assist him to get my nephew to bed m de luynes be good enough to take bernouins taper and light me back to my apartments  unsavoury as was the task i had no choice but to obey and to stalk on in front of him candle in hand like an acolyte at notre dame and in my heart the profound conviction that i was about to have a bad quarter of an hour with his eminence nor was i wrong for no sooner had we reached his cabinet and the door had been closed than he turned upon me the full measure of his wrath  you miserable fool he snarled did you think to trifle with the trust which in a misguided moment i placed in you think you that when a week ago i saved you from starvation to clothe and feed you and give you a lieutenancy in my guards i should endure so foul an abuse as this think you that i entrusted m de mancinis training in arms to you so that you might lead him into the dissolute habits which have dragged you down to what you areto what you were before i rescued youto what you will be tomorrow when i shall have again abandoned you  hear me your eminence i cried indignantly t is no fault of mine some fool hath sent m de mancini a basket of wine and  and you showed him how to abuse it he broke in harshly you have taught the boy to become a sot in time were he to remain under your guidance i make no doubt but that he would become a gamester and a duellist as well i was mad perchance to give him into your care but i have the good fortune to be still in time before the mischief has sunk farther to withdraw him from it and to cast you back into the kennel from which i picked you  your eminence does not mean  as god lives i do he cried you shall quit the palais royal this very night m de luynes and if ever i find you unbidden within half a mile of it i will do that which out of a misguided sense of compassion i do not do nowi will have you flung into an oubliette of the bastille where better men than you have rotted before today per dio do you think that i am to be fooled by such a thing as you  does your eminence dismiss me i cried aghast and scarce crediting that such was indeed the extreme measure upon which he had determined  have i not been plain enough he answered with a snarl  i realised to the full my unenviable position and with the realisation of it there overcame me the recklessness of him who has played his last stake at the tables and lost that recklessness it was that caused me to shrug my shoulders with a laugh i was a soldier of fortuneor should i say a soldier of misfortuneas rich in vice as i was poor in virtue a man who lived by the steel and parried the blows that came as best he might or parried them not at allbut never quailed  as your eminence pleases i answered coolly albeit methinks that for one who has shed his blood for france as freely as i have done a little clemency were not unfitting  he raised his eyebrows and his lips curled in a malicious sneer  you come of a family m de luynes he said slowly that is famed for having shed the blood of others for france more freely than its own you are i believe the nephew of albert de luynes do you forget the marshal dancre  i felt the blood of anger hot in my face as i made haste to answer him  there are many of us monseigneur who have cause to blush for the families they spring frommore cause mayhap than hath gaston de luynes  in my words perchance there was no offensive meaning but in my tone and in the look which i bent upon the cardinal there was that which told him that i alluded to his own obscure and dubious origin he grew livid and for a moment methought he would have struck me had he done so then indeed the history of europe would have been other than it is today he restrained himself however and drawing himself to the full height of his majestic figure he extended his arm towards the door  go he said in a voice that passion rendered hoarse go monsieur go quickly while my clemency endures go before i summon the guard and deal with you as your temerity deserves  i bowednot without a taint of mockery for i cared little what might follow then with head erect and the firm tread of defiance i stalked out of his apartment along the corridor down the great staircase across the courtyard past the guardwhich ignorant of my disgrace saluted meand out into the street  then at last my head sank forward on my breast and deep in thought i wended my way home oblivious of all around me even the chill bite of the february wind  in my mind i reviewed my wasted life with the fleeting pleasures and the enduring sorrows that it had brought meor that i had drawn from it the cardinal said no more than truth when he spoke of having saved me from starvation a week ago that was indeed what he had done he had taken pity on gaston de luynes the nephew of that famous albert de luynes who had been constable of france in the early days of the late kings reign he had made me lieutenant of his guards and maître darmes to his nephews andrea and paolo de mancini because he knew that a better blade than mine could not be found in france and because he thought it well to have such swords as mine about him  a little week ago life had been replete with fresh promises the gates of the road to fame and perchance fortune had been opened to me anew and nowbefore i had fairly passed that gate i had been thrust rudely back and it had been slammed in my face because it pleased a fool to become a sot whilst in my company  there is a subtle poetry in the contemplation of ruin with ruin itself howbeit there comes a prosaic dispelling of all idle dreamsa hard a grim a vile reality  ruin t is an ugly word a fitting one to carve upon the tombstone of a reckless godless dissolute life such as mine had been  back gaston de luynes back to the kennel whence the cardinals hand did for a moment pluck you back from the morning of hope to the night of despair back to choose between starvation and the earning of a paupers fee as a master of fence     chapter ii the fruit of indiscretion   despite the dejection to which i had become a prey i slept no less soundly that night than was my wont and indeed it was not until late next morning when someone knocked at my door that i awakened  i sat up in bed and my first thought as i looked round the handsome roomwhich i had rented a week ago upon receiving the lieutenancy in the cardinals guardswas for the position that i had lost and of the need that there would be ere long to seek a lodging more humble and better suited to my straitened circumstances it was not without regret that such a thought came to me for my tastes had never been modest and the house was a fine one situated in the rue st antoine at a hundred paces or so from the jesuit convent  i had no time however to indulge the sorry mood that threatened to beset me for the knocking at my chamber door continued until at length i answered it with a command to enter  it was my servant michelot a grizzled veteran of huge frame and strength who had fought beside me at rocroi and who had thereafter become so enamoured of my personfor some trivial service he swore i had rendered himthat he had attached himself to me and my luckless fortunes  he came to inform me that m de mancini was below and craved immediate speech with me he had scarce done speaking however when andrea himself having doubtless grown tired of waiting appeared in the doorway he wore a sickly look the result of his last nights debauch but more than that there was stamped upon his face a look of latent passion which made me think at first that he was come to upbraid me  ah still abed luynes was his greeting as he came forward  his cloak was wet and his boots splashed which told me both that he had come afoot and that it rained  there are no duties that bid me rise i answered sourly  he frowned at that then divesting himself of his cloak he gave it to michelot who at a sign from me withdrew no sooner was the door closed than the boys whole manner changed the simmering passion of which i had detected signs welled up and seemed to choke him as he poured forth the story that he had come to tell  i have been insulted he gasped grossly insulted by a vile creature of monsieur dorleanss household an hour ago in the antechamber at the palais royal i was spoken of in my hearing as the besotted nephew of the italian adventurer  i sat up in bed tingling with excitement at the developments which already i saw arising from his last nights imprudence  calmly andrea i begged of him tell me calmly  mortdieu how can i be calm ough the thought of it chokes me i was a fool last nighta sot for that perchance men have some right to censure me but sangdieu that a ruffler of the stamp of eugène de canaples should speak of itshould call me the nephew of an italian adventurer should draw down upon me the cynical smile of a crowd of courtly apespah i am sick at the memory of it  did you answer him  pardieu i should be worthy of the title he bestowed upon me had i not done so oh i answered himnot in words i threw my hat in his face  that was a passing eloquent reply  so eloquent that it left him speechless with amazement he thought to bully with impunity and see me slink into hiding like a whipped dog terrified by his blustering tongue and dangerous reputation but there he broke off a meeting has been arranged for four oclock at st germain  a meeting i exclaimed  what else do you think the affront left any alternative  but  yes yes i know he interrupted tossing his head i am going to be killed verville has sworn that there shall be one less of the italian brood that is why i have come to you luynesto ask you to be my second i dont deserve it perhaps in my folly last night i did you an ill turn i unwittingly caused you to be stripped of your commission but if i were on my deathbed now and begged a favour of you you would not refuse it and what difference is there twixt me and one who is on his deathbed am i not about to die  peste i hope not i made answer with more lightness than i felt but ill stand by you with all my heart andrea  and youll avenge me he cried savagely his southern blood aboiling youll not let him leave the ground alive  not unless my opponent commits the indiscretion of killing me first who seconds m de canaples  the marquis de st auban and m de montmédy  and who is the third in our party  i have none i thought that perhaps you had a friend  i a friend i laughed bitterly pshaw andrea beggars have no friends but stay find stanislas de gouville there is no better blade in paris if he will join us in this frolic and you can hold off canaples until either st auban or montmédy is disposed of we may yet leave the three of them on the field of battle courage andrea dum spiramus speramus  my words seemed to cheer him and when presently he left me to seek out the redoubtable gouville the poor lads face was brighter by far than when he had entered my room  down in my heart however i was less hopeful than i had led him to believe and as i dressed after he had gone t was not without some uneasiness that i turned the matter over in my mind i had during the short period of our association grown fond of andrea de mancini indeed the wonted sweetness of the lads temper and the gentleness of his disposition were such as to breed affection in all who came in contact with him in a way too methought he had grown fond of me and i had known so few friends in lifetruth to tell i fear me that i had few of the qualities that engender friendshipthat i was naturally prone to appreciate a gift that from its rareness became doubly valuable  hence was it that i trembled for the boy he had shown aptitude with the foils and derived great profit from my tuition yet he was too raw by far to be pitted against so cunning a swordsman as canaples  i had but finished dressing when a coach rumbled down the street and halted by my door naturally i supposed that someone came to visit coupri the apothecaryto whom belonged this house in which i had my lodgingand did not give the matter a second thought until michelot rushed in with eyes wide open to announce that his eminence cardinal mazarin commanded my presence in the adjoining room  amazed and deeply marvelling what so extraordinary a visit might portend i hastened to wait upon his eminence  i found him standing by the window and received from him a greeting that was passing curt and cavalier  has m de mancini been here he inquired peremptorily disregarding the chair i offered him  he has but left me monseigneur  then you know sir of the harvest which he has already reaped from the indiscretion into which you led him last night  if monseigneur alludes to the affront put upon m de mancini touching his last nights indiscretion by a bully of the court i am informed of it  pish monsieur i do not follow your fine distinctionspossibly this is due to my imperfect knowledge of the language of france possibly to your own imperfect acquaintance with the language of truth  monseigneur  faugh he cried half scornfully half peevishly i came not here to talk of you but of my nephew why did he visit you  to do me the honour of asking me to second him at st germain this evening  and so you think that this duel is to be foughtthat my nephew is to be murdered  we will endeavour to prevent his beingas your eminence daintily puts itmurdered but for the rest the duel methinks cannot be avoided  cannot he blazed do you say cannot m de luynes mark me well sir i will use no dissimulation with you my position in france is already a sufficiently difficult one already we are threatened with a second fronde it needs but such events as these to bring my family into prominence and make it the butt for the ridicule that malcontents but wait an opportunity to slur it with this affair of andreas will lend itself to a score or so of lampoons and pasquinades all of which will cast an injurious reflection upon my person and position that monsieur is methinks sufficient evil to suffer at your hands the late cardinal would have had you broken on the wheel for less i have gone no farther than to dismiss you from my servicea clemency for which you should be grateful but i shall not suffer that in addition to the harm already done andrea shall be murdered by canaples  i shall do my best to render him assistance  you still misapprehend me this duel sir must not take place  i shrugged my shoulders  how does your eminence propose to frustrate it will you arrest canaples  upon what plea monsieur think you i am anxious to have the whole of paris howling in my ears  then possibly it is your good purpose to enforce the late kings edict against duelling and send your guards to st germain to arrest the men before they engage  benone he sneered and what will paris say if i now enforce a law that for ten years has been disregarded that i feared for my nephews skin and took this means of saving him a pretty story to have on pariss lips would it not be  indeed monseigneur you are right but i doubt me the duel will needs be fought  have i not already said that it shall not be fought  again i shrugged my shoulders mazarin grew tiresome with his repetitions  how can it be avoided your eminence  ah monsieur that is your affair  my affair  assuredly t was through your evil agency he was dragged into this business and through your agency he must be extricated from it  your eminence jests  undoubtedlyt is a jesting matter he answered with terrible irony oh i jest per dio yes but ill carry my jest so far as to have you hanged if this duel be foughtaye whether my nephew suffers hurt or not now sir you know what fate awaits you fight itturn it asidei have shown you the way the door m de luynes     chapter iii the fight in the horsemarket   i let him go without a word there was that in his voice in his eye and in the gesture wherewith he bade me hold the door for him that cleared my mind of any doubts touching the irrevocable character of his determination to plead was never an accomplishment of mine to argue i saw would be to waste the cardinals time to no purpose  and so i let him goand my curse with himand from my window i watched his coach drive away in the drizzling rain scattering the crowd of awestricken loiterers who had collected at the rumour of his presence  with a fervent prayer that his patron saint the devil might see fit to overset his coach and break his neck before he reached the palace i turned from the window and called michelot  he was quick to answer my summons bringing me the frugal measure of bread and wine wherewith it was my custom to break my fast then whilst i munched my crust i strode to and fro in the little chamber and exercised my wits to their utmost for a solution to the puzzle his eminence had set me  one solution there was and an easy oneflight but i had promised andrea de mancini that i would stand beside him at st germain there was a slender chance of saving him if i went whilst if i stayed away there would be nothing left for his eminence to do but to offer up prayers for the rest of his nephews soul  another idea i had but it was desperateand yet so persistently did my thoughts revert to it that in the end i determined to accept it  i drank a cup of armagnac cheered myself with an oath or two and again i called michelot when he came i asked him if he were acquainted with m de canaples to which he replied that he was having seen the gentleman in my company  then i said you will repair to m de canapless lodging in the rue des gesvres and ascertain discreetly whether he be at home if he is you will watch the house until he comes forth then follow him and bring me word thereafter where he is to be found should he be already abroad before you reach the rue des gesvres endeavour to ascertain whither he has gone and return forthwith but be discreet michelot you understand  he assured me that he did and left me to nurse my unpleasant thoughts for half an hour returning at the end of that time with the information that m de canaples was seated at dinner in the auberge du soleil  naught could have been more attuned to my purpose and straightway i drew on my boots girt on my sword and taking my hat and cloak i sallied out into the rain and wended my way at a sharp pace towards the rue st honoré  one oclock was striking as i crossed the threshold of the soleil and flung my dripping cloak to the first servant i chanced upon  i glanced round the wellfilled room and at one of the tables i espied my quarry in company with st auban and montmédythe very gentlemen who were to fight beside him that eveningand one vilmorin as arrant a coxcomb and poltroon as could be found in france with my beaver cocked at the back of my head and a general bearing that for aggressiveness would be hard to surpass i strode up to their table and stood for a moment surveying them with an insolent stare that made them pause in their conversation they raised their noble heads and bestowed upon me a look of haughty and disdainful wondersuch a look as one might bestow upon a misbehaving lackeyall save vilmorin who with a cowards keen nose for danger turned slightly pale and fidgeted in his chair i was well known to all of them but my attitude forbade all greeting  has m de luynes lost anything st auban inquired icily  his wits mayhap quoth canaples with a contemptuous shrug  he was a tall powerfully built man this canaples with a swart cruel face that was nevertheless not illfavoured and a profusion of black hair  there is a temerity in m de canapless rejoinder that i had not looked for i said banteringly  canapless brow was puckered in a frown  ha and why not monsieur  why not because it is not to be expected that one who fastens quarrels upon schoolboys would evince the courage to beard gaston de luynes  monsieur the four of them cried in chorus so loudly that the hum of voices in the tavern became hushed and all eyes were turned in our direction  m de canaples i said calmly permit me to say that i can find no more fitting expression for the contempt i hold you in than this  as i spoke i seized a corner of the tablecloth and with a sudden tug i swept it with all it held on to the floor  dame what a scene there was in an instant the four of them were on their feetas were half the occupants of the room besideswhilst poor vilmorin who stood trembling like a maid who for the first time hears words of love raised his quavering voice to cry soothingly messieurs messieurs  canaples was livid with passion but otherwise the calmest in that room saving perhaps myself with a gesture he restrained montmédy and st auban  i shall be happy to give master de luynes all the proof of my courage that he may desire and more i warrant than he will relish  bravely answered i cried with an approving nod and a beaming smile be good enough to lead the way to a convenient spot  i have other business at the moment he answered calmly let us say tomorrow at  faugh i broke in scornfully i knew it confess monsieur that you dare not light me now lest you should be unable to keep your appointments for this evening  mille diables exclaimed st auban this insolence passes all bounds  each man in his turn if you please gentlemen i replied my present affair is with m de canaples  there was a hot answer burning on st aubans lips but canaples was beforehand with him  par la mort dieu he cried you go too far sir with your dare and dare not is a broken gamester a penniless adventurer to tell eugène de canaples what he dares come sir since you are eager for the taste of steel follow me and say your prayers as you go  with that we left the inn amidst a prodigious hubbub and made our way to the horsemarket behind the hôtel vendôme it was not to be expected albeit the place we had chosen was usually deserted at such an hour that after the fracas at the soleil our meeting would go unattended when we faced each othercanaples and ithere were at least some twenty persons present who came despite the rain to watch what they thought was like to prove a pretty fight men of position were they for the most part gentlemen of the court with here and there a soldier and from the manner in which they eyed me methought they favoured me but little  our preparations were brief the absence of seconds disposed of all formalities the rain made us impatient to be done and in virtue of it canaples pompously announced that he would not risk a cold by stripping with interest did i grimly answer that he need fear no cold when i had done with him then casting aside my cloak i drew and professing myself also disposed to retain my doublet we forthwith engaged  he was no mean swordsman this canaples indeed his reputation was already widespread and in the first shock of our meeting blades i felt that rumour had been just for once but i was strangely dispossessed of any doubts touching the outcome this being due perchance to a vain confidence in my own skill perchance to the spirit of contemptuous raillery wherewith i had from the outset treated the affair and which had so taken root in my heart that even when we engaged i still almost unwittingly persisted in it  in my face and attitude there was the reflection of this bantering flippant mood it was to be read in the mocking disdain of my glance in the scornful curl of my lip and even in the turn of my wrist as i put aside my opponents passes all this canaples must have noted and it was not without effect upon his nerves moreover there is in steel a subtle magnetism which is the index of ones antagonist and from the moment that our blades slithered one against the other i make no doubt but that canaples grew aware of the confident almost exultant mood in which i met him and which told him that i was his master add to this the fact that whilst canapless nerves were unstrung by passion mine were held in check by a mind as calm and cool as though our swords were baited and consider with what advantages i took my ground  he led the attack fiercely and furiously as if i were a boy whose guard was to be borne down by sheer weight of blows i contented myself with tapping his blade aside and when at length after essaying every trick in his catalogue he fell back baffled i laughed a low laugh of derision that drove him pale with fury  again he came at me almost before i was prepared for him and his point parried with a downward stroke and narrowly averted scratched my thigh but did more damage to my breeches than my skin in exchange i touched him playfully on the shoulder and the sting of it drove him back a second time he was breathing hard by then and would fain have paused awhile for breath but i saw no reason to be merciful  now sir i cried saluting him as though our combat were but on the point of startingto me guard yourself  again our swords clashed and my blows now fell as swift on his blade as his had done awhile ago on mine so hard did i press him that he was forced to give way before me back i drove him pace by pace his wrist growing weaker at each parry each parry growing wider and the perspiration streaming down his ashen face panting he went in that backward flight before my onslaught defending himself as best he could never thinking of a ripostebeaten already back and yet back he went until he reached the railings and could back no farther and so broken was his spirit then that a groan escaped him i answered with a laughmy mood was lusty and crueland thrust at him then eluding his guard i thrust again beneath it and took him fairly in the middle of his doublet  he staggered dropped his rapier and caught at the railings where for a moment he hung swaying and gasping then his head fell forward his grip relaxed and swooning he sank down into a heap  a dozen sprang to his aid foremost amongst them being st auban and montmédy whilst i drew back suddenly realising my own spent condition to which the heat of the combat had hitherto rendered me insensible i mastered myself as best i might and dissembling my hard breathing i wiped my blade with a kerchief an act which looked so calm and callous that it drew from the crowdfor a crowd it had become by thenan angry growl t is thus with the vulgar they are ever ready to sympathise with the vanquished without ever pausing to ask themselves if his chastisement may not be merited  in answer to the growl i tossed my head and sheathing my sword i flung the bloodstained kerchief into their very midst the audacity of the gesture left them breathless and they growled no more but stared  then that outrageous fop vilmorin who had been bending over canaples started up and coming towards me with a face that was whiter than that of the prostrate man he proved himself so utterly bereft of wit by terror that for once he had the temerity to usurp the words and actions of a brave man  you have murdered him he cried in a strident voice and thrusting his clenched fist within an inch of my face do you hear me you knave you have murdered him  now as may be well conceived i was in no mood to endure such words from any man so was but natural that for answer i caught the dainty vicomte a buffet that knocked him into the arms of the nearest bystander and brought him to his senses  fool i snarled at him must i make another example before you believe that gaston de luynes wears a sword  in the name of heaven he began putting forth his hands in a beseeching gesture but what more he said was drowned by the roar of anger that burst from the onlookers and it was like to have gone ill with me had not st auban come to my aid at that most critical juncture  messieurs he cried thrusting himself before me and raising his hand to crave silence hear me i a friend of m de canaples tell you that you wrong m de luynes t was a fair fighthow the quarrel arose is no concern of yours  despite his words they still snarled and growled like the misbegotten curs they were but st auban was famous for the regal supper parties he gave to which all were eager to be bidden and amidst that crowd as i have said there were a score or so of gentlemen of the court whowith scant regard for the right or wrong of the case and every regard to conciliate this giver of supperscame to range themselves beside and around us and thus protected me from the murderous designs of that rabble  seeing how the gentlemen took my part and deemingin their blessed ignorancethat what gentlemen did must be perforce well done they grew calm in the twinkling of an eye thereupon st auban turning to me counselled me in a whisper to be gone whilst the tide of opinion flowed in my favour intent to act upon this good advice i took a step towards the little knot that had collected round canaples and with natural curiosity inquired into the nature of his hurt  t was montmédy who answered me scowling as he did so  he may die of it monsieur if he does not his recovery will be at least slow and difficult  i had been wise had i held my peace and gone but like a fool i must needs give utterance to what was in my mind  ah at least there will be no duel at st germain this evening  scarce had the words fallen from my lips when i saw in the faces of montmédy and st auban and half a dozen others the evidence of their rashness  so cried st auban in a voice that shook with rage that was your object eh that you had fallen low master de luynes i knew but i dreamt not that in your fall you had come so low as this  you dare  pardieu i dare more monsieur i dare tell youyou gaston de luynes spy and bravo of the cardinalthat your object shall be defeated that as god lives this duel shall still be foughtby me instead of canaples  and i tell you sir that as god lives it shall not i answered with a vehemence not a whit less than his own to you and to what other fools may think to follow in your footsteps i say this that not tonight nor tomorrow nor the next day shall that duel be fought cowards and poltroons you are who seek to murder a beardless boy who has injured none of you but by my soul every man who sends a challenge to that boy will i at once seek out and deal with as i have dealt with eugène de canaples let those who are eager to try another world make the attempt adieu messieurs  and with a flourish of my sodden beaver i turned and left them before they had recovered from the vehemence of my words     chapter iv fair rescuers   like the calm of the heavens when pregnant with thunder was the calm of that crowd and as brief it was for scarce had i taken a dozen steps when my ears were assailed by a rumble of angry voices and a rush of feet one glance over my shoulder one seconds hesitation whether i should stay and beard them then the thought of andrea de mancini and of what would befall him did this canaille vent its wrath upon me decided my course and sent me hotfoot down the rue monarque howling and bellowing that rabble followed in my wake stumbling over one another in their indecent haste to reach me  but i was fleet of foot and behind me there was that that would lend wings to the most deliberate so that when i turned into the open space before the hôtel vendôme i had set a good fifty yards betwixt myself and the foremost of my hunters  a coach was passing at that moment i shouted and the knave who drove glanced at me then up the rue monarque at my pursuers whereupon shaking his head he would have left me to my fate but i was of another mind i dashed towards the vehicle and as it passed me i caught at the window which luckily was open and drawing up my legs i hung there despite the shower of mud which the revolving wheels deposited upon me  from the bowels of the coach i was greeted by a womans scream a pale face and a profusion of fair hair flashed before my eyes  fear not madame i shouted i am no assassin but rather one who stands in imminent peril of assassination and who craves your protection  more i would have said but at that juncture the lash of the coachmans whip curled itself about my shoulders and stung me vilely  get down you rascal he bellowed get down or ill draw rein  to obey him would have been madness the crowd surged behind with hoots and yells and had i let go i must perforce have fallen into their hands so instead of getting down as he inconsiderately counselled i drew myself farther up by a mighty effort and thrust half my body into the coach whereupon the fair lady screamed again and the whip caressed my legs but within the coach sat another woman dark of hair and exquisite of face who eyed my advent with a disdainful glance her proud countenance bore the stamp of courage and to her it was that i directed my appeal  madame permit me i pray to seek shelter in your carriage and suffer me to journey a little way with you quick madame your coachman is drawing rein and i shall of a certainty be murdered under your very nose unless you bid him change his mind to be murdered in itself is a trifling matter i avow but it is not nice to behold and i would not for all the world offend your eyes with the spectacle of it  i had judged her rightly and my tone of flippant recklessness won me her sympathy and aid quickly thrusting her head through the other window  drive on louis she commanded faster then turning to me you may bring your legs into the coach if you choose sir she said  your words madame are the sweetest music i have heard for months i answered drily as i obeyed her then leaning out of the carriage again i waved my hat gallantly to the mob whichnow realising the futility of further pursuithad suddenly come to a halt  au plaisir de vous revoir messieurs i shouted come to me one by one and ill keep the devil busy finding lodgings for you  they answered me with a yell and i sat down content and laughed  you are not a coward monsieur said the dark lady  i have been accounted many unsavoury things madame but my bitterest enemies never dubbed me that  why then did you run away  why ma foi because in the excessive humility of my soul i recognised myself unfit to die  she bit her lip and her tiny foot beat impatiently upon the floor  you are trifling with me monsieur where do you wish to alight  pray let that give you no concern i can assure you that i am in no haste  you become impertinent sir she cried angrily answer me where are you going  where am i going oh ahto the palais royal  her eyes opened very wide at that and wandered over me with a look that was passing eloquent indeed i was a sorry spectacle for any womans eyesparticularly a pretty ones splashed from head to foot with mud my doublet saturated and my beaver dripping with the feather hanging limp and broken whilst there was a rent in my breeches that had been made by canapless sword i take it that i had not the air of a courtier and that when i said that i went to the palais royal she might have justly held me to be the adventurous lover of some kitchen wench but unto the palais royal go others besides courtiers and loversspies of the cardinal for instance and in her sudden coldness and the next question that fell from her beauteous lips i read that she had guessed me one of these  why did the mob pursue you monsieur  there was in her voice and gesture when she asked a question the imperiousness of one accustomed to command replies this pretty queenliness it was that drove me to answeras i had done beforein a bantering strain  why did the mob pursue me hum why does the mob pursue great men because it loves their company  her matchless eyes flashed an angry glance and the faint smile on my lips must have tried her temper sorely  what did you do to deserve this affection  a mere nothingi killed a man i answered coolly or at least i left him started on the road toparadise  the little flaxenhaired doll uttered a cry of horror and covered her face with her small white hands my inquisitor however sat rigid and unaffected my answer had confirmed her suspicions  why did you kill him  ma foi i replied encouraging her thoughts because he sought to kill me  ah and why did he seek to kill you  because i disturbed him at dinner  have a care how you trifle sir she retorted her eyes kindling again  upon my honour t was no more than that i pulled the cloth from the table whilst he ate he was a quicktempered gentleman and my playfulness offended him that is all  doubt appeared in her eyes and it may have entered her mind that perchance her judgment had been overhasty  do you mean sir that you provoked a duel  alas madame it had become necessary you see m de canaples  who her voice rang sharp as the crack of a pistol  eh m de canaples  was it he whom you killed  from her tone and the eager strained expression of her face it was not difficult to read that some mighty interest of hers was involved in my reply it needed not the low moan that burst from her companion to tell me so  as i have said madame it is possible that he is not deadnay even that he will not die for the rest since you ask the question my opponent was indeed m de canapleseugène de canaples  her face went deadly white and she sank back in her seat as if every nerve in her body had of a sudden been bereft of power whilst she of the fair hair burst into tears  a pretty position was this for meluckily it endured not the girl roused herself from her momentary weakness and seizing the cord she tugged it violently the coach drew up  alight sir she hissedgo i wish to heaven that i had left you to the vengeance of the people  not so did i nevertheless as i alighted i am sorry madame that you did not i answered adieu  the coach moved away and i was left standing at the corner of the rue st honoré and the rue des bons enfants in the sorriest frame of mind conceivable the lady in the coach had saved my life and for that i was more grateful perchance than my life was worth out of gratitude sprang a regret for the pain that i had undoubtedly caused her and the sorrow which it might have been my fate to cast over her life  still regret albeit an admirable sentiment was one whose existence was usually brief in my bosom dame had i been a man of regrets i might have spent the remainder of my days weeping over my past life but the gods who had given me a character calculated to lead a man into misfortune had given me a stout heart wherewith to fight that misfortune and an armour of recklessness against which remorse regrets aye and conscience itself rained blows in vain  and so it befell that presently i laughed myself out of the puerile humour that was besetting me and finding myself chilled by inaction in my wet clothes i set off for the palais royal at a pace that was first cousin to a run  ten minutes later i stood in the presence of the most feared and hated man in france  cospetto cried mazarin as i entered his cabinet have you swum the seine in your clothes  no your eminence but i have been serving you in the rain for the past hour  he smiled that peculiar smile of his that rendered hateful his otherwise not illfavoured countenance it was a smile of the lips in which the eyes had no part  yes he said slowly i have heard of your achievements  you have heard i ejaculated amazed by the powers which this man wielded  yes i have heard you are a brave man m de luynes  pshaw your eminence i deprecated the poor are always brave they have naught to lose but their life and that is not so sweet to them that they lay much store by it howbeit monseigneur your wishes have been carried out there will be no duel at st germain this evening  will there not hum i am not so confident you are a brave man m de luynes but you lack that great auxiliary of valourdiscretion what need to fling into the teeth of those fine gentlemen the reason you had for spitting canaples eh you have provoked a dozen enemies for andrea where only one existed  i will answer for all of them i retorted boastfully  fine words m de luynes but to support them how many men will you have to kill pah what if some fine morning there comes one who despite your vaunted swordsmanship proves your master what will become of that fool my nephew eh  and his uncanny smile again beamed on me andrea is now packing his valise in an hour he will have left paris secretly he goesbut what does it signify where he goes he is compelled by your indiscretion to withdraw from court had you kept a close tongue in your foolish headbut there you did not and so by a thoughtless word you undid all that you had done so well you may go m de luynes i have no further need of youand thank heaven that you leave the palais royal free to go whither your fancy takes you and not to journey to the bastille or to vincennes i am merciful m de luynesas merciful as you are brave more merciful than you are prudent one word of warning m de luynes do not let me learn that you are in my nephews company if you would not make me regret my clemency and repair the error of it by having you hanged and now adieu  i stood aghast was i indeed dismissed albeit naught had been said i had not doubted since my interview with him that morning that did i succeed in saving andrea my rank in his guardsand thereby a means of livelihoodwould be restored to me and now matters were no better than they had been before he dismissed me with the assurance that he was merciful as god lives it would have been as merciful to have hanged me  he met my astonished look with an eye that seemed to ask me why i lingered then reading mayhap what was passing in my thoughts he raised a little silver whistle to his lips and blew softly upon it  bernouin said he to his valet who entered in answer to the summons reconduct m de luynes  i remember drawing down upon my bedraggled person the curious gaze of the numerous clients who thronged the cardinals antechamber as i followed bernouin to the door which opened on to the corridor and which he held for me and thus for the second time within twentyfour hours did i leave the palais royal to wend my way home to the rue st antoine with grim despondency in my heart  i found michelot on the point of setting out in search of me with a note which had been brought to my lodging half an hour ago and which its bearer had said was urgent i took the letter and bidding michelot prepare me fresh raiment that i might exchange for my wet clothes i broke the seal and read   a thousand thanks dear friend for the service you have rendered me and of which his eminence my uncle has informed me i fear that you have made many enemies for yourself through an action which will likely go unrewarded and that paris is therefore as little suited at present to your health as it is to mine i am setting out for blois on a mission of exceeding delicacy wherein your advice and guidance would be of infinite value to me i shall remain at choisy until tomorrow morning and should there be no ties to hold you in paris and you be minded to bear me company join me there at the hôtel du connétable where i shall lie tonight your grateful and devoted  andre   so there was one at least who desired my company i had not thought it if there be no ties to hold you in paris he wrote dame a change of air would suit me vastly i was resolveda fig for the cardinals threat to hang me if i were found in his nephews company  my suit of buff michelot i shouted springing to my feet and my leather jerkin  he gazed at me in surprise  is monsieur going a journey  i answered him that i was and as i spoke i began to divest myself of the clothes i wore pack my suit of pearl grey in the valise with what changes of linen i possess then call master coupri that i may settle with him it may be some time before we return  in less than half an hour i was ready for the journey spurred and booted with my rapier at my side and in the pocket of my hautde­chausses a purse containing some fifty pistolesbest part of which i had won from vilmorin at lansquenet some nights before and which moderate sum represented all the moneys that i possessed  our horses were ready my pistols holstered and my valise strapped to michelots saddle despite the desperate outlook of my fortunes of which i had made him fully cognisant he insisted upon clinging to me reminding me that at rocroi i had saved his life and that he would leave me only when i bade him go  as four oclock was striking at nôtre dame we crossed the pont neuf and going by the quai des augustins and the rue de la harpe we quitted paris by the st michel gate and took the road to choisy the rain had ceased but the air was keen and cold and the wind cut like a swordedge     chapter v mazarin the matchmaker   twixt paris and choisy there lies but a distance of some two leagues which given a fair horse one may cover with ease in little more than half an hour so that as the twilight was deepening into night we drew rein before the hostelry of the connétable in the only square the little township boasts and from the landlord i had that obsequious reception which is ever accorded to him who travels with a bodyservant  i found andrea installed in a fairsized and comfortable apartment to the original decoration of which he added not a little by bestowing his boots in the centre of the floor his hat sword and baldrick on the table his cloak on one chair and his doublet on another he himself sat toasting his feet before the blazing logs which cast a warm reddish glow upon his sable hair and dainty shirt of cambric  he sprang up as i entered and came towards me with a look of pleasure on his handsome highbred face that did me good to see  so you have come de luynes he cried putting forth his hand i did not dare to hope that you would  no i answered truly it was not to be expected that i could be easily lured from paris just as my fortunes are nearing a high tide and his eminence proposing to make me a marshal of france and create me duke as you say you had scant grounds for hoping that my love for you would suffice to make me renounce all these fine things for the mere sake of accompanying you on your jaunt to blois  he laughed then fell to thanking me for having rid him of canaples i cut him short at last and in answer to his questions told him what had passed twixt his eminence and me that afternoon then as the waiter entered to spread our supper the conversation assumed a less delicate character until we were again alone with the table and its steaming viands between us  you have not told me yet andrea what takes you to blois quoth i then  you shall learn little do you dream how closely interwoven are our morning adventures with this journey of mine to begin with i go to blois to pay my dévoirs to the lady whom his eminence has selected for my future wife  you were then right in describing this as a mission of great delicacy  more than you thinki have never seen the lady  never seen her and you go awooing a woman you have never seen  it is so i have never seen her but his eminence has and t is he who arranges the affair ah the cardinal is the greatest match­maker in france my cousin anna martinozzi is destined for the prince de conti my sisters olympia and marianne he also hopes to marry to princes of the blood whilst i dare wager that he has thoughts of seating either maria or hortensia upon the throne of france as the wife of louis xiv as soon as his majesty shall have reached a marriageable age you may laugh de luynes nevertheless all this may come to pass for my uncle has great ambitions for his family and it is even possible that should that poor wandering youth charles ii of england ever return to the throne of his fathers he may also become my brotherinlaw i am likely to become well connected de luynes so make a friend of me whilst i am humble so much for mazarins nieces his nephews are too young for alliances just yet saving myself and for me his eminence has chosen one of the greatest heiresses in franceyvonne st albaret de canaples  whom i shouted  he smiled  curious is it not she is the sister of the man whom i quarrelled with this morning and whom you fought with this afternoon now you will understand my uncles reasons for so strenuously desiring to prevent the duel at st germain it appears that the old chevalier de canaples is as eager as the cardinal to see his daughter wed to me for his eminence has promised to create me duke for a wedding gift t will cost him little and t will please these canaples mightily naturally had eugène de canaples and i crossed swords matters would have been rendered difficult  when did you learn all this i inquired  today after the duel and when it was known what st auban and montmédy had threatened me with my uncle thought it well that i should withdraw from paris he sent for me and told me what i have told you adding that i had best seize the opportunity whilst my presence at court was undesirable to repair to blois and get my wooing done i in part agreed with him the lady is very rich and i am told that she is beautiful i shall see her and if she pleases me ill woo her if not ill return to paris  but her brother will oppose you  her brother pooh if he doesnt die of the swordthrust you gave him which i am told is in the region of the lung and passing dangerous he will at least be abed for a couple of months to come  but i mon cher andré what rôle do you reserve for me that you have desired me to go with you  the rôle of mentor if you will methought you would prove a merry comrade to help one oer a tedious journey and knowing that there was little to hold you to paris and probably sound reasons why you should desire to quit it meseemed that perhaps you would consent to bear me company who knows my knight errant what adventures may await you and what fortunes if the heiress displeases me it may be that she will please youor mayhap there is another heiress at blois who will fall enamoured of those fierce moustachios  i laughed with him at the improbability of such things befalling i carried in my bosom too large a heart and one that was the property of every wench i metfor just so long as i chanced to be in her company  it was no more than in harmony with this habit of mine that when next morning in the commonroom of the connétable i espied jeanneton the landlords daughter and remarked that she was winsome and shapely with a complexion that would not have dishonoured a rosepetal i permitted myself to pinch her dainty cheek she slapped mine in return and in this pleasant manner we became acquainted  sweet jeanneton quoth i with a laugh that was mightily illdone i did but pinch your cheek as one may pinch a sweetsmelling bud so that the perfume of it may cling to ones fingers  and i sir was the pert rejoinder did but slap yours as one may slap a misbehaving urchins so that he may learn better manners  nevertheless she was pleased with my courtly speech and perchance also with my moustachios for a smile took the place of the frown wherewith she had at first confronted me now if i had uttered glib pleasantries in answer to her frowns how many more did not her smiles wring from me i discoursed to her in the very courtliest fashion of cows and pullets and such other matters as interesting to her as they were mysterious to me i questioned her in a breath touching her fathers pigs and the swain she loved best in that little township to all of which she answered me with a charming wit which would greatly divert you did i but recall her words sufficiently to set them down in five minutes we had become the best friends in the world which was attested by the protecting arm that i slipped around her waist as i asked her whether she loved that village swain of hers better than she loved me and refused to believe her when she answered that she did  outside two men were talking one calling for a farrier and when informed that the only one in the village was absent and not likely to return till noon demanding relays of horses the otherprobably the hostleranswered him that the connétable was not a posthouse and that no horses were to be had there then a womans voice sweet yet commanding rose above theirs  very well guilbert it said we will await this farriers return  let me go monsieur cried jeanneton some one comes  now for myself i cared little who might come but methought that it was likely to do poor jeannetons fair name no benefit if the arm of gaston de luynes were seen about her waist and so i obeyed her but not quickly enough for already a shadow lay athwart the threshold and in the doorway stood a woman whose eye took in the situation before we had altered it sufficiently to avert suspicion to my amazement i beheld the lady of the coachshe who had saved me from the mob in place vendôme and touching whose identity i could have hazarded a shrewd guess  in her eyes also i saw the light of recognition which swiftly changed to one of scorn then they passed from me to the vanishing jeanneton and methought that she was about to call her back she paused however and turning to the lackey who followed at her heels  guilbert she said be good enough to call the landlord and bid him provide me with an apartment for the time that we may be forced to spend here  but at this juncture the host himself came hurrying forward with many bows and endless rubbing of hands which argued untold deference he regretted that the hostelry of the connétable being but a poor inn seldom honoured as it was at that moment possessed but one suite of private apartments and that was now occupied by a most noble gentleman the lady tapped her foot and as at that moment her companion who was none other than the fairhaired doll i had seen with her on the previous day entered the room she turned to speak with her whilst i moved away towards the window  will this gentleman she inquired lend me one of his rooms think you  hélas mademoiselle he has but two a bedroom and an antechamber and he is still abed  oh she cried in pretty anger this is insufferable t is your fault guilbert you fool am i then to spend the day here in the commonroom  no no mademoiselle exclaimed the host in his most soothing accents only for an hour or less perhaps until this very noble lord is risen when assuredlyfor he is young and very gallanthe will resign one or both of his rooms to you  more was said between them but my attention was suddenly drawn elsewhere michelot burst into the room disaster written on his face  monsieur he cried in great alarm the marquis de st auban is riding down the street with the vicomte de vilmorin and another gentleman  i rapped out an oath at the news they had got scent of andreas whereabouts and were after him like sleuthhounds on a trail  remain here michelot i answered in a low voice tell them that m de mancini is not here that the only occupant of the inn is your master a gentleman from normandy or picardy or where you will see that they do not guess our presencethe landlord fortunately is ignorant of m de mancinis name  there was a clatter of horses hoofs without and i was barely in time to escape by the door leading to the staircase when st aubans heavy voice rang out calling the landlord  i am in search of a gentleman named andrea de mancini he said i am told that he has journeyed hither and that he is here at present am i rightly informed  i determined to remain where i was and hear that conversation to the end  there is a gentleman here answered the host but i am ignorant of his name i will inquire  you may spare yourself the trouble michelot interposed that is not the gentlemans name i am his servant  there was a moments pause then came vilmorins shrill voice  you lie knave m de mancini is here you are m de luyness lackey and where the one is there shall we find the other  m de luynes came a voice unknown to me that is mancinis swordblade of a friend is it not well why does he hide himself where is he where is your master rascal  i am here messieurs i answered throwing wide the door and appearing grim and arrogant upon the threshold  mort de ma vie had they beheld the devil st auban and vilmorin could not have looked less pleased than they did when their eyes lighted upon me standing there surveying them with a sardonic grin  st auban muttered an oath vilmorin stifled a cry whilst he who had so loudly called to know where i hid myselfa frail little fellow in the uniform of the gardes du corpsnow stood silent and abashed  the two women who had withdrawn into a dark and retired corner of the apartment stood gazing with interest upon this pretty scene  well gentlemen i asked in a tone of persiflage as i took a step towards them have you naught to say to me now that i have answered your imperious summons what all dumb  our affair is not with you said st auban curtly  pardon why then did you inquire where i was  messieurs exclaimed vilmorin whose face assumed the pallor usual to it in moments of peril meseems we have been misinformed and that m de mancini is not here let us seek elsewhere  most excellent advice gentlemen i commentedseek elsewhere  monsieur cried the little officer turning purple it occurs to me that you are mocking us  mocking you mocking you mocking a gentleman who has been tied to so huge a sword as yours surelysurely sir you do not think  ill not endure it he broke in you shall answer to me for this  have a care sir i cried in alarm as he rushed forward have a care sir lest you trip over your sword  he halted drew himself up and with a magnificent gesture i am armand de malpertuis lieutenant of his majestys guards he announced and i shall be grateful if you will do me the honour of taking a turn with me outside  i am flattered beyond measure m malappris  malpertuis he corrected furiously  malpertuis i echoed i am honoured beyond words but i do not wish to take a turn  mille diables sir dont you understand we must fight  must we indeed again i am honoured but monsieur i dont fight sparrows  gentlemen gentlemen cried st auban thrusting himself between us malpertuis have the goodness to wait until one affair is concluded before you create a second one now m de luynes will you tell me whether m de mancini is here or not  what if he should be  you will be wise to withdrawwe shall be three to two  three to two surely marquis your reckoning is at fault you cannot count the vicomte there as one his knees are knocking together at best he is but a woman in mans clothes as for your other friend unless his height misleads me he is but a boy therefore monsieur you see that the advantage is with us we are two men opposed to a man a woman and a child so that  in heavens name sir cried st auban again interposing himself betwixt me and the bellicose malpertuis will you cease this foolishness a word with you in private m de luynes  i permitted him to take me by the sleeve and lead me aside wondering the while what curb it was that he was setting upon his temper and what wily motives he might have for adopting so conciliatory a tone  with many generations to come the name of césar de st auban must perforce be familiar as that of one of the greatest roysterers and most courtly libertines of the early days of louis xiv as well as that of a rabid anticardinalist and frondeur and one of the earliest of that new cabal of nobility known as the petitsmaîtres whose leader the prince de condé was destined to become a few years later he was a man of about my own age that is to say between thirtytwo and thirtythree and of my own frame tall spare and active on his florid débonnair countenance was stamped his character of bonviveur in dress he was courtly in the extreme his doublet and hautdechausses were of winecoloured velvet richly laced and he still affected the hanging sleeves of a fastdisappearing fashion valuable lace filled the tops of his black boots a valuable jewel glistened here and there upon his person and one must needs have pronounced him a fop but for the strength and resoluteness of his bearing and the long rapier that hung from his goldembroidered baldrick such in brief is a portrait of the man who now confronted me his fine blue eyes fixed upon my face wherein methinks he read but little search though he might  m de luynes he murmured at last you appear to find entertainment in making enemies and you do it wantonly  have you brought me aside to instruct me in the art of making friends  possibly m de luynes and without intending an offence permit me to remark that you need them  mayhap but i do not seek them  i have it in my heart to wish that you did for i m de luynes seek to make a friend of you nay do not smile in that unbelieving fashion i have long esteemed you for those very qualities of dauntlessness and defiance which have brought you so rich a crop of hatred if you doubt my words perhaps you will recall my attitude towards you in the horsemarket yesterday and let that speak without wishing to remind you of a service done i may yet mention that i stood betwixt you and the mob that sought to avenge my friend canaples he was my friend you stood there as indeed you have always stood in the attitude of a foe you wounded canaples maltreated vilmorin defied me and yet but for my intervention mille diables sir you had been torn to pieces  all this i grant is very true monsieur i made reply with deep suspicion in my soul yet pardon me if i confess that to me it proves no more than that you acted as a generous enemy pardon my bluntness alsobut what profit do you look to make from gaining my friendship  you are frank monsieur he said colouring slightly i will be none the less so i am a frondeur an anticardinalist in a word i am a gentleman and a frenchman an interloping foreigner miserly meansouled and jesuitical springs up wins himself into the graces of a foolish impetuous wilful queen and climbs the ladder which she holds for him to the highest position in france i allude to mazarin this cardinal who is not a priest this minister of france who is not a frenchman this belittler of nobles who is not a gentleman  mort dieu monsieur  one moment m de luynes this adventurer not content with the millions which his avaricious talons have dragged from the people for his own benefit seeks by means of illustrious alliances to enrich a pack of beggarly nieces and nephews that he has rescued from the squalor of their sicilian homes to bring hither his nieces the mancinis and martinozzis he is marrying to dukes and princes t is not nice to witness but t is the affair of the men who wed them in seeking however to marry his nephew andrea to one of the greatest heiresses in france he goes too far yvonne de canaples is for some noble countryman of her ownthere are many suitors to her handand for no nephew of giulio mazarini her brother eugène himself thinks thus and therein m de luynes you have the real motive of the quarrel which he provoked with andrea and which had you not interfered could have had but one ending  why do you tell me all this monsieur i inquired coldly betraying none of the amazement his last words gave birth to  so that you may know the true position of affairs and knowing it see the course which the name you bear must bid you follow because canaples failed am i here today i had not counted upon meeting you but since i have met you i have set the truth before you confident that you will now withdraw from an affair to which no real interest can bind you leaving matters to pursue their course  he eyed me methought almost anxiously from under his brows as he awaited my reply it was briefer than he looked for  you have wasted time monsieur  how you persist  yes i persist yet for the cardinal i care nothing mazarin has dismissed me from his service unjustly and unpaid he has forbidden me his nephews company in fact did he know of my presence here with m de mancini he would probably carry out his threat to hang me  ciel cried st auban you are mad if that be so france is divided into two parties cardinalists and anticardinalists you sir without belonging to either stand alone an enemy to both your attitude is preposterous  nay sir not alone there is andrea de mancini the boy is my only friend in a world of enemies i am growing fond of him monsieur and i will stand by him while my arm can wield a sword in all that may advance his fortunes and his happiness that monsieur is my last word  do not forget m de luynes he saidhis suaveness all departed of a sudden and his tone full of menace and aciditydo not forget that when a wall may not be scaled it may be broken through  aye monsieur but many of those who break through stand in danger of being crushed by the falling stones i answered entering into the spirit of his allegory  there are many ways of striking he said  and many ways of being struck i retorted with a sneer  our words grew sinister our eyes waxed fiery and more might have followed had not the door leading to the staircase opened at that moment to admit andrea himself he came elegant in dress and figure with a smile upon his handsome young face whose noble features gave the lie to st aubans assertion that he had been drawn from a squalid sicilian home such faces are not bred in squalor  in utter ignorance of the cabal against him he greeted st aubanwho was well known to himwith a graceful bow and also vilmorin who stood in the doorway with malpertuis and who at the sight of mancini grew visibly ill at ease in coming to choisy the vicomte had clearly expected to do no more than second st auban in the duel which he thought to see forced upon andrea he now realised that if a fight there was he might by my presence be forced into it malpertuis looked fierce and tugged at his moustachios whilst his companions returned andreas salutationst auban gravely and vilmorin hesitatingly  ha gaston said the boy advancing towards me our host tells me that two ladies who have been shipwrecked here wish to do me the honour of occupying my apartments for an hour or so ha there they are he added as the two girls came suddenly forward then bowingmesdames i am enchanted to set the poor room at your disposal for as long as it may please you to honour it  as the ladiesof whose presence st auban had been unawareappeared before us i shot a glance at the marquis and from the start he gave upon beholding them i saw that things were as i had suspected  before they could reply to andrea st auban suddenly advanced  mesdemoiselles quoth he forgive me if in this miserable light i did not earlier discover your presence and offer you my services i do so now with the hope that you will honour me by making use of them  merci m de st auban replied the darkhaired onewhom i guessed to be none other than yvonne de canaples herselfbut since this gentleman so gallantly cedes his apartments to us all our needs are satisfied it would be churlish to refuse that which is so graciously proffered  her tone was cold in the extreme as also was the inclination of her head wherewith she favoured the marquis in arrant contrast were the pretty words of thanks she addressed to andrea who stood by blushing like a girl and a damnable scowl did this contrast draw from st auban a scowl that lasted until escorted by the landlord the two ladies had withdrawn  there was an awkward pause when they were gone and methought from the look on st aubans face that he was about to provoke a fight after all not so however for after staring at us like a clown whilst one might tell a dozen he turned and strode to the door calling for his horse and those of his companions  au révoir m de luynes he said significantly as he got into the saddle  au révoir m de luynes said also malpertuis coming close up to me we shall meet again believe me  pray god that we may not if you would die in your bed i answered mockingly adieu     chapter vi of how andrea became lovesick   with what fictions i could call to mind i put off andreas questions touching the peculiar fashion of st aubans leavetaking tell him the truth and expose to him the situation whereof he was himself the unconscious centre i dared not lest his highspirited impetuosity should cause him to take into his own hands the reins of the affair and thus drive himself into irreparable disaster  andrea himself showed scant concern however and was luckily content with my hurriedly invented explanations his thoughts had suddenly found occupation in another and a gentler theme than the illhumour of men and presently his tongue betrayed them when he drew the conversation to the ladies to whom he had resigned his apartments  pardieu gaston he burst out she is a lovely maidsaw you ever a bonnier  indeed she is very beautiful i answered laughing to myself at the thought of how little he dreamt that it was of yvonne st albaret de canaples that he spoke and not minded for the while to enlighten him  if she be as kind and gentle as she is beautiful gaston welluncle giulios plans are likely to suffer shipwreck i shall not leave choisy until i have spoken to her in fact i shall not leave until she leaves  nevertheless we shall still be able to set out as we had projected after dining for in an hour or two at most they will proceed on their journey  he was silent for some moments then  to the devil with the cardinals plans quoth he banging his fist on the table i shall not go to blois  pooh why not  why not he halted for a moment then in a meandering toneyou have read perchance in storybooks he said of love being born from the first meeting of two pairs of eyes as a spark is born of flint and steel and you may have laughed at the conceit as i have laughed at it but laugh no more gaston for i who stand before you am one who has experienced this thing which poets tell of and which hitherto i have held in ridicule i will not go to blois becausebecauseenfin because i intend to go where she goes  then mon cher you will go to blois you will go to blois if not as a dutiful nephew resigned to obey his reverend uncles wishes at least because fate forces you to follow a pair of eyes that havehum what was it you said they did  do you say that she is going to blois how do you know  eh how do i know oh i heard her servant speaking with the hostler  so much the better then for thus if his eminence gets news of my whereabouts the news will not awaken his everready suspicions ciel how beautiful she is noted you her eyes her skin and what hair mon dieu like threads of gold  like threads of gold i echoed you are dreaming boy oh st gris i understand you are speaking of the fairhaired chit that was with her  he eyed me in amazement  t is you whose thoughts are wandering to that lanky noseintheair madame who accompanied her  i began a laugh that i broke off suddenly as i realised that it was not yvonne after all who had imprisoned his wits the cardinals plans were indeed likely to miscarry if he persisted thus  but t was the noseintheair madame as you call her with whom you spoke  aye but it was the goldenhaired lady that held my gaze pshaw who would mention them in a breath  who indeed said i but with a different meaning  thereafter seeing him listless i suggested a turn in the village to stretch our limbs before dining but he would have none of it and when i pressed the point with sound reasoning touching the benefits which health may cull from exercise he grew petulant as a wayward child she might descend whilst he was absent indeed she might require some slight service that lay perchance in his power to render her what an opportunity would he not lose were he abroad she might even depart before we returned and than that no greater calamity could just then befall him no he would not stir a foot from the inn a fig for exercise to the devil with health who sought an appetite not he he wished for no appetitecould contrive no base and vulgar appetite for food whilst his soul he swore was being consumed by the overwhelming alleffacing appetite to behold her  such meandering fools are most of us at nineteen when the heart is younga flawless mirror ready to hold the image of the first fair maid that looks into it through our eyes and as readyheaven knowsto relinquish it when the substance is withdrawn  but i who was not nineteen and the mirror of whose heartto pursue my metaphorwas dulled warped and cracked with much ill­usage grew sick of the boys enthusiasm and the monotony of a conversation which i could divert into no other channel from that upon which it had been started by a little slip of a girl with hair of gold and sapphire eyesi use andreas words and so i rose and bidding him take root in the tavern if so it pleased his fancy i left him there  wrapped in my cloak for the air was raw and damp i strode aimlessly along revolving in my mind what had befallen at the connétable that morning and speculating upon the issue that this quaint affair might have in matters of love or rather of matrimonywhich is not quite the same thingopposition is common enough but the opposers are usually members of either of the interested families now the familiesthat is to say the heads of the familiesbeing agreed and even anxious to bring about the union of yvonne de canaples and andrea de mancini it was something new to have a cabal of persons who from motives of principleas st auban had itshould oppose the alliance so relentlessly as to even resort to violence if no other means occurred to them it seemed vastly probable that andrea would be disposed of by a knife in the back and more than probable that a like fate would be reserved for me since i had constituted myself his guardian angel for my own part however i had a pronounced distaste to ending my days in so unostentatious a fashion i had also a notion that i should prove an exceedingly difficult person to assassinate and that those who sought to slip a knife into me would find my hide peculiarly tough and my hand peculiarly ready to return the compliment  so deeply did i sink into ponderings of this character that it was not until two hours afterwards that i again found myself drawing near the connétable  i reached the inn to find by the door a coach and by that coach andrea he stood bareheaded despite the cold conversing with all outward semblances of profound respect with those within it  so engrossed was he and so ecstatic that my approach was unheeded and when presently i noted that the coach was mademoiselle de canapless i ceased to wonder at the boys unconsciousness of what took place around him  clearly the farrier had been found at last and the horse shod afresh during my absence loath to interrupt so pretty a scene i waited aloof until these adieux should be concluded and whilst i waited there came to me from the carriage a sweet musical voice that was not yvonnes  may we not learn at least monsieur the name of the gentleman to whose courtesy we are indebted for having spent the past two hours without discomfort  my name mademoiselle is andrea de mancini that of the humblest of your servants and one to whom your thanks are a more than lavish payment for the trivial service he may have been fortunate enough to render you  dame what glibness doth a tongue acquire at court  m andrea de mancini came yvonnes voice in answer surely a relative of the lord cardinal  his nephew mademoiselle  ah my father sir is a great admirer of your uncle  from the halfcaressing tone as much as from the very words she uttered i inferred that she was in ignorance of the compact into which his eminence had entered with her fathera bargain whereof she was herself a part  i am rejoiced indeed mademoiselle replied andrea with a bow as though the compliment had been paid to him am i indiscreet in asking the name of monsieur your father  indiscreet nay monsieur you have a right to learn the name of those who are under an obligation to you my father is the chevalier de canaples of whom it is possible that you may have heard i am yvonne de canaples of whom it is unlikely that you should have heard and this is my sister geneviève whom a like obscurity envelops  the boys lips moved but no sound came from them whilst his cheeks went white and red by turns his courtliness of a moment ago had vanished and he stood sheepish and gauche as a clown at length he so far mastered himself as to bow and make a sign to the coachman who thereupon gathered up his reins  you are going presumably to blois he stammered with a nervous laugh as if the journey were a humorous proceeding  yes monsieur answered geneviève we are going home  why then it is possible that we shall meet again i too am travelling in that direction a bientôt mesdemoiselles  the whip cracked the coach began to move and the creaking of its wheels drowned so far as i was concerned the female voices that answered his farewell the coachman roused his horses into an amble the amble became a trot and the vehicle vanished round a corner some few idlers stopped to gaze stupidly after it but not half so stupidly as did my poor andrea standing bareheaded where the coach had left him  i drew near and laid my hand on his shoulder at the touch he started like one awakened suddenly and looked up  ahyou are returned gaston  to find that you have made a discovery and are overwhelmed by your error  my error  yesthat of falling in love with the wrong one hélas it is but one of those ironical jests wherewith fate amuses herself at every step of our lives had you fallen in love with yvonneand it passes my understanding why you did noteverything would have gone smoothly with your wooing unfortunately you have a preference for fair hair  have done he interrupted peevishly what does it signify to the devil with mazarins plans  so you said this morning  yes when i did not even dream her name was canaples  nevertheless she is the wrong canaples  for my unclebut mille diables sir t is i who am to wed and i shall wed as my heart bids me  hum and mazarin  faugh he answered with an expressive shrug  well since you are resolved let us dine  i have no appetite  let us dine notwithstanding eat you must if you would live and unless you livethink of ityoull never reach blois  gaston you are laughing at me i do not wish to eat  i surveyed him gravely with my arms akimbo  can love so expand the heart of man that it fills even his stomach well well if you will not eat at least have the grace to bear me company at table come andrea and i took his arm let us ascend to that chamber which she has but just quitted who can tell but that we shall find there some token of her recent presence if nothing more at least the air will be pervaded by the perfume she affected and since you scorn the humble food of man you can dine on that  he smiled despite himself as i drew him towards the staircase  scoffer quoth he your callous soul knows naught of love  whereas you have had three hours experience pardieu you shall instruct me in the gentle art  alas for those perfumes upon which i had proposed that he should feast himself if any the beautiful geneviève had left behind her they had been smothered in the vulgar yet appetising odour of the steaming ragoût that occupied the table  i prevailed at length upon the lovelorn boy to take some food but i could lead him to talk of naught save geneviève de canaples presently he took to chiding me for the deliberateness wherewith i ate and betrayed thereby his impatience to be in the saddle and after her i argued that whilst she saw him not she might think of him but the argument though sound availed me little and in the end i was forcedfor all that i am a man accustomed to please myselfto hurriedly end my repast and pronounce myself ready to start  as andrea had with him some store of baggagesince his sojourn at blois was likely to be of some durationhe travelled in a coach into this coach then we climbedhe and i his valet silvio occupied the seat beside the coachman whilst my stalwart michelot rode behind leading my horse by the bridle in this fashion we set out and ere long the silence of my thoughtful companion the monotonous rumbling of the vehicle and most important of all factors the good dinner that i had consumed bred in me a torpor that soon became a sleep  from a dream that bound hand and foot i was being dragged by st auban and malpertuis before the cardinal i awakened with a start to find that we were clattering already through the streets of etrechy so that whilst i had slept we had covered some six leagues twilight had already set in and andrea lay back idly in the carriage holding a book which it was growing too dark to read and between the leaves of which he had slipped his forefinger to mark the place where he had paused  his eyes met mine as i looked round and he smiled i should not have thought gaston he said that a man with so seared a conscience could have slept thus soundly  i have not slept soundly i grumbled recalling my dream  pardieu you have slept long at least  out of selfprotection so that i might not hear the name of geneviève de canaples t is a sweet name but you render it monotonous  he laughed goodhumouredly  have you never loved gaston  often  ahbut i mean did you never conceive a great passion  hundreds boy  but never such a one as mine  assuredly not for the world has never seen its fellow be good enough to pull the cord you cupid incarnate i wish to alight  you wish to alight why  because i am sick of love i am going to ride awhile with michelot whilst you dream of her coral lips her sapphire eyes and what other gems constitute her wondrous personality  two minutes later i was in the saddle riding with michelot in the wake of the carriage as i have already sought to indicate in these pages michelot was as much my friend as my servant it was therefore no more than natural that i should communicate to him my fears touching what might come of the machinations of st auban vilmorin and even perchance of that little firebrand malpertuis  night fell while we talked and at last the lights of Étampes where we proposed to lie peeped at us from a distance and food and warmth  it was eight oclock when we reached the town and a few moments later we rattled into the courtyard of the hôtel de lÉpée  andrea was out of temper to learn that mesdemoiselles de canaples had reached the place two hours earlier taken fresh horses and proceeded on their journey intending to reach monnerville that night he was even mad enough to propose that we should follow their example but my sober arguments prevailed and at Étampes we stayed till morning  andrea withdrew early but i having chanced upon a certain m de la vrillière a courtier of vilmorins stamp with whom i had some slight acquaintance and his purse being heavier than his wits i spent a passing profitable evening in his company this pretty gentleman hailed my advent with a delight that amazed me and suggested that we should throw a main together to kill time the dice were found and so clumsily did he use them that in half an hour playing for beggarly crowns he had lost twenty pistoles next he lost his temper and with an oath pitched the cubes into the fire swearing that they were toys for children and that i must grant him his révanche with cards the cards were furnished us and with a fortune that varied little we played lansquenet until long past midnight the fire died out in the grate and the air grew chill until at last with a violent sneeze la vrillière protested that he would play no more  cursing himself for the unluckiest being alive the fool bade me goodnight and left me seventy pistoles richer than when i had met him     chapter vii the chÂteau de canaples   despite the strenuous efforts which andrea compelled us to put forth we did not again come up with mesdemoiselles de canaples who in truth must have travelled with greater speed than ladies are wont to  this circumstance bred much discomfort in andreas bosom for in it he read that his geneviève thought not of him as he of her else knowing that he followed the same road she would have retarded their progress so that he might overtake them thus argued he when on the following night which was that of friday we lay at orleans but when towards noon on saturday our journey ended with our arrival at blois he went so far as to conclude that she had hastened on expressly to avoid him now from what i had seen of mademoiselle yvonne methought i might hazard a guess that she it was who commanded in theseand haply too in othermatters and that the manner of their journey had been such as was best to her wishes  with such an argument did i strive to appease andreas doubts but all in vainwhich is indeed no matter for astonishment for to reason with a man in love is to reason with one who knows no reason  after a brief halt at the lys de franceat which hostelry i hired myself a roomwe set out for the château de canaples which is situated on the left bank of the loire at a distance of about half a league from blois in the direction of tours  we cut a brave enough figure as we rode down the rue vieille attended by our servants and many a rustic blaisois stopped to gape at us to nudge his companion and point us out whispering the word paris  i had donned my grey velvet doubletdeeming the occasion worthy of itwhilst andrea wore a handsome suit of black with gold lace which for elegance it would have been difficult to surpass an air of pensiveness added interest to his handsome face and courtly figure and methought that geneviève must be hard to please if she fell not a victim to his wooing  we proceeded along the road bordering the loire a road of rare beauty at any other season of the year but now bare of foliage grey bleak and sullen as the clouds overhead and as cold to the eye as was the sharp wind to the flesh as we rode i fell to thinking of what my reception at the château de canaples was likely to be and almost to regret that i had permitted andrea to persuade me to accompany him long ago i had known the chevalier de canaples and for all the disparity in our agesfor he counted twice my yearswe had been friends and comrades that however was ten years ago in the old days when i owned something more than the name of luynes today i appeared before him as a ruined adventurer a soldier of fortune a ruffler a duellist who had almost slain his son in a brawl whose details might be known to him but not its origin seeing me in the company of andrea de mancini he mightwho could sayeven deem me one of those parasites who cling to young men of fortune so that they may live at their expense that the daughter would have formed such a conceit of me i was assured it but remained to see with what countenance the father would greet me  from such speculations i was at length aroused by our arrival at the gates of the canaples park seeing them wide open we rode between the two massive columns of granite each surmounted by a couchant lion holding the escutcheon of the canaples and proceeded at an ambling pace up the avenue through the naked trees the château became discerniblea brave old castle that once had been the stronghold of a feudal race long dead grey it was and attuned that day to the rest of the grey landscape but at its base the ivy grew thick and green and here and there long streaks of it crept up almost to the battlements whilst in one place it had gone higher yet and clothed one of the quaint old turrets a moat there had once been but this was now filled up and arranged into little mounds that became flowerbeds in summer  resigning our horses to the keeping of our servants we followed the grave maître dhôtel who had received us he led us across the spacious hall which had all the appearance of an armoury and up the regal staircase of polished oak on to a landing wide and lofty here turning to the left he opened a door and desired us to give ourselves the trouble of awaiting the chevalier we entered a handsome room hung in costly dutch tapestry and richly furnished yet with a sobriety of colour almost puritanical the long windows overlooked a broad terrace enclosed in a grey stone balustrade from which some halfdozen steps led to a garden below beyond that ran the swift waters of the loire and beyond that again in the distance we beheld the famous château de chambord built in the days of the first francis  i had but remarked these details when the door again opened to admit a short slender man in whose black hair and beard the hand of time had scattered but little of that white dust that marks its passage his face was pale thin and wrinkled and his grey eyes had a nervous restless look that dwelt not long on anything he was dressed in black with simple elegance and his deep collar and ruffles were of the finest point  welcome to canaples m de mancini he exclaimed as he hurried forward with a smile so winning that his countenance appeared transfigured by it welcome most cordially we had not hoped that you would arrive so soon but fortunately my daughters to whom you appear to have been of service at choisy warned me that you were journeying hither your apartments therefore are prepared for you and we hope that you will honour canaples by long remaining its guest  andrea thanked him becomingly  in truth he added my departure from paris was somewhat sudden but i have a letter here from monseigneur my uncle which explains the matter  no explanation is needed my dear andrea replied the old nobleman abandoning the formalities that had marked his welcoming speech how left you my lord cardinal he asked as he took the letter  in excellent health but somewhat harassed i fear by the affairs of state  ah yes yes but stay you are not alone and canapless grey eyes shot an almost furtive glance of inquiry in my direction a second glance followed the first and the chevaliers brows were knit then he came a step nearer scanning my face  surely surely monsieur he exclaimed before andrea had time to answer him were you not at rocroi  your memory flatters me monsieur i replied with a laugh i was indeed at rocroicaptain in the regiment of chévauxlégers whereof you were mestre de champ  his name said andrea is gaston de luynes my very dear friend counsellor and i might almost say protector  pardieu yes gaston de luynes he ejaculated seizing my hand in an affectionate grip but how have you fared since rocroi was fought for a soldier of such promise one might have predicted great things in ten years  hélas monsieur i was dismissed the service after senlac  dismissed the service  pah i laughed not without bitterness t is a long story and an ugly one divided twixt the dicebox the bottle and the scabbard ten years ago i was a promising young captain ardent and ambitious today i am a broken ruffler unrecognised by my familya man without hope without ambition almost without honour  i know not what it was that impelled me to speak thus haply the wish that since he must soon learn to what depths gaston de luynes had sunk he should at least learn it from my own lips at the outset  he shuddered at my concluding words and had not andrea at that moment put his arm affectionately upon my shoulder and declared me the bravest fellow and truest friend in all the world it is possible that the chevalier de canaples would have sought an excuse to be rid of me such men as he seek not the acquaintance of such men as i  to please andrea was however of chief importance in his plans and to that motive i owe it that he pressed me to remain a guest at the château i declined the honour with the best grace i could command determined that whilst andrea remained at canaples i would lodge at the lys de france in blois independent and free to come or go as my fancy bade me his invitation that i should at least dine at canaples i accepted but with the condition that he should repeat his invitation after he had heard something that i wished to tell him he assented with a puzzled look and when presently andrea repaired to his apartments and we were alone i began  you have doubtlessly received news monsieur of a certain affair in which your son had recently the misfortune to be dangerously wounded  we were standing by the great marble fireplace and canaples was resting one of his feet upon the huge brass andirons he made a gesture of impatience as i spoke  my son sir is a fool a goodfornothing fool oh i have heard of this affair a vulgar tavern brawl the fifth in which his name has been involved and besmirched i had news this morning by a courier dispatched me by my friend st simon who imagines that i am deeply concerned in that young profligate i learn that he is out of danger and that in a month or so he will be about again and ready to disgrace the name of canaples afresh but there sir i crave your pardon for the interruption  i bowed and when in answer to my questions he told me that he was in ignorance of the details of the affair of which i spoke i set about laying those details before him beginning with the original provocation in the palais royal and ending with the fight in the horsemarket i related the whole story to him but in an impersonal manner and keeping my own name out of my narrative when i had done canaples muttered an oath of the days of the fourth henry  ventre st gris does the dog carry his audacity so far as to dare come betwixt me and my wishes and to strive against them he sought to kill mancini eh would to heaven he had died by the hand of this fellow who shielded the lad  monsieur i cried aghast at so unnatural an expression  pah he cried harshly he is my son in name alone filial he never was  nevertheless monsieur he is still your son your heir  my heir and what pray does he inherit a titlea barren landless title by his shameful conduct he alienated the affection of his uncle and his uncle has disinherited him in favour of yvonne t is she who will be mistress of this château with its acres of land reaching from here to blois and three times as far on the other side my brother sir was the rich canaples the owner of all this and by his testament i am his heir during my lifetime the estates going to yvonne at my death so that you see i have naught to leave but if i had not a dénier should go to my worthless son  he spread his thin hands before the blaze and for a moment there was silence then i proceeded to tell him of the cabal which had been formed against mancini and of the part played by st auban at the mention of that name he started as if i had stung him  what he thundered is that ruffian also in the affair sangdieu his motives are not far to seek he is a suitoran unfavoured suitorfor the hand of yvonne that seemingly still hopes but you have not told me monsieur the name of this man who has stood betwixt andrea and his assassins  can you not guess monsieur quoth i looking him squarely in the face did you not hear andrea call me even now his protector  you and with what motive pray  at first as i have told you because the cardinal gave me no choice in the matter touching your son since then my motive has lain in my friendship for the boy he has been kind and affectionate to one who has known little kindness or affection in life i seek to repay him by advancing his interests and his happiness that monsieur is why i am here todayto shield him from st auban and his fellows should they appear again as i believe they will  the old man stood up and eyed me for a moment as steadily as his vacillating glance would permit him then he held out his hand  i trust monsieur he said that you will do me the honour to dine with us and that whilst you are at blois we shall see you at canaples as often as it may please you to cross its threshold  i took his hand but without enthusiasm for i understood that his words sprang from no warmth of heart for me but merely from the fact that he beheld in me a likely ally to his designs of raising his daughter to the rank of duchess  eugène de canaples may have been a goodfornothing knave still methought his character scarce justified the callous indifference manifested by this selfish weakminded old man towards his own son  there was a knock at the door and a lackeythe same guilbert whom i had seen at choisy in mademoiselles companyappeared with the announcement that the chevalier was served     chapter viii the foreshadow of disaster   in the spacious dining salon of the château de canaples i found the two daughters of my host awaiting usthose same two ladies of the coach in place vendôme and of the hostelry at choisy the dark and stately icicle yvonne and the fair playful doll geneviève  i bowed my best bow as the chevalier presented me and from the corner of my eye with inward malice i watched them as i did so geneviève curtsied with a puzzled air and a sidelong glance at her sister yvonne accorded me the faintest the coldest inclination of her head whilst her cheeks assumed a colour that was unwonted  we have met before i think monsieur she said disdainfully  true mademoiselleonce i answered thinking only of the coach  twice monsieur she corrected whereupon i recalled how she had surprised me with my arm about the waist of the innkeepers daughter and had heaven given me shame i might have blushed but if sweet yvonne thought to bring gaston de luynes to task for profiting by the good things which gods providence sent his way she was led by vanity into a prodigious error  twice indeed mademoiselle but the service which you rendered me upon the first occasion was so present to my mind just now that it eclipsed the memory of our second meeting i have ever since desired mademoiselle that an opportunity might be mine wherein to thank you for the preservation of my life i do so now and at your service do i lay that life which you preserved and which is therefore as much yours as mine  strive as i might i could not rid my tone of an ironical inflection i was goaded to it by her attitude by the scornful turn of her lip and the disdainful glance of her grey eyesshe had her fathers eyes saving that her gaze was as steadfast as his was furtive  what is this quoth canaples you owe your life to my daughter pray tell me of it  with all my heart i made haste to answer before mademoiselle could speak a week ago i disagreed upon a question of great delicacy with a certain gentleman who shall be nameless the obvious result attended our disagreement and we fought neath the eyes of a vast company of spectators right was on my side and the gentleman hurt himself upon my sword well sir the crowd snarled at me as though it were my fault that this had so befallen and i flouted the crowd in answer they were a hundred opposed to one and so confident did this circumstance render them of their superiority that for once those whelps displayed sufficient valour to attack me i fled and as a coach chanced to come that way i clutched at the window and hung there within the coach there were two ladies and one of them taking compassion upon me invited me to enter and thus rescued me that lady sir i ended with a bow was mademoiselle your daughter  in his eyes i read it that he had guessed the name of my nameless gentleman  the ladies were struck dumb by my apparent effrontery yvonne at last recovered sufficiently to ask if my presence at the château arose from my being attached to m de mancini now attached is an unpleasant word a courtier is attached to the king a soldier to the army there is humiliation in neither of these but to a private gentleman a man may be only attached as his secretary his valet or possibly as his bravo therein lay the sting of her carefully chosen word  i am m de mancinis friend i answered with simple dignity  for all reply she raised her eyebrows in token of surprise canaples looked askance i bit my lip and an awkward silence followed which luckily was quickly ended by the appearance of andrea  the ladies received him graciously and a faint blush might to searching eyes have been perceived upon genevièves cheek  there came a delicate exchange of compliments after which we got to table and for my part i did ample justice to the viands  i sat beside geneviève and visàvis with andrea who occupied the place of the honoured guest at the hosts right hand with yvonne beside him me it concerned little where i sat since the repast was all that i could look for not so the others andrea scowled at me because i was nearer to geneviève than he and yvonne frowned at me for other reasons by geneviève i was utterly disregarded and my endeavours to converse were sorely unsuccessfulfor one may not converse alone  i clearly saw that yvonne only awaited an opportunity to unmask me and denounce me to her father as the man who had sought his sons life  this opportunity however came not until the moment of my departure from the château that evening i was crossing the hail with the chevalier de canaples and we had stopped for a moment to admire a piece of old chain armour of the days of the crusaders andrea and geneviève had preceded us and passed out through the open doorway whilst yvonne lingered upon the threshold looking back  i trust m de luynes said canaples as we moved towards her that you will remember my invitation and that whilst you remain at biois we shall see you here as often as you may be pleased to come indeed i trust that you will be a daily visitor  before i could utter a replyfather exclaimed mademoiselle coming forward do you know to whom you are offering the hospitality of canaples  why that question child to m de luynes m de mancinis friend  and the wouldbe murderer of eugène she added fiercely  canaples started  surely such affairs are not for women to meddle with he cried moreover m de luynes has already given me all details of the affair  her eyes grew very wide at that  he has told you yet you invite him hither she exclaimed  m de luynes has naught wherewith to reproach himself nor have i those details which he has given me i may not impart to you suffice it however that i am satisfied that his conduct could not have been other than it was whereas that of my son reflects but little credit upon his name  she stamped her foot and her eyes blazing with anger passed from one to the other of us  and youyou believe this mans story  yvonne  possibly i interposed coolly mademoiselle may have received some false account of it that justifies her evident unbelief in what i may have told you  it is not easy to give a lie unless you can prove it a lie i made her realise this and she bit her lip in vexation dame what a pretty viper i thought her at that moment  let me add yvonne said her father that m de luynes and i are old comrades in arms then turning to memy daughter sir is but a child and therefore hasty to pass judgment upon matters beyond her understanding forget this foolish outburst and remember only my assurance of an ever cordial welcome  with all my heart i answered after a moments deliberation during which i had argued that for once i must stifle pride if i would serve andrea  ough was all mademoiselles comment as she turned her back upon me nevertheless i bowed and flourished my beaver to her retreating figure  clearly mademoiselle entertained for me exactly that degree of fondness which a pious hermit feels for the devil and if i might draw conclusions from what evidences i had had of the strength of her character and the weakness of her fathers our sojourn at blois promised to afford me little delectation in fact i foresaw many difficulties that might lead to disaster should our paris friends appear upon the scenea contingency this that seemed overimminent  it was not my wont howbeit to brood over the evils that the future might hold and to this i owe it that i slept soundly that night in my room at the lys de france  it was a pleasant enough chamber on the first floor overlooking the street and having an alcove attached to it which served for michelot  next day i visited the château de canaples early in the afternoon the weather was milder and the glow of the sun heralded at last the near approach of spring and brightened wondrously a landscape that had yesterday worn so forbidding a look  this change it must have been that drew the ladies and andrea with them to walk in the park where i came upon them as i rode up their laughter rippled merrily and they appeared upon the best of terms until they espied me my advent was like a cloud that foretells a storm and drove mesdemoiselles away when they had accorded me a greeting that contained scant graciousness  all unruffled by this act from which i gathered that yvonne the strong had tutored geneviève the frail concerning me i consigned my horse to a groom of the château and linked arms with andrea  well boy quoth i what progress  he smiled radiantly  my hopes are all surpassed it exceeds belief that so poor a thing as i should find favour in her eyeswhat eyes gaston he broke off with a sigh of rapture  peste you have lost no time and so already you know that you find favour eh how know you that  how need a man be told such things there is an inexpressible  my good andrea seek not to express it therefore i interrupted hastily let it suffice that the inexpressible exists and makes you happy his eminence will doubtless share your joy have you written to him  the mirth faded from the lads face at the words as the blossom fades neath the blighting touch of frost what he said was so undutiful from a nephew touching his uncleparticularly when that uncle is a prelatethat i refrain from penning it  we were joined just then by the chevalier and together we strolled round to the rosegardennow alas naught but black and naked bushesand down to the edge of the loire yellow and swollen by the recent rains  how lovely must be this place in summer i mused looking across the water towards chambord and dame i cried suddenly changing my meditations what an ideal fencing ground is this even turf  the swordsmans instinct laughed canaples  and with that our talk shifted to swords swordsmen and swordplay until i suggested to andrea that he should resume his practice whereupon the chevalier offered to set a room at our disposal  nay if you will pardon me monsieur t is not a room we want i answered a room is well enough at the outset but it is the common error of fencingmasters to continue their tutoring on a wooden floor it results from this that when the neophyte handles a real sword and defends his life upon the turf the ground has a new feeling its elasticity or even its slipperiness discomposes him and sets him at a disadvantage  he agreed with me whilst andrea expressed a wish to try the turf foils were brought and we whiled away best part of an halfhour in the end the chevalier who had watched my play intently offered to try a bout with me and so amazed was he with the result that he had not done talking of it when i left canaples a few hours latera homage this that earned me some more than ordinarily unfriendly glances from yvonne no doubt since the accomplishment was mine it became in her eyes characteristic of a bully and a ruffler  during the week that followed i visited the château with regularity and with equal regularity did andrea receive his fencing lessons the object of his presence at canaples however was being frustrated more and more each day so far as the cardinal and the chevalier were concerned  he raved to me of geneviève the one perfect woman in all the world and brought into it by a kind providence for his own particular delectation in truth love is like a rabid dogwhom it bites it renders mad so open grew his wooing and so ardent that one evening i thought well to take him aside and caution him  my dear andrea said i if you will love geneviève you will and theres an end of it but if you would not have the chevalier pack you back to paris and the anger of my lord cardinal be circumspect and at least when m de canaples is by divide your homage equally betwixt the two t were well if you dissembled even a slight preference for yvonneshe will not be misled by it seeing how unmistakable at all other seasons must be your wooing of geneviève  he was forced to avow the wisdom of my counsel and to be guided by it  nevertheless i rode back to my hostelry in no pleasant frame of mind it was more than likely that a short shrift and a length of hemp would be the acknowledgment i should anon receive from mazarin for my participation in the miscarriage of his desires  i felt that disaster was on the wing call it a premonition call it what you will i know but this that as i rode into the courtyard of the lys de france at dusk the first man my eyes alighted on was the marquis césar de st auban and in conversation with him six of the most arrantlooking ruffians that ever came out of paris     chapter ix of how a whip proved a better argument than a tongue   i crave monsieurs pardon but there is a gentleman below who desires to speak with you immediately  how does this gentleman call himself m lhote  m le marquis de st auban answered the landlord still standing in the doorway  it wanted an hour or so to noon on the day following that of st aubans arrival at blois and i was on the point of setting out for the château on an errand of warning  it occurred to me to refuse to see the marquis but remembering betimes that from your enemys speech you may sometimes learn where to look for his next attack i thought better of it and bade my host admit him  i strode over to the fire and stirring the burning logs i put my back to the blaze and waited  steps sounded on the stairs there was the shuffling of the landlords slippered feet and the firm tread of my visitor accompanied by the jingle of spurs and the clank of his scabbard as it struck the balustrade then my door was again opened and st auban as superbly dressed as ever was admitted  we bowed formally as men bow who are about to cross swords and whilst i waited for him to speak i noted that his face was pale and bore the impress of suppressed anger  so m de luynes again we meet  by your seeking m le marquis  you are not polite  you are not opportune  he smiled dangerously  i learn monsieur that you are a daily visitor at the château de canaples  well sir what of it  this i have been to canaples this morning and knowing that you will learn anon from that old dotard what passed between us i prefer that you shall hear it first from me  i bowed to conceal a smile  thanks to you m de luynes i was ordered from the house icésar de st aubanhave been ordered from the house of a provincial upstart thanks to the calumnies which you poured into his ears  calumnies was that the word  i choose the word that suits me best he answered and the rage that was in him at the affront he had suffered at the hands of the chevalier de canaples was fast rising to the surface i warned you at choisy of what would befall your opposition and your alliance with m de mancini are futile you think to have gained a victory by winning over to your side an old fool who will sacrifice his honour to see his daughter a duchess but i tell you sir  that you hope to see her a marchioness i put in calmly you see m de st auban i have learned something since i came to blois  he grew livid with passion  you shall learn more ere you quit it you meddler you shall be taught to keep that long nose of yours out of matters that concern you not  i laughed  loud threats i answered jeeringly  never fear he cried there is more to follow to your cost shall you learn it by god sir do you think that i am to suffer a sicilian adventurer and a broken tavern ruffler to interfere with my designs  still i kept my temper  so i said in a bantering tone you confess that you have designs good but what says the lady eh i am told that she is not yet outrageously enamoured of you for all your beauty  beside himself with passion his hand sought his sword but the gesture was spasmodic  knave he snarled  knave to me have a care st auban or ill find you a shroud for a wedding garment  knave he repeated with a snarl what price are you paid by that boy  pardieu st auban you shall answer to me for this  answer for it to you and he laughed harshly you are mad my master when did a st auban cross swords with a man of your stamp  m le marquis i said with a calmness that came of a stupendous effort at choisy you sought my friendship with highsounding talk of principles that opposed you to the proposed alliance twixt the houses of mancini and canaples since then i have learned that your motives were purely personal from my discovery i hold you to be a liar  monsieur  i have not yet done you refuse to cross swords with me on the pretext that you do not fight men of my stamp i am no saint sir i confess but my sins cannot wash out my namethe name of a family accounted as good as that of st auban and one from which a constable of france has sprung whereas yours has never yet bred aught but profligates and debauchees you are little better than i am marquis indeed you do many things that i would not do that i have never done for instance whilst refusing to cross blades with me who am a soldier and a man of the sword you seek to pick a fight with a beardless boy who hardly knows the use of a rapier and whowittingly at leasthas done you no wrong now my master you may call me profligate ruffler gamester duellistwhat you will but there are two viler things you cannot dub me and which methinks i have proven you to beliar and craven  and as i spoke the burning words i stood close up to him and tapped his breast as if to drive the epithets into his very heart  rage he felt indeed and his distorted countenance was a sight fearful to behold  now my master i added setting my arms akimbo and laughing brutally in his face will you fight  for a moment he wavered and surely meseemed that i had drawn him then  no he cried passionately i will not do dishonour to my sword and turning he made for the door leaving me baffled  go sir i shouted but fame shall stalk fast behind you liar and craven will i dub you throughout the whole of france  he stopped neath the lintel and faced me again  fool he sneered youll need dispatch to spread my fame so far by this time tomorrow youll be arrested in three days you will be in the bastille and there shall you lie until you rot to carrion  loud threats again i laughed hoping by the taunt to learn more  loud perchance but not empty learn that the cardinal has knowledge of your association with mancini and means to separate you an officer of the guards is on his way to blois he is at meung by now he bears a warrant for your arrest and delivery to the governor of the bastille thereafter none may say what will betide and with a coarse burst of laughter he left me banging the door as he passed out  for a moment i stood there stricken by his parting words he had sought to wound me and in this he had succeeded but at what cost to himself in his blind rage the fool had shown me that which he should have zealously concealed and what to him was but a stinging threat was to me a timely warning i saw the necessity for immediate action two things must i do kill st auban first then fly the cardinals warrant as best i could i cast about me for means to carry out the first of these intentions my eye fell upon my ridingwhip lying on a chair close to my hand and the sight of it brought me the idea i sought seizing it i bounded out of the room and down the stairs three steps at a stride  along the corridor i sped and into the commonroom which at the moment was tolerably full as i entered by one door the marquis was within three paces of the other leading to the courtyard  my whip in the air i sprang after him and he hearing the rush of my onslaught turned then uttered a cry of pain as i brought the lash caressingly about his shoulders  now master craven i shouted will that change your mind  with an almost inarticulate cry he sought to draw there and then but those about flung themselves upon us and held us aparti passive and unresisting the marquis bellowing struggling and foaming at the mouth  to meet you now would be to murder you marquis i said coolly send your friends to me to appoint the time  soit he cried his eyes blazing with a hate unspeakable at eight tomorrow morning i shall await you on the green behind the castle of blois  at eight oclock i shall be there i answered and now gentlemen if you will unhand me i will return to my apartments  they let me go but with many a growl and angry look for in their eyes i was no more than a coarse aggressor whilst their sympathy was all for st auban     chapter x the conscience of malpertuis   and so back to my room i went my task accomplished and so pleased was i with what had passed that as i drew on my bootspreparing to set out to canaplesi laughed softly to myself  st auban i would dispose of in the morning as for the other members of the cabal i deemed neither vilmorin nor malpertuis sufficiently formidable to inspire uneasiness st auban gone they too would vanish there remained then eugène de canaples him however methought no great evil was to be feared from in paris he might be as loudvoiced as he pleased but in his fathers châteaufrom what i had learnedt was unlikely he would so much as show himself moreover he was wounded and before he had sufficiently recovered to offer interference it was more than probable that andrea would have married one or the other of mesdemoiselles de canaplesthough i had a shrewd suspicion that it would be the wrong one and there again i feared trouble  as i stood up booted and ready to descend there came a gentle tap at my door and in answer to my enter there stood before me a very dainty and foppish figure i stared hard at the effeminate face and the long fair locks of my visitor thinking that i had become the dupe of my eyes  m de vilmorin i murmured in astonishment as he came forward having closed the door you here  in answer he bowed and greeted me with cold ceremoniousness  i have been in blois since yesterday monsieur  in truth i might have guessed it vicomte your visit flatters me for of course i take it you are come to pay me your respects i said ironically a glass of wine vicomte  a thousand thanks monsieurno he answered coldly in his mincing tones it is concerning your affair with m le marquis de st auban that i am come and drawing forth a dainty kerchief which filled the room with the scent of ambregris he tapped his lips with it affectedly  do you come as friend orin some other capacity  i come as mediator  mediator i echoed and my brow grew dark sdeath has st aubans courage lasted just so long as the sting of my whip  he raised his eyebrows after a supercilious fashion that made me thirst to strike the chair from under him  you misapprehend me m de st auban has no desire to avert the duel on the contrary he will not rest until the affront you have put upon him be washed out  it will be ill answer for it  your answer sir is characteristic of a fanfarron he who promises most does not always fulfil most  i stared at him in amazement  shall i promise you something vicomte mortdieu if you seek to pick a quarrel with me  god forbid he ejaculated turning colour and his suddenly awakened apprehensions swept aside the affectation that hitherto had marked his speech and manner  then monsieur be brief and state the sum of this mediation  it is this monsieur in the heat of the moment m le marquis gave you in the hearing of half a score of people an assignation for tomorrow morning news of the affair will spread rapidly through blois and it is likely there will be no lack of spectators on the green to witness the encounter therefore as my friend thinks this will be as unpalatable to you as it is to him he has sent me to suggest a fresh rendezvous  pooh sir i answered lightly i care not for myself who comes i am accustomed to a crowd still since m de st auban finds it discomposing let us arrange otherwise  there is yet another point m de st auban spoke to you i believe of an officer who is coming hither charged with your arrest it is probable that he may reach blois before morning so that the marquis thinks that to make certain you might consent to meet him tonight  ma foi st auban is indeed in earnest then convey to him my expressions of admiration at this suddenly awakened courage be good enough vicomte to name the rendezvous  do you know the chapel of st sulpice des reaux  what beyond the loire  precisely monsieur about a league from chambord by the river side  i can find the place  will you meet us there at nine oclock to­night  i looked askance at him  but why cross the river this side affords many likely spots  very true monsieur but the marquis has business at chambord this evening after which there will be no reasonindeed it will inconvenience him exceedinglyto return to blois  what i cried more and more astonished st auban is leaving blois  this evening sir  but voyons vicomte why make an assignation in such a place and at night when at any hour of the day i can meet the marquis on this side without suffering the inconvenience of crossing the river  there will be a bright moon well up by nine oclock moreover remember that you cannot as you say meet st auban on this side at any time he may appoint since tonight or tomorrow the officer who is in search of you will arrive  i pondered for a moment then  m le vicomte i said in this matter of ground t is i who have the first voice  how so  because the marquis is the affronted one  therefore he has a right to choose  a right yes but that is not enough the necessity to fight is on his side his honour is hurt not mine i have whipped him i am content now let him come to me  assuredly you will not be so ungenerous  i do not care about journeying to reaux to afford him satisfaction  does monsieur fear anything  vicomte you go too far i cried my pride gaining the mastery since it is asked of mei will go  m le marquis will be grateful to you  a fig for his gratitude i answered whereupon the vicomte shrugged his narrow shoulders and his errand done took his leave of me  when he was gone i called michelot to tell him of the journey i must go that night so that he might hold himself in readiness  whyif monsieur will pardon me quoth he do you go to meet the marquis de st auban at st sulpice des reaux by night  precisely what i asked vilmorin the marquis desires it andwhat will yousince i am going to kill the man i can scarce do less than kill him on a spot of his own choosing  michelot screwed up his face and scratched at his grey beard with his huge hand  does no suspicion of foul play cross your mind monsieur he inquired timidly  shame on you michelot i returned with some heat you do not yet understand the ways of gentlemen think you that m de st auban would stoop to such a deed as that he would be shamed for ever pooh i would as soon suspect my lord cardinal of stealing the chalices from nôtre dame go see to my horse i am riding to canaples  as i rode out towards the château i fell to thinking and my thoughts turning to vilmorin i marvelled at the part he was playing in this little comedy of a cabal against andrea de mancini his tastes and instincts were of the boudoir the antechamber and the table he wore a sword because it was so ordained by fashion and because the hilt was convenient for the display of a jewel or two certainly t was not for utility that it hung beside him and no man had ever seen it drawn nature had made him the most pitiable coward begotten why then should he involve himself in an affair which promised bloodshed and which must be attended by many a risk for him there was in all this some mystery that i could not fathom  from the course into which they had slipped my thoughts were diverted when i was within half a mile of the château by the sight of a horseman stationed motionless among the trees that bordered the road it occurred to me that men take not such a position without purposeusually an evil one i slackened speed somewhat and rode on watching him sharply as i came up he walked his horse forward to meet me and i beheld a man in the uniform of the gardes du corps in whom presently i recognised the little sparrow malpertuis with whom i had exchanged witticisms at choisy he was the one man wanting to complete the trinity that had come upon us at the inn of the connétable  it flashed across my mind that he might be the officer charged with my arrest and that he had arrived sooner than had been expected if so it was likely to go ill with him for i was not minded to be taken until st aubans soul sped hellwards  he hailed me as i advanced and indeed rode forward to meet me  you are come at last m de luynes was his greeting i have waited for you this hour past  how knew you i should ride this way  i learnt that you would visit canaples before noon be good enough to quit the road and pass under those trees with me i have something to say to you but it were not well that we should be seen together  for the sake of your character or mine m malappris  malpertuis he snapped  malpertuis i corrected you were saying that we should not be seen together  st auban might hear of it  ah and therefore  you shall learn we were now under the trees which albeit leafless yet screened us partly from the road he drew rein and i followed his example  m de luynes he began i am or was a member of the cabal formed against mazarins aims in the matter of the marriage of mademoiselle de canaples to his nephew i joined hands with st auban lured by his protestations that it is not meet that such an heiress as yvonne de canaples should be forced to marry a foreigner of no birth and less distinction whilst france holds so many noble suitors to her hand this motive by which i know that even eugène de canaples was actuated was st auban gave me to understand his only one for embarking upon this business as it was also vilmorins now m de luynes i have to­day discovered that i had been duped by st auban and his dupe vilmorin st auban lied to me another motive brings him into the affair he seeks himself by any means that may present themselves to marry yvonneand her estates whilst the girl i am told loathes him beyond expression vilmorin again is actuated by no less a purpose and so what think you these two knavesthis master knave and his dupehave determined to carry off mademoiselle by force  sangdieu i burst out and would have added more but his gesture silenced me and he continued  vilmorin believes that st auban is helping him in this whereas st auban is but fooling him with ambiguous speeches until they have the lady safe then might will assert itself and st auban need but show his fangs to drive the sneaking coward away from the prize he fondly dreams is to be his  when do these gentlemen propose to carry out their plan have they determined that i inquired breathlessly  aye they have they hope to accomplish it this very day mademoiselle de canaples has received a letter wherein she is asked to meet her anonymous writer in the coppice yonder at the angelus this evening if she would learn news of great importance to her touching a conspiracy against her father  faugh i sneered t is too poor a bait to lure her with  say you so believe me that unless she be dissuaded she will comply with the invitation so cunningly was the letter couched a closed carriage will be waiting at this very spot into this st auban vilmorin and their bravos will thrust the girl then away through blois and beyond it for a mile or so in the direction of meung thereby misleading any chance pursuers there they will quit the coach and take a boat that is to be in waiting for them and which will bear them back with the stream to chambord thereafter god pity the poor lady if they get thus far without mishap  mort de ma vie i cried slapping my thigh i understand and to myself i thought of the assignation at st sulpice des reaux and the reason for this as also st aubans resolution to so suddenly quit blois grew of a sudden clear to me also did i recall the riddle touching vilmorins conduct which a few moments ago i had puzzled over and of which methought that i now held the solution  what do you understand asked malpertuis  something that was told me this morning i made answer then spoke of gratitude wherein he cut me short  i ask no thanks he said curtly you owe me none what i have done is not for love of you or mancinifor i love neither of you it is done because noblesse moblige i told st auban that i would have no part in this outrage but that is not enough i owe it to my honour to attempt the frustration of so dastardly a plan you m de luynes appear to be the most likely person to encompass this in the interests of your friend mancini i leave the matter therefore in your hands good­day  and with this abrupt leavetaking the little fellow doffed his hat to me and wheeling his horse he set spurs in its flanks and was gone before a word of mine could have stayed him     chapter xi of a womans obstinacy   m de luynes is a wizard quoth andrea laughing in answer to something that had been said  it was afternoon we had dined and the bright sunshine and springlike mildness of the weather had lured us out upon the terrace yvonne and geneviève occupied the stone seat andrea had perched himself upon the granite balustrade and facing them he sat swinging his shapely legs to and fro as he chatted merrily whilst on either side of him stood the chevalier de canaples and i  if m de luynes be as great a wizard in other things as with the sword then pardieu he is a fearful magician said canaples  i bowed yet not so low but that i detected a sneer on yvonnes lips  so pretty lady said i to myself we shall see if presently your lip will curl when i show you something of my wizards art  and presently my chance came m de canaples found reason to leave us and no sooner was he gone than geneviève remembered that she had that day discovered a budding leaf upon one of the rose bushes in the garden below andrea naturally caused an argument by asserting that she was the victim of her fancy as it was by far too early in the year by that means these two found the plea they sought for quitting us since neither could rest until the other was convinced  so down they went into that rose garden which methought was like to prove their fools paradise and yvonne and i were left alone then she also rose but as she was on the point of quitting me  mademoiselle i ventured will you honour me by remaining for a moment there is something that i would say to you  with raised eyebrows she gave me a glance mingled with that superciliousness which she was for ever bestowing upon me and which from the monotony of it alone grew irksome  what can you have to say to me m de luynes  will you not be seated i shall not long detain you nevertheless  if i stand perchance you will be more brief i am waiting monsieur  i shrugged my shoulders rudely why indeed be courteous where so little courtesy was met with  a little while ago mademoiselle when m de mancini dubbed me a wizard you were good enough to sneer now a sneer mademoiselle implies unbelief and i would convince you that you were wrong to disbelieve  if you have no other motive for detaining me suffer me to depart she interrupted with some warmth whether you be a wizard or not is of no moment to me  and yet i dare swear that you will be of a different mind within five minutes a wizard is one who discloses things unknown to his fellowmen i am about to convince you that i can do this and by convincing you i am about to serve you  i seek neither conviction nor service at your hands she answered  your courtesy dumfounds me mademoiselle  no less than does your insolence dumfound me she retorted with crimson cheeks do you forget sir that i know you for what you area gamester a libertine a duellist the murderer of my brother  that your brother lives mademoiselle is methinks sufficient proof that i have not murdered him  you willed his death if you did not encompass it so t is all one do you not understand that it is because my father receives you here thanks to m de mancini your frienda friendship easily understood from the advantages you must derive from itthat i consent to endure your presence and the insult of your glance is it not enough that i should do this and have you not wit enough to discern it without adding to my shame by your insolent call upon my courtesy  her words cut me as no words that i ever heard and more than her words her tone of loathing and disgust unspeakable for half that speech i should have killed a manindeed i had killed men for less than half and yet for all the passion that raged in my soul i preserved upon my countenance a smiling mask that smile exhausted her patience and increased her loathing for with a contemptuous exclamation she turned away  tarry but a moment mademoiselle i cried with a sudden note of command or if you will go go then but take with you my assurance that before nightfall you will weep bitterly for it  my words arrested her the mystery of them awakened her curiosity  you speak in riddles monsieur  like a true wizard mademoiselle you received a letter this morning in a handwriting unknown and bearing no signature  she wheeled round and faced me again with a little gasp of astonishment  how know you that ah i understand you wrote it  what shrewdness mademoiselle i laughed ironically come think again what need have i to bid you meet me in the coppice yonder may i not speak freely with you here  you know the purport of that letter  i do mademoiselle and i know more i know that this hinted conspiracy against your father is a trumpedup lie to lure you to the coppice  and for what purpose pray  an evil oneyour abduction shall i tell you who penned that note and who awaits you the marquis césar de st auban  she shuddered as i pronounced the name then looking me straight between the eyeshow come you to know these things she inquired  what does it signify since i know them  this monsieur that unless i learn how i can attach no credit to your preposterous story  not credit it i cried let me assure you that i have spoken the truth let me swear it go to the coppice at the appointed time and things will fall out as i have predicted  again monsieur how know you this she persisted as women will  i may not tell you  we stood close together and her clear grey eyes met mine her lip curling in disdain  you may not tell me you need not i can guess and she tossed her shapely head and laughed seek some likelier story monsieur had you not spoken of it t is likely i should have left the letter unheeded but your disinterested warning has determined me to go to this rendezvous shall i tell you what i have guessed that this conspiracy against my father the details of which you would not have me learn is some evil of your own devising ah you change colour she cried pointing to my face then with a laugh of disdain she left me before i had sufficiently recovered from my amazement to bid her stay  ciel i cried as i watched the tall lissom figure vanish through the portals of the château did ever god create so crass and obstinate a thing as woman  it occurred to me to tell andrea and bid him warn her but then she would guess that i had prompted him naught remained but to lay the matter before the chevalier de canaples already i had informed him of my fracas with st auban and of the duel that was to be fought that night and he in his turn had given me the details of his stormy interview with the marquis which had culminated in st aubans dismissal from canaples i had not hitherto deemed it necessary to alarm him with the news imparted to me by malpertuis imagining that did i inform mademoiselle that would suffice  now however as i have said no other course was left me but to tell him of it accordingly i went within and inquired of guilbert whom i met in the hall where i might find the chevalier he answered me that m de canaples was not in the château it was believed that he had gone with m louis the intendant of the estates to visit the vineyards at montcroix  the news made me choke with impatience already it was close upon five oclock and in another hour the sun would set and the angelus would toll the knell of mademoiselles preposterous suspicions unless in the meantime i had speech with canaples and led him to employ a fathers authority to keep his daughter indoors  fuming at the contretemps i called for my horse and set out at a brisk trot for montcroix but my ride was fruitless the vineyard peasants had not seen the chevalier for over a week  now twixt montcroix and the château there lies a good league and to make matters worse as i galloped furiously back to canaples an evil chance led me to mistake the way and pursue a track that brought me out on the very banks of the river with a strong belt of trees screening the château from sight and defying me to repair my error by going straight ahead  i was forced to retrace my steps and before i had regained the point where i had gone astray a precious quarter of an hour was wasted and the sun already hung a dull red globe on the brink of the horizon  clenching my teeth i tore at my horses flanks and with a bloody heel i drove the maddened brute along at a pace that might have cost us both dearly i dashed at last into the quadrangle and throwing the reins to a gaping groom i sprang up the steps  has the chevalier returned i gasped breathlessly  not yet monsieur answered guilbert with a tranquillity that made me desire to strangle him is mademoiselle in the château was my next question mechanically asked  i saw her on the terrace some moments ago she has not since come within  like one possessed i flew across the intervening room and out on to the terrace geneviève and andrea were walking there deep in conversation at another time i might have cursed their lack of prudence at the moment i did not so much as remark it  where is mademoiselle de canaples i burst out  they gazed at me as much astounded by my question and the abruptness of it as by my apparent agitation  has anything happened inquired geneviève her blue eyes wide open  yesno naught has happened tell me where she is i must speak to her  she was here a while ago said andrea but she left us to stroll along the river bank  how long is it since she left you  a quarter of an hour perhaps  something has happened cried geneviève and added more maybe but i waited not to hear  muttering curses as i ranfor t was my way to curse where pious souls might prayi sped back to the quadrangle and my horse  follow me i shouted to the groom you and as many of your fellows as you can find follow me at onceat once mark youto the coppice by the river and without waiting for his answer i sent my horse thundering down the avenue the sun was gone leaving naught but a roseate streak to tell of its passage and at that moment a distant bell tinkled forth the angelus  with whip spur and imprecations i plied my steed a prey to such excitement as i had never known until that momentnot even in the carnage of battle  i had no plan my mind was a chaos of thought without a single clear idea to light it and i never so much as bethought me that singlehandled i was about to attempt to wrest yvonne from the hands of perchance half a dozen men to save time i did not far pursue the road but clearing a hedge i galloped ventreàterre across the meadow towards the little coppice by the waterside as i rode i saw no sign of any moving thing no sound disturbed the evening stillness save the dull thump of my horses hoofs upon the turf and a great fear arose in my heart that i might come too late  at last i reached the belt of trees and my fears grew into certainty the place was deserted  then a fresh hope sprang up perchance thinking of my warning she had seen the emptiness of her suspicions towards me and had pursued that walk of hers in another direction  but when i had penetrated to the little open space within that cluster of naked trees i had proof overwhelming that the worst had befallen not only on the moist ground was stamped the impress of struggling feet but on a branch i found a strip of torn green velvet and remembering the dress she had worn that day i understood to the full the significance of that rag and understanding it i groaned aloud     chapter xii the rescue   some precious moments did i waste standing with that green rag betwixt my fingers and i grew sick and numb in body and in mind she was gone carried off by a man i had reason to believe she hated and whom god send she might have no motive to hate more deeply hereafter  the ugly thought swelled until it blotted out all others and in its train there came a fury upon me that drove me to do by instinct that which earlier i should have done by reason i climbed back into the saddle and away across the meadow i went journeying at an angle with the road my horses head turned in the direction of blois that road at last was gained and on i thundered at a stretched gallop praying that my hardused beast might last until the town was reached  now as i have already said i am not a man who easily falls a prey to excitement it may have beset me in the heat of battle when the fearsome lust of blood and death makes of every man a raving maniac thrilled with mad joy at every stab he deals and laughing with fierce passion at every blow he takes though in the taking of it his course be run but saving at such wild times never until then could i recall having been so little master of myself there was a fever in me all hell was in my blood and stranger still and hitherto unknown at any season there was a sickly fear that mastered me and drew out great beads of sweat upon my brow fear for myself i have never known for at no time has life so pampered me that the thought of parting company with it concerned me greatly fear for another i had not known till thensaving perchance the uneasiness that at times i had felt touching andreabecause never yet had i sufficiently cared  thus far my thoughts took me as i rode and where i have halted did they halt and stupidly i went over their ground again like one who gropes for something in the darkbecause never yet had i sufficiently caredi had never cared  and then ah dieu as i turned the thought over i understood and understanding i pursued the sentence where i had left off  but caring at last i was sick with fear of what might befall the one i cared for there lay the reason of the frenzied excitement whereof i had become the slave that it was that had brought the moisture to my brow and curses to my lips that it was that had caused me instinctively to thrust the rag of green velvet within my doublet  ciel it was strangeaye monstrous strange and a right good jest for fate to laugh atthat i gaston de luynes vile ruffler and worthless spadassin should have come to such a pass i whose forefinger had for the past ten years uptilted the chin of every tavern wench i had chanced upon i whose lips had never known the touch of other than the lips of these i who had thought my heart long dead to tenderness and devotion or to any fondness save the animal one for my ignoble self yet there i rode as if the devil had me for a quarrypanting sweating cursing and wellnigh sobbing with rage at a fear that i might come too lateall because of a proud lady who knew me for what i was and held me in contempt because of her knowledge all for a lady who had not the kindness for me that one might spare a dogwho looked on me as something not good to see  since there was no one to whom i might tell my story that he might mock me i mocked myselfwith a laugh that startled passersby and which coupled with the crazy pace at which i dashed into blois caused them i doubt not to think me mad nor were they wrong for mad indeed i deemed myself  that i trampled no one underfoot in my furious progress through the streets is a miracle that passes my understanding  in the courtyard of the lys de france i drew rein at last with a tug that brought my shuddering brute on to his haunches and sent those who stood about flying into the shelter of the doorways  another horse i shouted as i sprang to the ground another horse at once  then as i turned to inquire for michelot i espied him leaning stolidly against the porte­cochère  how long have you been there michelot i asked  half an hour mayhap  saw you a closed carriage pass  ten minutes ago i saw one go by followed by m de st auban and a gentleman who greatly resembled m de vilmorin besides an escort of four of the most villainous knaves  that is the one i broke in quick michelot arm yourself and get your horse i have need of you come knave move yourself  at the end of a few minutes we set out at a sharp trot leaving the curious ones whom my loudvoiced commands had assembled to speculate upon the meaning of so much bustle once clear of the township we gave the reins to our horses and our trot became a gallop as we travelled along the road to meung with the loire on our right and as we went i briefly told michelot what was afoot interlarding my explanations with prayers that we might come upon the kidnappers before they crossed the river and curses at the flying pace of our mounts which to my anxious mind seemed slow  at about a mile from blois the road runs over an undulation of the ground that is almost a hill from the moment that i had left canaples as the angelus was ringing until the moment when our panting horses gained the brow of that little eminence only half an hour had sped still in that halfhour the tints had all but faded from the sky and the twilight shadows grew thicker around us with every moment yet not so thick had they become but that i could see a coach at a standstill in the hollow some three hundred yards beneath us and by it half a dozen horses of which four were riderless and held by the two men who were still mounted then breathlessly scanning the field between the road and the river i espied five persons half way across and at the same distance from the water that we were from the coach two men whom i supposed to be st auban and vilmorin were forcing along a woman whose struggles feeble though they appearedyet retarded their progress in some measure behind them walked two others musket on shoulder  i pointed them out to michelot with a soft cry of joy we were in time  following with my eyes the course they appeared to be pursuing i saw by the bank a boat in which two men were waiting again i pointed this time to the boat  over the hedge michelot i cried we must ride in a straight line for the water and so intercept them follow me  over the hedge we went and down the gentle slope at as round a pace as the soft ground would with safety allow i had reckoned upon being opposed to six or even eight men whereas there were but four one of whom i knew was hardly to be reckoned doubtless st auban had imagined himself safe from pursuit when he left two of his bravos with the horses probably to take them on to meung and there cross with them and rejoin him two more i doubted not were those seated at the oars  i laughed to myself as i took in all this but even as i laughed those in the field stood still and sent up a shout that told me we had been perceived  on michelot on i shouted spurring my horse forward then in answer to their masters call the two ruffians who had been doing duty as grooms came pounding into the field  ride to meet them michelot i cried obediently he wheeled to the left and i caught the swish of his sword as it left the scabbard  st auban was now hurrying towards the river with his party already they were but fifty yards from the boat and a hundred still lay between him and me furiously i pressed onward and presently but half the distance separated us whilst they were still some thirty yards from their goal  then his two bravos faced round to meet me and one standing some fifty paces in ad­vance of the other levelled his musket and fired but in his haste he aimed too high the bullet carried away my hat and before the smoke had cleared i was upon him i had drawn a pistol from my holster but it was not needed my horse passed over him before he could save himself from my fearful charge  in the fastfading light a second musket barrel shone and i saw the second ruffian taking aim at me with not a dozen yards between us with the old soldiers instinct i wrenched at the reins till i brought my horse on to his haunches it was high time for simultaneously with my action the fellow blazed at me and the scream of pain that broke from my steed told me that the poor brute had taken the bullet with a bound that carried me forward some six paces the animal sank quivering to the ground i disengaged my feet from the stirrups as he fell but the shock of it sent me rolling on the ground and the ruffian seeing me fallen sprang forward swinging his musket up above his head i dodged the murderous downward stroke and as the stock buried itself close beside me in the soft earth i rose on one knee and with a grim laugh i raised my pistol i brought the muzzle within a hands breadth of his face then fired and shot him through the head perchance youll say it was a murderous cruel stroke mayhap it was but at such seasons men stay not to unravel niceties but strike ere they themselves be stricken  leaping over the twitching corpse i got out my sword and sprang after st auban who with vilmorin and yvonne careless of what might betide his followers was now within ten paces of the boat  pistol shots cracked behind me and i wondered how michelot was faring but dared not pause to look  the twain in the boat stood up wielding their great oars and methought them on the point of coming to their masters aid in which case my battle had truly been a lost one but that craven vilmorin did me good service then for with a cry of fear at my approach he abandoned his hold of yvonne whose struggles were keeping both the men back thus freed he fled towards the boat and jumping in he shouted to the men in his shrill quavering voice to put off albeit they disobeyed him contemptuously and waited for the marquis still they did not leave the boat fearing no doubt that if they did so the coward would put off alone  as for st auban vilmorins flight left him unequal to the task of dragging the girl along she dug her heels into the ground and tug as he might for all that he set both hands to work he could not move her in this plight i came upon him and challenged him to stand and face me  with a bunch of oaths he got out his sword but in doing so he was forced to remove one of his hands from the girls arm seizing the opportunity with a ready wit and courage seldom found in women of her quality she twisted herself from the grip of his left hand and came staggering towards me for protection holding up her pinioned wrists with my blade i severed the cord whereupon she plucked the gag from her mouth and sank against my side her struggles having left her weak indeed  as i set my arm about her waist to support her my heart seemed to swell within me and strange melodies shaped themselves within my soul  st auban bore down upon me with a raucous oath but the glittering point of my rapier danced before his eyes and drove him back again  to me vilmorin you cowardly cur he shouted to me you dogs  he let fly at them a volley of bloodcurdling oaths then without waiting to see if they obeyed him he came at me again and our swords met  courage mademoiselle i whispered as a sigh that was almost a groan escaped her have no fear  but that fight was not destined to be fought for as again we engaged there came the fall of running feet behind me it flashed across my mind that michelot had been worsted and that my back was about to be assailed but in st aubans face i saw as in a mirror that he who came was michelot  mort de christ snarled the marquis springing back beyond my reach what can a man do with naught but fools and poltroons to serve him faugh we will continue our swordplay at st sulpice des reaux tonight au revoir m de luynes  turning he sheathed his sword and running down to the river bounded into the boat where i heard him reviling vilmorin with every foul name he could call to mind  my blood was aflame and i was not minded to wait for our meeting at reaux consigning mademoiselle to the care of michelot who stood panting and bleeding from a wound in his shoulder i turned back to my dead horse and plucking the remaining pistol from the holster i ran down to the very edge of the water the boat was not ten yards from shore and my action had been unheeded by st auban who was standing in the stern  kneeling i took careful aim at him and as god lives i would have saved much trouble that was to follow had i been allowed to fire but at that moment a hand was laid upon my arm and yvonnes sweet voice murmured in my ear  you have fought a brave and gallant fight m de luynes and you have done a deed of which the knights of old might have been proud do not mar it by an act of murder  murder mademoiselle i gasped letting my hand fall surely there is no murder in this  a suspicion of it i think and so brave a man should have clean hands     chapter xiii the hand of yvonne   we did not long remain upon the field of battle indeed if we lingered at all it was but so that mademoiselle might bandage michelots wound and whilst she did so my stout henchman related to us how it had fared with him and how having taken the two ruffians separately he had been wounded by the first whom he repaid by splitting his skull whereupon the second one had discharged his pistol without effect then made off towards the road whilst michelot remembering that i might need assistance had let him go  there good michelot quoth mademoiselle completing her task i have done what little i can and now m de luynes let us go  it was close upon seven oclock and night was at hand already the moon was showing her large full face above the treetops by chambord and casting a silver streak athwart the stream the plash of oars from the marquiss boat was waxing indistinct despite the stillness whilst by the eye the boat itself was no longer to be distinguished  as i turned my glance fell upon the bravo whom i had shot he lay stiff and stark upon his back his sightless eyes wide open and staring heavenwards his face all bloodsmeared and ghastly to behold  mademoiselle shuddered let us go she repeated in a faint whisper her eye had also fallen on that thing and her voice was full of awe she laid her hand upon my sleeve and neath the suasion of her touch i moved away  to our surprise and joy we found st aubans coach where we had left it with two saddled horses tethered close by the others had doubtless been taken by the coachman and the bravo who had escaped michelot both of whom had fled these animals we looked upon as the spoils of war and accordingly when we set out in the coachmademoiselle having desired me to ride beside her thereinmichelot wielding the reins it was with those two horses tethered behind  monsieur de luynes said my companion softly i fear that i have done you a great injustice indeed i know not how to crave your forgiveness how to thank you or how to hide my shame at those words i spoke to you this afternoon at canaples  not another word on that score mademoiselle  and to myself i thought of what recompense already had been mine to me it had been given to have her lean trustingly upon me my arm about her waist whilst sword in hand i had fought for her dieu was that not something to have lived foraye and to have died for methought  i deserved monsieur she continued presently that you should have left me to my fate for all the odious things i uttered when you warned me of my perilfor the manner in which i have treated you since your coming to blois  you have but treated me mademoiselle in the only manner in which you could treat one so far beneath you one who is utterly unworthy that you should bestow a single regret upon him  you are strangely humble tonight monsieur it is unwonted in you and for once you wrong yourself you have not said that i am forgiven  i have naught to forgive  hélas you haveindeed you have  eh bien quoth i with a return of my old tone of banter i forgive then  thereafter we travelled on in silence for some little while my heart full of joy at being so near to her and the friendliness which she evinced for me and my mind casting oer my joyous heart a cloud of some indefinable evil presage  you are a brave man m de luynes she murmured presently and i have been taught that brave men are ever honourable and true  had they who taught you that known gaston de luynes they would have told you instead that it is possible for a vile man to have the one redeeming virtue of courage even as it is possible for a liar to have a countenance that is sweet and innocent  there speaks that humble mood you are affecting and which sits upon you as my fathers clothes might do nay monsieur i shall believe in my first teaching and be deaf to yours  again there was a spell of silence at lasti have been thinking monsieur she said of that other occasion on which you rode with me i remember that you said you had killed a man and when i asked you why you said that you had done it because he sought to kill you was that the truth  assuredly mademoiselle we fought a duel and it is customary in a duel for each to seek to kill the other  but why was this duel fought she cried with some petulance  i fear me mademoiselle that i may not answer you i said recalling the exact motives and thinking how futile appeared the quarrel which eugène de canaples had sought with andrea when viewed in the light of what had since befallen  was the quarrel of your seeking  in a measure it was mademoiselle  in a measure she echoed then persisting as women willwill you not tell me what this measure was  tenez mademoiselle i answered in despair i will tell you just so much as i may your brother had occasion to be opposed to certain projects that were being formed in paris by persons high in power around a beardless boy himself of too small importance to dare wage war against those powerful ones who would have crushed him your brother sought to gain his ends by sending a challenge to this boy the lad was highspirited and consented to meet m de canaples by whom he would assuredly have been murderedt is the only word mademoisellehad i not intervened as i did  she was silent for a moment theni believe you monsieur she said simply you fought then to shield anotherbut why  for three reasons mademoiselle firstly those persons high in power chose to think it my fault that the quarrel had arisen and threatened to hang me if the duel took place and the boy were harmed secondly i myself felt a kindness for the boy thirdly because whatever sins heaven may record against me it has at least ever been my way to side against men who confident of their superiority seek with the cowardly courage of the strong to harm the weak it is mademoiselle the courage of the man who knows no fear when he strikes a woman yet who will shake with a palsy when another man but threatens him  why did you not tell me all this before she whispered after a pause and methought i caught a quaver in her voice  i laughed for answer and she read my laugh aright presently she pursued her questions and asked me the name of the boy i had defended but i evaded her telling her that she must need no further details to believe me  it is not that monsieur i do believe you i do indeed but  hark mademoiselle i cried suddenly as the clatter of many hoofs sounded near at hand what is that  a shout rang out at that moment halt who goes there  mon dieu exclaimed mademoiselle drawing close up to me and again the voice sounded this time more sinister  halt i sayin the kings name  the coach came to a standstill and through the window i beheld the shadowy forms of several mounted men and the feeble glare of a lantern  who travels in the carriage knave came the voice again  mademoiselle de canaples answered michelot then like a fool he must needs add have a care whom you knave my master if you would grow old  pardieu let us behold this mademoiselle de canaples who owns so fearful a warrior for a coachman  the door was flung rudely open and the man bearing the lanternwhose rays shone upon a uniform of the cardinals guardsconfronted us  with a chuckle he flashed the light in my face then suddenly grew serious  peste is it indeed you m de luynes quoth he adding with stern politeness it grieves me to disturb you but i have a warrant for your arrest  he was fumbling in his doublet as he spoke and during the time i had leisure to scan his countenance recognising to my surprise a young lieutenant of the guards who had but recently served with me and with whom i had been on terms almost of friendship his words i have a warrant for your arrest came like a bolt from the blue to enlighten me and to remind me of what st auban had that morning told me and which for the nonce i had all but forgotten  upon hearing those same words yvonne methought grew pale and her eyes were bent upon me with a look of surprise and pity  upon what charge am i arrested i enquired with forced composure  my warrant mentions none m de luynes it is here and he thrust before me a paper whose purport i could have read in its shape and seals idly my eye ran along the words  by these presents i charge and empower my lieutenant jean de montrésor to seize whereer he may be found hold and conduct to paris the sieur gaston de luynes  and so further until the cardinals signature ended the legal verbiage  in the kings name m de luynes said montrésor firmly yet deferentially your sword  it would have been madness to do aught but comply with his request and so i surrendered my rapier which he in his turn delivered to one of his followers next i stepped down from the coach and turned to take leave of mademoiselle whereupon montrésor thinking that peradventure matters were as they appeared to be between us and being a man of fine feelings signed to his men to fall back whilst he himself withdrew a few paces  adieu mademoiselle i said simply i shall carry with me for consolation the memory that i have been of service to you and i shall everduring the little time that may be left mebe grateful to heaven for the opportunity that it has afforded me of causing youperchance without sufficient reasonto think better of me adieu mademoiselle god guard you  it was too dark to see her face but my heart bounded with joy to catch in her voice a quaver that argued methought regret for me  what does it mean m de luynes why are they taking you  because i have displeased my lord cardinal albeit mademoiselle i swear to you that i have no cause for shame at the reasons for which i am being arrested  my father is monseigneur de mazarins friend she cried he is also yours he shall exert for you what influence he possesses  t were useless mademoiselle besides what does it signify again adieu  she spoke no answering word but silently held out her hand silently i took it in mine and for a moment i hesitated thinking of what i wasof what she was at last moved by some power that was greater than my will i stooped and pressed those shapely fingers to my lips then i stepped suddenly back and closed the carriage door oppressed by a feeling akin to that of having done an evil deed  have i your permission to say a word to my servant m le lieutenant i inquired  he bowed assent whereat stepping close up to the horrorstricken michelot  drive straight to the château de canaples i said in a low voice thereafter return to the lys de france and there wait until you hear from me here take my purse there are some fifty pistoles in it  speak but the word monsieur he growled and ill pistol a couple of these dogs  pah you grow childish i laughed or can you not see that fellows musket  pardieu ill risk his aim i never yet saw one of these curs shoot straight  no no obey me michelot think of mademoiselle go adieu if we should not meet again mon brave i finished as i seized his loyal hand what few things of mine are at the hostelry shall belong to you as well as what may be left of this money it is little enough payment michelot for all your faithfulness  monsieur monsieur he cried  diable i muttered we are becoming women be off you knave adieu  the peremptoriness of my tone ended our leavetaking and caused him to grip his reins and bring down his whip the coach moved on a white face on which the moonlight fell glanced at me from the window then to my staring eyes naught was left but the back of the retreating vehicle with one of the two saddlehorses that had been tethered to it still ambling in its wake  m de montrésor i said thrusting my bulletpierced hat upon my head i am at your service     chapter xiv of what befell at reaux at my captors bidding i mounted the horse which they had untethered from the carriage and we started off along the road which the coach itself had disappeared upon a moment before but we travelled at a gentle trot which after that evenings furious riding was welcome to me  with bitterness i reflected as i rode that the very moment at which mademoiselle de canaples had brought herself to think better of me was like to prove the last we should spend together yet not altogether bitter was that reflection for with it came also the consolationwhereof i had told herthat i had not been taken before she had had cause to change her mind concerning me  that she should care for me was too preposterous an idea to be nourished and indeed it was bettermuch betterthat m de montrésor had come before i grown sanguine as lovers will had again earned her scorn by showing her what my heart contained much better was it that i should pass for ever out of her lifeas indeed methought i was like to pass out of all lifewhilst i could leave in her mind a kind remembrance and a grateful regret free from the stain that a subsequent possible presumption of mine might have cast oer it  then my thoughts shifted to andrea st auban would hear of my removal and i cared not to think of what profit he might derive from it to yvonne also his presence must hereafter be a menace and in that wherein tonight he had failed he might again succeed it was at this juncture of my reverie that m de montrésors pleasant young voice aroused me  you appear downcast m de luynes  i downcast i echoed throwing back my head and laughing nay i was but thinking  believe me m de luynes he said kindly when i tell you that it grieves me to be charged with this matter i have done my best to capture you that was my duty but i should have rejoiced had i failed with the consciousness of having done all in my power  thanks montrésor i murmured and silence followed  i have been thinking monsieur he went on presently that possibly the absence of your sword causes you discomfort  eh discomfort it does most damnably  give me your parole dhonneur that you will attempt no escape and not only shall your sword be returned to you but you shall travel to paris with all comfort and dignity  now so amazed was i that i paused to stare at the officer who was young enough to make such a proposal to a man of my reputation he turned his face towards me and in the moonlight i could make out his questioning glance  eh bien monsieur  i am more than grateful to you m de montrésor i replied and i freely give you my word of honour to seek no means of eluding you nor to avail myself of any that may be presented to me  i said this loud enough for those behind to hear so that no surprise was evinced when the lieutenant bade the man who bore my sword return it to me  if he who may chance to read these simple pages shall have gathered aught of my character from their perusal he will marvel perchance that i should give the lieutenant my parole instead rather of watching for an opportunity toat leastattempt an escape preeminent in my thoughts however stood at that moment the necessity to remove st auban and methought that by acting as i did i saw a way by which haply i might accomplish this what might thereafter befall me seemed of little moment  m de montrésor i said presently your kindness impels me to set a further tax upon your generosity  that is monsieur  bid your men fall back a little and i will tell you  he made a sign to his troopers and when the distance between us had been sufficiently widened i began  there is a man at present across the river yonder who has done me no little injury and with whom i have a rendezvous at nine oclock tonight at st sulpice des reaux where our swords are to determine the difference between us i crave monsieur your permission to keep that appointment  impossible he answered curtly  i took a deep breath like a man who is about to jump an obstacle in his path  why impossible monsieur  because you are a prisoner and therefore no longer under obligation to keep appointments  how would you feel montrésor if burning to be avenged upon a man who had done you irreparable wrong you were arrested an hour before the time at which you were to meet this man sword in hand and your captorwhose leave you craved to keep the assignationanswered you with the word impossible  yes yes monsieur he replied impatiently but you forget my position let us suppose that i allow you to go to st sulpice des reaux what if you do not return  you mistrust me i exclaimed my hopes melting  you misapprehend me i mean what if you are killed  i do not think that i shall be  ah but what if you are what shall i say to my lord cardinal  dame that i am dead and that he is saved the trouble of hanging me the most he can want of me is my life let us suppose that you had come an hour later you would have been forced to wait until after the encounter and did i fall matters would be no different  the young man fell to thinking but i knowing that it is not well to let the young ponder overlong if you would bend them to your wishes broke in upon his reflectionssee montrésor yonder are the lights of blois by eight oclock we shall be in the town come grant me leave to cross the loire and by ten oclock or halfpast at the latest i shall return to sup with you or i shall be dead i swear it  were i in your position he answered musingly i know how i would be treated and pardieu come what may i shall deal with you accordingly you may go to your assignation m de luynes and may god prosper you  and thus it came to pass that shortly after eight oclock albeit a prisoner i rode into the courtyard of the lys de france and alighting i stepped across the threshold of the inn and strode up to a table at which i had espied michelot he sat nursing a huge measure of wine into the depths of which he was gazing pensively with an expression so glum upon his weatherbeaten countenance that it defies depicting so deep was he in his meditations that albeit i stood by the table surveying him for a full minute he took no heed of me  allons michelot i said at length wake up  he started up with a cry of amazement surprise chased away the grief that had been on his face and a moment later joy unfeigned and good to see took the place of surprise  you have escaped monsieur he cried and albeit caution made him utter the words beneath his breath a shout seemed to lurk somewhere in the whisper  pressing his hand i sat down and briefly told him how matters stood and how i came to be for the moment free and when i had done i bade him since his wound had not proved serious to get his hat and cloak and go with me to find a boat  he obeyed me and a quarter of an hour after we had quitted the hostelry he was rowing me across the stream whilst wrapped in my cloak i sat in the stern thinking of yvonne  monsieur said michelot observe how swift is the stream if i were to let the boat drift we should be at tours tomorrow and from there it would be easy to defy pursuit we have enough money to reach spain what say you monsieur  say you rascal why bend your back to the work and set me ashore by st sulpice in a quarter of an hour or ill forget that you have been my friend would you see me dishonoured  sooner than see you dead he grumbled as he resumed his task thereafter whilst he rowed michelot entertained me with some quaint ideas touching that which fine gentlemen call honour and to what sorry passes it was wont to bring them concluding by thanking god that he was no gentleman and had no honour to lead him into mischief  at last however our journey came to an end and i sprang ashore some five hundred paces from the little chapel and almost exactly opposite the château de canaples i stood for a moment gazing across the water at the lighted windows of the château wondering which of those eyes that looked out upon the night might be that of yvonnes chamber  then bidding michelot await me or follow did i not return in half an hour i turned and moved away towards the chapel  there is a clearing in front of the little white edificewhich rather than a temple is but a monument to the martyr who is said to have perished on that spot in the days before clovis  as i advanced into the centre of this open patch of ground and stood clear of the black silhouettes of the trees cast about me by the moon two men appeared to detach themselves from the side wall of the chapel and advanced to meet me  albeit they were wrapped in their cloaksuptilted behind by their protruding scabbardsit was not difficult to tell the tall figure and stately bearing of st auban and the mincing gait of vilmorin  i doffed my hat in a grave salutation which was courteously returned  i trust messieurs that i have not kept you waiting  i was on the point of expressing that very hope monsieur returned st auban we have but arrived do you come alone  as you perceive  hum m le vicomte then will act for both of us  i bowed in token of my satisfaction and without more ado cast aside my cloak pleased to see that the affair was to be conducted with decency and politeness as such matters should ever be conducted albeit impoliteness may have marked their origin  the marquis having followed my example and divested himself of his cloak and hat unsheathed his rapier and delivered it to vilmorin who came across with it to where i stood when he was close to me i saw that he was deadly pale his teeth chattered and the hand that held the weapon shook as with a palsy  mumonsieur he stammered will it please you to lend me your sword that i may mumeasure it  what formalities i exclaimed with an amused smile as i complied with his request i am afraid you have caught a chill vicomte the night air is little suited to health so delicate  he answered me with a baleful glance as silently he took my sword and set itpoint to hiltwith st aubans he appeared to have found some slight difference in the length for he took two steps away from me holding the weapons well in the light where for a moment he surveyed them attentively his hands shook so that the blades clattered one against the other the while but of a sudden taking both rapiers by the hilt he struck the blades together with a ringing clash then flung them both behind him as far as he could contrive leaving me thunderstruck with amazement and marvelling whether fear had robbed him of his wits  not until i perceived that the trees around me appeared to spring into life did it occur to me that that clashing of blades was a signal and that i was trapped with the realisation of it i was upon vilmorin in a bound and with both hands i had caught the dog by the throat before he thought of flight the violence of my onslaught bore him to the ground and i not to release my choking grip went with him  for a moment we lay together where we had fallen his slender body twisting and writhing under me his swelling face upturned and his protruding horrorstricken eyes gazing into mine that were fierce and pitiless voices rang above me someone stooped and strove to pluck me from my victim then below the left shoulder i felt a sting of pain first cold then hot and i knew that i had been stabbed  again i felt the blade thrust in lower down and driven deeper then as the knife was for the second time withdrawn and my flesh sucked at the steelthe pain of it sending a shudder through methe instinct of preservation overcame the sweet lust to strangle vilmorin i let him go and staggering to my feet i turned to face those murderers who struck a defenceless man behind  swords gleamed around me one two three four five six i counted and stood weak and dazed from loss of blood gazing stupidly at the white blades had i but had my sword i should have laid about me and gone down beneath their blows as befits a soldier but the absence of that trusty friend left me limp and helplesscowed for the first time since i had borne arms  of a sudden i became aware that st auban stood opposite to me hand on hip surveying me with a malicious leer as our eyes metso master meddler quoth he mockingly you crow less lustily than is your wont  hound i gasped choking with rage if you are a man if there be a spark of pride or honour left in your lying cowardly soul order your assassins to give me my sword and wounded though i be ill fight with you this duel that you lured me here to fight  he laughed harshly  i told you but this morning master de luynes that a st auban does not fight men of your stamp you forced a rendezvous upon me you shall reap the consequences  despite the weakness arising from loss of blood i sprang towards him beside myself with fury but ere i had covered half the distance that lay between us my arms were gripped from behind and in my spent condition i was held there powerless at the marquiss mercy he came slowly forward until we were but some two feet apart for a second he stood leering at me then raising his hand he struck mestruck a man whose arms another heldfull upon the face passion for the moment lent me strength and in that moment i had wrenched my right arm free and returned his blow with interest  with an oath he got out a dagger that hung from his baldrick  sang du christ take that you dog he snarled burying the blade in my breast as he spoke  my god you are murdering me i gasped  have you discovered it what penetration he retorted and those about him laughed at his indecent jest  he made a sign and the man who had held me withdrew his hands i staggered forward deprived of his support then a crashing blow took me across the head  i swayed for an instant and with arms upheld i clutched at the air as if i sought by hanging to it to save myself from falling then the moon appeared to go dark a noise as of the sea beating upon its shore filled my ears and i seemed to be fallingfallingfalling  a voice that buzzed and vibrated oddly growing more distant at each word reached me as i sank  come it said fling that carrion into the river  then nothingness engulfed me     chapter xv of my resurrection   even as the blow which had plunged me into senselessness had imparted to me the sinking sensation which i have feebly endeavoured to depict so did the first dim ray of returning consciousness bring with it the feeling that i was again being buoyed upwards through the thick waters that had enveloped me to their surface where intelligence and wakefulness awaited  and as i felt myself borne up and up in that effortless ascension my senses awake and my reason still halfdormant an exquisite sense of languor pervaded my whole being presently meseemed that the surface was gained at last and an instinct impelled me to open my eyes upon the light of which through closed lids i had become conscious  i beheld a fairsized room superbly furnished and flooded with amber sunlight suggestive in itself of warmth and luxury the vision of which heightened the delicious torpor that held me in thrall the bed i lay upon was such i told myself as would not have disgraced a royal sleeper it was upheld by great pillars of black oak carved with a score of fantastic figures and all around it descending from the dome above hung curtains of rich damask drawn back at the side that looked upon the window near at hand stood a table laden with phials and such utensils as one sees by the bedside of the wealthy sick all this i beheld in a languid unreasoning fashion through my halfopen lids and albeit the luxury of the room and the fine linen of my bed told me that this was neither my paris lodging in the rue st antoine nor yet my chamber at the hostelry of the lys de france still i taxed not my brain with any questions touching my whereabouts  i closed my eyes and i must have slept again when next i opened them a burly figure stood in the deep bay of the latticed window looking out through the leaded panes  i recognised the stalwart frame of michelot and at last i asked myself where i might be it did not seem to occur to me that i had but to call him to receive an answer to that question instead i closed my eyes again and essayed to think but just then there came a gentle scratching at the door and i could hear michelot tiptoeing across the room next he and the one he had admitted tiptoed back towards my bedside and as they came i caught a whisper in a voice that seemed to drag me to full consciousness  how fares the poor invalid this morning  the fever is gone mademoiselle and he may wake at any moment indeed it is strange that he should sleep so long  he will be the better for it when he does awaken i will remain here while you rest michelot my poor fellow you are almost as worn with your vigils as he is with the fever  pooh i am strong enough mademoiselle he answered i will get a mouthful of food and return for i would be by when he wakes  then their voices sank so low that as they withdrew i caught not what was said the door closed softly and for a space there was silence broken at last by a sigh above my head with an answering sigh i opened wide my eyes and feasted them upon the lovely face of yvonne de canaples as she bent over me with a look of tenderness and pity that at once recalled to me our parting when i was arrested  but suddenly meeting the stare of my gaze she drew back with a halfstifled cry whose meaning my dull wits sought not to interpret but methought i caught from her lips the words thank god  where am i mademoiselle i inquired and the faintness of my voice amazed me  you know me she exclaimed as though the thing were a miracle then coming forward again and setting her cool sweet hand upon my forehead  hush she murmured in the accents one might use to soothe a child you are at canaples among friends now sleep  at canaples i echoed how came i here i am a prisoner am i not  a prisoner she exclaimed no no you are not a prisoner you are among friends  did i then but dream that montrésor arrested me yesterday on the road to meung ah i recollect m de montrésor gave me leave on parole to go to reaux  then like an avalanche remembrance swept down upon me and my memory drew a vivid picture of the happenings at st sulpice  my god i cried am i not dead then and i sought to struggle up into a sitting posture but that gentle hand upon my forehead restrained and robbed me of all will that was not hers  hush monsieur she said softly lie still by a miracle and the faithfulness of michelot you live be thankful be content and sleep  but my wounds mademoiselle i inquired feebly  they are healed  healed quoth i and in my amazement my voice sounded louder than it had yet done since my awakening healed three such wounds as i took last night to say naught of a broken head healed  t was not last night monsieur  not last night was it not last night that i went to reaux  it is nearly a month since that took place she answered with a smile for nearly a month have you lain unconscious upon that bed with the angel of death at your pillow you have fought and won a silent battle now sleep monsieur and ask no more questions until next you awaken when michelot shall tell you all that took place  she held a glass to my lips from which i drank gratefully then with the submissiveness of a babe i obeyed her and slept  as she had promised it was michelot who greeted me when next i opened my eyes on the following day there were tears in his eyeseyes that had looked grim and unmoved upon the horrors of the battlefield  from him i learned how after they had flung me into the river deeming me dead already st auban and his men had made off the swift stream swirled me along towards the spot where in the boat michelot awaited my return all unconscious of what was taking place he had heard the splash and had suddenly stood up on the point of going ashore when my body rose within a few feet of him he spoke of the agony of mind wherewith he had suddenly stretched forth and clutched me by my doublet fearing that i was indeed dead he had lifted me into the boat to find that my heart still beat and that the blood flowed from my wounds these he had there and then bound up in the only rude fashion he was master of and forthwith thinking of andrea and the chevalier de canaples who were my friends and of mademoiselle who was my debtor also seeing that the château was the nearest place he had rowed straight across to canaples and there i had lain during the four weeks that had elapsed nursed by mademoiselle andrea and himself and thus won back to life  ah dieu how good it was to know that someone there was still who cared for worthless gaston de luynes a littleenough to watch beside him and withhold his soul from the grim claws of death  what of m de st auban i inquired presently  he has not been seen since that night probably he feared that did he come to blois the chevalier would find means of punishing him for the attempted abduction of mademoiselle  ah then andrea is safe  as if in answer to my question the lad entered at that moment and upon seeing me sitting up talking to michelot he uttered an exclamation of joy and hurried forward to my bedside  gaston dear friend he cried as he took my handand a thin withered hand it was  we talked long togetherwe threeand anon we were joined by the chevalier de canaples who offered me also in his hesitating manner his felicitations and with me they lingered until yvonne came to drive them with protestations from my bedside  such in brief was the manner of my resurrection for a week or so i still kept my chamber then one day towards the middle of april the weather being warm and the sun bright michelot assisted me to don my clothes which hung strangely empty upon my gaunt emaciated frame and leaning heavily upon my faithful henchman i made my way below  in the salon i found the chevalier de canaples with mesdemoiselles and andrea awaiting me and the kindness wherewith they overwhelmed me as i sat propped up with pillows was such that i asked myself again and again if indeed i was that same gaston de luynes who but a little while ago had held himself as destitute of friends as he was of fortune i was the pampered hero of the hour and even little geneviève had a sunny smile and a kind word for me  thereafter my recovery progressed with great strides and gradually day by day i felt more like my old vigorous self they were happy days for mademoiselle was often at my side and ever kind to me so kind was she that presently as my strength grew there fell a great cloud athwart my happinessthe thought that soon i must leave canaples never to return thereleave mademoiselles presence never to come into it again  i was monsieur de montrésors prisoner i had learned that in common with all others save those at canaples he deemed me dead and that informed of it by a message from st auban he had returned to paris on the day following that of my journey to reaux nevertheless since i lived he had my parole and it was my duty as soon as i had regained sufficient strength to journey to paris and deliver myself into his hands  nearer and nearer drew the dreaded hour in which i felt that i must leave canaples on the last day of april i essayed a fencing bout with andrea and so strong and supple did i prove myself that i was forced to realise that the time was come on the morrow i would go  as i was on the point of returning indoors with the foils under my arm andrea called me back  gaston i have something of importance to say to you will you take a turn with me down yonder by the river  there was a serious almost nervous look on his comely face which arrested my attention i dropped the foils and taking his arm i went with him as he bade me we seated ourselves on the grass by the edge of the gurgling waters and he began  it is now two months since we came to blois i to pay my court to the wealthy mademoiselle de canaples you to watch over and protect menay you need not interrupt me michelot has told me what st auban sought here and the true motives of your journey to st sulpice never shall i be able to sufficiently prove my gratitude to you my poor gaston but tell me dear friend you who from the outset saw how matters stood why did you not inform st auban that he had no cause to hunt me down since i intended not to come between him and yvonne  mon dieu i exclaimed that little fairhaired coquette has  gaston he interrupted you go too fast i love geneviève de canaples i have loved her i think since the moment i beheld her in the inn at choisy and what is more she loves me  so that i asked with an illrepressed sneer  we have plighted our troth and with her fathers sanction or without it she will do me the honour to become my wife  admirable i exclaimed and my lord cardinal  may hang himself on his stole for aught i care  ah truly a dutiful expression for a nephew who has thwarted his uncles plans  my uncles plans are like himself cold and selfish in their ambition  andrea andrea whatever your uncle may be to those of your blood at least he was never selfish  not selfish he cried think you that he is enriching and contracting great alliances for us because he loves us no no our uncle seeks to gain our support and with it the support of those noble houses to which he is allying us the nobility opposes him therefore he seeks to find relatives among noblemen so that he may weather the storm of which his farseeing eyes have already detected the first dim clouds what to him are my feelings my inclinations my affections things of no moment to be sacrificed so that i may serve him in the manner that will bring him the most profit yet you call him not selfish were he not selfish i should go to him and say i love geneviève de canaples create me duke as you would do did i wed her sister and the chevalier de canaples will not withstand our union what think you would be his answer  i have a shrewd idea what his answer would be i replied slowly also i have a shrewd idea of what he will say when he learns in what manner you have defied his wishes  he can but order me away from court or at most banish me from france  and then what will become of youof you and your wife  what is to become of us he cried in a tone that was almost that of anger think you that i am a pauper dependent upon my uncles bounty i have an estate near palermo which for all that it does not yield riches is yet sufficient to enable us to live with dignity and comfort i have told geneviève and she is content  i looked at his flushed face and laughed  well well said i if you are resolved upon it it is ended  he appeared to meditate for a moment thenwe have decided to be married by the curé of st innocent on the day after tomorrow  crédieu i answered with a whistle you have wasted no time in determining your plans does yvonne know of it  we have dared tell nobody he replied and a moment later he added hesitatingly you i know will not betray us  do you know me so little that you doubt me on that score have no fear andrea i shall not speak besides tomorrow or the next day at latest i leave canaples  you do not mean that you are returning to the lys de france  no i am going farther than that i am going to paris  to paris  to paris to deliver myself up to m de montrésor who gave me leave to go to reaux some seven weeks ago  but it is madness gaston he ejaculated  all virtue is madness in a world so sinful nevertheless i go in a measure i am glad that things have fallen out with you as they have done for when the news goes abroad that you have married geneviève de canaples and left the heiress free your enemies will vanish and you will have no further need of me new enemies you will have perchance but in your strife with them i could lend you no help were i by  he sat in silence casting pebbles into the stream and watching the ripples they made upon the face of the waters  have you told mademoiselle he asked at length  not yet i shall tell her today you also andrea must take her into your confidence touching your approaching marriage that she will prove a good friend to you i am assured  but what reason shall i give form my secrecy he inquired and inwardly i smiled to see how the selfishness which love begets in us had caused him already to forget my affairs and how the thought of his own approaching union effaced all thought of me and the doom to which i went  give no reason i answered let genevieve tell her of what you contemplate and if a reason she must have let geneviève bid her come to me this much will i do for you in the matter indeed andrea it is the last service i am like to render you  sh here comes the chevalier she shall be told today     chapter xvi the way of woman   for all that i realised that this love of mine for yvonne was as a child stillborna thing that had no existence save in the heart that had begotten iti rejoiced meanly at the thought that she was not destined to become andreas wife for since i understood that this womanwho to me was like no other of her sexwas not for so poor a thing as gaston de luynes like the dog in the fable i wished that no other might possess her inevitable it seemed that sooner or later one must come who would woo and win her but ere that befell my lord cardinal would have meted out justice to methe justice of the rope meseemedand i should not be by to gnash my teeth in jealousy  that evening when the chevalier de canaples had gone to pay a visit to his vineyardthe thing that next to himself he loved most in this worldand whilst geneviève and andrea were vowing a deathless love to each other in the rose garden their favourite haunt when the chevalier was absent i seized the opportunity for making my adieux to yvonne  we were leaning together upon the balustrade of the terrace and our faces were turned towards the river and the wooded shores beyonda landscape this that was as alive and beautiful now as it had been dead and grey when first i came to canaples two months ago  scarce were my first words spoken when she turned towards me and methoughtbut i was mad i told myselfthat there was a catch in her voice as she exclaimed you are leaving us monsieur  tomorrow morning i shall crave monsieur your fathers permission to quit canaples  but why monsieur have we not made you happy here  so happy mademoiselle i answered with fervour that at times it passes my belief that i am indeed gaston de luynes but go i must my honour demands of me this sacrifice  and in answer to the look of astonishment that filled her wondrous eyes i told her what i had told andrea touching my parole to montrésor and the necessity of its redemption as andrea had done she also dubbed it madness but her glance was nevertheless so full of admiration that methought to have earned it was worth the immolation of libertyof life perchance who could say  before i go mademoiselle i pursued looking straight before me as i spoke and dimly conscious that her glance was bent upon my facebefore i go i fain would thank you for all that you have done for me here your care has saved my life mademoiselle your kindness methinks has saved my soul for it seems to me that i am no longer the same man whom michelot fished out of the loire that night two months ago i would thank you mademoiselle for the happiness that has been mine during the past few daysa happiness such as for years has not fallen to my lot to another and worthier man the task of thanking you might be an easy one but to me who know myself to be so far beneath you the obligation is so overwhelming that i know of no words to fitly express it  monsieur monsieur i beseech you already you have said overmuch  nay mademoiselle not half enough  have you forgotten then what you did for me our trivial service to you is but unseemly recompense what other man would have come to my rescue as you came with such odds against youand forgetting the affronting words wherewith that very day i had met your warning tell me monsieur who would have done that  why any man who deemed himself a gentleman and who possessed such knowledge as i had  she laughed a laugh of unbelief  you are mistaken sir she answered the deed was worthy of one of those preux chevaliers we read of and i have never known but one man capable of accomplishing it  those words and the tone wherein they were uttered set my brain on fire i turned towards her our glances met and her eyesthose eyes that but a while ago had never looked on me without avowing the disdain wherein she had held mewere now filled with a light of kindliness of sympathy of tenderness that seemed more than i could endure  already my hand was thrust into the bosom of my doublet and my fingers were about to drag forth that little shred of green velvet that i had found in the coppice on the day of her abduction and that i had kept ever since as one keeps the relic of a departed saint another moment and i should have poured out the story of the mad hopeless passion that filled my heart to bursting when of a suddenyvonne yvonne came genevièves fresh voice from the other end of the terrace the spell of that moment was broken  methought mademoiselle made a little gesture of impatience as she answered her sisters call then with a word of apology she left me  half dazed by the emotions that had made sport of me i leaned over the balustrade and with my elbows on the stone and my chin on my palms i stared stupidly before me thanking god for having sent geneviève in time to save me from again earning mademoiselles scorn for as i grew sober i did not doubt that with scorn she would have met the wild words that already trembled on my lips  i laughed harshly and aloud such a laugh as those in hell may vent gaston gaston i muttered at thirtytwo you are more a fool than ever you were at twenty  i told myself then that my fancy had vested her tone and look with a kindliness far beyond that which they contained and as i thought of how i had deemed impatient the little gesture wherewith she had greeted genevièves interruption i laughed again  from the reverie into which naturally enough i lapsed it was mademoiselle who aroused me she stood beside me with an unrest of manner so unusual in her that straightway i guessed the substance of her talk with geneviève  so mademoiselle i said without waiting for her to speak you have learned what is afoot  i have she answered that they love each other is no news to me that they intend to wed does not surprise me but that they should contemplate a secret marriage passes my comprehension  i cleared my throat as men will when about to embark upon a perilous subject with no startingpoint determined  it is time mademoiselle i began that you should learn the true cause of m de mancinis presence at canaples it will enlighten you touching his motives for a secret wedding had things fallen out as was intended by those who planned his visitmonsieur your father and my lord cardinalit is improbable that you would ever have heard that which it now becomes necessary that i should tell you i trust mademoiselle i continued that you will hear me in a neutral spirit without permitting your personal feelings to enter into your consideration of that which i shall unfold  so long a preface augurs anything but well she interposed looking monstrous serious  not ill at least i hope hear me then your father and his eminence are friends the one has a daughter who is said to be very wealthy and whom he with fond ambition desires to see wedded to a man who can give her an illustrious name the other possesses a nephew whom he can ennoble by the highest title that a man may bear who is not a prince of the bloodand borne indeed by few who are notand whom he desires to see contract an alliance that will bring him enough of riches to enable him to bear his title with becoming dignity i glanced at mademoiselle whose cheeks were growing an ominous red  well mademoiselle i continued your father and monseigneur de mazarin appear to have bared their hearts desire to each other and m de mancini was sent to canaples to woo and win your fathers elder daughter  a long pause followed during which she stood with face aflame averted eyes and heaving bosom betraying the feelings that stormed within her at the disclosure of the bargain whereof she had been a part at lengthoh monsieur she exclaimed in a choking voice and clenching her shapely hands to think  i beseech you not to think mademoiselle i interrupted calmly for having taken the first plunge i was now master of myself the ironical little god whom the ancients painted with bandaged eyes has led m de mancini by the nose in this matter and things have gone awry for the plotters there mademoiselle you have the reason for a clandestine union did monsieur your father guess how andreas affections havei caught the word miscarried betimes and substitutedgone against his wishes his opposition is not a thing to be doubted  are you sure there is no mistake she inquired after a pause is all this really true monsieur  it is indeed  but how comes it that my father has seen naught of what has been so plain to methat m de mancini was ever at my sisters side  your father mademoiselle is much engrossed in his vineyard moreover when the chevalier has been at hand he has been careful to show no greater regard for the one than for the other of you i instructed him in this duplicity many weeks ago  she looked at me for a moment  oh monsieur she cried passionately how deep is my humiliation to think that i was made a part of so vile a bargain oh i am glad that m de mancini has proved above the sordid task to which they set himglad that he will dupe the cardinal and my father  so am not i mademoiselle i exclaimed she vouchsafed me a stare of ineffable surprise  how  diable i answered i am m de mancinis friend it was to shield him that i fought your brother again because of my attitude towards him was it that i went perilously near assassination at reaux enemies sprang up about him when the cardinals matrimonial projects became known your brother picked a quarrel with him and when i had dealt with your brother st auban appeared and after st auban there were others when it is known that he has played this trick upon uncle giulio his enemies will disappear but on the other hand his prospects will all be blighted and for that i am sorry  so that was the motive of your duel with eugène  at last you learn it  and she added in a curious voice you would have been better pleased had m de mancini carried out his uncles wishes  it matters little what i would think mademoiselle i answered guardedly for i could not read that curious tone of hers  nevertheless i am curious to hear your answer  what answer could i make the truththat for all my fine talk i was at heart and in a sense right glad that she was not to become andreas wifewould have seemed ungallant moreover i must have added the explanation that i desired to see her no mans wife so that i might not seem to contradict myself therefore  in truth mademoiselle i answered lying glibly it would have given me more pleasure had andrea chosen to obey his eminence  her manner froze upon the instant  in the consideration of your friends advancement she replied half contemptuously you forget m de luynes to consider me am i then a thing to be bartered into the hands of the first fortunehunter who woos me because he has been bidden so to do and who is to marry me for political purposes pshaw m de luynes she added with a scornful laugh after all i was a fool to expect aught else from  she checked herself abruptly and a sudden access of mercy left the stinging you unuttered i stood by dumb and sheepish not understanding how the words that i had deemed gallant could have brought this tempest down upon my head before i could say aught that might have righted matters or perchance made them worsesince you leave canaples tomorrow quoth she i will say adieu monsieur for it is unlikely that we shall meet again  with a slight inclination of her head and withholding her hand intentionally she moved away whilst i stood as only a fool or a statue would stand and watched her go  once she paused and indeed half turned whereupon hope knocked at my heart again but before i had admitted it she had resumed her walk towards the house hungrily i followed her graceful lissom figure with my eyes until she had crossed the threshold then with a dull ache in my breast i flung myself upon a stone seat and addressing myself to the setting sun for want of a better audience i roundly cursed her sex for the knottiest puzzle that had ever plagued the mind of man in the unravelling     chapter xvii father and son   gaston quoth andrea next morning you will remain at canaples until tomorrow you must for tomorrow i am to be wed and i would fain have your good wishes ere you go  nice hands mine to seek a benediction at i grumbled  but you will remain come gaston we have been good friends you and i and who knows when next we shall meet believe me i shall value your god speed above all others  likely enough since it will be the only one youll hear  but for all my sneers he was not to be put off he talked and coaxed so winningly that in the endalbeit i am a man not easily turned from the course he has set himselfthe affectionate pleading in his fresh young voice and the affectionate look in his dark eyes won me to his way  forthwith i went in quest of the chevalier whom at the indication of a lackey i discovered in the room it pleased him to call his studythat same room into which we had been ushered on the day of our arrival at canaples i told him that on the morrow i must set out for paris and albeit he at first expressed a polite regret yet when i had shown him how my honour was involved in my speedy return thither he did not urge me to put off my departure  it grieves me sir that you must go and i deeply regret the motive that is taking you yet i hope that his eminence in recognition of the services you have rendered his nephew will see fit to forget what cause for resentment he may have against you and render you your liberty if you will give me leave monsieur i will write to his eminence in this strain and you shall be the bearer of my letter  i thanked him with a smile of deprecation as i thought of the true cause of mazarins resentment which was precisely that of the plea upon which m de canaples sought to obtain for me my liberation  and now monsieur he pursued nervously touching andrea and his visit here i would say a word to you who are his friend and may haply know something of his mind it is over two months since he came here and yet theeraffair which we had hoped to bring about seems no nearer its conclusion than when first he came of late i have watched him and i have watched yvonne they are certainly good friends yet not even the frail barrier of formality appears overcome betwixt them and i am beginning to fear that andrea is not only lukewarm in this matter but is forgetful of his uncles wishes and selfishly indifferent to monseigneurs projects and mine which as he well knows are the reason of his sojourn at my château what think you of this m de luynes  he shot a furtive glance at me as he spoke and with his long lean forefinger he combed his beard in a nervous fashion  i gave a short laugh to cover my embarrassment at the question  what do i think monsieur i echoed to gain time then thinking that a sententious answer would be the most fittingma foi love is as the spark that lies latent in flint and steel for days and weeks these two may be as close together as you please and naught will come of it but one fine day a handthe hand of chancewill strike the one against the other and lothe spark is born  you speak in parables monsieur was his caustic comment  t is in parables that all religions are preached i returned and love methinks is a great religion in this world  love sir love he cried petulantly the word makes me sick what has love to do with this union love sir is a pretty theme for poets romancers and fools the imagination of such a sentimentfor it is a sentiment that does not live save in the imaginationmay serve to draw peasants and other low­bred clods into wedlock with such as wewith gentlemenit has naught to do so let that be monsieur andrea de mancini came hither to wed my daughter  and i am certain monsieur i answered stoutly that andrea will wed your daughter  you speak with confidence  i know andrea well signs that may be hidden to you are clear to me and i have faith in my prophecy  he looked at me and fell a victim to my confidence of manner the petulancy died out of his face  well well we will hope my lord cardinal is to create him duke and he will assume as title his wifes estate becoming known to history as andrea de mancini duke of canaples thus shall a great house be founded that will bear our name you see the importance of it  clearly  and how reasonable is my anxiety  assuredly  and you are in sympathy with me  pardieu why else did i go so near to killing your son  true he mused then suddenly he added apropos have you heard that eugène has become one of the leaders of these frondeur madmen  ah then he is quite recovered  unfortunately he assented with a grimace and thus our interview ended  that day wore slowly to its close i wandered hither and thither in the château and the grounds hungering throughout the long hours for a word with mademoisellea glimpse of her at least  but all day long she kept her chamber the pretext being that she was beset by a migraine by accident i came upon her that evening at last in the salon yet my advent was the signal for her departure and all the words she had for me were  still at canaples monsieur i thought you were to have left this morning she looked paler than her wont and her eyes were somewhat red  i am remaining until tomorrow said i awkwardly  vraiement was all she answered and she was gone  next morning the chevalier and i breakfasted alone mademoiselles migraine was worse geneviève was nursing so her maid brought wordwhilst andrea had gone out an hour before and had not returned  the chevalier shot me an apologetic glance across the board  t is a poor god speed to you m de luynes  i made light of it and turned the conversation into an indifferent channel wherein it abided until filling himself a bumper of anjou the chevalier solemnly drank to my safe journey and good fortune in paris  at that moment andrea entered by the door abutting on the terrace balcony he was flushed and his eyes sparkled with a joyous fever profuse was he in his apologies which howbeit were passing vague in character and which he brought to a close by pledging me as the chevalier had done already  as we rose geneviève appeared with the news that yvonne was somewhat better adding that she had come to take leave of me her composure surprised me gladly for albeit in her eyes there was also a telltale light the lids demurely downcast as was her wont amply screened it from the vulgar gaze  andrea would tell his fatherinlaw of the marriage later in the day and for all i am not a chickenhearted man still i had no stomach to be at hand when the storm broke  the moment having come for my departure and michelot awaiting me already with the horses in the courtyard m de canaples left us to seek the letter which i was to carry to his eminence so soon as the door had closed upon him andrea came forward leading his bride by the hand and asked me to wish them happiness  with all my heart i answered and if happiness be accorded you in a measure with the fervency of my wishes then shall you indeed be happy each of you i congratulate upon the companion in life you have chosen cherish him mademoimadame for he is loyal and trueand such are rare in this world  it is possible that i might have said more in this benign and fatherly strainfor it seemed to me that this new role i had assumed suited me wondrous wellbut a shadow that drew our eyes towards the nearest window interrupted me and what we saw there drew a cry from andrea a shudder from geneviève and from me a gasp that was half amazement half dismay for leaning upon the sill surveying us with a sardonic evil grin we beheld eugène de canaples the man whom i had left with a swordthrust through his middle behind the hôtel vendôme two months ago whence was he sprung and why came he thus to his fathers house  he started as i faced him for doubtless st auban had boasted to him that he had killed me in a duel for a moment he remained at the window then he disappeared and we could hear the ring of his spurred heel as he walked along the balcony towards the door  and simultaneously came the quick hurrying steps of the chevalier de canaples as he crossed the hall returning with the letter he had gone to fetch  geneviève shuddered again and looked fearfully from one door to the other andrea drew a sharp breath like a man in pain whilst i rapped out an oath to brace my nerves for the scene which we all three foresaw then in silence we waited some subtle instinct warning us of the disaster that impended  the steps on the balcony halted and a second later those in the hall and then as though the thing had been rehearsed and timed so that the spectators might derive the utmost effect from it the doors opened together and on the opposing thresholds with the width of the room betwixt them stood father and son confronted     chapter xviii of how i left canaples   whilst a man might tell a dozen did those two remain motionless the one eyeing the other but their bearing was as widely different as their figures eugènes stalwart frame stood firm and erect insolence in every line of it reflected perchance from the smile that lurked about the corners of his thin­lipped mouth  the hat which he had not had the grace to doff set jauntily upon his straight black hair the jerkin of leather which he wore and the stout sword which hung from the plainest of belts all served to give him the air of a ruffler or tavern knight  the chevalier on the other hand stood as if turned to stone from his enervated fingers the letter fluttered to the ground and on his pale thin face was to be read a displeasure mixed with fear  at length with an oath the old man broke the silence  what seek you at canaples he asked in a quivering voice as he advanced into the room are you so dead to shame that you dare present yourself with such effrontery off with your hat sir he blazed stamping his foot and going from pale to crimson off with your hat or mortdieu ill have you flung out of doors by my grooms  this show of vehemence as sudden as it was unexpected drew from eugène a meek obedience that i had not looked for nevertheless the young mans lip curled as he uncovered  how fatherly is your greeting he sneered the chevaliers eyes flashed a glance that lacked no venom at his son  what manner of greeting did you look for he returned hotly did you expect me to set a ring upon your finger and have the fattened calf killed in honour of your return sangdieu sir have you come hither to show me how a father should welcome the profligate son who has dishonoured his name why are you here unbidden answer me sir  a deep flush overspread eugènes cheeks  i had thought when i crossed the threshold that this was the château de canaples or else that my name was canaplesi know not which clearly i was mistaken for here is a lady who has no word either of greeting or intercession for me and who therefore cannot be my sister and yonder a man whom i should never look to find in my fathers house  i took a step forward a hot answer on my lips when from the doorway at my back came yvonnes sweet voice  eugène you here  as you see sister though had you delayed your coming t is probable you would no longer have found me for your father welcomes me with oaths and threatens me with his grooms  she cast a reproachful glance upon the chevalier neath which the anger seemed to die out of him then she went forward with hands outstretched and a sad smile upon her lips  yvonne the chevaliers voice rang out sharp and sudden  she stopped  i forbid you to approach that man  for a moment she appeared to hesitate then leisurely pursuing her way she set her hands upon her brothers shoulders and embraced him  the chevalier swore through set teeth geneviève trembled andrea looked askance and i laughed softly at the chevaliers discomfiture eugène flung his hat and cloak into a corner and strode across the room to where his father stood  and now monsieur since i have travelled all the way from paris to save my house from a step that will bring it into the contempt of all france i shall not go until you have heard me  the chevalier shrugged his shoulders and made as if to turn away yvonnes greeting of her brother appeared to have quenched the spark of spirit that for a moment had glimmered in the little mans breast  monsieur cried eugène believe me that what i have to say is of the utmost consequence and say it i willwhether before these strangers or in your private ear shall be as you elect  the old man glanced about him like one who seeks a way of escape at lastif say it you must he growled say it here and now and when you have said it go  eugène scowled at me and from me to andrea to pay him for that scowl i had it in my mind to stay but overcoming the clownish thought i took andrea by the arm  come andrea i said we will take a turn outside while these family matters are in discussion  i had a shrewd idea what was the substance of eugènes mission to canaplesto expostulate with his father touching the proposed marriage of yvonne to the cardinals nephew  nor was i wrong for when some moments later the chevalier recalled us from the terrace where we were strollingwhat think you he has come hither to tell me he inquired as we entered he pointed to his son as he spoke and passion shook his slender frame as the breeze shakes a leaf mademoiselle and geneviève sat hand in handyvonne deadly pale geneviève weeping  what think you he has the effrontery to say têtedieu it seems that he has profited little by the lesson you read him in the horsemarket about meddling in matters which concern him not he has come hither to tell me that he will not permit his sister to wed the cardinals nephew that he will not have the estates of canaples pass into the hands of a foreign upstart he forsoothhe he he and at each utterance of the pronoun he lunged with his forefinger in the direction of his son this he is not ashamed to utter before yvonne herself  you compelled me to do so cried eugène angrily  i ejaculated the chevalier did i compel you to come hither with your i will and i will not who are you that you should give laws at canaples and he adds sir quoth the old knight excitedly that sooner than allow this marriage to take place he will kill m de mancini  i shall be happy to afford him the opportunity shouted andrea bounding forward  eugène looked up quickly and gave a short laugh thereupon followed a wild hubbub everyone rushed forward and everyone talked even little genevièvelouder than all the rest  you shall not fight you shall not fight she cried and her voice was so laden with command that all others grew silent and all eyes were turned upon her  what affair is this of yours little one quoth eugène  t is this she answered panting that you need fear no marriage twixt my sister and andrea  in her eagerness she had cast caution to the winds of heaven her father and brother stared askance at her i gave an inward groan  andrea echoed eugène at last what is this man to you that you speak thus of him  the girl flung herself upon her fathers breast  father she sobbed dear father forgive  the chevaliers brow grew dark roughly he seized her by the arms and holding her at arms length scanned her face  what must i forgive he inquired in a thick voice what is m de mancini to you  some sinister note in her fathers voice caused the girl to grow of a sudden calm and to assume a rigidity that reminded me of her sister  he is my husband she answered and there was a note of pridealmost of triumphin her voice  an awful silence followed the launching of that thunderbolt eugène stood with open mouth staring now at geneviève now at his father andrea set his arm about his brides waist and her fair head was laid trustingly upon his shoulder the chevaliers eyes rolled ominously at length he spoke in a dangerously calm voice  how long is ithow long have you been wed  we were wed in blois an hour ago answered geneviève  something that was like a grunt escaped the chevalier then his eye fastened upon me and his anger boiled up  you knew of this he asked coming towards me  i knew of it  then you lied to me yesterday  i drew myself up stiff as a broomstick  i do not understand i answered coldly  did you not give me your assurance that m de mancini would marry yvonne  i did not monsieur i did but tell you that he would wed your daughter and ma foi your daughter he has wed  you have fooled me scélérat he blazed out you who have been sheltered by  father yvonne interrupted taking his arm m de luynes has behaved no worse than have i or any one of us in this matter  no he cried and pointed to andrea t is you who have wrought this infamy eugène he exclaimed turning of a sudden to his son you have a sword wipe out this shame  shame echoed geneviève oh father where is the shame if it were no shame for andrea to marry yvonne surely  silence he thundered eugène  but eugène answered him with a contemptuous laugh  you are quick enough to call upon my sword now that things have not fallen out as you would have them where are your grooms now monsieur  insolent hound cried his father indignantly then letting fall his arms with something that was near akin to a sobis there no one left to do aught but mock me he groaned  but this weakness was no more than momentary  out of my house sir he blazed turning upon andrea and for a moment methought he would have struck him out of my houseyou and this wife of yours  father sobbed geneviève with hands outstretched in entreaty  out of my house he repeated and you also m de luynes away with you go with the master you have served so well and turning on his heel he strode towards the door  fatherdear father cried geneviève following him he slammed the door in her face for answer  with a moan she sank down upon her knees her frail body shaken by convulsive sobsdieu what a bridal morn was hers  andrea and yvonne raised her and led her to a chair eugène watched them with a cynical eye then laughed brutally and gathering up his hat and cloak he moved towards the balcony door and vanished  is m de luynes still there quoth geneviève presently  i am here madame  you had best set out monsieur she said we shall follow soonvery soon  i took andrea aside and asked him whither it was his intention to take his wife he replied that they would go to chambord where they would remain for some weeks in the hope that the chevalier might relent sufficiently to forgive them thereafter it was his purpose to take his bride home to his sicilian demesne  our farewells were soon spoken yet none the less warm for all its brevity was my leavetaking of andrea and our wishes for each others happiness were as fervent as the human heart can shape we little thought that we were not destined to meet again for years  yvonnes adieu was cold and formalso cold and formal that it seemed to rob the sunshine of its glory for me as i stepped out into the open air  after all what mattered it i was a fool to have entertained a single tender thought concerning her     chapter xix of my return to paris   scant cause is there for me to tarry over the details of my return to paris a sad enough journey was it as sad for my poor michelot as for myself since he rode with one so dejected as i  things had gone ill and i feared that when the cardinal heard the story things would go worse for mazarin was never a tolerant man nor one to be led by the gospel of mercy and forgiveness for myself i foresaw the ropepossibly even the wheel and a hundred times a day i dubbed myself a fool for obeying the voice of honour with such punctiliousness when so grim a reward awaited me what mood was on meme gaston de luynes whose honour had been long since besmirched and tattered until no outward semblance of honour was left  but swift in the footsteps of that question would come the answeryvonne ay truly enough it was because in my heart i had dared to hold a sentiment of love for her the purestnay the only purething my heart had held for many a year that i would set nothing vile to keep company with that sentiment that until my sun should setand already it dropped swiftly towards lifes horizonmy actions should be the actions of such a man as might win yvonnes affections  but let that be this idle restrospective mood can interest you but little nor can you profit from it unless indeed it be by noting how holy and cleansing to the heart of man is the lovealbeit unrequitedthat he bears a good woman  as we drew near meungwhere we lay on that first night of our journeya light travelling chaise going in the same direction passed us at a gallop as it flashed by i caught a glimpse of eugène de canapless swart face through the window whether the recognition was mutual i cannot saynor does it signify  when we reached the hôtel de la couronne half an hour later we saw that same chaise disappearing round a corner of the street whilst through the portecochère the hostler was leading a pair of horses foamflecked and steaming with sweat  whither went master canaples at such a rate and in a haste that caused him to travel day and night to a goal he little looked foror rather which in the madness of his headlong rush he could not see so i was to learn ere long  next day i awoke betimes and setting my window wide to let in the fresh cleansmelling air of that may morning i made shift to dress save for the cackle of the poultry which had strayed into the courtyard and the noisy yawns and sleepladen ejaculations of the stableboy who was drawing water for the horses all was still for it had not yet gone five oclock  but of a sudden a door opened somewhere and a step rang out accompanied by the jangle of spurs and with it came a sharp unpleasant voice calling for its owners horse there was a familiar sound in those shrill accents that caused me to thrust my head through the casement but i was quick to withdraw it as i recognised in the gaily dressed little fellow below my old friend malpertuis  i know not what impulse made me draw back so suddenly the action was as much the child of instinct as of the lately acquired habit of concealing my face from the gaze of all who were likely to spread abroad the news that i still lived  from behind my curtains i watched malpertuis ride out of the yard saying in answer to a parting question of the landlord who had come upon the scene that he would breakfast at beaugency  then as he rode down the street he of a sudden raised his discordant voice and sang to the accompaniment of his horses hoofs and the burden of his song ran thus       a frondeur wind      got up today      gainst mazarin      it blows they say  i listened in amazement to his ravens voice  whither was he bound i asked myself and whence a haste that made him set out fasting with an anticardinalist ditty on his lips and ride two leagues to seek a breakfast in a village that did not hold an inn where a dog might be housed in comfort  like eugène de canaples he also travelled towards a goal that he little dreamt of and so albeit the one went south and the other north these two men were between them drawing together the thread of this narrative of mine as anon you shall learn  we reached paris at dusk three days later and we went straight to my old lodging in the rue st antoine  coupri started and gasped upon beholding me and not until i had cursed him for a fool in a voice that was passing human would he believe that i was no ghost he too had heard the rumour of my death  i dispatched michelot to the palais royal wherewithout permitting his motive to transpirehe was to ascertain for me whether m de montrésor was in paris whether he still dwelt at the hôtel des cloches and at what hour he could be found there  whilst he was away i went up to my room and there i found a letter which coupri informed me had been left by a lackey a month agobefore the report that i had been killed had reached parisand since lain forgotten it was a delicate note to which still hung the ghost of a perfume there were no arms on the seal but the writing i took to be that of my aunt the duchesse de chevreuse and vaguely marvelling what motive she could have had for communicating with me i cut the silk  it was indeed from the duchesse but it contained no more than a request that i should visit her at her hôtel on the day following upon that on which she had written adding that she had pleasing news for me  i thrust the note into my pocket with a sigh of what could it avail me now to present myself at her hôtel her invitation was for a month ago since then she would likely enough have heard the rumour that had been current and would have ceased to expect me  i caught myself wondering whether the news might have caused her a pang of regret and somehow methought this possible for of all my relatives madame de chevreuse was the only oneand she was but my aunt by marriagewho of late years had shown me any kindness or even recognition i marvelled what her pleasing news could be and i concluded that probably she had heard of my difficulties and wished once again to help me out of them well my purse was hollow indeed at the moment but i need not trouble her since i was going somewhere where purses are not neededon a journey to which no expenses are attached  in my heart nevertheless i blessed the gracious lady who for all the lies that the world may have told of her was the kindest woman i had known and the bestsave one other  i was still musing when michelot returned with the information that m de montrésor was to be found at the hôtel des cloches whither he had gone to sup a few minutes before straightway i set out bidding him attend me and muffled in my cloak i proceeded at a brisk pace to the rue des fosses st germain where the lieutenants auberge was situated  i left michelot in the commonroom and preceded by the plump little woman who owned the house i ascended to montrésors chamber i found the young soldier at table and fortunately alone he rose as i entered and as the hostess retreating closed the door i doffed my hat and letting fall my cloak revealed myself his lips parted and i heard the hiss of an indrawn breath as his astonished eyes fell upon my countenance my laugh dispelled his doubts that i might be other than flesh and bloodyet not his doubts touching my identity he caught up a taper and coming forward he cast the light on my face for a moment then setting the candle back upon the table he vented his surprise in an oath or two which was natural enough in one of his calling  t is clear lieutenant quoth i as i detached my sword from the baldrick that you believed me dead fate willed however that i should be restored to life and so soon as i had recovered sufficient strength to undertake the journey to paris i set out i arrived an hour ago and here i am to redeem my word of honour and surrender the sword and liberty which you but lent me  i placed my rapier on the table and waited for him to speak instead however he continued to stare at me for some moments and when at last he did break the silence it was to burst into a laugh that poured from his throat in rich mellow peals as he lay back in his chair  my wrath arose had i travelled from blois and done what i deemed the most honourable deed of my life to be laughed at for my pains by a foppish young jackanapes of his eminences guards something of my displeasure must he have seen reflected on my face for of a sudden he checked his mirth  forgive me m de luynes he gasped pardieu t is no matter for laughter and albeit i laughed with more zest than courtesy i give you my word that my admiration for you vastly exceeds my amusement m de luynes he added rising and holding out his hand to me there are liars in paris who give you an evil namemen who laughed at me when they heard that i had given you leave to go on parole to st sulpice des reaux that night trusting to your word of honour that you would return if you lived his eminence dubbed me a fool and went near to dismissing me from his service and yet i have now the proof that my confidence was not misplaced since even though you were believed to be dead you did not hesitate to bring me your sword  monsieur spare me i exclaimed for in truth his compliments waxed as irksome as had been his whilom merriment  he continued however his laudatory address and when it was at last ended and he paused exhausted alike in breath and brain it was to take up my sword and return it to me with my parole pronouncing me a free man and advising me to let men continue to think me dead and to withdraw from france he cut short my halfprotesting thanks and calling the hostess bade her set another cover whilst me he invited to share his supper and as we ate he again urged upon me the advice that i should go abroad  for by heaven he added mazarin has been as a raging beast since the news was brought him yesterday of his nephews marriage  how i cried he has heard already  he has indeed and should he learn that your flesh still walks the earth methinks it would go worse with you than it went even with eugène de canaples  in answer to the questions with which i excitedly plied him i drew from him the story of how eugène had arrived the day before in paris and gone straight to the palais royal m de montrésor had been on guard in the antechamber and in virtue of an excitement noticeable in canapless bearing coupled with the illodour wherein already he was held by mazarin the lieutenants presence had been commanded in the cardinals closet during the interviewfor his eminence was never like to acquire fame for valour  in his exultation at what had chanced and at the manner in which mazarins château en espagne had been dispelled canaples used little caution or even discretion in what he said in fact from what montrésor told me i gathered that the fools eagerness to be the first to bear the tidings to mazarin sprang from a rash desire to gloat over the cardinals discomfiture he had told his story insolentlyalmost derisivelyand mazarins fury driven beyond bounds already by what he had heard became a very tempest of passion neath the lash of canapless impertinences and naturally enough that tempest had burst upon the only head availableeugène de canaplessand the cardinal had answered his jibes with interest by calling upon montrésor to arrest the fellow and bear him to the bastille  when the astonished and sobered canaples had indignantly asked upon what charge he was being robbed of his liberty the cardinal had laughed at him and answered with his neverfailing axiom that he who sings pays  you sang lustily enough just now his eminence had added and you shall pay by lodging awhile in an oubliette of the bastille where you may lift up your voice to sing the de profundis  was my name not mentioned i anxiously inquired when montrésor had finished  not once you may depend that i should have remarked it after i had taken canaples away the cardinal i am told sat down and still trembling with rage wrote a letter which he straightway dispatched to the chevalier armand de canaples at blois  no doubt i mused he attributes much blame to me for what has come to pass  not a doubt of it this morning he said to me that it was a pity your wings had not been clipped before you left paris and that his misplaced clemency had helped to bring him great misfortunes you see therefore m de luynes that your sojourn in france will be attended with great peril i advise you to try spain t is a martial country where a man of the sword may find honourable and even profitable employment  his counsel i deemed sound but how follow it then of a sudden i bethought me of madame de chevreuses friendly letter doubtless she would assist me once again and in such an extremity as this and with the conception of the thought came the resolution to visit her on the morrow that formed i gave myself up to the task of drinking m de montrésor under the table with an abandon which had not been mine for months in each goblet that i drained methought i saw yvonnes sweet face floating on the surface of the red armagnac it looked now sad now reproachful still i drank on and in each cup i pledged her     chapter xx of how the chevalier de canaples became a frondeur   it wanted an hour or so to noon next day as i drove across the pont neuf in a closed carriage and was borne down the rue st dominique to the portals of that splendid palace facing the jacobins which bears the title of the hôtel de luynes and over the portals of which is carved the escutcheon of our house  michelotin obedience to the orders i had given himgot down only to be informed that madame la duchesse was in the country the lackey who was summoned did not know where the lady might be found nor when she might return to paris and so i was compelled to drive back almost despairingly to the rue st antoine and there lie concealed nursing my impatience until my aunt should return  daily i sent michelot to the hôtel de luynes to make the same inquiry and to return daily with the same dispiriting replythat there was no news of madame la duchesse  in this fashion some three weeks wore themselves out during which period i lay in my concealment a prey to weariness unutterable i might not venture forth save at night unless i wore a mask and as masks were no longer to be worn without attracting noticeas during the late kings reigni dared not indulge the practice  certainly my ennui was greatly relieved by the visits of montrésor which grew very frequent the lad appearing to have conceived a kindness for me and during those three weeks our fellowship at nights over a bottle or two engendered naturally enough a friendship and an intimacy between us  i had written to andrea on the morrow of my return to paris to tell him how kindly montrésor had dealt with me and some ten days later the following letter was brought me by the lieutenantto whom for safety it had been forwarded   my very dear gaston  i have no words wherewith to express my joy at the good news you send me which terminates the anxiety that has been mine since you left us on the disastrous morning of our nuptials  the uncertainty touching your fate the fear that the worst might have befallen you and the realisation that ifor whom you have done so muchmight do naught for you in your hour of need has been the one cloud to mar the sunshine of my own bliss  that cloud your letter has dispelled and the knowledge of your safety renders my happiness complete  the chevalier maintains his unforgiving mood as no doubt doth also my lord cardinal but what to me are the frowns of either so that my lady smile my little geneviève is yet somewhat vexed in spirit at all this but i am teaching her to have faith in time the patron saint of all lovers who follow not the course their parents set them and so that time may be allowed to intercede and appeal to the parent heart with the potent prayer of a daughters absence i shall take my lady from chambord some three days hence we shall travel by easy stages to marseilles and there take ship for palermo  and so dear trusty friend until we meet again fare you well and may god hold you safe from the wickedness of man devil and my lord cardinal  for all that you have done for me no words of mine can thank you but should you determine to quit this france of yours and journey to palermo after me you shall never want a roof to shelter you or a board to sit at so long as roof and board are owned by him who signs himself in love at least your brother  andrea de mancini   with a sigh i set the letter down a sigh of love and gratitude it was a sigh also of regret for the bright happy boy who had been the source alike of my recent joys and sorrows and whom methought i was not likely to see again for many a day since the peaceful vegetation of his sicilian home held little attraction for me a man of action  it was on the evening of the last sunday in may whilst the bell of the jesuits close by was tinkling out its summons to vespers that montrésor burst suddenly into my room with the request that i should get my hat and cloak and go with him to pay a visit in reply to my questionsmonseigneurs letter to armand de canaples he said has borne fruit already come with me and you shall learn how  he led me past the bastille and up the rue des tournelles to the door of an unpretentious house upon which he knocked we were admitted by an old woman to whom montrésor appeared to be known for after exchanging a word or two with her he himself led the way upstairs and opened the door of a room for me  by the melancholy light of a single taper burning upon the table i beheld a fairsized room containing a curtained bed  my companion took up the candle and stepping to the bedside he drew apart the curtains  lying there i beheld a man whose countenance despite its pallor and the bloody bandages about his brow i recognised for that of the little spitfire malpertuis  as the light fell upon his face the little fellow opened his eyes and upon beholding me at his side he made a sudden movement which wrung from him a cry of pain  lie still monsieur said montrésor quietly  but for all the lieutenants remonstrances he struggled up into a sitting posture requesting montrésor to set the pillows at his back  thank god you are here m de luynes he said i learnt at canaples that you were not dead  you have been to canaples  i was a guest of the chevalier for twelve days i arrived there on the day after your departure  you i ejaculated pray what took you to canaples  what took me there he echoed turning his feverish eyes upon me almost with fierceness the same motive that led me to join hands with that ruffian st auban when he spoke of waging war against mancini the same motive that led me to break with him when i saw through his plans and when the abduction of mademoiselle was on foot the same motive that made me come to you and tell you of the proposed abduction so that you might interfere if you had the power or cause others to do so if you had not  i lay back in my chair and stared at him was this then another suitor of yvonne de canaples and were all men mad with love of her  presently he continued  when i heard that st auban was in paris having apparently abandoned all hope in connection with mademoiselle i obtained a letter from m de la rochefoucauldwho is an intimate friend of mineand armed with this i set out as luck would have it i got embroiled in the streets of blois with a couple of cardinalist gentlemen who chose to be offended by lampoon of the fronde that i was humming i am not a patient man and i am even indiscreet in moments of choler i ended by crying down with mazarin and all his creatures and i would of a certainty have had my throat slit had not a slight and elegant gentleman interposed and exercising a wonderful influence over my assailants extricated me from my predicament this gentleman was the chevalier de canaples he was strangely enough in a mood to be pleased by an anticardinalist ditty for his rage against andrea de manciniwhich he took no pains to concealhad extended already to the cardinal and from morn till night he did little else but revile the whole italian broodas he chose to dub the cardinals family  i recognised the old knights weak vacillating character in this a creature of moods that like the vane on a steeple turns this way or that as the wind blows  i crave your patience m de luynes he continued and beg of you to hear my story so that you may determine whether you will save the canaples from the danger that threatens them i only ask that you dispatch a reliable messenger to blois but hear me out first in virtue as much of la rochefoucaulds letters as of the sentiments which the chevalier heard me express i became the honoured guest at his château three days after my arrival i sustained a shock by the unexpected appearance at canaples of st auban the chevalier however refused him admittance and baffled the marquis was forced to withdraw but he went no farther than blois where he hired himself a room at the lys de france the chevalier hated him as a mad dog hates wateralmost as much as he hated you he spoke often of you and always bitterly  before i knew what i had said  and mademoiselle i burst out did she ever mention my name  malpertuis looked up quickly at the question and a wan smile flickered round his lips  once she spoke of you to mepityingly as one might speak of a dead man whose life had not been good  yes yes i broke in it matters little your story m malpertuis  after i had been at the château ten days we learnt that eugène de canaples had been sent to the bastille the news came in a letter penned by his eminence himselfa bitter viperish letter with a covert threat in every line the chevaliers anger went white hot as he read the disappointed cardinals epistle his eminence accused eugène of being a frondeur m de canaples whose politics had grown sadly rusted in the country asked me the meaning of the word i explained to him the petty squabbles between court and parliament in consequence of the extortionate imposts and of mazarins avariciousness i avowed myself a partisan of the fronde and within three days the chevalierwho but a little time before had sought an alliance with the cardinals familyhad become as rabid a frondeur as m de gondi as fierce an anti­cardinalist as m de beaufort  i humoured him in his new madness with the result that ere long from being a frondeur in heart he thirsted to become a frondeur in deeds and he ended by begging me to bear a letter from him to the coadjutor of paris wherein he offered to place at m de gondis disposal towards the expenses of the civil war which he believed to be imminentas indeed it isthe sum of sixty thousand livres  now albeit i had gone to canaples for purposes of my own and not as an agent of m le coadjuteurs still for many reasons i saw fit to undertake the chevaliers commission and so bearing the letter in question which was hot and unguarded and charged with endless treasonable matter i set out four days later for paris arriving here yesterday  i little knew that i had been followed by st auban his suspicions must have been awakened i know not how and clearly they were confirmed when i stopped before the coadjutors house last night i was about to mount the steps when of a sudden i was seized from behind by half a dozen hands and dragged into a side street i got free for a moment and attempted to defend myself but besides st auban there were two others they broke my sword and attempted to break my skull in which they went perilously near succeeding as you see albeit halfswooning i had yet sufficient consciousness left to realise that my pockets were being emptied and that at last they had torn open my doublet and withdrawn the treasonable letter from the breast of it  i was left bleeding in the kennel and there i lay for nigh upon an hour until a passerby succoured me and carried out my request to be brought hither and put to bed  he ceased and for some moments there was silence broken only by the wounded mans laboured breathing which argued that his narrative had left him fatigued at last i sprang up  the chevalier de canaples must be warned i exclaimed  t is an ugly business muttered montrésor ill wager a hundred that mazarin will hang the chevalier if he catches him just now  he would not dare cried malpertuis  not dare echoed the lieutenant the man who imprisoned the princes of condé and conti and the duke of beaufort not dare hang a provincial knight with never a friend at court pah monsieur you do not know cardinal mazarin  i realised to the full how likely montrésors prophecy was to be fulfilled and before i left malpertuis i assured him that he had not poured his story into the ears of an indifferent listener and that i would straightway find means of communicating with canaples     chapter xxi of the bargain that st auban drove with my lord cardinal   from the wounded mans bedside i wended my steps back to the rue st antoine resolved to start for blois that very night and beside me walked montrésor with bent head like a man deep in thought  at my door i paused to take my leave of the lieutenant for i was in haste to have my preparations made and to be gone but montrésor appeared not minded to be dismissed thus easily  what plan have you formed he asked  the only plan there is to formto set out for canaples at once  hum he grunted and again was silent then suddenly throwing back his head par la mort dieu he cried i care not what comes of it ill tell you what i know lead the way to your chamber m de luynes and delay your departure until you have heard me  surprised as much by his words as by the tone in which he uttered them which was that of a man who is angry with himself i passively did as i was bidden  once within my little antechamber he turned the key with his own hands and pointing to the door of my bedroomin there monsieur quoth he we shall be safe from listeners  deeper grew my astonishment at all this mystery as we passed into the room beyond  now m de luynes he cried flinging down his hat for no apparent reason i am about to commit treason i am about to betray the hand that pays me  if no reason exists why do so evil a deed i inquired calmly i have learnt during our association to wish you well montrésor if by telling me that which your tongue burns to tell you shall have cause for shame the door is yonder go before harm is done and leave me alone to fight my battle out  he stood up and for a moment he seemed to waver then dismissing his doubts with an abrupt gesture he sat down again  there is no wrong in what i do right is with you m de luynes and if i break faith with the might i serve it is because that might is an unjust one i do but betray the false to the true and there can be little shame in such an act moreover i have a reasonbut let that be  he was silent for a moment then he resumed  most of that which you have learnt from malpertuis tonight i myself could have told you yes st auban has carried canapless letter to the cardinal already i heard from his lips todayfor i was present at the interviewhow the document had been wrested from malpertuis for your sake so that you might learn all he knew i sought the fellow out and having found him in the rue des tournelles i took you thither  in a very fever of excitement i listened  to take up the thread of the story where malpertuis left off let me tell you that st auban sought an audience with mazarin this morning and by virtue of a note which he desired an usher to deliver to his eminence he was admitted the first of all the clients that for hours had thronged the anteroom as in the instance of the audience to eugène de canaples so upon this occasion did it chance that the cardinals fears touching st aubans purpose had been roused for he bade me stand behind the curtains in his cabinet  the marquis spoke bluntly enough and with rude candour he stated that since mazarin had failed to bring the canaples estates into his family by marriage he came to set before his eminence a proof so utter of canapless treason that it would enable him to snatch the estates by confiscation the cardinal may have been staggered by st aubans bluntness but his avaricious instincts led him to stifle his feelings and bid the marquis to set this proof before him but st auban had a bargain to drivea preposterous one methought he demanded that in return for his delivering into the hands of mazarin the person of armand de canaples together with an incontestable proof that the chevalier was in league with the frondeurs and had offered to place a large sum of money at their disposal he was to receive as recompense the demesne of canaples on the outskirts of blois together with one third of the confiscated estates at first mazarin gasped at his audacity then laughed at him whereupon st auban politely craved his eminences permission to withdraw this the cardinal however refused him and bidding him remain he sought to bargain with him but the marquis replied that he was unversed in the ways of trade and barter and that he had no mind to enter into them from bargaining the cardinal passed on to threatening and from threatening to whining and so on until the endst auban preserving a firm demeanourthe comedy was played out and mazarin fell in with his proposal and his terms  mille diables i cried and has st auban set out  he starts tomorrow and i go with him when finally the cardinal had consented the marquis demanded and obtained from him a promise in writing signed and sealed by mazarin that he should receive a third of the canaples estates and the demesne on the outskirts of blois in exchange for the body of armand de canaples dead or alive and a proof of treason sufficient to warrant his arrest and the confiscation of his estates next seeing in what regard the seigneur is held by the people of blois and fearing that his arrest might be opposed by many of his adherents the marquis has demanded a troop of twenty men this mazarin has also granted him entrusting the command of the troop to me under st auban further the marquis has stipulated that the greatest secrecy is to be observed and has expressed his purpose of going upon this enterprise disguised and masked foras he rightly opineswhen months hence he enters into possession of the demesne of canaples in the character of purchaser did the blaisois recognise in him the man who sold the chevalier his life would stand in hourly peril  i heard him through patiently enough yet when he stopped my pentup feelings burst all bonds and i resolved there and then to go in quest of that judas st auban and make an end of his plotting for all time but montrésor restrained me showing me how futile such a course must prove and how i risked losing all chance of aiding those at canaples  he was right first i must warn the chevalierafterwards i would deal with st auban  someone knocked at that moment and with the entrance of michelot my talk with montrésor came perforce to an end for michelot brought me the news that for days i had been awaiting madame de chevreuse had returned to paris at last  but for montrésors remonstrances it is likely that i should have set out forthwith to wait upon her i permitted myself however to be persuaded that the lateness of the hour would render my visit unwelcome and so i determined in the endalbeit grudginglyto put off my departure for blois until the morrow  noon had but struck from nôtre dame next day as i mounted the steps of the hôtel de luynes my swagger and that brave suit of pearl grey velvet with its silver lace bore me unchallenged past the gorgeous suisse who stood majestic in the doorway  but for the first mincing lackey i chanced upon more was needed to gain me an audience and so as i did not choose to speak my name i drew a ring from my finger and bade him bear it to the duchesse  he obeyed me in this and presently returning he bowed low and begged of me to follow him for as i had thought albeit madame de chevreuse might not know to whom that ring belonged yet the arms of luynes carved upon the stone had sufficed to ensure an interview  i was ushered into a pretty boudoir hung in blue and gold which overlooked the garden and wherein reclining upon a couch with a book of bois roberts verses in her white and slender hand i found my beautiful aunt  of this famous lady who was the cherished friend and more than sister of anne of austria much has been written much that is good and morefar morethat is ill for those who have a queen for friend shall never lack for enemies but those who have praised and those who have censured have at least been at one touching her marvellous beauty at the time whereof i write it is not possible that she could be less than fortysix and yet her figure was slender and shapely and still endowed with the grace of girlhood her face delicate of tint and little marked by timeor even by the sufferings to which in the late kings reign cardinal de richelieu had subjected her her eyes were blue and peaceful as a summer sky her hair was the colour of ripe corn he would be a hardy guesser who set her age at so much as thirty  my appearance she greeted by letting fall her book and lifting up her handsthe loveliest in franceshe uttered a little cry of surprise  is it really you gaston she asked  albeit it was growing wearisome to be thus greeted by all to whom i showed myself yet i studied courtesy in my reply and then neath the suasion of her kindliness i related all that had befallen me since first i had journeyed to blois in andrea de mancinis company withholding however all allusions to my feelings towards yvonne why betray them when they were doomed to be stifled in the breast that begat them but madame de chevreuse had not been born a woman and lived six and forty years to no purpose  and this maid with as many suitors as penelope is she very beautiful she inquired slyly  france does not hold her equal i answered falling like a simpleton into the trap she had set me  this to me quoth she archly fi donc gaston your evil ways have taught you as little gallantry as dissimulation and her merry ripple of laughter showed me how in six words i had betrayed that which i had been at such pains to hide  but before i could by protestations plunge deeper than i stood already the duchesse turned the conversation adroitly to the matter of that letter of hers wherein she had bidden me wait upon her  a cousin of mineone marion de luynes who like myself had through the evil of his ways become an outcast from his familywas lately dead unlike me however he was no adventurous soldier of fortune but a man of peace with an estate in provence that had a rentroll of five thousand livres a year on his deathbed he had cast about him for an heir unwilling that his estate should swell the fortunes of the family that in life had disowned him into his ear some kindly angel had whispered my name and the memory that i shared with him the frowns of our house and that my plight must be passing pitiful had set up a bond of sympathy between us which had led him to will his lands to me of madame de chevreusewho clearly was the patron saint of those of her first husbands nephews who chanced to tread ungodly waysmy cousin marion had besought that she should see to the fulfilment of his last wishes  my brain reeled beneath the first shock of that unlookedfor news already i saw myself transformed from a needy adventurer into a gentleman of fortune and methought my road to yvonne lay open all obstacles removed but swiftly there followed the thought of my own position and truly it seemed that a cruel irony lay in the manner wherein things had fallen out since did i declare myself to be alive and claim the provence estates the cardinals claws would be quick to seize me  thus much i told madame de chevreuse but her answer cheered me and said much for my late cousins prudence  nay she cried marion was ever shrewd knowing that men who live by the sword as you have lived are often wont to die by the swordand that suddenly at timeshe has made provision that in the event of your being dead his estates shall come to me who have been the most indulgent of his relatives this my dear gaston has already taken place for we believed you dead and therein fortune has been kind to you for now while receiving the revenues of your landswhich the world will look upon as minei shall contrive that they reach you wherever you may be until such a time as you may elect to come to life again  now but for the respect in which i held her i could have taken the pretty duchesse in my arms and kissed her  restraining myself however i contented myself by kissing her hand and told her of the journey i was going then craved another boon of her no matter what the issue of that journey and whether i went alone or accompanied i was determined to quit france and repair to spain there i would abide until the parliament the court or the knife of some chance assassin or even nature herself should strip mazarin of his power  now at the court of spain it was well known that my aunts influence was vast and so the boon i craved was that she should aid me to a position in the spanish service that would allow me during my exile to find occupation and perchance renown to this my aunt most graciously acceded and when at length i took my leavewith such gratitude in my heart that what words i could think of seemed but clumsily to express iti bore in the breast of my doublet a letter to don juan de cordovaa noble of great prominence at the spanish courtand in the pocket of my hautdechausses a rouleau of two hundred gold pistoles as welcome as they were heavy     chapter xxii of my second journey to canaples   an hour after i had quitted the hôtel de luynes michelot and i left paris by the barrier st michel and took the orleans road how different it looked in the bright june sunshine to the picture which it had presented to our eyes on that february evening four months ago when last we had set out upon that same journey  not only in nature had a change been wrought but in my very self my journey then had been aimless and i had scarcely known whither i was bound nor had i fostered any great concern thereon now i rode in hot haste with a determined purpose a man of altered fortunes and altered character  into choisy we clattered at a brisk pace but at the sight of the inn of the connétable such memories surged up that i was forced to draw rein and call for a cup of anjou which i drank in the saddle thereafter we rode without interruption through longjumeau arpajon and etrechy and so well did we use our horses that as night fell we reached Étampes  from inquiries that michelot had made on the road we learned that no troop such as that which rode with st auban had lately passed that way so that t was clear we were in front of them  but scarce had we finished supper in the little room which i had hired at the gros paon when from below a stamping of hoofs the jangle of arms and the shouts of many men told me that we were overtaken  clearly i did not burn with a desire to linger but rather it seemed to me that although night had closed in black and moonless we must set out again and push on to monnerville albeit our beasts were worn and the distance a good three leagues  with due precaution we effected our departure and thereafter had a spur been needed to speed us on our way that spur we had in the knowledge that st auban came close upon our heels at monnerville we slept and next morning we were early afoot by four oclock in the afternoon we had reached orleans whencewith fresh horseswe pursued our journey as far as meung where we lay that night  there we were joined by a sturdy rascal whom michelot enlisted into my service seeing that not only did my means allow but the enterprise upon which i went might perchance demand another body servant this recruit was a swart powerfully built man of about my own age trusty and a lover of hard knocks as michelotwho had long counted him among his friendsassured me he owned the euphonious name of abdon  i spent twenty pistoles in suitable raiment and a horse for him and as we left meung next day the knave cut a brave enough figure that added not a little to my importance to have at my heels  this however so retarded our departure that night had fallen by the time we reached blois still our journey had been a passing swift one we had left paris on a monday the fourth of junei have good cause to remember since on that day i entered both upon my thirtysecond year and my altered fortunes on the evening of wednesday we reached blois having covered a distance of fortythree leagues in less than three days  bidding michelot carry my valise to the hostelry of the vigne dor and there await my coming i called to abdon to attend me and rode on jaded and travelstained though i was to canaples realising fully that there was no time to lose  old guilbert who came in answer to my knock at the door of the château looked askance when he beheld me and when i bade him carry my compliments to the chevalier with the message that i desired immediate speech of him on a matter of the gravest moment he shook his grey head and protested that it would be futile to obey me yet in the end when i had insisted he went upon my errand but only to return with a disturbed countenance to tell me that the chevalier refused to see me  but i must speak to him guilbert i exclaimed setting foot upon the top step i have travelled expressly from paris  the man stood firm and again shook his head  i beseech you not to insist monsieur m le chevalier has sworn to dismiss me if i permit you to set foot within the château  mille diables this is madness i seek to serve him i cried my temper rising fast at least guilbert will you tell mademoiselle that i am here and that i  i may carry no more messages for you monsieur he broke in listen there is m le chevalier  in reality i could hear the old knights voice loud and shrill with anger and a moment later louis his intendant came across the hall  guilbert he commanded harshly close the door the night air is keen  my cheeks aflame with anger i still made one last attempt to gain an audience  master louis i exclaimed will you do me the favour to tell m de canaples  you are wasting time monsieur he interrupted m de canaples will not see you he bids you close the door guilbert  pardieu he shall see me  the door guilbert  i took a step forward but before i could gain the threshold the door was slammed in my face and as i stood there quivering with anger and disappointment i heard the bolts being shot within  i turned with an oath  come abdon i growled as i climbed once more into the saddle let us leave the fool to the fate he has chosen     chapter xxiii of how st auban came to blois   in silence we rode back to blois not that i lacked matter for conversation anger and chagrin at the thought that i had come upon this journey to earn naught but an insult and to have a door slammed in my face made my gorge rise until it went near to choking me i burned to revile canaples aloud but abdons was not the ear into which i might pour the hot words that welled up to my lips  yet if silent the curses that i heaped upon the chevaliers crassness were none the less fervent and to myself i thought with grim relish of how soon and how dearly he would pay for the affront he had put upon me  that satisfaction however endured not long for presently i bethought me of how heavily the punishment would fall upon yvonneand yet of how she would be left to the mercy of st auban whose warrant from mazarin would invest with almost any and every power at canaples  i ground my teeth at the sudden thought and for a moment i was on the point of going back and forcing my way into the château at the sword point if necessary to warn and save the chevalier in spite of himself and unthanked  it was not in such a fashion that i had thought to see my mission to canaples accomplished i had dreamt of gratitude and gratitude unbars the door to much nevertheless whether or not i earned it i must return and succeed where for want of insistence i had failed awhile ago  of a certainty i should have acted thus but that at the very moment upon which i formed the resolution abdon drew my attention to a dark shadow by the roadside not twenty paces in front of us this proved to be the motionless figure of a horseman  as soon as i was assured of it i reined in my horse and taking a pistol from the holster i levelled it at the shadow accompanying the act by a sonorous  who goes there  the shadow stirred and michelots voice answered me  t is i monsieur they have arrived i came to warn you  who has arrived i shouted  the soldiers they are lodged at the lys de france  an oath was the only comment i made as i turned the news over in my mind i must return to canaples  then another thought occurred to me the chevalier was capable of going to extremes to keep me from entering his house he might for instance greet me with a blunderbuss it was not the fear of that that deterred me but the fear that did a charge of lead get mixed with my poor brains before i had said what i went to say matters would be no better and there would be one poor knave the less to adorn the world  what shall we do michelot i groaned appealing in my despair to my henchman  might it not be well to seek speech with m de montrésor quoth he  i shrugged my shoulders nevertheless after a moments deliberation i determined to make the attempt if i succeeded something might come of it  and so i pushed on to blois with my knaves close at my heels  up the rue vieille we proceeded with caution for the hostelry of the vigne dor where michelot had hired me a room fortunately overlooking the street fronted the lys de france where st auban and his men were housed  i gained that room of mine without mishap and my first action was to deal summarily with a fat and wellroasted capon which the landlord set before mefor an empty stomach is a poor comrade in a desperate situation that meal washed down with the best part of a bottle of red anjou did much to restore me alike in body and in mind  from my open window i gazed across the street at the lys de france the door of the commonroom opening upon the street was set wide and across the threshold came a flood of light in which there flitted the black figures of maybe a dozen amazed rustics drawn thither for all the world as bats are drawn to a glare  and there they hovered with open mouths and stupid eyes hearkening to the din of voices that floated out on the tranquil air the snatches of ribald songs the raucous bursts of laughter the clink of glasses the clank of steel the rattle of dice and the strange soldier oaths that fell with every throw and which to them must have sounded almost as words of some foreign tongue  whilst i stood by my window the landlord entered my room and coming up to me  thank heaven they are not housed at the vigne dor he said it will take maître bernard a week to rid his house of the stench of leather they are part of a stray company that is on its way to fight the spaniards he informed me but methinks they will be forced to spend two or three days at blois their horses are sadly jaded and will need that rest before they can take the road again thanks to the pace at which their boy of an officer must have led them there is a gentleman with them who wears a mask t is whispered that he is a prince of the blood who has made a vow not to uncover his face until this war be ended in expiation of some sin committed in mad paris  i heard him in silence and when he had done i thanked him for his information so this was the story that the crafty st auban had spread abroad to lull suspicion touching the real nature of their presence until their horses should be fit to undertake the return journey to paris or until he should have secured the person of m de canaples  towards eleven oclock as the lights in the hostelry opposite were burning low i descended and made my way out into the now deserted street the troopers had apparently seen fitor else been orderedto seek their beds for the place had grown silent and a servant was in the act of making fast the door for the night the portecochère was half closed and a man carrying a lantern was making fast the bolt whistling aimlessly to himself through the half of the door that was yet open i beheld a window from which the light fell upon a distant corner of the courtyard  i drew near the fellow with the lantern in whom i recognised rené the hostler and as i approached he flashed the light upon my face then with a gaspm de luynes he exclaimed remembering me from the time when i had lodged at the lys de france three months ago  sh i whispered pressing a louis dor into his hand whose window is that rené and i pointed towards the light  that he replied is the room of the lieutenant and the gentleman in the mask  i must take a look at them rené and whilst i am looking i shall search my pocket for another louis now let me in  i dare not monsieur maître bernard may call me and if the doors are not closed  dame i broke in i shall stay but a moment  but  and you will have easily earned a louis dor if bernard calls youpeste tell him that you have let fall something and that you are seeking it there let me pass  i got past him at last and made my way swiftly towards the other end of the quadrangle  as i approached the sound of voices smote my ear for the lighted window stood open i stopped within half a dozen paces of it and climbed on to the step of a coach that stood there thence i could look straight into the room whilst the darkness hid me from the eyes of those i watched  three men there were montrésor the sergeant of his troop and a tall man dressed in black and wearing a black silk mask this i concluded to be st auban despite the profusion of fair locks that fell upon his shoulders concealingi rightly guessedhis natural hair which was as black as my own it was a cunning addition to his disguise and one well calculated to lead people on to the wrong scent hereafter  presently as i watched them st auban spoke and his voice was that of a man whose gums are toothless or else whose nether lip is drawn in over his teeth whilst he speaks here again the dissimulation was as effective as it was simple  so that is concluded were the words that reached me tomorrow we will install our men at the château for while we remain here it is preposterous to lodge them at an inn on the following day i hope that we may be able to set out again  if we could obtain fresh horses began the sergeant when he of the mask interrupted him  sangdieu think you my purse is bottomless we return as we came with the cardinals horses what signify a day or two after all comecall the landlord to light me to my room  i had heard enough but more than that whilst i listened an idea had of a sudden sprung up in my mind which did away with the necessity of gaining speech with montresora contingency moreover that now presented insuperable difficulties  so i got down softly from my perch and made my way out of the yard and after fulfilling my part of the bargain with rené across to the vigne dor and to my room there to sit and mature the plan that of a sudden i had conceived     chapter xxiv of the passing of st auban   dame what an ado there was next day in blois when the news came that the troopers had installed themselves at the château de canaples and that the chevalier had been arrested for treason by order of the lord cardinal and that he would be taken to paris andprobablythe scaffold  men gathered in little knots at street corners and with sullen brows and threatening gestures they talked of the affair and the more they talked the more clouded grew their looks and more than one anticardinalist pasquinade was heard in blois that day  given a leader those men would have laid hands upon pikes and muskets and gone to the chevaliers rescue as i observed them the thought did cross my mind that i might contrive a pretty fight in the rose garden of canaples were i so inclined and so inclined i should indeed have been but for the plan that had come to me like an inspiration from above and which methought would prove safer in the end  to carry out this plan of mine i quitted blois at nightfall with my two knaves having paid my reckoning at the lys de france and given out that we were journeying to tours we followed the road that leads to canaples until we reached the first trees bordering the park there i dismounted and leaving abdon to guard the horses i made my way on foot accompanied by michelot towards the garden  we gained this and were on the point of quitting the shadow of the trees when of a sudden by the light of the crescent moon i beheld a man walking in one of the alleys not a hundred paces from where we stood i had but time to seize michelot by the collar of his pourpoint and draw him towards me but as he trod precipitately backwards a twig snapped neath his foot with a report that in the surrounding stillness was like a pistol shot  i caught my breath as he who walked in the garden stood still his face wrapped in the shadows of his hat turned towards us  who goes there he shouted then getting no reply he came resolutely forward whilst i drew a pistol wherewith to welcome him did he come too near  on he came and already i had brought my pistol to a level with his head when fortunately he repeated his question who goes thereand this time i recognised the voice of montrésor the very man i could then most wish to meet  hist montrésor i called softly t is iluynes  so he exclaimed coming close up to me you have reached canaples at last  at last i echoed  whom have you there he inquired abruptly  only michelot  bid him fall behind a little  when michelot had complied with this request you see m de luynes quoth the officer that you have arrived too late  there was a certain coldness in his tone that made me seek by my reply to sound him  indeed i trust not my friend with your assistance i hope to get m de canaples from the clutches of st auban  he shook his head  it is impossible that i should help you he replied with increasing coldness already once for your sake have i broken faith to those who pay me by setting you in a position to forestall st auban and get m de canaples away before his arrival unfortunately you have dallied on the road m de luynes and canaples is already a prisonera doomed one i fear  is that your last word montrésor i inquired sadly  i am sorry he answered in softened tones but you must see that i cannot do otherwise i warned you more you cannot expect of me  i sighed and stood musing for an instant thenyou are right montrésor nevertheless i am still grateful to you for the warning you gave me in paris god pity and help canaples adieu montrésor i do not think that you will see me again  he took my hand but as he did so he pushed me back into the shadow from which i had stepped to proffer it him  peste he ejaculated the moon was full upon your face and did st auban chance to look out he must have seen you  i followed the indication of his thumb and noted the lighted window to which he pointed a moment later he was gone and as i joined michelot i chuckled softly to myself  for two hours and more i sat in the shrubbery conversing in whispers with michelot and watching the lights in the château die out one by one until st aubans window which opened on to the terrace balcony was the only one that was not wrapt in darkness  i waited a little while longer then rising i cautiously made a tour of inspection peace reigned everywhere and the only sign of life was the sentry who with musket on shoulder paced in front of the main entrance a silent testimony of st aubans mistrust of the blaisois and of his fears of a possible surprise  satisfied that everyone slept i retraced my steps to the shrubbery where michelot awaited me watching the square of light and after exchanging word with him i again stepped forth  when i was half way across the intervening space of garden treading with infinite precaution a dark shadow obscured the window which a second later was thrown open crouching hastily behind a boxwood hedge i watched st aubanfor i guessed that he it wasas he leaned out and gazed skywards  for a little while he remained there then he withdrew leaving the casement open and presently i caught the grating of a chair on the parquet floor within if ever the gods favoured mortal they favoured me at that moment  stealthily as a cat i sprang towards the terrace the steps to which i climbed on hands and knees stooping i sped silently across it until i had gained the flowerbed immediately below the window that had drawn me to it crouching therefor did i stand upright my chin would be on a level with the silli paused to listen for some moments the only sound i caught was a rustle as of paper emboldened i took a deep breath and standing up i gazed straight into the chamber  by the light of four tapers in heavy silver sconces i beheld st auban seated at a table littered with parchments over which he was intently poring his back was towards me and his long black hair hung straight upon his shoulders on the table amid the papers lay his golden wig and black mask and on the floor in the centre of the room his back and breast of blackened steel and his sword  it needed but little shrewdness to guess those parchments before him to be legal documents touching the canaples estates and his occupation that of casting up exactly what profit he would reap from his infamous work of betrayal  so intent was the hound upon his calculations that my cautious movements passed unheeded by him as i got astride of the window ledge it was only when i swung my right leg into the room that he turned his head but before his eyes reached me i was standing upright and motionless within the chamber  i have seen fear of many sorts writ large upon the faces of men of many conditionsfrom the awe that blanches the cheek of the boy soldier when first he hears the cannon thundering to the terror that glazes the eye of the vanquished swordsman who at every moment expects the deadly point in his heart but never had i gazed upon a countenance filled with such abject ghastly terror as that which came over st aubans when his eyes met mine that night  he sprang up with an inarticulate cry that sank into something that i can but liken to the rattle which issues from the throat of expiring men for a second he stood where he had risen then terror loosened his knees and he sank back into his chair his mouth fell open and the trembling lips were drawn down at the corners like those of a sobbing child his cheeks turned whiter than the lawn collar at his throat and his eyes wide open in a horrid stare were fixed on mine and powerless to avert them he met my gazecold stern and implacable  for a moment we remained thus and i marvelled greatly to see a man whose heart if full of evil i had yet deemed stout enough stricken by fear into so parlous and pitiful a condition  then i had the explanation of it as he lifted his right hand and made the sign of the cross first upon himself then in the air whilst his lips moved and i guessed that to himself he was muttering some prayer of exorcising purport there was the solution of the terrorsweat that stood out in beads upon his browhe had deemed me a spectre the spectre of a man he believed to have foully done to death on a spot across the loire visible from the window at my back  at last he sufficiently mastered himself to break the awful silence  what do you want he whispered then his voice gaining power as he used itspeak he commanded man or devil speak  i laughed for answer harshly mockingly for never had i known a fiercer crueller mood at the sound of that laugh satanical though may have been its ring he sprang up again and unsheathing a dagger he took a step towards me  we shall see of what you are made he cried if you blast me in the act ill strike you  i laughed again and raising my arm i gave him the nozzle of a pistol to contemplate  stand where you are st auban or by the god above us ill send your ghost awandering quoth i coolly  my voice which i take it had nothing ghostly in it and still more the levelled pistol which of all implements is the most unghostly dispelled his dread the colour crept slowly back to his cheeks and his mouth closed with a snap of determination  is it indeed you master meddler he said peste i thought you dead these three months  and you are overcome with joy to find that you were in error eh marquis we luynes die hard  it seems so indeed he answered with a cool effrontery past crediting in one who but a moment ago had looked so pitiful what do you seek at canaples  many things marquis you among others  you have come to murder me he cried and again alarm overspread his countenance  hoity toity marquis we do not all follow the same trade who talks of murder faugh  again he took a step towards me but again the nozzle of my pistol drove him back to have pistoled him there and then as he deserved would have brought the household about my ears and that would have defeated my object to have fallen upon him and slain him with silent steel would have equally embarrassed me as you shall understand anon  you and i had a rendezvous at st sulpice des reaux i said calmly to which you came with a band of hired assassins for this you deserve to be shot like the dog you are but i have it in my heart to be generous to you i added in a tone of irony come take up your sword  to what purpose  do you question me take up your sword man and do my bidding thus shall you have a slender chance of life refuse and i pistol you without compunction so now put on that wig and mask  when he obeyed me in thisnow listen st auban i said you and i are going together to that willow copse whither three months ago you lured yvonne de canaples for the purpose of abducting her on that spot you and i shall presently face each other sword in hand with none other to witness our meeting save god in whose hands the issue lies that is your chance at the first sign that you meditate playing me any tricks that chance is lost to you and i tapped my pistol significantly now climb out through that window  when he had done so i bade him stand six paces away whilst i followed and to discourage any foolish indiscretion on his part i again showed him my pistol  he answered me with an impatient gesture and by the light that fell on his face i saw him sneer  come on you fool he snarled and have done threatening ill talk to you in the copse and tread softly lest you arouse the sentry on the other side  rejoiced to see the man so wide awake in him i followed him closely across the terrace and through the rose garden to the bank of the river this we followed until we came at last to the belt of willows where having found a suitable patch of even and springy turf i drew my sword and invited him to make ready  will you not strip he inquired sullenly  i do not think so i answered the night air is sharp nevertheless do you make ready as best you deem fit and that speedily monsieur  with an exclamation of contempt he divested himself of his wig mask and doublet then drawing his sword he came forward and announced himself at my disposal  as well you may conceive we wasted no time in compliments but straightway went to work and that with a zest that drew sparks from our rapiers at the first contact  the marquis attacked me furiously and therein lay his only chance for a fierce rude swordplay that is easily dealt with in broad daylight is vastly discomposing in such pale moonshine as lighted us i defended myself warily for of a sudden i had grown conscious of the danger that i ran did he once by luck or strength get past my guard with that point of his which in the spare light i could not follow closely enough to feel secure  neath the fury of his onslaught i was compelled to break ground more than once and each time he was so swift to follow up his advantage that i had neer a chance to retaliate  still fear or doubt of the issue i had none i needed but to wait until the marquiss fury was spent by want of breath to make an end of it and presently that which i waited for came about his attack began to lag in vigour and the pressure of his blade to need less resistance whilst his breathing grew noisy as that of a brokenwinded horse then with the rage of a gambler who loses at every throw he cursed and reviled me with every thrust or lunge that i turned aside  my turn was come yet i held back and let him spend his strength to the utmost drop whilst with my elbow close against my side and by an easy play of wrist i diverted each murderous stroke of his point that came again and again for my heart  when at last he had wasted in blasphemies what little breath his wild exertions had left him i let him feel on his blade the twist that heralded my first riposte he caught the thrust and retreated a step his blasphemous tongue silenced and his livid face bathed in perspiration  cruelly i toyed with him then and with every disengagement i made him realise that he was mastered and that if i withheld the coup de grâce it was but to prolong his agony and to add to the bitterness of that agony of his i derided him whilst i fenced with a recitation of his many sins i mocked him showing him how ripe he was for hell and asking him how it felt to die unshriven with such a load upon his soul  goaded to rage by my bitter words he grit his teeth and gathered what rags of strength were left him for a final effort and before i knew what he was about he had dropped on to his left knee and with his body thrown forward and supported within a foot of the ground by his left arm he came like a snake under my guard with his point directed upwards  so swift had been this movement and so unlookedfor that had i not sprung backwards in the very nick of time this narrative of mine had neer been written with a jeering laugh i knocked aside his sword but even as i disengaged to thrust at him he knelt up and caught my blade in his left hand and for all that it ate its way through the flesh to the very bones of his fingers he clung to it with that fierce strength and blind courage that is born of despair  then raising himself on his knees again he struck at me wildly i swung aside and as his sword missing its goal shot past me i caught his wrist in a grip from which i contemptuously invited him to free himself with that began a fierce tugging and panting on both sides which however was of short duration for presently my blade having severed the last sinew of his fingers was set free simultaneously i let go his wrist pushing his arm from me so violently that in his exhausted condition it caused him to fall over on his side  in an instant however he was up and at me again again our swords clashedbut once only it was time to finish with a vigorous disengagement i got past his feeble guard and sent my blade into him full in the middle of his chest and out again at his back until a foot or so of glittering steel protruded  a shudder ran through him and his mouth worked oddly whilst spasmodically he still sought without avail to raise his sword then as i recovered my blade a halfstifled cry broke from his lips and throwing up his arms he staggered and fell in a heap  as i turned him over to see if he were dead his eyes met mine and were full of piteous entreaty his lips moved and presently i caught the words  i am sped luynes then struggling up and in a louder voice a priest he gasped get me a priest luynes jesu have mer  a rush of blood choked him and cut short his utterance he writhed and twitched for a moment then his chin sank forward and he fell back death starkening his limbs and glazing the eyes which stared hideously upwards at the cold pitiless moon  such was the passing of the marquis césar de st auban     chapter xxv playacting   for a little while i stood gazing down at my work my mind full of the unsolvable mysteries of life and death then i bethought me that time stood not still for me and that something yet remained to be accomplished ere my evenings task were done  and forthwith i made shift to do a thing at the memory of which my blood is chilled and my soul is filled with loathing even nowalbeit the gulf of many years separates me from that june night at canaples  to pass succinctly oer an episode on which i have scant heart to tarry suffice it you to know that using my sash as a rope i bound a heavy stone to st aubans ankle then lifting the body in my arms i half dragged half bore it across the little stretch of intervening sward to the waters edge and flung it in  as i write i have the hideous picture in my mind and again i can see st aubans ghastly face grinning up at me through the moonlit waters until at last it was mercifully swallowed up in their black depths and naught but a circling wavelet that spread swiftly across the stream was left to tell of what had chanced  i dare not dwell upon the feelings that assailed me as i stooped to rinse the blood from my hands nor yet of the feverish haste wherewith i tore my bloodstained doublet from my back and hurled it wide into the stream for all my callousness i was sick and unmanned by that which had befallen  no time however did i waste in mawkish sentiment but setting my teeth hard i turned away from the river and back to the trampled ground of our recent conflict there with no other witness save the moon i clad myself in the marquiss doublet of black velvet i set his mask of silk upon my face his golden wig upon my head and over that his sable hat with its drooping feather next i buckled on his sword belt wherefrom hung his rapier that i had sheathed  in blois that day i had taken the precautionknowing the errand upon which i cameto procure myself hautdechausses of black velvet and black leather boots with gilt spurs that closely resembled those which st auban had worn in life  now as i have already written st auban and i were of much the same build and stature and so methought with confidence that he would have shrewd eyes indeed who could infer from my appearance that i was other than the same masked gentleman who had that very day ridden into canaples at the head of a troop of his eminences guards  i made my way swiftly back along the path that st auban and i had together trodden but a little while ago and past the château until i came to the shrubbery where michelotfaithful to the orders i had given himawaited my return from his concealment he had seen me leave the château with the marquis and as i suddenly loomed up before him now he took me for the man whose clothes i wore and naturally enough assumed that ill had befallen gaston de luynes of a certainty i had been pistolled by him had i not spoken in time i lingered but to give him certain necessary orders then whilst he went off to join abdon and see to their fulfilment i made my way stealthily with eyes keeping watch around me across the terrace and through the window into the room that st auban had left to follow me to his death  the tapers still burned and in all respects the chamber was as it had been the back and breast pieces still lay upon the floor and on the table the littered documents the door i ascertained had been locked on the inside a precaution which st auban had no doubt taken so that none might spy upon the work that busied him  i closed and made fast the window then i bethought me that being in ignorance of the whereabouts of st aubans bedchamber i must perforce spend the night as best i could within that very room  and so i sat me down and pondered deeply oer the work that was to come the part i was about to play and the details of its playing in this manner did i while away perchance an hour through the next one i must have slept for i awakened with a start to find three tapers spent and the last one spluttering and in the sky the streaks that heralded the summer dawn  again i fell to thinking again i slept and woke again to find the night gone and the sunlight on my face someone knocked at the door and that knocking vibrated through my brain and set me wideawake indeed it was as the signal to uplift the curtain and let my playacting commence  hastily i rose and shot a glance at the mirror to see that my wig hung straight and that my mask was rightly adjusted i started at my own reflection for methought that from the glass t was st auban who looked at me as i had seen him look the night before when he had donned those things at my command  holà there within came montrésors voice monsieur le capitaine a fresh shower of blows descended on the oak panels  i yawned with prodigious sonority and overturned a chair with my foot then bracing myself for the ordeal through which i looked to what scant information i possessed and my own mother wit to bear me successfully i strode across to admit my visitor  muffling my voice as i had heard st auban do at the inn by drawing my nether lip over my teeth  pardieu quoth i as i opened the door it seems lieutenant that i must have fallen asleep over those musty documents  i trembled as i watched him waiting for his reply and i thanked heaven that in the rôle i had assumed a mask was worn not only because it hid my features but because it hid the emotions which these might have betrayed  i was beginning to fear he replied coldly and without so much as looking at me that worse had befallen you  i breathed again  you mean  pooh nothing said he half contemptuously only methinks t were well whilst we remain at canaples that you do not spend your nights in a room within such easy access of the terrace  your advice no doubt is sound but as i shall not spend another night at canaples it comes too late  you mean monsieur  that we set out for paris today  he shrugged his shoulders  oh ça i have just visited the stables and there are not four horses fit for the journey so that unless you have in mind the purchase of fresh animals  pish my purse is not bottomless i broke in repeating the very words that i heard st auban utter  so you said once before monsieur still unless you are prepared to take that course the only alternative is to remain here until the horses are sufficiently recovered but perhaps you think of walking he added with a sniff  such is your opinion your time being worthless and it being of little moment where you spend it i have conceived a plan  ah  has it not occurred to you that the danger which threatens us and which calls for the protection of a troop is only on this side of the loire where the blaisois might be minded to attempt a rescue of the chevalier but over yonder chevalier on the chambord side who cares a fig for the lord of canaples or his fate none is it not so  he made an assenting gesture whereupon i continued  this being so i have bethought me that it will suffice if i take but three or four men and the sergeant as an escort and cross the river with our prisoner after nightfall travelling along the opposite shore until we reach orleans what think you lieutenant  he shrugged his shoulders again  t is you who command here he answered with apathy not i  nevertheless do you not think the plan a safe one as well as one that will allay his eminences very natural impatience  oh it is safe enough i doubt not he replied coldly  your enthusiasm determines me quoth i with an irony that made him wince and we will follow the plan since you agree with me touching its excellence but keep the matter to yourself until an hour or so after sunset  he bowed so utterly my dupe that i could have laughed at him thenthere is a little matter that i would mention he said mademoiselle de canaples has expressed a wish to accompany her father to paris and has asked me whether this will be permitted her  my heart leaped surely the gods fought on my side  i cannot permit it i answered icily  monsieur you are pitiless he protested in a tone of indignation for which i would gladly have embraced him  i feigned to ponder  the matter needs consideration tell mademoiselle that i will discuss it with her at noon if she will condescend to await me on the terrace i will then give her my definite reply and now lieutenant let us breakfast  as completely as i had duped montrésor did i presently dupe those of the troopers with whom i came in contact among others the sergeantand anon the chevalier himself  from the brief interview that i had with him i discovered that whilst he but vaguely suspected me to be st aubanand when i say he suspected me i mean he suspected him whose place i had takenhe was nevertheless aware of the profit which his captor whoever he might be derived from this business it soon grew clear to me from what he said that st auban had mocked him with it whilst concealing his identity that he had told him how he had obtained from malpertuis the treasonable letter and of the bargain which it had enabled him to strike with mazarin i did not long remain in his company and deeming the time not yet ripe for disclosures i said little in answer to his lengthy tirades which had i guessed for scope to trap me into betraying the identity he but suspected  it wanted a few minutes to noon as i left the room in which the old nobleman was confined and by the door of which a trooper was stationed musket on shoulder with every pulse athrobbing at the thought of my approaching interview with mademoiselle i made my way below and out into the bright sunshine the soldiers i chanced to meet saluting me as i passed them  on the terrace i found mademoiselle already awaiting me she was standing as often i had seen her stand with her back turned towards me and her elbows resting upon the balustrade but as my step sounded behind her she turned and stood gazing at me with a face so griefstricken and pale that i burned to unmask and set her torturing fears at rest i doffed my hat and greeted her with a silent bow which she contemptuously disregarded  my lieutenant tells me mademoiselle said i in my counterfeited voice that it is your desire to bear monsieur your father company upon this journey of his to paris  with your permission sir she answered in a choking voice  it is a matter for consideration mademoiselle i pursued there are in it many features that may have escaped you and which i shall discuss with you if you will honour me by stepping into the garden below  why will not the terrace serve  because i may have that to say which i would not have overheard  she knit her brows and stared at me as though she would penetrate the black cloth that hid my face at last she shrugged her shoulders and letting her arms fall to her side in a gesture of helplessness and resignation  soit i will go with you was all she said  side by side we went down the steps as a pair of lovers might have gone save that her face was white and drawn and that her eyes looked straight before her and never once until we reached the gravel path below at her companion side by side we walked along one of the rosebordered alleys until at length i stopped  mademoiselle i said speaking in the natural tones of that goodfornaught gaston de luynes i have already decided and you have my permission to accompany your father  at the sound of my voice she started and with her left hand clutching at the region of her heart she stood her head thrust forward and on her face the look of one who is confronted with some awful doubt that look was brief however and swift to replace it was one of hideous revelation  in gods name who are you she cried in accents that bespoke internal agony  already you have guessed it mademoiselle i answered and i would have added that which should have brought comfort to her distraught mind when  you she gasped in a voice of profound horror you you the judas who has sold my father to the cardinal for a paltry share in our estates and i believed that mask of yours to hide the face of st auban  her words froze me into a stony mass of insensibility there was no logic in my attitude i see it now appearances were all against me and her belief no more than justified i overlooked all this and instead of saving time by recounting how i came to be there and thus delivering her from the anguish that was torturing her i stood dumb and cruel cut to the quick by her scorn and her suspicions that i was capable of such a thing as she imputed and listening to the dictates of an empty pride that prompted me to make her pay full penalty  oh god pity me she wailed have you naught to say  still i maintained my mad resentful silence and presently as one who muses  you she said again you whom i she stopped short oh the shame of it she moaned  reason at last came uppermost and as in my mind i completed her broken sentence my heart gave a great throb and i was thawed to a gentler purpose  mademoiselle i exclaimed  but even as i spoke she turned and sweeping aside her gown that it might not touch me she moved rapidly towards the steps we had just descended full of remorse i sprang after her  mademoiselle hear me i cried and put forth my hand to stay her thereat she wheeled round and faced me a blaze of fury in her grey eyes  dare not to touch me she panted you thief you hound  i recoiled and like one turned to stone i stood and watched her mount the steps my feelings swaying violently between anger and sorrow then my eye fell upon montrésor standing on the topmost step and on his face there was a sneering insolent smile which told me that he had heard the epithets she had bestowed upon me  albeit i sought that day another interview with yvonne i did not gain it and so i was forced to sun myself in solitude upon the terrace but i cherished for my consolation that broken sentence of hers whereby i read that the coldness which she had evinced for me before i left canaples had only been assumed  and presently as i recalled what talks we had had and one in particular from which it now appeared to me that her coldness had sprung a light seemed suddenly to break upon my mind as perchance it hath long ago broken upon the minds of those who may happen upon these pages and whose wits in matters amorous are of a keener temper than were mine  i who in all things had been arrogant presumptuous and selfsatisfied had methought erred for once through overhumility  and indeed even as i sat and pondered on that june day it seemed to me a thing incredible that she whom i accounted the most queenly and superb of women should have deigned to grant a tender thought to one so mean so far beneath her as i had ever held myself to be     chapter xxvi reparation   things came to pass that night as i had planned and the fates which of late had smiled upon me were kind unto the end  soon after ten and before the moon had risen a silent procession wended its way from the château to the river first went montrésor and two of his men next came the chevalier with mademoiselle and on either side of them a trooper whilst i in headpiece and back and breast of steel went last with mathurin the sergeantwho warmly praised the plan i had devised for the conveyance of m de canaples to paris without further loss of time  two boats which i had caused to be secretly procured were in readiness and by these a couple of soldiers awaited us holding the bridles of eight horses one of which was equipped with a ladys saddle five of these belongedor had belongedto the chevalier whilst the others were three of those that had brought the troop from paris and which i in the teeth of all protestations had adjudged sufficiently recovered for the return journey  the embarkation was safely effected m de canaples and mademoiselle in one boat with montrésor mathurin and myself the sergeant took the oars montrésor and i kept watch over our prisoner in the other boat came the four troopers who were to accompany us and one other who was to take the boats and montrésor in them back to canaples for the lieutenant was returning so that he might with the remainder of the troop follow us to paris so soon as the condition of the horses would permit it  the beasts we took with us were swimming the stream guided and upheld by the men in the other boat  just as the moon began to show her face our bow grated on the shore at the very point where i had intended that we should land i sprang out and turned to assist mademoiselle  but disdaining my proffered hand she stepped ashore unaided the chevalier came next and after him montrésor and mathurin  awhile we waited until the troopers brought their boat to land then when they had got the snorting animals safely ashore i bade them look to the prisoner and requested montrésor and mathurin to step aside with me as i had something to communicate to them  walking between the pair i drew them some twenty paces away from the group by the water towards a certain thicket in which i had bidden michelot await me  it has occurred to me messieurs i began speaking slowly and deliberately as we paced alongit has occurred to me that despite all the precautions taken to carry out my lord cardinals wishesa work at least in which you yourselves have evinced a degree of zeal that i cannot too highly commend to his eminencethe possibility yet remains of some mistake of trivial appearance of some slight flaw that might yet cause the miscarriage of those wishes  they turned towards me and although i could not make out the expressions of their faces in the gloom yet i doubted not but that they were puzzled ones at that lengthy and apparently meaningless harangue  the sergeant was the first to speak albeit i am certain that he understood the less  i venture m le capitaine to think that your fears though very natural are groundless  say you so quoth i with a backward glance to assure myself that we were screened by the trees from the eyes of those behind us say you so well well mayhap you are right though you speak of my fears being groundless i alluded to some possible mistake of yoursyours and m de montrésorsnot of mine and by heaven a monstrous flaw there is in this business for if either of you so much as whisper ill blow your brains out  and to emphasise these words as sinister as they were unlookedfor i raised both hands suddenly from beneath my cloak and clapped the cold nose of a pistol to the head of each of them  i was obeyed as men are obeyed who thus uncompromisingly prove the force of their commands seeing them resigned i whistled softly and in answer there was a rustle from among the neighbouring trees and presently two shadows emerged from the thicket in less time than it takes me to relate it montrésor and his sergeant found themselves gagged and each securely bound to a tree  then with michelot and abdon following a short distance behind me i made my way back to the troopers and feigning to stumble as i approached i hurtled so violently against two of them that i knocked the pair headlong into the stream  scarce was it done and almost before the remaining three had realised it there was a pistol at the head of each of them and sweet promises of an eternal hereafter being whispered in their ears they bore themselves with charming discretion and like lambs we led them each to a tree and dealt with them as we had dealt with their officers whilst the chevalier and his daughter watched us bewildered and dumfounded at what they saw  as soon as the other two had crawledall unconscious of the fates of their comradesout of the river we served them also in a like manner  bidding abdon and michelot lead the horses and still speaking in my assumed voice i desired mademoiselle and the chevalierwho had not yet sufficiently recovered from his bewilderment to have found his tongueto follow me i led the way up the gentle slope to the spot where our first victims were pinioned  montrésors comely young face looked monstrous wicked in the moonlight and his eyes rolled curiously as he beheld me stepping up to him i freed him of his gagan act which i had almost regretted a moment later for he cleared his throat with so lusty a torrent of profanity that methought the heavens must have fallen on us at last when he was done with thatbefore you leave me in this plight m de st auban quoth he perchance you will satisfy me with an explanation of your unfathomable deeds and of this violence  st auban exclaimed the chevalier  st auban cried yvonne  and albeit wonder rang in both their voices yet their minds i knew went different ways  no not st auban i answered with a laugh and putting aside all counterfeit of speech  par la mort dieu i know that voice cried montrésor  mayhap indeed and know you not this face and as i spoke i whipped away my wig and mask and thrust my countenance close up to his  thunder of god ejaculated the boy thenpardieu he added there is michelot how came i not to recognise him  since you would not assist me montrésor you see i was forced to do without you  but st auban he gasped where is he  in heaven i hopebut i doubt it sadly  you have killed him  there and then as briefly as i might i told him whilst the others stood by to listen how i had come upon the marquis in the château the night before and what had passed thereafter  and now i said as i cut his bonds it grieves me to charge you with an impolite errand to his eminence but  ill not return to him he burst out i dare not mon dieu you have ruined me luynes  then come with me and ill build your fortunes anew and on a sounder foundation i have an influential letter in my pocket that should procure us fortune in the service of the king of spain  he needed little pressing to fall in with my invitation so we set the sergeant free and him instead i charged with a message that must have given mazarin endless pleasure when it was delivered to him but he had the canaples estates wherewith to console himself and his neverfailing maxim that chi canta paga touching the canaples estates however he did not long enjoy them for when he went into exile two years later the parliament returned them to their rightful owner  the chevalier de canaples approached me timidly  monsieur quoth he i have wronged you very deeply and this generous rescue of one who has so little merited your aid truly puts me to so much shame that i know not what thanks to offer you  then offer none monsieur i answered taking his proffered hand moreover time presses and we have a possible pursuit to baffle so to horse monsieurs  i assisted mademoiselle to mount and she passively suffered me to do her this office having no word for me and keeping her face averted from my earnest gaze  i sighed as i turned to mount the horse michelot held for me but methinks t was more a sigh of satisfaction than of pain                                              all that night we travelled and all next day until tours was reached towards evening there we halted for a sorely needed rest and for fresh horses  three days later we arrived at nantes and a week from the night of the chevaliers rescue we took ship from that port to santander  that same evening as i leaned upon the taffrail watching the distant coast line of my beloved france whose soil meseemed i was not like to tread again for years yvonne came softly up behind me  monsieur she said in a voice that trembled somewhat i have indeed misjudged you the shame of it has made me hold aloof from you since we left blois i cannot tell you monsieur how deep that shame has been or with what sorrow i have been beset for the words i uttered at canaples had i but paused to think  nay nay mademoiselle t was all my fault i swear i left you overlong the dupe of appearances  but i should not have believed them so easily say that i am forgiven monsieur she pleaded tell me what reparation i can make  there is one reparation that you can make if you are so minded i answered but tis a lifelong reparation  they were bold words indeed but my voice played the coward and shook so vilely that it bereft them of half their boldness but ah dieu what joy what ecstasy was mine to see how they were read by her to remark the rich warm blood dyeing her cheeks in a bewitching blush to behold the sparkle that brightened her matchless eyes as they met mine  yvonne  gaston  she was in my arms at last and the work of reparation was begun whilst together we gazed across the sungilt sea towards the fading shores of france  if you be curious to learn how guided by the gentle hand of her who plucked me from the vile ways that in my old life i had trodden i have since achieved greatness honour and renown history will tell you
