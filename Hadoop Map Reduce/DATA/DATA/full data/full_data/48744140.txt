robert louis stevenson     xi  life in samoa  first year at vailima   november 1890december 1891  returning from sydney at the end of october 1890 stevenson and his wife at once took up their abode in the wooden fourroomed cottage or rough barrack as he calls it which had been built for them in the clearing at vailima during the months of their absence at sydney and on their cruise in the equator mr lloyd osbourne in the meantime had started for england to wind up the family affairs at bournemouth during the first few months as will be seen by the following letters the conditions of life at vailima were rough to the point of hardship but matters soon mended the work of clearing and planting went on under the eye of the master and mistress diligently and in the main successfully though not of course without complications and misadventures ways and means of catering were found and abundance began to reign in place of the makeshifts and privations of the first days by april a better house fit to receive the elder mrs stevenson had been built and later in the year plans for further extension were considered but for the present held over the attempt made at first to work the establishment by means of white servants and headmen indoors and out proved unsatisfactory and was gradually superseded by the formation of an efficient native staff which in course of time developed itself into something like a small devoted feudal clan  during the earlier months of 1891 stevenson was not in continuous residence on his new property but went away on two excursions the first to sydney to meet his mother the second in company of the american consul mr sewall to tutuila a neighbouring island of the samoan group of the latter to him very interesting trip the correspondence contains only the beginning of an account abruptly broken off more will be found in the extracts from his diary given in mr graham balfours life ed 1906 pp 312 f during part of the spring he was fortunate in having the company of two distinguished americans the painter lafarge and the historian henry adams in addition to that of the local planters traders and officials a singular and singularly mixed community after some halfyears residence he began to realise that the arrangements made for the government of samoa by treaty between the three powers england germany and america were not working nor promising to work well stevenson was no abstracted student or dreamer the human interests and human duties lying immediately about him were ever the first in his eyes and he found himself drawn deeply into the complications of local politics as so active a spirit could not fail to be drawn however little taste he might have for the work  he kept in the meantime at a fair level of health and among the multitude of new interests was faithful in the main business of his lifethat is to literature he did not cease to toil uphill at the heavy task of preparing for serial publication the letters or more properly chapters on the south seas he planned and began delightedly his happiest tale of south sea life the high woods of ulufanua afterwards changed to the beach of falesá conceived the scheme which was never carried out of working two of his old conceptions into one long genealogical novel or fictitious family history to be called the shovels of newton french and in the latter part of the year worked hard in continuation of the wrecker having completed this during november he turned at once from a sense of duty rather than from any literary inspiration to the footnote to history a laboriously prepared and minutely conscientious account of recent events in samoa  from his earliest days at vailima determined that our intimacy should suffer no diminution by absence stevenson began to my great pleasure the practice of writing me a monthly budget containing a full account of his doings and interests at first the pursuits of the enthusiastic farmer planter and overseer filled these letters delightfully to the exclusion of almost everything else except references to his books projected or in hand later these interests began to give place in his letters to those of the local politician immersed in affairs which seemed to me exasperatingly petty and obscure however grave the potential european complications which lay behind them at any rate they were hard to follow intelligently from the other side of the globe and it was a relief whenever his correspondence turned to matters literary or domestic or humours of his own mind and character these letters or so much of them as seemed suitable for publication were originally printed separately in the year following the writers death under the title vailima letters they are here placed with some additions in chronological order among those addressed to other friends or acquaintances during this first year at vailima his general correspondence was not nearly so large as it afterwards became mr burlingame as representative of the house of scribner receiving the lions share next to myself  for the love of stevenson i will ask readers to take the small amount of pains necessary to grasp and remember the main facts of samoan politics in the ten years 188999 at the date when he settled in vailima the government of the islands had lately been reordered between the three powers interestednamely germany england and the united statesat the convention of berlin july 14 1889 the rivalries and jealousies of these three powers complicated with the conflicting claims of various native kings or chiefs had for some time kept the affairs of the islands dangerously embroiled under the berlin convention malietoa laupepa who had previously been deposed and deported by the germans in favour of a nominee of their own was reinstated as king to the exclusion of his kinsman the powerful and popular mataafa whose titles were equally good and abilities certainly greater but who was especially obnoxious to the germans owing to his resistance to them during the troubles of the preceding years in the course of that resistance a small german force had been worsted in a petty skirmish at fagalii and resentment at this affront to the national pride was for several years one of the chief obstacles to the reconciliation of contending interests for a time the two kinsmen laupepa and mataafa lived on amicable terms but presently differences arose between them mataafa had expected to occupy a position of influence in the government finding himself ignored he withdrew to a camp malie a few miles outside the town of apia where he lived in semiroyal state as a sort of passive rebel or rival to the recognised king in the meantime in the course of the year 1891 the two white officials appointed under the berlin conventionnamely the chief justice a swedish gentleman named cedercrantz and the president of the council baron senfft von pilsachhad come out to the islands and entered on their duties these gentlemen soon proved themselves unfitted for their task to a degree both disastrous and grotesque almost the entire white community were soon against them with the native population they had no influence or credit affairs both political and municipal went from bad to worse and the consuls of the three powers acting as an official board of advisers to the king could do very little to mend them  to the impropriety of some of the official proceedings stevenson felt compelled to call attention in a series of letters to the times the first of which appeared in 1891 the remainder in 1892 he had formed the conviction that for the cure of samoan troubles two things were necessary first and above all the reconciliation of laupepa and mataafa secondly the supersession of the unlucky chief justice and president by men better qualified for their tasks to effect the former purpose he made his only practical intromission in local politics and made it unsuccessfully the motive of his letters to the times was the hope to effect the second in this matter after undergoing the risk which was at one moment serious of deportation he in the end saw his wishes fulfilled the first chief justice and president were replaced by better qualified persons in the course of 1893 but meantime the muddle had grown to a head in the autumn of that year war broke out between the partisans of laupepa and mataafa the latter were defeated and mataafa exiled to a distant island at the close of the following year stevenson died three years later followed the death of laupepa then came more confused rivalries between various claimants to the kingly title the germans having by this time come round to stevensons opinion backed the claims of mataafa which they had before stubbornly disallowed while the english and americans stood for another candidate in 1899 these differences resulted in a calamitous and unjustifiable action the bombardment of native villages for several successive days by english and american warships as a matter of urgent necessity to avert worse things new negotiations were set on foot between the three powers with the result that england withdrew her claims in samoa altogether america was satisfied with the small island of tutuila with its fine harbour of pagopago while the two larger islands of upolu and savaii were ceded to germany german officials have governed them well and peacefully ever since having allowed the restored mataafa as long as he lived a recognised position of headship among the native chiefs stevenson during his lifetime was obnoxious to the german official world but his name and memory are now held in honour by them his policy to a large extent practically followed and he would have been the first to acknowledge the merits of the new order had he lived to witness it  these remarks following the subject down to what remains for the present its historic conclusion will i hope be enough to clear it for the present purpose out of the readers way and enable him to understand as much as is necessary of the political allusions in this and the following sections of the correspondence  it need only be added that in reading the following pages it must be borne in mind that mulinuu and malie the places respectively of laupepas and mataafas residence are also used to signify their respective parties and followings     to sidney colvin      during the absence of the stevensons at sydney some eight acres of    the vailima property had been cleared of jungle a cottage roughly    built on the clearing and something done towards making the track up    the hill from apia into a practicable road they occupied the cottage    at once and the following letters narrate of the sequel      in the mountain apia samoa monday november 2nd 1890  my dear colvinthis is a hard and interesting and beautiful life that we lead now our place is in a deep cleft of vaea mountain some six hundred feet above the sea embowered in forest which is our strangling enemy and which we combat with axes and dollars i went crazy over outdoor work and had at last to confine myself to the house or literature must have gone by the board nothing is so interesting as weeding clearing and pathmaking the oversight of labourers becomes a disease it is quite an effort not to drop into the farmer and it does make you feel so well to come down covered with mud and drenched with sweat and rain after some hours in the bush change rub down and take a chair in the verandah is to taste a quiet conscience and the strange thing that i mark is this if i go out and make sixpence bossing my labourers and plying the cutlass or the spade idiot conscience applauds me if i sit in the house and make twenty pounds idiot conscience wails over my neglect and the day wasted for near a fortnight i did not go beyond the verandah then i found my rush of work run out and went down for the night to apia put in sunday afternoon with our consul a nice young man dined with my friend h j moors in the evening went to churchno lessat the white and halfwhite churchi had never been before and was much interested the woman i sat next looked a fullblood native and it was in the prettiest and readiest english that she sang the hymns back to moors where we yarned of the islands being both wide wanderers till bedtime bed sleep breakfast horse saddled round to the mission to get mr clarke to be my interpreter over with him to the kings whom i have not called on since my return received by that mild old gentleman have some interesting talk with him about samoan superstitions and my landthe scene of a great battle in his malietoa laupepas youththe place which we have cleared the platform of his fortthe gulley of the stream full of dead bodiesthe fight rolled off up vaea mountainside back with clarke to the mission had a bit of lunch and consulted over a queer point of missionary policy just arisen about our new town hall and the balls theretoo long to go into but a quaint example of the intricate questions which spring up daily in the missionary path1  then off up the hill jack very fresh the sun close on noon staring hot the breeze very strong and pleasant the ineffable green country all roundgorgeous little birds i think they are hummingbirds but they say not skirmishing in the wayside flowers about a quarter way up i met a native coming down with the trunk of a cocoa palm across his shoulder his brown breast glittering with sweat and oil talofatalofa aliiyou see that white man he speak for you white man he gone up hereioe yestofa aliitofa soifua i put on jack up the steep path till he is all as white as shaving stickbrowns euxesis wish i had somepast tanugamanono a bush villagesee into the houses as i passthey are open sheds scattered on a greensee the brown folk sitting there suckling kids sleeping on their stiff wooden pillowsthen on through the wood pathand here i find the mysterious white man poor devil with his twenty years certificate of good behaviour as a bookkeeper frozen out by the strikes in the colonies come up here on a chance no work to be found big hotel bill no ship to leave inand come up to beg twenty dollars because he heard i was a scotchman offering to leave his portmanteau in pledge settle this and on again and here my house comes in view and a war whoop fetches my wife and henry or simelé our samoan boy on the front balcony and i am home again and only sorry that i shall have to go down again to apia this day week i could and would dwell here unmoved but there are things to be attended to  never say i dont give you details and news that is a picture of a letter  i have been hard at work since i came three chapters of the wrecker and since that eight of the south sea book and along and about and in between a hatful of verses some day ill send the verse to you and youll say if any of it is any good i have got in a better vein with the south sea book as i think you will see i think these chapters will do for the volume without much change those that i did in the janet nicoll under the most ungodly circumstances i fear will want a lot of suppling and lightening but i hope to have your remarks in a month or two upon that point it seems a long while since i have heard from you i do hope you are well i am wonderful but tired from so much work tis really immense what i have done in the south sea book i have fifty pages copied fair some of which has been four times and all twice written certainly fifty pages of solid scriving inside a fortnight but i was at it by seven am till lunch and from two till four or five every day between whiles verse and blowing on the flageolet never outside if you could see this place but i dont want any one to see it till my clearing is done and my house built it will be a home for angels  illustration     point referred to in text    paths    our boundary    a garden             b present house   c banana patch       d waterfall   e large waterfall into deep gorge where the heat of the fight was  so far i wrote after my bit of dinner some cold meat and bananas on arrival then out to see where henry and some of the men were clearing the garden for it was plain there was to be no work today indoors and i must set in consequence to farmering i stuck a good while on the way up for the path there is largely my own handiwork and there were a lot of sprouts and saplings and stones to be removed then i reached our clearing just where the streams join in one it had a fine autumn smell of burning the smoke blew in the woods and the boys were pretty merry and busy now i had a private designthe vaitae i had explored pretty far up not yet the other stream the vaituliga gnasal n as ng in sing and up that with my wood knife i set off alone it is here quite dry it went through endless woods about as broad as a devonshire lane here and there crossed by fallen trees huge trees overhead in the sun dripping lianas and tufted with orchids tree ferns ferns depending with air roots from the steep banks great arumsi had not skill enough to say if any of them were the edible kind one of our staples herehundreds of bananasanother stapleand alas i had skill enough to know all of these for the bad kind that bears no fruit my henry moralised over this the other day how hard it was that the bad banana flourished wild and the good must be weeded and tended and i had not the heart to tell him how fortunate they were here and how hungry were other lands by comparison the ascent of this lovely lane of my dry stream filled me with delight i could not but be reminded of old mayne reid as i have been more than once since i came to the tropics and i thought if reid had been still living i would have written to tell him that for me it had come true and i thought forbye that if the great powers go on as they are going and the chief justice delays it would come truer still and the warconch will sound in the hills and my home will be inclosed in camps before the year is ended and all at oncemark you how mayne reid is on the spota strange thing happened i saw a liana stretch across the bed of the brook about breasthigh swung up my knife to sever it andbehold it was a wire on either hand it plunged into thick bush tomorrow i shall see where it goes and get a guess perhaps of what it means today i know no more thanthere it is a little higher the brook began to trickle then to fill at last as i meant to do some work upon the homeward trail it was time to turn i did not return by the stream knife in hand as long as my endurance lasted i was to cut a path in the congested bush  at first it went ill with me i got badly stung as high as the elbows by the stinging plant i was nearly hung in a tough lianaa rotten trunk giving way under my feet it was deplorable bad business and an axeif i dared swing onewould have been more to the purpose than my cutlass of a sudden things began to go strangely easier i found stumps bushing out again my body began to wonder then my mind i raised my eyes and looked ahead and by george i was no longer pioneering i had struck an old track overgrown and was restoring an old path so i laboured till i was in such a state that carolina wilhelmina skeggs2 could scarce have found a name for it thereon desisted returned to the stream made my way down that stony track to the garden where the smoke was still hanging and the sun was still in the high treetops and so home here fondly supposing my long day was over i rubbed down exquisite agony water spreads the poison of these weeds i got it all over my hands on my chest in my eyes and presently while eating an orange à la rarotonga burned my lip and eye with orange juice now all day our three small pigs had been adrift to the mortal peril of our corn lettuce onions etc and as i stood smarting on the back verandah behold the three piglings issuing from the wood just opposite instantly i got together as many boys as i couldthree and got the pigs penned against the rampart of the sty till the others joined whereupon we formed a cordon closed captured the deserters and dropped them squeaking amain into their strengthened barracks where please god they may now stay  perhaps you may suppose the day now over you are not the head of a plantation my juvenile friend politics succeeded henry got adrift in his english bene was too cowardly to tell me what he was after result i have lost seven good labourers and had to sit down and write to you to keep my temper let

sorrows of a planter  i am sir yours and be jowned to you the planter      r l s  tuesday 3rdi begin to see the whole scheme of letterwriting you sit down every day and pour out an equable stream of twaddle  this morning all my fears were fled and all the trouble had fallen to the lot of peni himself who deserved it my field was full of weeders and i am again able to justify the ways of god all morning i worked at the south seas and finished the chapter i had stuck upon on saturday fanny awfully hoveto with rheumatics and injuries received upon the field of sport and glory chasing pigs was unable to go up and down stairs so she sat upon the back verandah and my work was chequered by her cries paul you take a spade to do thatdig a hole first if you do that youll cut your foot off here you boy what you do there you no get work you go find simelé he give you work peni you tell this boy he go find simelé suppose simelé no give him work you tell him go way i no want him here that boy no goodpeni from the distance in reassuring tones all right sirfanny after a long pause peni you tell that boy go find simelé i no want him stand here all day i no pay that boy i see him all day he no do nothingluncheon beef sodascones fried bananas pineapple in claret coffee try to write a poem no go play the flageolet then sneakingly off to farmering and pioneering four gangs at work on our place a lively scene axes crashing and smoke blowing all the knives are out but i rob the garden party of one without a stock and you should see my handcut to ribbons now i want to do my path up the vaituliga singlehanded and i want it to burst on the public complete hence with devilish ingenuity i begin it at different places so that if you stumble on one section you may not even then suspect the fulness of my labours accordingly i started in a new place below the wire and hoping to work up to it it was perhaps lucky i had so bad a cutlass and my smarting hand bid me stay before i had got up to the wire but just in season so that i was only the better of my activity not dead beat as yesterday  a strange business it was and infinitely solitary away above the sun was in the high treetops the lianas noosed and sought to hang me the saplings struggled and came up with that sob of death that one gets to know so well great soft sappy trees fell at a lick of the cutlass little tough switches laughed at and dared my best endeavour soon toiling down in that pit of verdure i heard blows on the far side and then laughter i confess a chill settled on my heart being so dead alone in a place where by rights none should be beyond me i was aware upon interrogation if those blows had drawn nearer i should of course quite unaffectedly have executed a strategic movement to the rear and only the other day i was lamenting my insensibility to superstition am i beginning to be sucked in shall i become a midnight twitterer like my neighbours at times i thought the blows were echoes at times i thought the laughter was from birds for our birds are strangely human in their calls vaea mountain about sundown sometimes rings with shrill cries like the hails of merry scattered children as a matter of fact i believe stealthy woodcutters from tanugamanono were above me in the wood and answerable for the blows as for the laughter a woman and two children had come and asked fannys leave to go up shrimpfishing in the burn beyond doubt it was these i heard just at the right time i returned to wash down change and begin this snatch of letter before dinner was ready and to finish it afterwards before henry has yet put in an appearance for his lesson in long explessions  dinner stewed beef and potatoes baked bananas new loafbread hot from the oven pineapple in claret these are great days we have been low in the past but now are we as bellygods enjoying all things  wednesday hist vailima resumeda gorgeous evening of afterglow in the great treetops and behind the mountain and full moon over the lowlands and the sea inaugurated a night of horrid cold to you effete denizens of the socalled temperate zone it had seemed nothing neither of us could sleep we were up seeking extra coverings i know not at what hourit was as bright as day the moon right over vaeanear due west the birds strangely silent and the wood of the house tingling with cold i believe it must have been 60° consequence fanny has a headache and is wretched and i could do no work i am trying all round for a place to hold my pen you will hear why later on this to explain penmanship i wrote two pages very bad no movement no life or interest then i wrote a business letter then took to tootling on the flageolet till glory should call me farmering  i took up at the fit time lafaele and maugamauga accent on the first is a mountain i dont know what maugà meansmind what i told you of the value of gto the garden and set them digging then turned my attention to the path i could not go into my bush path for two reasons 1st sore hands 2nd had on my trousers and good shoes lucky it was right in the wild lime hedge which cuts athwart us just homeward of the garden i found a great bed of kuikuisensitive plantour deadliest enemy a fool brought it to this island in a pot and used to lecture and sentimentalise over the tender thing the tender thing has now taken charge of this island and men fight it with torn hands for bread and life a singular insidious thing shrinking and biting like a weasel clutching by its roots as a limpet clutches to a rock as i fought him i bettered some verses in my poem the woodman3 the only thought i gave to letters though the kuikui was thick there was but a small patch of it and when i was done i attacked the wild lime and had a handtohand skirmish with its spines and elastic suckers all this time close by in the cleared space of the garden lafaele and maugà were digging suddenly quoth lafaele somebody he sing outsomebody he sing out all right i go and i went and found they had been whistling and singing out for long but the fold of the hill and the uncleared bush shuts in the garden so that no one heard and i was late for dinner and fannys headache was cross and when the meal was over we had to cut up a pineapple which was going bad to make jelly of and the next time you have a handful of broken bloodblisters apply pineapple juice and you will give me news of it and i request a specimen of your hand of write five minutes afterthe historic moment when i tackled this history my day so far  fanny was to have rested blessed paul began making a duckhouse she let him be the duckhouse fell down and she had to set her hand to it he was then to make a drinkingplace for the pigs she let him be againhe made a stair by which the pigs will probably escape this evening and she was near weeping impossible to blame the indefatigable fellow energy is too rare and goodwill too noble a thing to discourage but its trying when she wants a rest then she had to cook the dinner then of courselike a fool and a womanmust wait dinner for me and make a flurry of herself her day so far cetera adhuc desunt  fridayi thinki have been too tired to add to this chronicle which will at any rate give you some guess of our employment all goes well the kuikuithink of this mispronunciation having actually infected me to the extent of misspelling tuitui is the word by rightsthe tuitui is all out of the paddocka fenced park between the house and boundary penis men start today on the road the garden is part burned part dug and henry at the head of a troop of underpaid assistants is hard at work clearing the part clearing you will see from the map from the house run down to the stream side up the stream nearly as high as the garden then back to the star which i have just added to the map  my long silent contests in the forest have had a strange effect on me the unconcealed vitality of these vegetables their exuberant number and strength the attemptsi can use no other wordof lianas to enwrap and capture the intruder the awful silence the knowledge that all my efforts are only like the performance of an actor the thing of a moment and the wood will silently and swiftly heal them up with fresh effervescence the cunning sense of the tuitui suffering itself to be touched with windswayed grasses and not mindingbut let the grass be moved by a man and it shuts up the whole silent battle murder and slow death of the contending forest weigh upon the imagination my poem the woodman stands but i have taken refuge in a new story which just shot through me like a bullet in one of my moments of awe alone in that tragic jungle    the high woods of ulufanua4     1 a south sea bridal    2 under the ban    3 savao and faavao    4 cries in the high wood    5 rumour full of tongues    6 the hour of peril    7 the day of vengeance  it is very strange very extravagant i dare say but its varied and picturesque and has a pretty love affair and ends well ulufanua is a lovely samoan word ulu  grove fanua  land grovelandthe tops of the high trees savao sacred to the wood and faavao woodways are the names of two of the characters ulufanua the name of the supposed island  i am very tired and rest off today from all but letters fanny is quite done up she could not sleep last night something it seemed like asthmai trust not i suppose lloyd will be about so you can give him the benefit of this long scrawl5 never say that i cant write a letter say that i dontyours ever my dearest fellow      r l s  later on fridaythe guidwife had bread to bake and she baked it in a pan o but between whiles she was down with me weeding sensitive in the paddock the men have but now passed over it i was round in that very place to see the weeding was done thoroughly and already the reptile springs behind our heels tuitui is a truly strange beast and gives food for thought i am nearly surei cannot yet be quite i mean to experiment when i am less on the hot chase of the beastthat even at the instant he shrivels up his leaves he strikes his prickles downward so as to catch the uprooting finger instinctive say the gabies but so is mans impulse to strike out one thing that takes and holds me is to see the strange variation in the propagation of alarm among these rooted beasts at times it spreads to a radius i speak by the guess of the eye of five or six inches at times only one individual plant appears frightened at a time we tried how long it took one to recover tis a sanguine creature it is all abroad again before i guess again two minutes it is odd how difficult in this world it is to be armed the double armour of this plant betrays it in a thick tuft where the leaves disappear i thrust in my hand and the bite of the thorns betrays the topmost stem in the open again and when i hesitate if it be clover a touch on the leaves and its fine sense and retractile action betrays its identity at once yet it has one gift incomparable rome had virtue and knowledge rome perished the sensitive plant has indigestible seedsso they sayand it will flourish for ever i give my advice thus to a young planthave a strong root a weak stem and an indigestible seed so you will outlast the eternal city and your progeny will clothe mountains and the irascible planter will blaspheme in vain the weak point of tuitui is that its stem is strong  supplementary pagehere beginneth the third lesson which is not from the planter but from a less estimable character the writer of books  i want you to understand about this south sea book the job is immense i stagger under material i have seen the first big tache it was necessary to see the smaller ones the letters were at my hand for the purpose but i was not going to lose this experience and instead of writing mere letters have poured out a lot of stuff for the book how this works and fits time is to show but i believe in time i shall get the whole thing in form now up to date that is all my design and i beg to warn you till we have the whole or much of the stuff together you can hardly judgeand i can hardly judge such a mass of stuff is to be handled if possible without repetitionso much foreign matter to be introducedif possible with perspicuityand as much as can be a spirit of narrative to be preserved you will find that come stronger as i proceed and get the explanations worked through problems of style are as yet dirt under my feet my problem is architectural creativeto get this stuff jointed and moving if i can do that i will trouble you for style anybody might write it and it would be splendid wellengineered the masses right the blooming thing travellingtwig  this i wanted you to understand for lots of the stuff sent home is i

   the opening sentences of the following refer of course to the    wrecker and particularly to a suggestion of mine concerning the    relation of the main narrative to the prologue       vailima apia samoa nov 7 1890  i wish you to add to the words at the end of the prologue they run i think thus and this is the yarn of loudon dodd add not as he told but as he wrote it afterwards for his diversion this becomes the more needful because when all is done i shall probably revert to taiohae and give final details about the characters in the way of a conversation between dodd and havers these little snippets of information and faitsdivers have always a disjointed brokenbacked appearance yet readers like them in this book we have introduced so many characters that this kind of epilogue will be looked for and i rather hope looking far ahead that i can lighten it in dialogue  we are well past the middle now how does it strike you and can you guess my mystery it will make a fattish volume  i say have you ever read the highland widow i never had till yesterday i am half inclined bar a trip or two to think it scotts masterpiece and it has the name of a failure strange things are readers  i expect proofs and revises in duplicate  we have now got into a small barrack at our place we see the sea six hundred feet below filling the end of two vales of forest on one hand the mountain runs above us some thousand feet higher great trees stand round us in our clearing there is an endless voice of birds i have never lived in such a heaven just now i have fever which mitigates but not destroys my gusto in my circumstancesyou may envy      robert louis stevenson   o i dont know if i mentioned that having seen your new tail to the magazine i cried off interference at least for this

desirei positively begin to awaketo be remembered to scribner low st gaudens russell sullivan well well you fellows have the feast of reason and the flow of soul i have a betterlooking place and climate you should hear the birds on the hill now the day has just wound up with a shower it is still light without though i write within here at the cheek of a lamp my wife and an invaluable german are wrestling about bread on the back verandah and how the birds and the frogs are rattling and piping and hailing from the woods here and there a throaty chuckle here and there cries like those of jolly children who have lost their way here and there the ringing sleighbell of the tree frog out and away down below me on the sea it is still raining it will be wet under foot on schooners and the house will leak how well i know that here the showers only patter on the iron roof and sometimes roar and within the lamp burns steady on the tafacovered walls with their dusky tartan patterns and the bookshelves with their thin array of books and no squall can rout my house or bring my heart into my mouththe wellpleased south sea islander      r l s     to sidney colvin        vailima tuesday november 25th1890  my dear colvini wanted to go out bright and early to go on with my survey you never heard of that the world has turned and much water run under bridges since i stopped my diary i have written six more chapters of the book all good i potently believe and given up as a deception of the devils the high woods i have been once down to apia to a huge native feast at seumanutafas the chief of apia there was a vast mass of food crowds of people the police charging among them with whips the whole in high good humour on both sides infinite noise and a historic eventmr clarke the missionary and his wife assisted at a native dance on my return from this function i found work had stopped no more south seas in my belly well henry had cleared a great deal of our bush on a contract and it ought to be measured i set myself to the task with a tapeline it seemed a dreary business then i borrowed a prismatic compass and tackled the task afresh i have no books i had not touched an instrument nor given a thought to the business since the year of grace 1871 you can imagine with what interest i sat down yesterday afternoon to reduce my observations five triangles i had taken all five came right to my ineffable joy our dinnerthe lowest we have ever beenconsisted of one avocado pear between fanny and me a ships biscuit for the guidman white bread for the missis and red wine for the twa no salt horse even in all vailima after dinner henry came and i began to teach him decimals you wouldnt think i knew them myself after so long desuetude  i could not but wonder how henry stands his evenings here the polynesian loves gaietyi feed him with decimals the mariners compass derivations grammar and the like delecting myself after the manner of my race moult tristement i suck my paws i live for my dexterities and by my accomplishments even my clumsinesses are my joymy woodcuts my stumbling on the pipe this surveying evenand even weeding sensitive anything to do with the mind with the eye with the handwith a part of me diversion flows in these ways for the dreary man but gaiety is what these children want to sit in a crowd tell stories and pass jests to hear one another laugh and scamper with the girls its good fun too i believe but not for rls ætat 40 which i am now past forty custodian and not one penny the worse that i can see as amusable as ever to be on board ship is reward enough for me give me the wages of going onin a schooner only if ever i were gay which i misremember i am gay no more and here is poor henry passing his evenings on my intellectual husks which the professors masticated keeping the accounts of the estateall wrong i have no doubti keep no check beyond a very rough one marching in with a cloudy brow and the daybook under his arm tackling decimals coming with cases of consciencehow would an english chief behave in such a case etc and i am bound to say on any glimmer of a jest lapsing into native hilarity as a tree straightens itself after the wind is by the other night i remembered my old friendi believe yours alsoscholastikos and administered the crow and the anchorthey were quite fresh to samoan ears this implies a very early severanceand i thought the anchor would have made away with my simelé altogether  fannys time in this interval has been largely occupied in contending publicly with wild swine we have a black sow we call her jack sheppard impossible to confine herimpossible also for her to be confined to my sure knowledge she has been in an interesting condition for longer than any other sow in story else she had long died the death as soon as she is brought to bed she shall count her days i suppose that sow has cost us in days labour from thirty to fifty dollars as many as eight boys at a dollar a day have been twelve hours in chase of her now it is supposed that fanny has outwitted her she grins behind broad planks in what was once the cookhouse she is a wild pig far handsomer than any tame and when she found the cookhouse was too much for her methods of evasion she lay down on the floor and refused food and drink for a whole sunday on monday morning she relapsed and now eats and drinks like a little man i am reminded of an incident two sundays ago the sad word was brought that the sow was out again this time she had carried another in her flight moors and i and fanny were strolling up to the garden and there by the waterside we saw the black sow looking guilty it seemed to me beyond words but fannys cri du coeur was delicious grr she cried nobody loves you  i would i could tell you the moving story of our cart and carthorses the latter are dapplegrey about sixteen hands and of enormous substance the former was a kind of red and green shandrydan with a driving bench plainly unfit to carry lumber or to face our road remember that the last third of my road about a mile is all made out of a bridletrack by my boysand my dollars it was supposed a white man had been foundan exgerman artillerymanto drive this last he proved incapable and drunken the gallant henry who had never driven before and knew nothing about horsesexcept the rats and weeds that flourish on the islandsvolunteered moors accepted proposing to follow and supervise despatched his work and started after no cart he hurried on up the roadno cart transfer the scene to vailima where on a sudden to fanny and me the cart appears apparently at a hard gallop some two hours before it was expected henry radiantly ruling chaos from the bench it stopped it was long before we had time to remark that the axle was twisted like the letter l our first care was the horses there they stood black with sweat the sweat raining from themliterally rainingtheir heads down their feet apartand blood running thick from the nostrils of the mare we got out fannys underclothescouldnt find anything else but our blanketsto rub them down and in about half an hour we had the blessed satisfaction to see one after the other take a bite or two of grass but it was a toucher a little more and these steeds would have been foundered  monday 31st novembernear a week elapsed and no journal on monday afternoon moors rode up and i rode down with him dined and went over in the evening to the american consulate present consulgeneral sewall lieut parker and mrs parker lafarge the american decorator adams an american historian we talked late and it was arranged i was to write up for fanny and we should both dine on the morrow  on the friday i was all forenoon in the mission house lunched at the german consulate went on board the sperbergerman warship in the afternoon called on my lawyer on my way out to american consulate and talked till dinner time with adams whom i am supplying with introductions and information for tahiti and the marquesas fanny arrived a wreck and had to lie down the moon rose one day past full and we dined in the verandah a good dinner on the whole talk with lafarge about art and the lovely dreams of art students8 remark by adams which took me briskly home to the monumenti only liked one young womanand that was mrs procter9 henry james would like that back by moonlight in the consulate boatfanny being too tired to walkto moorss saturday i left fanny to rest and was off early to the mission where the politics are thrilling just now the native pastors to every ones surprise have moved of themselves in the matter of the native dances desiring the restrictions to be removed or rather to be made dependent on the character of the dance clarke who had feared censure and all kinds of trouble is of course rejoicing greatly a characteristic feature the argument of the pastors was handed in in the form of a fictitious narrative of the voyage of one mr pye an english traveller and his conversation with a chief there are touches of satire in this educational romance mr pye for instance admits that he knows nothing about the bible at the mission i was sought out by henry in a devil of an agitation he has been made the victim of a forgerya crime hitherto unknown in samoa i had to go to folau the chief judge here in the matter folau had never heard of the offence and begged to know what was the punishment there may be lively times in forgery ahead it seems the sort of crime to tickle a polynesian after lunchyou can see what a busy three days i am describingwe set off to ride home my jack was full of the devil of corn and too much grass and no work i had to ride ahead and leave fanny behind he is a most gallant little rascal is my jack and takes the whole way as hard as the rider pleases single incident halfway up i find my boys upon the road and stop and talk with henry in his character of ganger as long as jack will suffer me fanny drones in after we make a show of eatingor i doshe goes to bed about halfpast six i write some verses read irvings washington and follow about halfpast eight o one thing more i did in a prophetic spirit i had made sure fanny was not fit to be left alone and wrote before turning in a letter to chalmers telling him i could not meet him in auckland at this time by eleven at night fanny got me wakenedshe had tried twice in vainand i found her very bad thence till three we laboured with mustard poultices laudanum soda and gingerheavens wasnt it cold the land breeze was as cold as a river the moon was glorious in the paddock and the great boughs and the black shadows of our trees were inconceivable but it was a poor time  sunday morning found fanny of course a complete wreck and myself not very brilliant paul had to go to vailele re cocoanuts it was doubtful if he could be back by dinner never mind said i ill take dinner when you return off set paul i did an hours work and then tackled the house work i did it beautiful the house was a picture it resplended of propriety presently mr moors andrew rode up i heard the doctor was at the forest house and sent a note to him and when he came i heard my wife telling him she had been in bed all day and that was why the house was so dirty was it grateful was it politic was it trueenough in the interval up marched little l s one of my neighbours all in his sunday white linens made a fine salute and demanded the key of the kitchen in german and english and he cooked dinner for us like a little man and had it on the table and the coffee ready by the hour paul had arranged me this surprise some time later paul returned himself with a fresh surprise on hand he was almost sober nothing but a hazy eye distinguished him from paul of the week days vivat  on the evening i cannot dwell all the horses got out of the paddock went across and smashed my neighbours garden into a big hole how little the amateur conceives a farmers troubles i went out at once with a lantern staked up a gap in the hedge was kicked at by a chestnut mare who straightway took to the bush and came back a little after they had found another gap and the crowd were all abroad again what has happened to our own garden nobody yet knows  fanny had a fair night and we are both tolerable this morning only the yoke of correspondence lies on me heavy i beg you will let this go on to my mother i got such a good start in your letter that i kept on at it and i have neither time nor energy for moreyours ever      r l s  something newi was called from my letters by the voice of mr  who had just come up with a load of wood roaring henry henry bring six boys i saw there was something wrong and ran out the cart half unloaded had upset with the mare in the shafts she was all cramped together and all tangled up in harness and cargo the off shaft pushing her over the carter holding her up by main strength and right alongside of herwhere she must fall if she went downa deadly stick of a tree like a lance i could not but admire the wisdom and faith of this great brute i never saw the ridinghorse that would not have lost its life in such a situation but the cartelephant patiently waited and was saved it was a stirring three minutes i can tell you  i forgot in talking of saturday to tell of one incident which will particularly interest my mother i met dr davis from savaii and had an agelong talk about edinburgh folk it was very pleasant he has been studying in edinburgh along with his son a pretty relation he told me he knew nobody but college people i was altogether a student he said with glee he seems full of cheerfulness and thickset energy i feel as if i could put him in a novel with effect and ten to one if i know more of him the image will be only blurred  tuesday dec 2ndi should have told you yesterday that all my boys were got up for their work in moustaches and sidewhiskers of some sort of blackingi suppose woodash

accident i have mislaid your last what was in it i know not and here i am caught unexpectedly by the american mail a week earlier than by computation the computation not the mail is supposed to be in error the vols of scribners have arrived and present a noble appearance in my house which is not a noble structure at present but by autumn we hope to be sprawling in our verandah twelve feet sir by eightyeight in front and seventytwo on the flank view of the sea and mountains sunrise moonrise and the german fleet at anchor three miles away in apia harbour i hope some day to offer you a bowl of kava there or a slice of a pineapple or some lemonade from my own hedge i know a hedge where the lemons growshakespeare my house at this moment smells of them strong and the rain which a while ago roared there now rings in minute drops upon the iron roof i have no wrecker for you this mail other things having engaged me i was on the whole rather relieved you did not vote for regular papers as i feared the traces it is my design from time to time to write a paper of a reminiscential beastly word description some of them i could scarce publish from different considerations but some of themfor instance my long experience of gambling placeshomburg wiesbaden badenbaden old monaco and new monte carlowould make good magazine padding if i got the stuff handled the right way i never could fathom why verse was put in magazines it has something to do with the makingup has it not i am scribbling a lot just now if you are taken badly that way apply to the south seas i could send you some i believe anyway only none of it is thoroughly ripe if you have kept back the volume of ballads ill soon make it of a respectable size if this fit continue by the next mail you may expect some more wrecker or i shall be displeased probably no more than a chapter however for it is a hard one and i am denuded of my proofs my collaborator having walked away with them to england hence some trouble in catching the just note  i am a mere farmer my talk which would scarce interest you on broadway is all of fuafua and tuitui and black boys and planting and weeding and axes and cutlasses my hands are covered with blisters and full of thorns letters are doubtless a fine thing so are beer and skittles but give me farmering in the tropics for real interest life goes in enchantment i come home to find i am late for dinner and when i go to bed at night i could cry for the weariness of my loins and thighs do not speak to me of vexation the life brims with it but with living interest fairly  christmas i go to auckland to meet tamate the new guinea missionary a man i love the rest of my life is a prospect of much rain much weeding and making of paths a little letters and devilish little to eati am my dear burlingame with messages to all whom it may concern very sincerely yours       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        vailima monday twentysomethingth of december 1890  my dear colvini do not say my jack is anything extraordinary he is only an island horse and the profane might call him a punch and his face is like a donkeys and natives have ridden him and he has no mouth in consequence and occasionally shies but his merits are equally surprising and i dont think i should ever have known jacks merits if i had not been riding up of late on moonless nights jack is a bit of a dandy he loves to misbehave in a gallant manner above all on apia street and when i stop to speak to people they say dr stuebel the german consul said about three days ago o what a wild horse it cannot be safe to ride him such a remark is jacks reward and represents his ideal of fame now when i start out of apia on a dark night you should see my changed horse at a fast steady walk with his head down and sometimes his nose to the groundwhen he wants to do that he asks for his head with a little eloquent polite movement indescribablehe climbs the long ascent and threads the darkest of the wood the first night i came it was starry and it was singular to see the starlight drip down into the crypt of the wood and shine in the open end of the road as bright as moonlight at home but the crypt itself was proof blackness lived in it the next night it was raining we left the lights of apia and passed into limbo jack finds a way for himself but he does not calculate for my height above the saddle and i am directed forward all braced up for a crouch and holding my switch upright in front of me it is curiously interesting in the forest the dead wood is phosphorescent some nights the whole ground is strewn with it so that it seems like a grating over a pale hell doubtless this is one of the things that feed the night fears of the natives and i am free to confess that in a night of trackless darkness where all else is void these pallid ignes suppositi have a fantastic appearance rather bogey even one night when it was very dark a man had put out a little lantern by the wayside to show the entrance to his ground i saw the light as i thought far ahead and supposed it was a pedestrian coming to meet me i was quite taken by surprise when it struck in my face and passed behind me jack saw it and he was appalled do you think he thought of shying no sir not in the dark in the dark jack knows he is on duty and he went past that lantern steady and swift only as he went he groaned and shuddered for about 2500 of jacks steps we only passed one housethat where the lantern was and about 1500 of these are in the darkness of the pit but now the moon is on tap again and the roads lighted  illustration    1 three posts        5 sink of the tuluiga   2 leather bottle     6 silent falls   3 old walls          7 garden   4 wreck hill  i have been exploring up the vaituluiga see your map it comes down a wonderful fine glen at least 200 feet of cliffs on either hand winding like a corkscrew great forest trees filling it at the top there ought to be a fine double fall but the stream evades it by a fault and passes underground above the fall it runs at this season full and very gaily in a shallow valley some hundred yards before the head of the glen its course is seen full of grasses like a flooded meadow that is the sink beyond the grave of the grasses the bed lies dry near this upper part there is a great show of ruinous pigwalls a village must have stood near by  to walk from our house to wreck hill when the path is buried in fallen trees takes one about half an hour i think to return not more than twenty minutes i dare say fifteen hence i should guess it was threequarters of a mile i had meant to join on my explorations passing eastward by the sink but lord how it rains  lateri went out this morning with a pocket compass and walked in a varying direction perhaps on an average s by w 1754 paces then i struck into the bush nw by n hoping to strike the vaituluiga above the falls now i have it plotted out i see i should have gone w or even w by s but it is not easy to guess for 600 weary paces i struggled through the bush and then came on the stream below the gorge where it was comparatively easy to get down to it in the place where i struck it it made cascades about a little isle and was running about ne 20 to 30 feet wide as deep as to my knee and piercing cold i tried to follow it down and keep the run of its direction and my paces but when i was wading to the knees and the waist in mud poison brush and rotted wood bound hand and foot in lianas shovelled unceremoniously off the one shore and driven to try my luck upon the otheri saw i should have hard enough work to get my body down if my mind rested it was a damnable walk certainly not half a mile as the crow flies but a real bucketer for hardship once i had to pass the stream where it flowed between banks about three feet high to get the easier down i swung myself by a wildcocoanutso called it bears bunches of scarlet nutletswhich grew upon the brink as i so swung i received a crack on the head that knocked me all abroad impossible to guess what tree had taken a shy at me so many towered above one over the other and the missile whatever it was dropped in the stream and was gone before i had recovered my wits i scarce know what i write so hideous a niagara of rain roars shouts and demonizes on the iron roofit is pitch dark toothe lamp lit at 5 it was a blessed thing when i struck my own road and i got home neat for lunch time one of the most wonderful mud statues ever witnessed in the afternoon i tried again going up the other path by the garden but was early drowned out came home plotted out what i had done and then wrote this truck to you  fanny has been quite ill with earache she wont go10 hating the sea at this wild season i dont like to leave her so it drones on steamer after steamer and i guess itll end by no one going at all she is in a dreadful misfortune at this hour a case of kerosene having burst in the kitchen a little while ago it was the carpenters horse that trod in a nest of fourteen eggs and made an omelette of our hopes the farmers lot is not a happy one and it looks like some real uncompromising bad weather too i wish fannys ear were well think of parties in monuments think of me in skerryvore and now of this it dont look like a part of the same universe to me work is quite laid aside i have worked myself right out  christmas eveyesterday who could write my wife near crazy with earache the rain descending in white crystal rods and playing hells tattoo like a tutti of battering rams on our sheetiron roof the wind passing high overhead with a strange dumb mutter or striking us full so that all the huge trees in the paddock cried aloud and wrung their hands and brandished their vast arms the horses stood in the shed like things stupid the sea and the flagship lying on the jaws of the bay vanished in sheer rain all day it lasted i locked up my papers in the iron box in case it was a hurricane and the house might go we went to bed with mighty uncertain feelings far more than on shipboard where you have only drowning aheadwhereas here you have a smash of beams a shower of sheetiron and a blind race in the dark and through a whirlwind for the shelter of an unfinished stableand my wife with earache well well this morning we had word from apia a hurricane was looked for the ships were to leave the bay by 10 am it is now 330 and the flagship is still a fixture and the wind round in the blessed east so i suppose the danger is over but heaven is still laden the day dim with frequent rattling bucketfuls of rain and just this moment as i write a squall went overhead scarce striking us with that singular solemn noise of its passage which is to me dreadful i have always feared the sound of wind beyond everything in my hell it would always blow a gale  i have been all day correcting proofs and making out a new plan for our house the other was too dear to be built now and it was a hard task to make a smaller house that would suffice for the present and not be a mere waste of money in the future i believe i have succeeded i have taken care of my study anyway  two favours i want to ask of you first i wish you to get pioneering in new guinea by j chalmers its a missionary book and has less pretensions to be literature than spurgeons sermons yet i think even through that you will see some of the traits of the hero that wrote it a man that took me fairly by storm for the most attractive simple brave and interesting man in the whole pacific he is away now to go up the fly river a desperate venture it is thought he is quite a livingstone card  second try and keep yourself free next winter and if my means can be stretched so far ill come to egypt and well meet at shepheards hotel and youll put me in my place which i stand in need of badly by this time lord what bully times i suppose ill come per british asia or whatever you call it and avoid all cold and might be in egypt about november as ever waseleven months from now or rather less but do not let us count our chickens  last night three piglings were stolen from one of our pigpens the great lafaele appeared to my wife uneasy so she engaged him in conversation on the subject and played upon him the following engaging trick you advance your two forefingers towards the sitters eyes he closes them whereupon you substitute on his eyelids the fore and middle fingers of the left hand and with your right which he supposes engaged you tap him on the head and back when you let him open his eyes he sees you withdrawing the two forefingers what that asked lafaele my devil says fanny i wake um my devil all right now he go catch the man that catch my pig about an hour afterwards lafaele came for further particulars o all right my wife says by and by that man he sleep devil go sleep same place by and by that man plenty sick i no care what for he take my pig lafaele cares plenty i dont think he is the man though he may be but he knows him and most likely will eat some of that pig tonight he will not eat with relish  saturday 27thit cleared up suddenly after dinner and my wife and i saddled up and off to apia whence we did not return till yesterday morning christmas day i wish you could have seen our party at table h j moors at one end with my wife i at the other with mrs m between us two native women carruthers the lawyer moorss two shopboyswalters and a m the quadroonand the guests of the evening shirley baker the defamed and muchaccused man of tonga and his son with the artificial joint to his armwhere the assassins shot him in shooting at his father bakers appearance is not unlike john bull on a cartoon he is highly interesting to speak to as i had expected i found he and i had many common interests and were engaged in puzzling over many of the same difficulties after dinner it was quite pretty to see our christmas party it was so easily pleased and prettily behaved in the morning i should say i had been to lunch at the german consulate where i had as usual a very pleasant time i shall miss dr stuebel11 much when he leaves and when adams and lafarge go also it will be a great blow i am getting spoiled with all this good society  on friday morning i had to be at my house affairs before seven and they kept me in apia till past ten disputing and consulting about brick and stone and native and hydraulic lime and cement and sand and all sorts of otiose details about the chimneyjust what i fled from in my fathers office twenty years ago i should have made a languid engineer rode up with the carpenter ah my wicked jack on christmas eve as i was taking the saddle bag off he kicked at me and fetched me too right on the shin on friday being annoyed at the carpenters horse having a longer trot he uttered a shrill cry and tried to bite him alas alas these are like old days my dear jack is a bogue12 but i cannot strangle jack into submission  i have given up the big house for just now we go ahead right away with a small one which should be ready in two months and i suppose will suffice for just now  o i know i havent told you about our aitu have i it is a lady aitu fafine she lives on the mountainside her presence is heralded by the sound of a gust of wind a sound very common in the high woods when she catches you i do not know what happens but in practice she is avoided so i suppose she does more than pass the time of day the great aitu saumaiafe was once a living woman and became an aitu no one understands how she lives in a stream at the wellhead her hair is red she appears as a lovely young lady her bust particularly admired to handsome young men these die her love being fatalas a handsome youth she has been known to court damsels with the like result but this is very rare as an old crone she goes about and asks for water and woe to them who are uncivil saumaiafe means literally come here a thousand a good name for a lady of her manners my aitu fafine does not seem to be in the same line of business it is unsafe to be a handsome youth in samoa a young man died from her favours last monthso we said on this side of the island on the other where he died it was not so certain i for one blame it on madam saumaiafe without hesitation  example of the farmers sorrows i slipped out on the balcony a moment ago it is a lovely morning cloudless smoking hot the breeze not yet arisen looking west in front of our new house i saw two heads of indian corn wagging and the rest and all nature stock still as i looked one of the stalks subsided and disappeared i dashed out to the rescue two small pigs were deep in the grassquite hid till within a few yardsgently but swiftly demolishing my harvest never be a farmer  1230 pmi while away the moments of digestion by drawing you a faithful picture of my morning when i had done writing as above it was time to clean our house when i am working it falls on my wife alone but today we had it between us she did the bedroom i the sittingroom in fiftyseven minutes of really most unpalatable labour then i changed every stitch for i was wet through and sat down and played on my pipe till dinner was ready mighty pleased to be in a mildly habitable spot once more the house had been neglected for near a week and was a hideous spot my wifes ear and our visit to apia being the causes our paul we prefer not to see upon that theatre and god knows he has plenty to do elsewhere  i am glad to look out of my back door and see the boys smoothing the foundations of the new house this is all very jolly but six months of it has satisfied me we have too many things for such close quarters to work in the midst of all the myriad misfortunes of the planters life seated in a dyonisius cant spell him ear whence i catch every complaint mishap and contention is besides the devil and the hope of a cave of my own inspires me with lust o to be able to shut my own door and make my own confusion o to have the brown paper and the matches and make a hell of my own once more  i do not bother you with all my troubles in these outpourings the troubles of the farmer are inspiritingthey are like difficulties out huntinga fellow rages at the time and rejoices to recall and to commemorate them my troubles have been financial it is hard to arrange wisely interests so distributed america england samoa sydney everywhere i have an end of liability hanging out and some shelf of credit hard by and to juggle all these and build a dwellingplace here and check expensea thing i am ill fitted foryou can conceive what a nightmare it is at times then god knows i have not been idle but since the master nothing has come to raise any coins i believe the springs are dry at home and now i am worked out and can no more at all a holiday is required  dec 28thi have got unexpectedly to work again and feel quite dandy goodbye       r l s     to henry james      mr lafarge the artist and mr henry adams the historian have been    mentioned already the pinch in the matter of eatables only lasted    for a little while until mrs stevenson had taken her bearings and    made her arrangements in the matter of marketing etc       vailima apia samoa december 29th 1890  my dear henry jamesit is terrible how little everybody writes and how much of that little disappears in the capacious maw of the post office many letters both from and to me i now know to have been lost in transit my eye is on the sydney post office a large ungainly structure with a tower as being not a hundred miles from the scene of disappearance but then i have no proof the tragic muse you announced to me as coming i had already ordered it from a sydney bookseller about two months ago he advised me that his copy was in the post and i am still tragically museless  news news news what do we know of yours what do you care for ours we are in the midst of the rainy season and dwell among alarms of hurricanes in a very unsafe little twostoried wooden box 650 feet above and about three miles from the seabeach behind us till the other slope of the island desert forest peaks and loud torrents in front green slopes to the sea some fifty miles of which we dominate we see the ships as they go out and in to the dangerous roadstead of apia and if they lie far out we can even see their topmasts while they are at anchor of sounds of men beyond those of our own labourers there reach us at very long intervals salutes from the warships in harbour the bell of the cathedral church and the low of the conchshell calling the labour boys on the german plantations yesterday which was sundaythe quantième is most likely erroneous you can now correct itwe had a visitorbaker of tonga heard you ever of him he is a great man here he is accused of theft rape judicial murder private poisoning abortion misappropriation of public moneysoddly enough not forgery nor arson you would be amused if you knew how thick the accusations fly in this south sea world i make no doubt my own character is something illustrious or if not yet there is a good time coming  but all our resources have not of late been pacific we have had enlightened society lafarge the painter and your friend henry adams a great privilegewould it might endure i would go oftener to see them but the place is awkward to reach on horseback i had to swim my horse the last time i went to dinner and as i have not yet returned the clothes i had to borrow i dare not return in the same plight it seems inevitableas soon as the wash comes in i plump straight into the american consuls shirt or trousers they i believe would come oftener to see me but for the horrid doubt that weighs upon our commissariat department we have often almost nothing to eat a guest would simply break the bank my wife and i have dined on one avocado pear i have several times dined on hard bread and onions what would you do with a guest at such narrow seasonseat him or serve up a labour boy fricasseed  work work is now arrested but i have written i should think about thirty chapters of the south sea book they will all want rehandling i dare say gracious what a strain is a long book the time it took me to design this volume before i could dream of putting pen to paper was excessive and then think of writing a book of travels on the spot when i am continually extending my information revising my opinions and seeing the most finely finished portions of my work come part by part in pieces very soon i shall have no opinions left and without an opinion how to string artistically vast accumulations of fact darwin said no one could observe without a theory i suppose he was right tis a fine point of metaphysic but i will take my oath no man can write without oneat least the way he would like to and my theories melt melt melt and as they melt the thawwaters wash down my writing and leave unideal tractswastes instead of cultivated farms  kipling is by far the most promising young man who has appeared sinceahemi appeared he amazes me by his precocity and various endowment but he alarms me by his copiousness and haste he should shield his fire with both hands and draw up all his strength and sweetness in one ball draw all his strength and all his sweetness up into one ball i cannot remember marvells words so the critics have been saying to me but i was never capable ofand surely never guilty ofsuch a debauch of production at this rate his works will soon fill the habitable globe and surely he was armed for better conflicts than these succinct sketches and flying leaves of verse i look on i admire i rejoice for myself but in a kind of ambition we all have for our tongue and literature i am wounded if i had this mans fertility and courage it seems to me i could heave a pyramid  well we begin to be the old fogies now and it was high time something rose to take our places certainly kipling has the gifts the fairy godmothers were all tipsy at his christening what will he do with them  goodbye my dear james find an hour to write to us and register your letteryours affectionately       r l s     to rudyard kipling      in 1890 on first becoming acquainted with mr kiplings soldiers    three stevenson had written off his congratulations redhot well    and indeed mr mulvaney so ran the first sentences of his note    but its as good as meat to meet in with you sir they tell me it    was a man of the name of kipling made ye but indeed and they cant    fool me it was the lord god almighty that made you taking the cue    thus offered mr kipling had written back in the character of his    own irishman thomas mulvaney addressing stevensons highlander    alan breck stewart in the following letter which belongs to an    uncertain date in 1891 alan breck is made to reply the gentleman i    now serve with means of course r l s himself       vailima 1891  siri cannot call to mind having written you but i am so throng with occupation this may have fallen aside i never heard tell i had any friends in ireland and i am led to understand you are come of no considerable family the gentleman i now serve with assures me however you are a very pretty fellow and your letter deserves to be remarked its true he is himself a man of a very low descent upon the one side though upon the other he counts cousinship with a gentleman my very good friend the late mr balfour of the shaws in the lothian which i should be wanting in good fellowship to forget he tells me besides you are a man of your hands i am not informed of your weapon but if all be true it sticks in my mind i would be ready to make exception in your favour and meet you like one gentleman with another i suppose thisll be your purpose in your favour which i could very ill make out its one i would be sweir to baulk you of it seems mr mcilvaine which i take to be your name you are in the household of a gentleman of the name of coupling for whom my friend is very much engaged the distances being very uncommodious i think it will be maybe better if we leave it to these two to settle all thats necessary to honour i would have you to take heed its a very unusual condescension on my part that bear a kings name and for the matter of that i think shame to be mingled with a person of the name of coupling which is doubtless a very good house but one i never heard tell of any more than stevenson but your purpose being laudable i would be sorry as the word goes to cut off my nose to spite my facei am sir your humble servant         a stewart      chevalier de st louis     to mr milvaine       gentleman private in a foot regiment            under cover to mr coupling  he has read me some of your barrack room ballants which are not of so noble a strain as some of mine in the gaelic but i could set some of them to the pipes if this rencounter goes as its to be desired lets first as i understand you to move do each other this rational courtesy and if either will survive we may grow better acquaint for your tastes for whats martial and for poetry agree with mine       a s     to sidney colvin      this is the first appearance in stevensons letters of the swedish    chief justice of samoa mr conrad cedercrantz of whom we shall hear    enough and more than enough in the sequel       ss lübeck between apia and sydney jan 17th 1891  my dear colvinthe faamasino sili or chief justice to speak your low language has arrived i had ridden down with henry and lafaele the sun was down the night was close at hand so we rode fast just as i came to the corner of the road before apia i heard a gun fire and lo there was a great crowd at the end of the pier and the troops out and a chief or two in the height of samoa finery and seumanu coming in his boat the oarsmen all in uniform bringing the faamasino sili sure enough it was lucky he was no longer the natives would not have waited many weeks but think of it as i sat in the saddle at the outside of the crowd looking the english consul said as if i were commanding the manoeuvres i was nearly knocked down by a stampede of the three consuls they had been waiting their guest at the matafele end and some wretched intrigue among the whites had brought him to apia and the consuls had to run all the length of the town and come too late  the next day was a long one i was at a marriage of gurr the banker to fanua the virgin of apia bride and bridesmaids were all in the old high dress the ladies were all native the men with the exception of seumanu all white  it was quite a pleasant party and while we were writing we had a birdseye view of the public reception of the chief justice the best part of it were some natives in war array with blacked faces turbans tapa kilts and guns they looked very manly and purposelike no the best part was poor old drunken joe the portuguese boatman who seemed to think himself specially charged with the reception and ended by falling on his knees before the chief justice on the end of the pier and in full view of the whole town and bay the natives pelted him with rotten bananas how the chief justice took it i was too far off to see but it was highly absurd  i have commemorated my genial hopes for the regimen of the faamasino sili in the following canine verses which if you at all guess how to read them are very pretty in movement and unless he be a mighty good man too true in sense    were quarrelling the villages weve beaten the wooden drums   sa femisai o nuu

into tongues that have never been alivethough i assure you we have one capital book in the language a book of fables by an old missionary of the unpromising name of pratt which is simply the best and the most literary version of the fables known to me i suppose i should except la fontaine but l f takes a long time these are brief as the books of our childhood and full of wit and literary colour and o colvin what a tongue it would be to write if one only knew itand there were only readers its curse in common use is an incredible lefthanded wordiness but in the hands of a man like pratt it is succinct as latin compact of long rolling polysyllables and little and often pithy particles and for beauty of sound a dream listen i quote from prattthis is good samoan not canine              1

distinguished 3 the ai is practically suffixed to the verb 4 almost vow the excursion has prolonged itself  i started by the lübeck to meet lloyd and my mother there were many reasons for and against the main reason against was the leaving of fanny alone in her blessed cabin which has been somewhat remedied by my carter mr  putting up in the stable and messing with her but perhaps desire of change decided me not well though i do think i ought to see an oculist being very blind indeed and sometimes unable to read anyway i left the only cabin passenger four and a kid in the second cabin and a dear voyage it had like to have proved close to fiji choose a worse place on the map we broke our shaft early one morning and when or where we might expect to fetch land or meet with any ship i would like you to tell me the pacific is absolutely desert i have sailed there now some years and scarce ever seen a ship except in port or close by i think twice it was the hurricane season besides and hurricane waters well our chief engineer got the shaftit was the middle crank shaftmended thrice it was mended and twice broke down but now keeps uponly we dare not stop for it is almost impossible to start again the captain in the meanwhile crowded her with sail fifteen sails in all every stay being gratified with a staysail a boatboom sent aloft for a maintopgallant yard and the derrick of a crane brought in service as bowsprit all the time we have had a fine fair wind and a smooth sea today at noon our run was 203 miles if you please and we are within some 360 miles of sydney probably there has never been a more gallant success and i can say honestly it was well worked for no flurry no high words no long faces only hard work and honest thought a pleasant manly business to be present at all the chances were we might have been six weeksay or three months at seaor never turned up at all and now it looks as though we should reach our destination some five days too late     to marcel schwob        sydney january 19th 1891  my dear sirsapristi comme vous y allez richard iii and dumas with all my heart but not hamlet hamlet is great literature richard iii a big black gross sprawling melodrama writ with infinite spirit but with no refinement or philosophy by a man who had the world himself mankind and his trade still to learn i prefer the vicomte de bragelonne to richard iii it is better done of its kind i simply do not mention the vicomte in the same part of the building with hamlet or lear or othello or any of those masterpieces that shakespeare survived to give us  also comme vous y allez in my commendation i fear my solide éducation classique had best be described like shakespeares as little latin and no greek and i was educated let me inform you for an engineer i shall tell my bookseller to send you a copy of memories and portraits where you will see something of my descent and education as it was and hear me at length on my dear vicomte i give you permission gladly to take your choice out of my works and translate what you shall prefer too much honoured that so clever a young man should think it worth the pains my own choice would lie between kidnapped and the master of ballantrae should you choose the latter pray do not let mrs henry thrust the sword up to the hilt in the frozen groundone of my inconceivable blunders an exaggeration to stagger hugo say she sought to thrust it in the ground in both these works you should be prepared for scotticisms used deliberately  i fear my stepson will not have found time to get to paris he was overwhelmed with occupation and is already on his voyage back we live here in a beautiful land amid a beautiful and interesting people the life is still very hard my wife and i live in a tworoomed cottage about three miles and six hundred and fifty feet above the sea we have had to make the road to it our supplies are very imperfect in the wild weather of this the hurricane season we have much discomfort one night the wind blew in our house so outrageously that we must sit in the dark and as the sound of the rain on the roof made speech inaudible you may imagine we found the evening long all these things however are pleasant to me you say lartiste inconscient set off to travel you do not divide me right 06 of me is artist 04 adventurer first i suppose come letters then adventure and since i have indulged the second part i think the formula begins to change 055 of an artist 045 of the adventurer were nearer true and if it had not been for my small strength i might have been a different man in all things  whatever you do do not neglect to send me what you publish on villon i look forward to that with lively interest i have no photograph at hand but i will send one when i can it would be kind if you would do the like for i do not see much chance of our meeting in the flesh and a name and a handwriting and an address and even a style i know about as much of tacitus and more of horace it is not enough between contemporaries such as we still are i have just remembered another of my books which i reread the other day and thought in places goodprince otto it is not as good as either of the others but it has one recommendationit has female parts so it might perhaps please better in france  i will ask chatto to send you thenprince otto memories and portraits underwoods and ballads none of which you seem to have seen they will be too late for the new year let them be an easter present  you must translate me soon you will soon have better to do than to transvase the work of othersyours very truly       robert louis stevenson      with the worst pen in the south pacific     to charles baxter      stevenson had been indignant with an old friend at edinburgh who had    received much kindness from his mother for neglecting to call on her    after her return from her wanderings in the pacific       ss lübeck at sea on the return voyage from sydney february      1891  my dear charlesperhaps in my old days i do grow irascible the old man virulent has long been my pet name for myself well the temper is at least all gone now time is good at lowering these distemperatures far better is a sharp sickness and i am just and scarce afoot again after a smoking hot little malady at sydney and the temper being gone i still think the same we have not our parents for ever we are never very good to them when they go and we have lost our frontfile man we begin to feel all our neglects mighty sensibly i propose a proposal my mother is here on board with me today for once i mean to make her as happy as i am able and to do that which i know she likes you on the other hand go and see your father and do ditto and give him a real good hour or two we shall both be glad hereafteryours ever       r l s     to sidney colvin      stevenson had been sharply ailing as usual at sydney and was now on    his way back having received proofs of some of his south sea    chapters he had begun to realise that they were not what he had    hoped to make them       on board ship between sydney and apia february 1891  my dear colvinthe janet nicoll stuff was rather worse than i had looked for you have picked out all that is fit to stand bar two others which i dont dislikethe port of entry and the house of temoana that is for a present opinion i may condemn these also ere i have done by this time you should have another marquesan letter the worst of the lot i think and seven paumotu letters which are not far out of the vein as i wish it i am in hopes the hawaiian stuff is better yet time will show and time will make perfect is something of this sort practicable for the dedication        terra marique   per pericula per ardua       amicae comiti            dd       amans viator  tis a first shot concocted this morning in my berth i had always before been trying it in english which insisted on being either insignificant or fulsome i cannot think of a better word than comes there being not the shadow of a latin book on board yet sure there is some other then viator though it sounds all right is doubtful it has too much perhaps the sense of wayfarer last will it mark sufficiently that i mean my wife and first how about blunders i scarce wish it longer  have had a swingeing sharp attack in sydney beating the fields13 for two nights saturday and sunday wednesday was brought on board tel quel a wonderful wreck and now wednesday week am a good deal picked up but yet not quite a samson being still groggy afoot and vague in the head my chess for instance which is usually a pretty strong game and defies all rivalry aboard is vacillating devoid of resource and observation and hitherto not covered with customary laurels as for work it is impossible we shall be in the saddle before long no doubt and the pen once more couched you must not expect a letter under these circumstances but be very thankful for a note once at samoa i shall try to resume my late excellent habits and delight you with journals you unaccustomed i unaccustomed but it is never too late to mend  it is vastly annoying that i cannot go even to sydney without an attack and heaven knows my life was anodyne i only once dined with anybody at the club with wise worked all morninga terrible dead pull a month only produced the imperfect embryos of two chapters lunched in the boardinghouse played on my pipe went out and did some of my messages dined at a french restaurant and returned to play draughts whist or van john with my family this makes a cheery life after samoa but it isnt what you call burning the candle at both ends is it it appears to me not one word of this letter will be legible by the time i am done with it this dreadful ink rubs off i have a strange kind of novel under construction it begins about 1660 and ends 1830 or perhaps i may continue it to 1875 or so with another life one two three four five six generations perhaps seven figure therein two of my old stories delafield and shovel are incorporated it is to be told in the third person with some of the brevity of history some of the detail of romance the shovels of newton french will be the name the idea is an old one it was brought to birth by an accident a friend in the islands who picked up f jenkin14 read a part and said do you know thats a strange book i like it i dont believe the public will but i like it he thought it was a novel very well said i well see whether the public will like it or not they shall have the chanceyours ever       r l s     to h b baildon      the late mr h bellyse baildon for some time lecturer on english    literature at the university of vienna and afterwards at dundee had    been an old schoolmate and fellowaspirant in literature with    stevenson at edinburgh chalmers of course is the rev james    chalmers of rarotonga and new guinea already referred to above the    admirable missionary explorer and administrator whom stevenson    sometimes expressed a desire to survive for the sake only of writing    his life       vailima upolu spring 1891  my dear baildonthis is a real disappointment it was so long since we had met i was anxious to see where time had carried and stranded us last time we saw each otherit must have been all ten years ago as we were new to the thirtiesit was only for a moment and now were in the forties and before very long we shall be in our graves sick and well i have had a splendid life of it grudge nothing regret very littleand then only some little corners of misconduct for which i deserve hanging and must infallibly be damnedand take it all over damnation and all would hardly change with any man of my time unless perhaps it were gordon or our friend chalmers a man i admire for his virtues love for his faults and envy for the really a1 life he has with everything heartmy heart i meancould wish it is curious to think you will read this in the grey metropolis go the first grey eastwindy day into the caledonian station if it looks at all as it did of yore i met satan there and then go and stand by the cross and remember the other onehim that went downmy brother robert fergusson it is a pity you had not made me out and seen me as patriarch and planter i shall look forward to some record of your time with chalmers you cant weary me of that fellow he is as big as a house and far bigger than any church where no man warms his hands do you know anything of thomson of a b c d e f at all as i write cs name mustard rises in my nose i have never forgiven that weak amiable boy a little trick he played me when i could ill afford it i mean that whenever i think of it some of the old wrath kindles not that i would hurt the poor soul if i got the world with it and old x is he still afloat harmless bark i gather you aint married yet since your sister to whom i ask to be remembered goes with you did you see a silly tale john nicholsons predicament15 or some such name in which i made free with your home at murrayfield there is precious little sense in it but it might amuse cassells published it in a thing called yuletide years ago and nobody that ever i heard of read or has ever seen yuletide it is addressed to a class we never metreaders of cassells series and that class of conscientious chaff and my tale was dull though i dont recall that it was conscientious only theres the house at murrayfield and a dead body in it glad the ballads amused you they failed to entertain a coy public at which i wondered not that i set much account by my verses which are the verses of prosator but i do know how to tell a yarn and two of the yarns are great rahero is for its length a perfect folktale savage and yet fine full of tailforemost morality ancient as the granite rocks if the historian not to say the politician could get that yarn into his head he would have learned some of his abc but the average man at home cannot understand antiquity he is sunk over the ears in roman civilisation and a tale like that of rahero falls on his ears inarticulate the spectator said there was no psychology in it that interested me much my grandmother as i used to call that able paper and an able paper it is and a fair one cannot so much as observe the existence of savage psychology when it is put before it i am at bottom a psychologist and ashamed of it the tale seized me onethird because of its picturesque features twothirds because of its astonishing psychology and the spectator says theres none i am going on with a lot of island work exulting in the knowledge of a new world a new created world and new men and i am sure my income will decline and fall off for the effort of comprehension is death to the intelligent public and sickness to the dull  i do not know why i pester you with all this trash above all as you deserve nothing i give you my warm talofa my love to you samoan salutation write me again when the spirit moves you and some day if i still live make out the trip again and let us hobanob with our grey pows on my verandahyours sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      the latter part of this letter was written in the course of an    expedition on which stevenson had been invited by the american    consul mr sewall to the neighbouring island of tutuila unluckily    the letter breaks off short and the only record of this trip occurs    in the diary partly quoted in mr balfours life ch xiv       vailima friday march 19th 1891  my dear s cyou probably expect that now i am back at vailima i shall resume the practice of the diary letter a good deal is changed we are more solitude does not attend me as before the night is passed playing van john for shells and what is not less important i have just recovered from a severe illness and am easily tired  i will give you today i sleep now in one of the lower rooms of the new house where my wife has recently joined me we have two beds an empty case for a table a chair a tin basin a bucket and a jug next door in the diningroom the carpenters camp on the floor which is covered with their mosquito nets before the sun rises at 545 or 550 paul brings me tea bread and a couple of eggs and by about six i am at work i work in bedmy bed is of mats no mattress sheets or filthmats a pillow and a blanketand put in some three hours it was 95 this morning when i set off to the streamside to my weeding where i toiled manuring the ground with the best enricher human sweat till the conchshell was blown from our verandah at 1030 at eleven we dine about halfpast twelve i tried by exception to work again could make nothing ont and by one was on my way to the weeding where i wrought till three halfpast five is our next meal and i read flauberts letters till the hour came round dined and then fanny having a cold and i being tired came over to my den in the unfinished house where i now write to you to the tune of the carpenters voices and by the lighti crave your pardonby the twilight of three vile candles filtered through the medium of my mosquito bar bad ink being of the party i write quite blindfold and can only hope you may be granted to read that which i am unable to see while writing  i said i was tired it is a mild phrase my back aches like toothache when i shut my eyes to sleep i know i shall see before thema phenomenon to which both fanny and i are quite accustomedendless vivid deeps of grass and weed each plant particular and distinct so that i shall lie inert in body and transact for hours the mental part of my day business choosing the noxious from the useful and in my dreams i shall be hauling on recalcitrants and suffering stings from nettles stabs from citron thorns fiery bites from ants sickening resistances of mud and slime evasions of slimy roots dead weight of heat sudden puffs of air sudden starts from birdcalls in the contiguous forestsome mimicking my name some laughter some the signal of a whistle and living over again at large the business of my day  though i write so little i pass all my hours of fieldwork in continual converse and imaginary correspondence i scarce pull up a weed but i invent a sentence on the matter to yourself it does not get written autant en emportent les vents but the intent is there and for me in some sort the companionship today for instance we had a great talk i was toiling the sweat dripping from my nose in the hot fit after a squall of rain methought you asked mefrankly was i happy happy said i i was only happy once that was at hyères it came to an end from a variety of reasons decline of health change of place increase of money age with his stealing steps since then as before then i know not what it means but i know pleasure still pleasure with a thousand faces and none perfect a thousand tongues all broken a thousand hands and all of them with scratching nails high among these i place this delight of weeding out here alone by the garrulous water under the silence of the high wood broken by incongruous sounds of birds and take my life all through look at it fore and back and upside downthough i would very fain change myselfi would not change my circumstances unless it were to bring you here and yet god knows perhaps this intercourse of writing serves as well and i wonder were you here indeed would i commune so continually with the thought of you i say i wonder for a form i know and i know i should not  so far and much further the conversation went while i groped in slime after viscous roots nursing and sparing little spears of grass and retreating even with outcry from the prod of the wild lime i wonder if any one had ever the same attitude to nature as i hold and have held for so long this business fascinates me like a tune or a passion yet all the while i thrill with a strong distaste the horror of the thing objective and subjective is always present to my mind the horror of creeping things a superstitious horror of the void and the powers about me the horror of my own devastation and continual murders the life of the plants comes through my fingertips their struggles go to my heart like supplications i feel myself bloodboltered then i look back on my cleared grass and count myself an ally in a fair quarrel and make stout my heart  it is but a little while since i lay sick in sydney beating the fields about the navy and dean swift and drydens latin hymns judge if i love this reinvigorating climate where i can already toil till my head swims and every string in the poor jumping jack as he now lies in bed aches with a kind of yearning strain difficult to suffer in quiescence  as for my damned literature16 god knows what a business it is grinding along without a scrap of inspiration or a note of style but it has to be ground and the mill grinds exceeding slowly though not particularly small the last two chapters have taken me considerably over a month and they are still beneath pity this i cannot continue time not sufficing and the next will just have to be worse all the good i can express is just this some day when style revisits me they will be excellent matter to rewrite of course my old cure of a change of work would probably answer but i cannot take it now the treadmill turns and with a kind of desperate cheerfulness i mount the idle stair i havent the least anxiety about the book unless i die i shall find the time to make it good but the lord deliver me from the thought of the letters however the lord has other things on hand and about six tomorrow i shall resume the consideration practically and face as best i may the fact of my incompetence and disaffection to the task toil i do not spare but fortune refuses me success we can do more whateverhisnamewas we can deserve it but my misdesert began long since by the acceptation of a bargain quite unsuitable to all my methods17  today i have had a queer experience my carter has from the first been using my horses for his own ends when i left for sydney i put him on his honour to cease and my back was scarce turned ere he was forfeit i have only been waiting to discharge him and today an occasion arose i am so much the old man virulent so readily stumble into anger that i gave a deal of consideration to my bearing and decided at last to imitate that of the late  whatever he might have to say this eminently effective controversialist maintained a frozen demeanour and a jeering smile the frozen demeanour is beyond my reach but i could try the jeering smile did so perceived its efficacy kept in consequence my temper and got rid of my friend myself composed and smiling still he white and shaking like an aspen he could explain everything i said it did not interest me he said he had enemies i said nothing was more likely he said he was calumniated with all my heart said i but there are so many liars that i find it safer to believe them he said in justice to himself he must explain god forbid i should interfere with you said i with the same factitious grin but it can change nothing so i kept my temper rid myself of an unfaithful servant found a method of conducting similar interviews in the future and fell in my own liking one thing more i learned a fresh tolerance for the dead  he too had learnedperhaps had inventedthe trick of this manner god knows what weakness what instability of feeling lay beneath ce que cest que de nous poor human nature that at past forty i must adjust this hateful mask for the first time and rejoice to find it effective that the effort of maintaining an external smile should confuse and embitter a mans soul  today i have not weeded i have written instead from six till eleven from twelve till two with the interruption of the interview aforesaid a damned letter is written for the third time i dread to read it for i dare not give it a fourth chanceunless it be very bad indeed now i write you from my mosquito curtain to the song of saws and planes and hammers and wood clumping on the floor above in a day of heavenly brightness a bird twittering near by my eye through the open door commanding green meads two or three forest trees casting their boughs against the sky a forestclad mountainside beyond and close in by the doorjamb a nick of the blue pacific it is march in england bleak march and i lie here with the great sliding doors wide open in an undershirt and pjama trousers and melt in the closure of mosquito bars and burn to be out in the breeze a few torn cloudsnot white the sun has tinged them a warm pinkswim in heaven in which blessed and fair day i have to make faces and speak bitter words to a manwho has deceived me it is truebut who is poor and older than i and a kind of a gentleman too on the whole i prefer the massacre of weeds  sundaywhen i had done talking to you yesterday i played on my pipe till the conch sounded then went over to the old house for dinner and had scarce risen from table ere i was submerged with visitors the first of these despatched i spent the rest of the evening going over the samoan translation of my bottle imp18 with claxton the missionary then to bed but being upset i suppose by these interruptions and having gone all day without my weeding not to sleep for hours i lay awake and heard the rain fall and saw faint faraway lightning over the sea and wrote you long letters which i scorn to reproduce this morning paul was unusually early the dawn had scarce begun when he appeared with the tray and lit my candle and i had breakfasted and read with indescribable sinkings the whole of yesterdays work before the sun had risen then i sat and thought and sat and better thought it was not good enough nor good it was as slack as journalism but not so inspired it was excellent stuff misused and the defects stood gross on it like humps upon a camel but could i in my present disposition do much more with it in my present pressure for time were i not better employed doing another one about as ill than making this some thousandth fraction better yes i thought and tried the new one and behold i could do nothing my head swims words do not come to me nor phrases and i accepted defeat packed up my traps and turned to communicate the failure to my esteemed correspondent i think it possible i overworked yesterday well well see tomorrowperhaps try again later it is indeed the hope of trying later that keeps me writing to you if i take to my pipe i know myselfall is over for the morning hurray ill correct proofs  pagopago wednesdayafter i finished on sunday i passed a miserable day went out weeding but could not find peace i do not like to steal my dinner unless i have given myself a holiday in a canonical manner and weeding after all is only fun the amount of its utility small and the thing capable of being done faster and nearly as well by a hired boy in the evening sewall came up american consul and proposed to take me on a malaga19 which i accepted monday i rode down to apia was nearly all day fighting about drafts and money the silver problem does not touch you but it is in a strange and i hope passing phase making my situation difficult in apia  about eleven the flags were all halfmasted it was old captain hamilton samasoni the natives called him who had passed away in the evening i walked round to the us consulate it was a lovely night with a full moon and as i got round to the hot corner of matautu i heard hymns in front the balcony of the dead mans house was full of women singing mary the widow a native sat on a chair by the doorstep and i was set beside her on a bench and next to paul the carpenter as i sat down i had a glimpse of the old captain who lay in a sheet on his own table after the hymn was over a native pastor made a speech which lasted a long while the light poured out of the door and windows the girls were sitting clustered at my feet it was choking hot after the speech was ended mary carried me within the captains hands were folded on his bosom his face and head were composed he looked as if he might speak at any moment i have never seen this kind of waxwork so express or more venerable and when i went away i was conscious of a certain envy for the man who was out of the battle all night it ran in my head and the next day when we sighted tutuila and ran into this beautiful landlocked loch of pago pago whence i write captain hamiltons folded hands and quiet face said a great deal more to me than the scenery  i am living here in a traders house we have a good table sewall doing things in style and i hope to benefit by the change and possibly get more stuff for letters in the meanwhile i am seized quite malàpropos with desire to write a story the bloody wedding founded on factvery possibly true being an attempt to read a murder casenot yet months old in this very place and house where i now write the indiscretion is what stops me but if i keep on feeling as i feel just now it will have to be written three star nettison kit nettison field the sailor these are the main characters old nettison and the captain of the man of war the secondary possible scenario chapter i     to sidney colvin        saturday april 18th 1891  my dear colvini got back on monday night after twentythree hours in an open boat the keys were lost the consul who had promised us a bottle of burgundy nobly broke open his storeroom and we got to bed about midnight next morning the blessed consul promised us horses for the daybreak forgot all about it worthy man set us off at last in the heat of the day and by a short cut which caused infinite trouble and we were not home till dinner i was extenuated and have had a high fever since or should have been writing before today for the first time i risk it tuesday i was pretty bad wednesday had a fever to kill a horse thursday i was better but still out of ability to do aught but read awful trash this is the time one misses civilisation i wished to send out for some police novels montépin would have about suited my frozen brain it is a bother when all ones thought turns on ones work in some sense or other i could not even think yesterday i took to inventing dishes by way of entertainment yesterday while i lay asleep in the afternoon a very lucky thing happened the chief justice came to call met one of our employés on the road and was shown what i had done to the road  is this the road across the island he asked  the only one said innes  and has one man done all this  three times said the trusty innes it has had to be made three times and when mr stevenson came it was a track like what you see beyond  this must be put right said the chief justice  sundaythe truth is i broke down yesterday almost as soon as i began and have been surreptitiously finishing the entry today for all that i was much better ate all the time and had no fever the day was otherwise uneventful i am reminded i had another visitor on friday and fanny and lloyd as they returned from a forest raid met in our desert untrodden road first father didier keeper of the conscience of mataafa the rising star and next the chief justice sole stay of laupepa the present and unsteady star and remember a few days before we were close to the sick bed and entertained by the amateur physician of tamasese the late and sunken star that is the fun of this place observed lloyd everybody you meet is so important everybody is also so gloomy it will come to war again is the opinion of all the well informedand before that to many bankruptcies and after that as usual to famine here under the microscope we can see history at work  wednesdayi have been very neglectful a return to work perhaps premature but necessary has used up all my possible energies and made me acquainted with the living headache i just jot down some of the past notabilia yesterday b a carpenter and k my unsuccessful white man were absent all morning from their work i was working myself where i hear every sound with morbid certainty and i can testify that not a hammer fell upon inquiry i found they had passed the morning making ice with our ice machine and taking the horizon with a spirit level i had no sooner heard this thana violent headache set in i am a real employer of labour now and have much of the ship captain when aroused and if i had a headache i believe both these gentlemen had aching hearts i promise you the late  was to the front and k who was the most guilty yet in a sense the least blameable having the brains and character of a canarybird fared none the better for bs repartees i hear them hard at work this morning so the menace may be blessed it was just after my dinner just before theirs that i administered my redoubtable tongueit is really redoubtableto these skulkers paul used to triumph over mr j for weeks i am very sorry for you he would say youre going to have a talk with mr stevenson when he comes home you dont know what that is in fact none of them do till they get it i have known k for instance for months he has never heard me complain or take notice unless it were to praise i have used him always as my guest and there seems to be something in my appearance which suggests endless ovine longsuffering we sat in the upper verandah all evening and discussed the price of iron roofing and the state of the draughthorses with innes a new man we have taken and who seems to promise well  one thing embarrasses me no one ever seems to understand my attitude about that book the stuff sent was never meant for other than a first state i never meant it to appear as a book knowing well that i have never had one hour of inspiration since it was begun and have only beaten out my metal by brute force and patient repetition i hoped some day to get a spate of style and burnish itfine mixed metaphor i am now so sick that i intend when the letters are done and some more written that will be wanted simply to make a book of it by the pruningknife i cannot fight longer i am sensible of having done worse than i hoped worse than i feared all i can do now is to do the best i can for the future and clear the book like a piece of bush with axe and cutlass even to produce the ms of this will occupy me at the most favourable opinion till the middle of next year really five years were wanting when i could have made a book but i have a family andperhaps i could not make the book after all     to w craibe angus      the late mr craibe angus of glasgow was one of the chief organisers    of the burns exhibition in that city and had proposed to send out to    samoa a precious copy of the jolly beggars to receive the autograph    of r l s and be returned for the purposes of that exhibition the    line quoted but still our hearts are true etc should it    appears run but still the blood is strong the heart is highland    the author of the canadian boat song which opens thus was hugh    twelfth earl of eglinton the first quotation is of course from    burns       vailima samoa april 1891  dear mr angussurely i remember you it was w c murray who made us acquainted and we had a pleasant crack i see your poet is not yet dead i remember even our talkor you would not think of trusting that invaluable jolly beggars to the treacherous posts and the perils of the sea and the carelessness of authors i love the idea but i could not bear the risk however    hale be your heart hale be your fiddle  it was kindly thought upon  my interest in burns is as you suppose perennial i would i could be present at the exhibition with the purpose of which i heartily sympathise but the nancy has not waited in vain for me i have followed my chest the anchor is weighed long ago i have said my last farewell to the hills and the heather and the lynns like leyden i have gone into far lands to die not stayed like burns to mingle in the end with scottish soil i shall not even return like scott for the last scene burns exhibitions are all over tis a far cry to lochow from tropical vailima    but still our hearts are true our hearts are highland    and we in dreams behold the hebrides  when your hand is in will you remember our poor edinburgh robin burns alone has been just to his promise follow burns he knew best he knew whence he drew firefrom the poor whitefaced drunken vicious boy that raved himself to death in the edinburgh madhouse surely there is more to be gleaned about fergusson and surely it is high time the task was set about i may tell you because your poet is not dead something of how i feel we are three robins who have touched the scots lyre this last century well the one is the worlds he did it he came off he is for ever but i and the otherah what bonds we haveborn in the same city both sickly both pestered one nearly to madness one to the madhouse with a damnatory creed both seeing the stars and the dawn and wearing shoeleather on the same ancient stones under the same pends down the same closes where our common ancestors clashed in their armour rusty or bright and the old robin who was before burns and the flood died in his acute painful youth and left the models of the great things that were to come and the new who came after outlived his greensickness and has faintly tried to parody the finished work if you will collect the strays of robin fergusson fish for material collect any last reechoing of gossip command me to do what you preferto write the prefaceto write the whole if you prefer anything so that another monument after burnss be set up to my unhappy predecessor on the causey of auld reekie you will never know nor will any man how deep this feeling is i believe fergusson lives in me i do but tell it not in gath every man has these fanciful superstitions coming going but yet enduring only most men are so wise or the poet in them so dead that they keep their follies for themselvesi am yours very truly       robert louis stevenson     to edmund gosse        vailima april 1891  my dear gossei have to thank you and mrs gosse for many mementoes chiefly for your life of your father there is a very delicate task very delicately done i noted one or two carelessnesses which i meant to point out to you for another edition but i find i lack the time and you will remark them for yourself against a new edition there were two or perhaps three flabbinesses of style which in your work amazed me am i right in thinking you were a shade bored over the last chapters or was it my own fault that made me think them susceptible of a more athletic compression the flabbinesses were not there i think but in the more admirable part where they showed the bigger take it all together the book struck me as if you had been hurried at the last but particularly hurried over the proofs and could still spend a very profitable fortnight in earnest revision and towards the end heroic compression the book in design subject and general execution is well worth the extra trouble and even if i were wrong in thinking it specially wanted it will not be lost for do we not know in flauberts dread confession that prose is never done what a medium to work in for a man tired perplexed among different aims and subjects and spurred by the immediate need of siller however its mine for what its worth and its one of yours the devil take it and you know as well as flaubert and as well as me that it is never done in other words it is a torment of the pit usually neglected by the bards who lucky beggars approached the styx in measure i speak bitterly at the moment having just detected in myself the last fatal symptom three blank verses in successionand i believe god help me a hemistich at the tail of them hence i have deposed the labourer come out of hell by my private trap and now write to you from my little place in purgatory but i prefer hell would i could always dig in those red coalsor else be at sea in a schooner bound for isles unvisited to be on shore and not to work is emptinesssuicidal vacancy  i was the more interested in your life of your father because i meditate one of mine or rather of my family i have no such materials as you and our objections already made your attack fills me with despair it is direct and elegant and your style is always admirable to melenity lucidity usually a high strain of breeding an elegance that has a pleasant air of the accidental but beware of purple passages i wonder if you think as well of your purple passages as i do of mine i wonder if you think as ill of mine as i do of yours i wonder i can tell you at least what is wrong with yoursthey are treated in the spirit of verse the spiriti dont mean the measure i dont mean you fall into bastard cadences what i mean is that they seem vacant and smoothed out ironed if you like and in a style which like yours aims more and more successfully at the academic one purple word is already much threea whole phraseis inadmissible wed yourself to a clean austerity that is your force wear a linen ephod splendidly candid arrange its folds but do not fasten it with any brooch i swear to you in your talking robes there should be no patch of adornment and where the subject forces let it force you no further than it must and be ready with a twinkle of your pleasantry yours is a fine tool and i see so well how to hold it i wonder if you see how to hold mine but then i am to the neck in prose and just now in the dark interstylar cave all methods and effects wooing me myself in the midst impotent to follow any i look for dawn presently and a full flowing river of expression running whither it wills but these useless seasons above all when a man must continue to spoil paper are infinitely weary  we are in our house after a fashion without furniture tis true camping there like the family after a sale but the bailiff has not yet appeared he will probably come after the place is beautiful beyond dreams some fifty miles of the pacific spread in front deep woods all round a mountain making in the sky a profile of huge trees upon our left about us the little island of our clearing studded with brave old gentlemen or ladies or the twa o them whom we have spared it is a good place to be in night and morning we have theodore rousseaus always a new one hung to amuse us on the walls of the world and the moonthis is our good season we have a moon just nowmakes the night a piece of heaven it amazes me how people can live on in the dirty north yet if you saw our rainy season which is really a caulker for wind wet and darknesshowling showers roaring winds pitblackness at noon you might marvel how we could endure that and we cant but theres a winter everywhere only ours is in the summer mark my words there will be a winter in heavenand in hell cela rentre dans les procédés du bon dieu et vous verrez theres another very good thing about vailima i am away from the little bubble of the literary life it is not all beer and skittles is it by the by my ballads seem to have been dam bad all the crickets sing so in their crickety papers and i have no ghost of an idea on the point myself verse is always to me the unknowable you might tell me how it strikes a professional bard not that it really matters for of course good or bad i dont think i shall get into that galley any more but i should like to know if you join the shrill chorus of the crickets the crickets are the devil in all to you tis a strange thing they seem to rejoice like a strong man in their injustice i trust you got my letter about your browning book in case it missed i wish to say again that your publication of brownings kind letter as an illustration of his character was modest proper and in radiant good tastein witness whereof etc etc       robert louis stevenson     to miss rawlinson      the next is written to a young friend and visitor of bournemouth days    see vol xxiv p 227 on the news of her engagement to mr alfred    spender       vailima apia samoa april 1891  my dear mayi never think of you by any more ceremonial name so i will not pretend there is not much chance that i shall forget you until the time comes for me to forget all this little turmoil in a corner though indeed i have been in several corners of an inconsiderable planet you remain in my mind for a good reason having given me in so short a time the most delightful pleasure i shall remember and you must still be beautiful the truth is you must grow more so or you will soon be less it is not so easy to be a flower even when you bear a flowers name and if i admired you so much and still remember you it is not because of your face but because you were then worthy of it as you must still continue  will you give my heartiest congratulations to mr spender he has my admiration he is a brave man when i was young i should have run away from the sight of you pierced with the sense of my unfitness he is more wise and manly what a good husband he will have to be and youwhat a good wife carry your love tenderly i will never forgive himor youit is in both your handsif the face that once gladdened my heart should be changed into one sour or sorrowful  what a person you are to give flowers it was so i first heard of you and now you are giving the may flower  yes skerryvore has passed it was for us but i wish you could see us in our new home on the mountain in the middle of great woods and looking far out over the pacific when mr spender is very rich he must bring you round the world and let you see it and see the old gentleman and the old lady i mean to live quite a long while yet and my wife must do the same or else i couldnt manage it so you see you will have plenty of time and its a pity not to see the most beautiful places and the most beautiful people moving there and the real stars and moon overhead instead of the tin imitations that preside over london i do not think my wife very well but i am in hopes she will now have a little rest it has been a hard business above all for her we lived four months in the hurricane season in a miserable house overborne with work illfed continually worried drowned in perpetual rain beaten upon by wind so that we must sit in the dark in the evenings and then i ran away and she had a month of it alone things go better now the back of the work is broken and we are still foolish enough to look forward to a little peace i am a very different person from the prisoner of skerryvore the other day i was threeandtwenty hours in an open boat it made me pretty ill but fancy its not killing me halfway it is like a fairy story that i should have recovered liberty and strength and should go round again among my fellowmen boating riding bathing toiling hard with a woodknife in the forest i can wish you nothing more delightful than my fortune in life i wish it you and better if the thing be possible  lloyd is tinkling below me on the typewriter my wife has just left the room she asks me to say she would have written had she been well enough and hopes to do it stillaccept the best wishes of your admirer       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      this letter announces 1 the arrival of mrs thomas stevenson from    sydney to take up her abode in her sons island home now that the    conditions of life there had been made fairly comfortable and 2    the receipt of a letter from me expressing the disappointment felt by    stevensons friends at home at the impersonal and even tedious    character of some portions of the south sea letters that had reached    us as a corrective of this opinion i may perhaps mention here that    there is a certain manyvoyaged mastermariner as well as    masterwriterno less a person than mr joseph conradwho does not    at all share it and prefers in the south seas to treasure    island       vailima april 29th 91  my dear colvini begin again i was awake this morning about halfpast four it was still night but i made my fire which is always a delightful employment and read lockharts scott until the day began to peep it was a beautiful and sober dawn a dovecoloured dawn insensibly brightening to gold i was looking at it some while over the downhill profile of our eastern road when i chanced to glance northward and saw with extraordinary pleasure the sea lying outspread it seemed as smooth as glass and yet i knew the surf was roaring all along the reef and indeed if i had listened i could have heard itand saw the white sweep of it outside matautu  i am out of condition still and can do nothing and toil to be at my pen and see some ink behind me i have taken up again the high woods of ulufanua i still think the fable too fantastic and farfetched but on a rereading fell in love with my first chapter and for good or evil i must finish it it is really good well fed with facts true to the manners and for once in my works rendered pleasing by the presence of a heroine who is pretty miss uma is pretty a fact all my other women have been as ugly as sin and like falconets horse i have just been reading the anecdote in lockhart mortes forbye  news our old house is now half demolished it is to be rebuilt on a new site now we look down upon and through the open posts of it like a birdcage to the woods beyond my poor paulo has lost his father and succeeded to thirty thousand thalers i think he had to go down to the consulate yesterday to send a legal paper got drunk of course and is still this morning in so bemused a condition that our breakfasts all went wrong lafaele is absent at the deathbed of his fair spouse fair she was but not in deed acting as harlot to the wreckers at work on the warships to which society she probably owes her end having fallen off a cliff or been thrust off itinter pocula henry is the same our standby in this transition stage he has been living in apia but the other night he stayed up and sat with us about the chimney in my room it was the first time he had seen a fire in a hearth he could not look at it without smiles and was always anxious to put on another stick we entertained him with the fairy tales of civilisationtheatres london blocks in the street universities the underground newspapers etc and projected once more his visit to sydney if we can manage it will be next christmas i see it will be impossible for me to afford a further journey this winter we have spent since we have been here about £2500 which is not much if you consider we have built on that three houses one of them of some size and a considerable stable made two miles of road some three times cleared many acres of bush made some miles of path planted quantities of food and enclosed a horse paddock and some acres of pig run but tis a good deal of money regarded simply as money k is bosh i have no use for him but we must do what we can with the fellow meanwhile he is goodhumoured and honest but inefficient idle himself the cause of idleness in others grumbling a selfexcuserall the faults in a bundle he owes us thirty weeks servicethe wretched paul about half as much henry is almost the only one of our employés who has a credit  may 17thwell am i ashamed of myself i do not think so i have been hammering letters ever since and got three ready and a fourth about half through all four will go by the mail which is what i wish for so i keep at least my start days and days of unprofitable stubbing and digging and the result still poor as literature lefthanded heavy unillumined but i believe readable and interesting as matter it has been no joke of a hard time and when my task was done i had little taste for anything but blowing on the pipe a few necessary letters filled the bowl to overflowing  my mother has arrived young well and in good spirits by desperate exertions which have wholly floored fanny her room was ready for her and the diningroom fit to eat in it was a famous victory lloyd never told me of your portrait till a few days ago fortunately i had no pictures hung yet and the space over my chimney waits your counterfeit presentment i have not often heard anything that pleased me more your severe head shall frown upon me and keep me to the mark but why has it not come have you been as forgetful as lloyd  18thmiserable comforters are ye all i read your esteemed pages this morning by lamplight and the glimmer of the dawn and as soon as breakfast was over i must turn to and tackle these despised labours some courage was necessary but not wanting there is one thing at least by which i can avenge myself for my drubbing for on one point you seem impenetrably stupid can i find no form of words which will at last convey to your intelligence the fact that these letters were never meant and are not now meant to be other than a quarry of materials from which the book may be drawn there seems something incommunicable in this to me simple idea i know lloyd failed to comprehend it i doubt if he has grasped it now and i despair after all these efforts that you should ever be enlightened still oblige me by reading that form of words once more and see if a light does not break you may be sure after the friendly freedoms of your criticism necessary i am sure and wholesome i know but untimely to the poor labourer in his landslip that mighty little of it will stand  our paul has come into a fortune and wishes to go home to the hie germanie this is a tile on our head and if a shower which is now falling lets up i must go down to apia and see if i can find a substitute of any kind this is from any point of view disgusting above all from that of work for whatever the result the mill has to be kept turning apparently dust and not flour is the proceed well there is gold in the dust which is a fine consolation sincewell i cant help it night or morning i do my darndest and if i cannot charge for merit i must een charge for toil of which i have plenty and plenty more ahead before this cup is drained sweat and hyssop are the ingredients  we are clearing from carruthers road to the pig fence twentyeight powerful natives with catholic medals about their necks all swiping in like trojans long may the sport continue  the invoice to hand ere this goes out i hope to see your expressive but surely not benignant countenance adieu o culler of offensive expressionsand a to be a posy to your ain dear mayfanny seems a little revived again after her spasm of work our books and furniture keep slowly draining up the road in a sad state of scatterment and disrepair i wish the devil had had k by his red beard before he had packed my library odd leaves and sheets and boardsa thing to make a bibliomaniac shed tearsare fished out of odd corners but i am no bibliomaniac praise heaven and i bear up and rejoice when i find anything safe  19thhowever i worked five hours on the brute and finished my letter all the same and couldnt sleep last night by consequence havent had a bad night since i dont know when dreamed a large handsome man a new orleans planter had insulted my wife and do what i pleased i could not make him fight me and woke to find it was the eleventh anniversary of my marriage a letter usually takes me from a week to three days but im sometimes two days on a pagei was once threeand then my friends kick me cestybête i wish letters of that charming quality could be so timed as to arrive when a fellow wasnt working at the truck in question but of course that cant be did not go down last night it showered all afternoon and poured heavy and loud all night  you should have seen our twentyfive popés the samoan phrase for a catholic lay or cleric squatting when the days work was done on the ground outside the verandah and pouring in the rays of fortyeight eyes through the back and the front door of the diningroom while henry and i and the boss pope signed the contract the second boss an old man wore a kilt as usual and a balmoral bonnet with a little tartan edging and the tails pulled off i told him that hat belong to my countrysekotia and he said yes that was the place that he belonged to right enough and then all the papists laughed till the woods rang he was slashing away with a cutlass as he spoke  the pictures20 have decidedly not come they may probably arrive sunday     to miss adelaide boodle      the reference in the first paragraph is to a previous letter    concerning private matters in which stevenson had remonstrated with    his correspondent on what seemed to him her mistaken reasons for a    certain course of conduct       vailima may 1891  my dear adelaidei will own you just did manage to tread on my gouty toe and i beg to assure you with most people i should simply have turned away and said no more my cudgelling was therefore in the nature of a caress or testimonial  god forbid i should seem to judge for you on such a point it was what you seemed to set forth as your reasons that fluttered my old presbyterian spiritfor mind you i am a child of the covenanterswhom i do not love but they are mine after all my fathers and my mothersand they had their merits too and their ugly beauties and grotesque heroisms that i love them for the while i laugh at them but in their name and mine do what you think right and let the world fall that is the privilege and the duty of private persons and i shall think the more of you at the greater distance because you keep a promise to your fellowman your helper and creditor in life by just so much as i was tempted to think the less of you o not much or i would never have been angry when i thought you were the swallower of a tinfoil formula  i must say i was uneasy about my letter not because it was too strong as an expression of my unregenerate sentiments but because i knew full well it should be followed by something kinder and the mischief has been in my health i fell sharply sick in sydney was put aboard the lübeck pretty bad got to vailima hung on a month there and didnt pick up as well as my work needed set off on a journey gained a great deal lost it again and am back at vailima still no good at my necessary work i tell you this for my imperfect excuse that i should not have written you again sooner to remove the bad taste of my last  a road has been called adelaide road it leads from the back of our house to the bridge and thence to the garden and by a bifurcation to the pig pen it is thus much traversed particularly by fanny an oleander the only one of your seeds that prospered in this climate grows there and the name is now some week or ten days applied and published adelaide road leads also into the bush to the banana patch and by a second bifurcation over the left branch of the stream to the plateau and the right hand of the gorges in short it leads to all sorts of good and is besides in itself a pretty winding path bound downhill among big woods to the margin of the stream  what a strange idea to think me a jewhater isaiah and david and heine are good enough for me and i leave more unsaid were i of jew blood i do not think i could ever forgive the christians the ghettos would get in my nostrils like mustard or lit gunpowder just so you as being a child of the presbytery i retaini need not dwell on that the ascendant hand is what i feel most strongly i am bound in and in with my forbears were he one of mine i should not be struck at all by mr moss of bevis marks i should still see behind him moses of the mount and the tables and the shining face we are all nobly born fortunate those who know it blessed those who remember  i am my dear adelaide most genuinely yours       robert louis stevenson  write by return to say you are better and i will try to do the same     to charles baxter      the following refers again to the project of a long genealogical novel    expanded from the original idea of henry shovel       vailima tuesday 19th may 91  my dear charlesi dont know what you think of me not having written to you at all during your illness i find two sheets begun with your name but that is no excuse i am keeping bravely getting about better every day and hope soon to be in my usual fettle my books begin to come and i fell once more on the old bailey session papers i have 1778 1784 and 1786 should you be able to lay hands on any other volumes above all a little later i should be very glad you should buy them for me i particularly want one or two during the course of the peninsular war come to think i ought rather to have communicated this want to bain would it bore you to communicate to that effect with the great man the sooner i have them the better for me tis for henry shovel but henry shovel has now turned into a work called the shovels of newton french including memoirs of henry shovel a private in the peninsular war which work is to begin in 1664 with the marriage of skipper afterwards alderman shovel of bristol henrys greatgreatgrandfather and end about 1832 with his own second marriage to the daughter of his runaway aunt will the public ever stand such an opus gude kens but it tickles me two or three historical personages will just appear judge jeffreys wellington colquhoun grant and i think townsend the runner i know the public wont like it let em lump it then i mean to make it good it will be more like a saga  adieuyours ever affectionately       r l stevenson     to sidney colvin        vailima june 1891  sirto you under your portrait which is in expression your true breathing self and up to now saddens me in time and soon i shall be glad to have it there it is still only a reminder of your absence fanny wept when we unpacked it and you know how little she is given to that mood i was scarce roman myself but that does not counti lift up my voice so readily these are good compliments to the artist21 i write in the midst of a wreck of books which have just come up and have for once defied my labours to get straight the whole floor is filled with them and whats worse most of the shelves forbye and where they are to go to and what is to become of the librarian god knows it is hot tonight and has been airless all day and i am out of sorts and my work sticks the devil fly away with it and me we had an alarm of war since last i wrote my screeds to you and it blew over and is to blow on again and the rumour goes they are to begin by killing all the whites i have no belief in this and should be infinitely sorry if it came to passi do not mean for us that were otiosebut for the poor deluded schoolboys who should hope to gain by such a step  letter resumed june 20thno diary this time why you ask i have only sent out four letters and two chapters of the wrecker yes but to get these i have written 132 pp 66000 words in thirty days 2200 words a day the labours of an elephant god knows what its like and dont ask me but nobody shall say i have spared pains i thought for some time it wouldnt come at all i was days and days over the first letter of the lotdays and days writing and deleting and making no headway whatever till i thought i should have gone bust but it came at last after a fashion and the rest went a thought more easily though i am not so fond as to fancy any better  your opinion as to the letters as a whole is so damnatory that i put them by but there is a hell of a want of money this year and these gilbert island papers being the most interesting in matter and forming a compact whole and being well illustrated i did think of as a possible resource  it would be called    six months in melanesia   two island kings    monarchies   gilbert island kings    monarchies  and i dare say ill think of a better yetand would divide thus      butaritari      i a town asleep    ii the three brothers   iii around our house    iv a tale of a tapu     v the five days festival    vi

whole and treating them as i have asked you and favour me with your damnatory advice i look up at your portrait and it frowns upon me you seem to view me with reproach the expression is excellent fanny wept when she saw it and you know she is not given to the melting mood she seems really better i have a touch of fever again i fancy overwork and today when i have overtaken my letters i shall blow on my pipe tell mrs sitwell i have been playing le chant damour lately and have arranged it after awful trouble rather prettily for two pipes and it brought her before me with an effect scarce short of hallucination i could hear her voice in every note yet i had forgot the air entirely and began to pipe it from notes as something new when i was brought up with a round turn by this reminiscence we are now very much installed the diningroom is done and looks lovely soon we shall begin to photograph and send you our circumstances my room is still a howling wilderness i sleep on a platform in a window and strike my mosquito bar and roll up my bedclothes every morning so that the bed becomes by day a divan a great part of the floor is kneedeep in books yet nearly all the shelves are filled alas it is a place to make a pig recoil yet here are my interminable labours begun daily by lamplight and sometimes not yet done when the lamp has once more to be lighted the effect of pictures in this place is surprising they give great pleasure  june 21sta word more i had my breakfast this morning at 430 my new cook has beaten me and as lloyd says revenged all the cooks in the world i have been hunting them to give me breakfast early since i was twenty and now here comes mr ratke and i have to plead for mercy i cannot stand 430 i am a mere fevered wreck it is now halfpast eight and i can no more and four hours divide me from lunch the devil take the man yesterday it was about 530 which i can stand day before 5 which is bad enough today i give out it is like a london season and as i do not take a siesta once in a month and then only five minutes i am being worn to the bones and look aged and anxious  we have rider haggards brother here as a land commissioner a nice kind of a fellow indeed all the three land commissioners are very agreeable     to e l burlingame      for the result of the suggestion made in the following see    scribners magazine october 1893 p 494       vailima summer 1891  my dear burlingamei find among my grandfathers papers his own reminiscences of his voyage round the north with sir walter eighty years ago labuntur anni they are not remarkably good but he was not a bad observer and several touches seem to me speaking it has occurred to me you might like them to appear in the magazine if you would kindly let me know and tell me how you would like it handled my grandads ms runs to between six and seven thousand words which i could abbreviate of anecdotes that scarce touch sir w would you like this done would you like me to introduce the old gentleman i had something of the sort in my mind and could fill a few columns rather à propos i give you the first offer of this according to your request for though it may forestall one of the interests of my biography the thing seems to me particularly suited for prior appearance in a magazine  i see the first number of the wrecker i thought it went lively enough and by a singular accident the picture is not unlike taiohae  thus we see the age of miracles etcyours very sincerely       r l s  proofs for next mail     to w craibe angus      referring again to the burns exhibition and to his correspondents    request for an autograph in a special copy of the jolly beggars       summer 1891  dear mr angusyou can use my letter as you will the parcel has not come pray heaven the next post bring it safe is it possible for me to write a preface here i will try if you like if you think i must though surely there are rivers in assyria of course you will send me sheets of the catalogue i suppose it the preface need not be long perhaps it should be rather very short be sure you give me your views upon these points also tell me what names to mention among those of your helpers and do remember to register everything else it is not safe  the true place in my view for a monument to fergusson were the churchyard of haddington but as that would perhaps not carry many votes i should say one of the two following sitesfirst either as near the site of the old bedlam as we could get or second beside the cross the heart of his city upon this i would have a fluttering butterfly and i suggest the citation    poor butterfly thy case i mourn  for the case of fergusson is not one to pretend about a more miserable tragedy the sun never shone upon or in consideration of our climate i should rather say refused to brightenyours truly       robert louis stevenson  where burns goes will not matter he is no local poet like your robin the first he is general as the casing air glasgow as the chief city of scottish men would do well but for gods sake dont let it be like the glasgow memorial to knox i remember when i first saw this laughing for an hour by shrewsbury clock       r l s     to h c ide      the following is written to the american land commissioner later    chief justice for a term in samoa whose elder daughter then at    home in the states had been born on a christmas day and    consequently regarded herself as defrauded of her natural rights to a    private anniversary of her own       vailima june 19 1891  dear mr ideherewith please find the document which i trust will prove sufficient in law it seems to me very attractive in its eclecticism scots english and roman law phrases are all indifferently introduced

states of america was born out of all reason upon christmas day and is therefore out of all justice denied the consolation and profit of a proper birthday  and considering that i the said robert louis

satisfactory manner since i can remember  and in case the said annie h ide shall neglect or contravene either of the above conditions i hereby revoke the donation and transfer my rights in the said

and ninetyone      illustration seal       robert louis stevenson  witness lloyd osbourne witness harold watts     to sidney colvin      the misgivings herein expressed about the imminence of a native war    were not realised until two years later and the plans of defence    into which stevenson here enters with characteristic gusto were not    put to the test       vailima june and july 1891  my dear colvini am so hideously in arrears that i know not where to begin however here i am a prisoner in my room unfit for work incapable of reading with interest and trying to catch up a bit we have a guest here a welcome guest my sydney music master whose health broke down and who came with his remarkable simplicity to ask a months lodging he is newly married his wife in the family way beastly time to fall sick i have found by good luck a job for him here which will pay some of his way and in the meantime he is a pleasant guest for he plays the flute with little sentiment but great perfection and endears himself by his simplicity to me especially i am so weary of finding people approach me with precaution pick their words flatter and twitter but the muttons of the good god are not at all afraid of the lion they take him as he comes and he does not biteat least not hard this makes us a party of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 at table deftly waited on by mary carter a very nice sydney girl who served us at a boardinghouse and has since come onhow long she will endure this exile is another story and gauchely waited on by faauma the new lefthanded wife of the famed lafaele a little creature in native dress of course and as beautiful as a bronze candlestick so fine clean and dainty in every limb her arms and her little hips in particular masterpieces the rest of the crew may be stated briefly the great henry simelé still to the front king of the yellow beard rather a disappointmenti am inclined on this point to republican opinions ratke a german cook goodand germanly bad he dont make my kitchen paul now working out his debts outdoor emma a strange weird creaturei suspect from her colour a quarter whitewidow of a white man ugly capable a really good laundress javayes that is the namethey spell it siava but pronounce it and explain it javaher assistant a creature i adore from her plain wholesome breadandbutter beauty an honest almost ugly bright goodnatured face the rest to my sense merely exquisite she comes steering into my room of a morning like mrs nickleby with elaborate precaution unlike her noiseless if i look up from my work she is ready with an explosive smile i generally dont and wait to look at her as she stoops for the bellows and trips tiptoe off again a miracle of successful womanhood in every line i am amused to find plain healthy java pass in my fancy so far before pretty young faauma i observed lloyd the other day to say that java must have been lovely when she was young and i thought it an odd word of a woman in the height of health not yet touched with fat though to be just a little slack of bust  our party you know fanny lloyd my mother belle and the babeas we call himaustin we have now three instruments boehm flageolet flute and bb clarinet and we expect in a few days our piano this is a great pleasure to me the bandmastering the playing and all as soon as i am done with this stage of a letter i shall return not being allowed to play to bandmaster being engaged in an attempt to arrange an air with effect for the three pipes and ill go now by jabers  illustration  july 3rda long pause occasioned first by some days of hard work next by a vile quinseyif that be the way to spell it but today i must write for we have all kinds of larks on hand the wars and rumours of wars begin to take consistency insomuch that we have landed the weapons this morning and inspected the premises with a view to defence of course it will come to nothing but as in all stories of massacres the one you dont prepare for is the one that comes off all our natives think ill of the business none of the whites do according to our natives the demonstration threatened for today or tomorrow is one of vengeance on the whitessmall wonderand if that beginswhere will it stop anyway i dont mean to go down for nothing if i can help it and to amuse you i will tell you our plans  there is the house upper story our weak point is of course the sides ab ah so we propose to place half our garrison in the space hgfd and half in the opposite corner bbcd we shall communicate through the interior there is a watertank in the angle c my mother and austin are to go in the loft the holding of only these two corners and deserting the corner c is for economy and communication two doors being in the sides gf and cd so that any one in the corner c could only communicate or be reinforced by exposure besides we are short of mattresses garrison r l s lloyd fanny king ratkedoubtful he may goemma mary belle weapons eight revolvers and a shot gun and swords galore but were pretty far gone when we come to the swords it has been rather a lark arranging but i find it a bore to write and i doubt it will be cruel stale to read about when alls over and done as it will be ere this goes i fancy far more ere it reaches you  date unknownwell nothing as yet though i dont swear by it yet there has been a lot of trouble and there still is a lot of doubt as to the future and those who sit in the chief seats who are all excellent pleasant creatures are not perhaps the most wise of mankind they actually proposed to kidnap and deport mataafa a scheme which would have loosed the avalanche at once but some human being interfered and choked off this pleasing scheme you ask me in yours just received what will become of us if it comes to a war well if it is a war of the old sort nothing it will mean a little bother and a great deal of theft and more amusement but if it comes to the massacre lark i can only answer with the bell of old bow you are to understand that in my reading of the native character every day that passes is a solid gain they put in the time public speaking so wear out their energy develop points of difference and exacerbate internal illfeeling consequently i feel less apprehension of difficulty now by about a hundredfold all that i stick to is that if war begins there are ten chances to one we shall have it bad the natives have been scurvily used by all the white powers without exception and they labour under the belief of which they cant be cured that they defeated germany this makes an awkward complication  i was extremely vexed to hear you were ill again i hope you are better tis a long time we have known each other now to be sure well well you say you are sure to catch fever in the bush so we do continually but you are to conceive samoa fever as the least formidable malady under heaven implying only a day or so of slight headache and languor and ill humour easily reduced by quinine or antipyrine the hot fever i had was from overexertion and blood poisoning no doubt and irritation of the bladder it went of its own accord and with rest i have had since a bad quinsey which knocked me rather useless for about a week but i stuck to my work with great difficulty and small success  date unknownbut its fast day and july and the rude inclement depth of winter and the thermometer was 68 this morning and a few days ago it was 63 and we have all been perishing with cold all still seems quiet your counterfeit presentments are all round us the pastel over my bed the dewsmith photograph over my door and the celebrity on fannys table my room is now done and looks very gay and chromatic with its blue walls and my coloured lines of books     to sidney colvin      this is the first letter in which stevenson expresses the opinion    which had been forcing itself upon him and which he felt it his duty    in the following year to express publicly in letters to the times of    the unwisdom of the government established under the treaty between    the three powers and the incompetence of the officials appointed to    carry it out       vailima sunday sept 5 1891  my dear colvinyours from lochinver has just come you ask me if i am ever homesick for the highlands and the isles conceive that for the last month i have been living there between 1786 and 1850 in my grandfathers diaries and letters i had to take a rest no use talking so i put in a month over my lives of the stevensons with great pleasure and profit and some advance one chapter and a part drafted the whole promises well chapter i domestic annals chapter ii the northern lights chapter iii the bell rock chapter iv a family of boys chap v the grandfather vi alan stevenson vii thomas stevenson my materials for my greatgrandfather are almost null for my grandfather copious and excellent name a puzzle a scottish family a family of engineers northern lights the engineers of the northern lights a family history advise but it will take long now imagine if i have been homesick for barrahead and island glass and kirkwall and cape wrath and the wells of the pentland firth i could have wept  now for politics i am much less alarmed i believe the malo  raj government will collapse and cease like an overlain infant without a shot fired they have now been months here on their big salariesand cedercrantz whom i specially like as a man has done nearly nothing and the baron who is wellmeaning has done worse they have these large salaries and they have all the taxes they have made scarce a foot of road they have not given a single native a positionall to white men they have scarce laid out a penny on apia and scarce a penny on the king they have forgot they were in samoa or that such a thing as samoans existed and had eyes and some intelligence the chief justice has refused to pay his customs the president proposed to have an expensive house built for himself while the king his master has none i had stood aside and been a loyal and above all a silent subject up to then but now i snap my fingers at their malo it is damned and im damned glad of it and this is not all last wainiu when i sent fanny off to fiji i hear the wonderful news that the chief justice is going to fiji and the colonies to improve his mind i showed my way of thought to his guest count wachtmeister whom i have sent to you with a letterhe will tell you all the news well the chief justice stayed but they said he was to leave yesterday i had intended to go down and see and warn him but the presidents house had come up in the meanwhile and i let them go to their doom which i am only anxious to see swiftly and if it may be bloodlessly fall  thus i have in a way withdrawn my unrewarded loyalty lloyd is down today with moors to call on mataafa the news of the excursion made a considerable row in apia and both the german and the english consuls besought lloyd not to go but he stuck to his purpose and with my approval its a poor thing if people are to give up a pleasure party for a malo that has never done anything for us but draw taxes and is going to go pop and leave us at the mercy of the identical mataafa whom i have not visited for more than a year and who is probably furious  the sense of my helplessness here has been rather bitter i feel it wretched to see this dance of folly and injustice and unconscious rapacity go forward from day to day and to be impotent i was not consultedor only by one man and that on particular points i did not choose to volunteer advice till some pressing occasion i have not even a vote for i am not a member of the municipality  what ails you miserable man to talk of saving material i have a whole world in my head a whole new society to work but i am in no hurry you will shortly make the acquaintance of the island of ulufanua on which i mean to lay several stories the bloody wedding possibly the high woodso its so good the high woods but the story is craziness thats the troublea political story the labour slave etc ulufanua is an imaginary island the name is a beautiful samoan word for the top of a forest ululeaves or hair fanualand the ground or country of the leaves ulufanua the isle of the sea read that verse dactylically and you get the beat the us are like our double oo did ever you hear a prettier word  i do not feel inclined to make a volume of essays22 but if i did and perhaps the idea is goodand any idea is better than the south seashere would be my choice of the scribner articles dreams beggars lanternbearers random memories there was a paper called the old pacific capital in fraser in tullochs time which had merit there were two on fontainebleau in the magazine of art in henleys time i have no idea if theyre any good then theres the emigrant train pulvis et umbra is in a different key and wouldnt hang on with the rest  i have just interrupted my letter and read through the chapter of the high woods that is written a chapter and a bit some sixteen pages really very fetching but what do you wish the story is so wilful so steep so sillyits a hallucination i have outlived and yet i never did a better piece of work horrid and pleasing and extraordinarily true its sixteen pages of the south seas their essence what am i to do lose this little gemfor ill be bold and thats what i think itor go on with the rest which i dont believe in and dont like and which can never make aught but a silly yarn make another end to it ah yes but thats not the way i write the whole tale is implied i never use an effect when i can help it unless it prepares the effects that are to follow thats what a story consists in to make another end that is to make the beginning all wrong the dénouement of a long story is nothing it is just a full close which you may approach and accompany as you pleaseit is a coda not an essential member in the rhythm but the body and end of a short story is bone of the bone and blood of the blood of the beginning well i shall end by finishing it against my judgment that fragment is my delilah golly its good i am not shining by modesty but i do just love the colour and movement of that piece so far as it goes  i was surprised to hear of your fishing and you saw the pharos23 thrice fortunate man i wish i dared go home i would ask the commissioners to take me round for old sakes sake and see all my family pictures once more from the mull of galloway to unst however all is arranged for our meeting in ceylon except the date and the blooming pounds i have heard of an exquisite hotel in the country airy large rooms good cookery not dear we shall have a couple of months there if we can make it out and converse oras my grandfather always saidcommune communings with mr kennedy as to lighthouse repairs he was a fine old fellow but a droll  eveninglloyd has returned peace and war were played before his eyes at heads or tails a german was stopped with levelled guns he raised his whip had it fallen we might have been now in war excuses were made by mataafa himself doubtless the thing was donei mean the stopping of the germana little to show off before lloyd meanwhile  was up here telling how the chief justice was really gone for five or eight weeks and begging me to write to the times and denounce the state of affairs many strong reasons he advanced and lloyd and i have been since his arrival and s departure near half an hour debating what should be done cedercrantz is gone it is not my fault he knows my views on that pointalone of all pointshe leaves me with my mouth sealed yet this is a nice thing that because he is guilty of a fresh offencehis flightthe mouth of the only possible influential witness should be closed i do not like this argument i look like a cad if i do in the mans absence what i could have done in a more manly manner in his presence true but why did he go it is his last sin and i who like the man extremelythat is the wordi love his societyhe is intelligent pleasant even witty a gentlemanand you know how that attachesi loathe to seem to play a base part but the poor nativeswho are like other folk false enough lazy enough not heroes not saintsordinary men damnably misusedare they to suffer because i like cedercrantz and cedercrantz has cut his lucky this is a little tragedy observe wella tragedy i may be right i may be wrong in my judgment but i am in treaty with my honour i know not how it will seem tomorrow lloyd thought the barrier of honour insurmountable and it is an ugly obstacle he cedercrantz will likely meet my wife three days from now may travel back with her will be charming if he does suppose this and suppose him to arrive and find that i have sprung a mineor the nearest approach to it i could findbehind his back my position is pretty yes i am an aristocrat i have the old petty personal view of honour i should blush till i die if i do this yet it is on the cards that i may do it so much i have written you in bed as a man writes or talks in a bittre wahl now i shall sleep and see if i am more clear i will consult the missionaries at leasti place some reliance in m alsoor i should if he were not a partisan but a partisan he is theres a pity to sleep a fund of wisdom in the prostrate body and the fed brain kindly observe r l s in the talons of politics tis funnytis sad nobody but these cursed idiots could have so driven me i cannot bear idiots  my dear colvin i must go to sleep it is long past tena dreadful hour for me and here am i lingering so i feel in the diningroom at the monument talking to you across the table both on our feet and only the two stairs to mount and get to bed and sleep and be waked by dear old georgeto whom i wish my kindest remembrancesnext morning i look round and there is my blue room and my long lines of shelves and the door gaping on a moonless night and no word of s c but his twa portraits on the wall goodbye my dear fellow and goodnight queer place the world  mondayno clearness of mind with the morning i have no guess what i should do tis easy to say that the public duty should brush aside these little considerations of personal dignity so it is that politicians begin and in a month you find them rat and flatter and intrigue with brows of brass i am rather of the old view that a mans first duty is to these little laws the big he does not he never will understand i may be wrong about the chief justice and the baron and the state of samoa i cannot be wrong about the vile attitude i put myself in if i blow the gaff on cedercrantz behind his back  tuesdayone more word about the south seas in answer to a question i observed i have forgotten to answer the tahiti part has never turned up because it has never been written as for telling you where i went or when or anything about honolulu i would rather die that is fair and plain how can anybody care when or how i left honolulu a man of upwards of forty cannot waste his time in communicating matter of that indifference the letters it appears are tedious they would be more tedious still if i wasted my time upon such infantile and suckingbottle details if ever i put in any such detail it is because it leads into something or serves as a transition to tell it for its own sake never the mistake is all through that i have told too much i had not sufficient confidence in the reader and have overfed him and here are you anxious to learn how io colvin suppose it had made a book all such information is given to one glance of an eye by a map with a little dotted line upon it but let us forget this unfortunate affair  wednesdayyesterday i went down to consult clarke who took the view of delay has he changed his mind already i wonder here at least is the news some little while back some men of manonowhat is manonoa samoan rotten borough a small isle of huge political importance heaven knows why where a handful of chiefs make half the trouble in the country some men of manono which is strong mataafa burned down the houses and destroyed the crops of some malietoa neighbours the president went there the other day and landed alone on the island which to give him his due was plucky moreover he succeeded in persuading the folks to come up and be judged on a particular day in apia that day they did not come but did come the next and to their vast surprise were given six months imprisonment and clapped in gaol those who had accompanied them cried to them on the streets as they were marched to prison shall we rescue you the condemned marching in the hands of thirty men with loaded rifles cried out no and the trick was done but it was ardently believed a rescue would be attempted the gaol was laid about with armed men day and night but there was some question of their loyalty and the commandant of the forces a very nice young beardless swede became nervous and conceived a plan how if he should put dynamite under the gaol and in case of an attempted rescue blow up prison and all he went to the president who agreed he went to the american manofwar for the dynamite and machine was refused and got it at last from the wreckers the thing began to leak out and there arose a muttering in town people had no fancy for amateur explosions for one thing for another it did not clearly appear that it was legal the men had been condemned to six months prison which they were peaceably undergoing they had not been condemned to death and lastly it seemed a somewhat advanced example of civilisation to set before barbarians the mutter in short became a storm and yesterday while i was down a cutter was chartered and the prisoners were suddenly banished to the tokelaus who has changed the sentence we are going to stir in the dynamite matter we do not want the natives to fancy us consenting to such an outrage  fanny has returned from her trip and on the whole looks better the high woods are under way and their name is now the beach of falesá and the yarn is cured i have about thirty pages of it done it will be fifty to seventy i suppose no supernatural trick at all and escaped out of it quite easily cant think why i was so stupid for so long mighty glad to have fanny back to this hell of the south seas as the german captain called it what will cedercrantz think when he comes back to do him justice had he been here this manono hash would not have been  here is a pretty thing when fanny was in fiji all the samoa and tokelau folks were agog about our flash house but the whites had never heard of it       robert louis stevenson       author of the beach of falesá     to sidney colvin       vailima sept 28 1891  my dear colvinsince i last laid down my pen i have written and rewritten the beach of falesá something like sixty thousand words of sterling domestic fiction the story you will understand is only half that length and now i dont want to write any more again for ever or feel so and ive got to overhaul it once again to my sorrow i was all yesterday revising and found a lot of slacknesses and what is worse in this kind of thing some literaryisms one of the puzzles is this it is a first person storya trader telling his own adventure in an island when i began i allowed myself a few liberties because i was afraid of the end now the end proved quite easy and could be done in the pace so the beginning remains about a quarter tone out in places but i have rather decided to let it stay so the problem is always delicate it is the only thing that worries me in first person tales which otherwise quo alan set better wi my genius there is a vast deal of fact in the story and some pretty good comedy it is the first realistic south sea story i mean with real south sea character and details of life everybody else who has tried that i have seen got carried away by the romance and ended in a kind of sugar candy sham epic and the whole effect was lostthere was no etching no human grin consequently no conviction now i have got the smell and look of the thing a good deal you will know more about the south seas after you have read my little tale than if you had read a library as to whether any one else will read it i have no guess i am in an off time but there is just the possibility it might make a hit for the yarn is good and melodramatic and there is quite a love affairfor me and mr wiltshire the narrator is a huge lark though i say it but there is always the exotic question and everything the life the place the dialectstraders talk which is a strange conglomerate of literary expressions and english and american slang and beach de mar or native englishthe very trades and hopes and fears of the characters are all novel and may be found unwelcome to that great hulking bullering whale the public  since i wrote i have been likewise drawing up a document to send in to the president it has been dreadfully delayed not by me but today they swear it will be sent in a list of questions about the dynamite report are herein laid before him and considerations suggested why he should answer  october 5thever since my last snatch i have been much chivied about over the president business his answer has come and is an evasion accompanied with schoolboy insolence and we are going to try to answer it i drew my answer and took it down yesterday but one of the signatories wants another paragraph added which i have not yet been able to draw and as to the wisdom of which i am not yet convinced  next day oct 7th the right daywe are all in rather a muddled state with our president affair i do loathe politics but at the same time i cannot stand by and have the natives blown in the air treacherously with dynamite they are still quiet how long this may continue i do not know though of course by mere prescription the government is strengthened and is probably insured till the next taxes fall due but the unpopularity of the whites is growing my native overseer the great henry simelé announced today that he was weary of whites upon the beach all too proud said this veracious witness one of the proud ones had threatened yesterday to cut off his head with a bush knife these are native outrages honour bright and setting theft aside in which the natives are active this is the main stream of irritation the natives are generally courtly far from always civil but really gentle and with a strong sense of honour of their own and certainly quite as much civilised as our dynamiting president  we shall be delighted to see kipling24 i go to bed usually about halfpast eight and my lamp is out before ten i breakfast at six we may say roughly we have no soda water on the island and just now truthfully no whisky i have heard the chimes at midnight now no more i guess butfanny and i as soon as we can get coins for it are coming to europe not to england i am thinking of royat bar wars if not perhaps the apennines might give us a mountain refuge for two months or three in summer how is that for high but the money must be all in hand first  october 13thhow am i to describe my life these last few days i have been wholly swallowed up in politics a wretched business with fine elements of farce in it too which repay a man in passing involving many dark and many moonlight rides secret counsels which are at once divulged sealed letters which are read aloud in confidence to the neighbours and a mass of fudge and fun which would have driven me crazy ten years ago and now makes me smile  on friday henry came and told us he must leave and go to my poor old family in savaii why i do not quite knowbut i suspect to be tattooedif so then probably to be married and we shall see him no more i told him he must do what he thought his duty we had him to lunch drank his health and he and i rode down about twelve when i got down i sent my horse back to help bring down the family later my own afternoon was cut out for me my last draft for the president had been objected to by some of the signatories i stood out and one of our small number accordingly refused to sign him i had to go and persuade which went off very well after the first hottish moments you have no idea how stolid my temper is now by about five the thing was done and we sat down to dinner at the chinamansthe verrey or doyen of apiagurr and i at each end as hosts gurrs wifefanua late maid of the village her adopted father and mother seumanu and faatulia fanny belle lloyd austin and henry simelé his last appearance henry was in a kilt of grey shawl with a blue jacket white shirt and black necktie and looked like a dark genteel guest in a highland shootingbox seumanu opposite fanny next g is chief of apia a rather big gun in this place looking like a large fatted military englishman bar the colour faatulia next me is a bigger chief than her husband henry is a chief toohis chief name iiga eeeenga he has not yet taken because of his youth we were in fine society and had a pleasant mealtime with lots of fun then to the operai beg your pardon i mean the circus we occupied the first row in the reserved seats and there in the row behind were all our friendscaptain foss and his captainlieutenant three of the american officers very nice fellows the dr etc so we made a fine show of what an embittered correspondent of the local paper called the shoddy aristocracy of apia and you should have seen how we carried on and how i clapped and captain foss hollered wunderschön and threw himself forward in his seat and how we all in fact enjoyed ourselves like schoolchildren austin not a shade more than his neighbours then the circus broke up and the party went home but i stayed down having business on the morrow  yesterday october 12th great news reaches me and lloyd and i with the mail just coming in must leave all saddle and ride down true enough the president had resigned sought to resign his presidency of the council and keep his advisership to the king given way to the consuls objections and resigned allthen fell out with them about the disposition of the funds and was now trying to resign from his resignation sad little president so trim to look at and i believe so kind to his little wife not only so but i meet dunnet on the beach dunnet calls me in consultation and we make with infinite difficulty a draft of a petition to the king then to dinner at moorss a very merry meal interrupted before it was over by the arrival of the committee slight sketch of procedure agreed upon self appointed spokesman and the deputation sets off walk all through matafele all along mulinuu come to the kings house he has verbally refused to see us in answer to our letter swearing he is gasegase chief sickness not common mans and indeed we see him inside in bed it is a miserable low house better houses by the dozen in the little hamlet tanugamanono of bushmen on our way to vailima and the presidents house in process of erection just opposite we are told to return tomorrow i refuse and at last we are very sourly received sit on the mats and i open out through a very poor interpreter and sometimes hampered by unacceptable counsels from my backers i can speak fairly well in a plain way now c asked me to write out my harangue for him this morning i have done so and couldnt get it near as good i suppose talking and interpreting i was twenty minutes or half an hour on the deck then his majesty replied in the dying whisper of a big chief a few words of rejoinder approving and the deputation withdrew rather well satisfied  a few days ago this intervention would have been a deportable offence not now i bet i would like them to try a little way back along mulinuu mrs gurr met us with her husbands horse and he and she and lloyd and i rode back in a heavenly moonlight here ends a chapter in the life of an island politician catch me at it again tis easy to go in but it is not a pleasant trade i have had a good team as good as i could get on the beach but what trouble even so and what fresh troubles shaping but i have on the whole carried all my points i believe all but one and on that which did not concern me i had no right to interfere i am sure you would be amazed if you knew what a good hand i am at keeping my temper talking people over and giving reasons which are not my reasons but calculated for the meridian of the particular objection so soon does falsehood await the politician in his whirling path     to henry james      stevenson had again been reading mr jamess lesson of the master    adela chart is the heroine of the second story in that collection    called the marriages       vailima october 1891  my dear henry jamesfrom this perturbed and hunted being expect but a line and that line shall be but a whoop for adela o shes delicious delicious i could live and die with adeladie rather the better of the two you never did a straighter thing and never will  david balfour second part of kidnapped is on the stocks at last and is not bad i think as for the wrecker its a machine you knowdont expect aught elsea machine and a police machine but i believe the end is one of the most genuine butcheries in literature and we point to our machine with a modest pride as the only police machine without a villain our criminals are a most pleasing crew and leave the dock with scarce a stain upon their character  what a different line of country to be trying to draw adela and trying to write the last four chapters of the wrecker heavens its like two centuries and ours is such rude transpontine business aiming only at a certain fervour of conviction and sense of energy and violence in the men and yours is so neat and bright and of so exquisite a surface seems dreadful to send such a book to such an author but your name is on the list and we do modestly ask you to consider the chapters on the norah creina with the study of captain nares and the forementioned last four with their brutality of substance and the curious and perhaps unsound technical manoeuvre of running the story together to a point as we go along the narrative becoming more succinct and the details fining off with every pagesworn affidavit of       r l s  no person now alive has beaten adela i adore adela and her maker sic subscrib       robert louis stevenson       a sublime poem to follow    adela adela adela chart   what have you done to my elderly heart   of all the ladies of paper and ink   i count you the paragon call you the pink   the word of your brother depicts you in part   you raving maniac adela chart   but in all the asylums that cumber the ground   so delightful a maniac was neer to be found    i pore on you dote on you clasp you to heart   i laud love and laugh at you adela chart   and thank my dear maker the while i admire   that i can be neither your husband nor sire    your husbands your sires were a difficult part   youre a byway to suicide adela chart   but to read of depicted by exquisite james   o sure youre the flower and quintessence of dames       r l s       eructavit cor meum  my heart was inditing a goodly matter about adela chart    though oft ive been touched by the volatile dart   to none have i grovelled but adela chart   there are passable ladies no question in art   but where is the marrow of adela chart    i dreamed that to tyburn i passed in the cart   i dreamed i was married to adela chart   from the first i awoke with a palpable start   the second dumbfoundered me adela chart  another verse bursts from me you see no end to the violence of the muse     to e l burlingame       vailima october 8th 1891  my dear burlingameall right you shall have the tales of my grandfather soon but i guess well try and finish off the wrecker first a propos of whom please send some advanced sheets to cassellsaway ahead of youso that they may get a dummy out  do you wish to illustrate my grandfather he mentions as excellent a portrait of scott by basil halls brother i dont think i ever saw this engraved would it not if you could get track of it prove a taking embellishment i suggest this for your consideration and inquiry a new portrait of scott strikes me as good there is a hard tough constipated old portrait of my grandfather hanging in my aunts house mrs alan stevenson 16 st leonards terrace chelsea which has never been engravedthe better portrait josephs bust has been reproduced i believe twiceand which i am sure my aunt would let you have a copy of the plate could be of use for the book when we get so far and thus to place it in the magazine might be an actual saving  i am swallowed up in politics for the first i hope for the last time in my sublunary career it is a painful thankless trade but one thing that came up i could not pass in silence much drafting addressing deputationising has eaten up all my time and again to my contrition i leave you wreckerless as soon as the mail leaves i tackle it straightyours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to e l burlingame        vailima october 1891  my dear burlingamethe time draws nigh the mail is near due and i snatch a moment of collapse so that you may have at least some sort of a scratch of note along with the    \ end    \ of     \ the      \ wrecker     hurray  which i mean to go herewith it has taken me a devil of a pull but i think its going to be ready if i did not know you were on the stretch waiting for it and trembling for your illustrations i would keep it for another finish but things being as they are i will let it go the best way i can get it i am now within two pages of the end of chapter xxv which is the last chapter the end with its gathering up of loose threads being the dedication to low and addressed to him this is my last and best expedient for the knotting up of these loose cards tis possible i may not get that finished in time in which case youll receive only chapters xxii to xxv by this mail which is all that can be required for illustration  i wish you would send me memoirs of baron marbot french introduction to the study of the history of language strong logeman  wheeler principles of psychology william james morris  magnussons saga library any volumes that are out george merediths one of our conquerors là bas by huysmans french oconnor morriss great commanders of modern times lifes handicap by kipling of taines origines de la france contemporaine i have only as far as la révolution vol iii if another volume is out please add that there is for a bookbox  i hope you will like the end i think it is rather strong meat i have got into such a deliberate dilatory expansive turn that the effort to compress this last yarn was unwelcome but the longest yarn has to come to an end some time please look it over for carelessnesses and tell me if it had any effect upon your jaded editorial mind ill see if ever i have time to add more  i add to my bookbox list adams historical essays the plays of a w pineroall that have appeared and send me the rest in course as they do appear noughts and crosses by q robertsons scotland under her early kings  sundaythe deed is done didst thou not hear a noise the end has been written to this endless yarn and i am once more a free man what will he do with it     to sidney colvin        vailima monday october 24th  my dear carthew25see what i have written but its colvin im afteri have written two chapters about thirty pages of wrecker since the mail left which must be my excuse and the bother ive had with it is not to be imagined you might have seen me the day before yesterday weighing british sovs and chili dollars to arrange my treasure chest and there was such a calculation not for that only but for the ships position and distances whenbut i am not going to tell you the yarnand then as my arithmetic is particularly lax lloyd had to go over all my calculations and then as i had changed the amount of money he had to go over all his as to the amount of the lay and altogether a bank could be run with less effusion of figures than it took to shore up a single chapter of a measly yarn however its done and i have but one more or at the outside two to do and i am free and can do any damn thing i like  before falling on politics i shall give you my day awoke somewhere about the first peep of day came gradually to and had a turn on the verandah before 555 when the child an enormous wallis islander brings me an orange at 6 breakfast 610 to work which lasts till at 1030 austin comes for his history lecture this is rather dispiriting but education must be gone about in faithand charity both of which pretty nigh failed me today about of all things carthage 11 luncheon after luncheon in my mothers room i read chapter xxiii of the wrecker then belle lloyd and i go up and make music furiously till about 2 i suppose when i turn into work again till 4 fool from 4 to halfpast tired out and waiting for the bath hour 430 bath 440 eat two heavenly mangoes on the verandah and see the boys arrive with the packhorses 5 dinner smoke chat on verandah then hand of cards and at last at 8 come up to my room with a pint of beer and a hard biscuit which i am now consuming and as soon as they are consumed i shall turn in  such are the innocent days of this ancient and outworn sportsman today there was no weeding usually there is however edged in somewhere my books for the moment are a crib to phædo and the second book of montaigne and a little while back i was reading frederic harrison choice of books etcvery good indeed a great deal of sense and knowledge in the volume and some very true stuff contra carlyle about the eighteenth century a hideous idea came over me that perhaps harrison is now getting old perhaps you are perhaps i am oh this infidelity must be stared firmly down i am about twentythreesay twentyeight you about thirty or byr lady thirtyfour and as harrison belongs to the same generation there is no good bothering about him  here has just been a fine alert i gave my wife a dose of chlorodyne something wrong says she nonsense said i embrocation said she i smelt it andit smelt very funny i think its just gone bad and tomorrow will tell proved to be so  wednesdayhistory of tuesdaywoke at usual time very little work for i was tired and had a job for the eveningto write parts for a new instrument a violin lunch chat and up to my place to practise but there was no practising for memy flageolet was gone wrong and i had to take it all to pieces clean it and put it up again as this is a most intricate jobthe thing dissolves into seventeen separate members most of these have to be fitted on their individual springs as fine as needles and sometimes two at once with the springs shoving different waysit took me till two then lloyd and i rode forth on our errands first to motootua where we had a really instructive conversation on weeds and grasses thence down to apia where we bought a fresh bottle of chlorodyne and conversed on politics  my visit to the king which i thought at the time a particularly nugatory and even schoolboy step and only consented to because i had held the reins so tight over my little band before has raised a deuce of a rownew proclamation no one is to interview the sacred puppet without consuls permission two days notice and an approved interpreterread i suppose spy then back i should have said i was trying the new horse a tallish piebald bought from the circus he proved steady and safe but in very bad condition and not so much the wild arab steed of the desert as had been supposed the height of his back after commodious jack astonished me and i had a great consciousness of exercise and florid action as i posted to his long emphatic trot we had to ride back easy even so he was hot and blown and when we set a boy to lead him to and fro our last character for sanity perished we returned just neat for dinner and in the evening our violinist arrived a young lady no great virtuoso truly but plucky industrious and a good reader and we played five pieces with huge amusement and broke up at nine this morning i have read a splendid piece of montaigne written this page of letter and now turn to the wrecker  wednesdaynovember 16th or 17thand i am ashamed to say mail day the wrecker is finished that is the best of my news it goes by this mail to scribners and i honestly think it a good yarn on the whole and of its measly kind the part that is genuinely good is nares the american sailor that is a genuine figure had there been more nares it would have been a better book but of course it didnt set up to be a book only a long tough yarn with some pictures of the manners of today in the greater worldnot the shoddy sham world of cities clubs and colleges but the world where men still live a mans life the worst of my news is the influenza apia is devastate the shops closed a ball put off etc as yet we have not had it at vailima and who knows we may escape none of us go down but of course the boys come and go  your letter had the most wonderful i told you so i ever heard in the course of my life why you madman i wouldnt change my present installation for any post dignity honour or advantage conceivable to me it fills the bill i have the loveliest time and as for wars and rumours of wars you surely know enough of me to be aware that i like that also a thousand times better than decrepit peace in middlesex i do not quite like politics i am too aristocratic i fear for that god knows i dont care who i chum with perhaps like sailors best but to go round and sue and sneak to keep a crowd togethernever my imagination which is not the least damped by the idea of having my head cut off in the bush recoils aghast from the idea of a life like gladstones and the shadow of the newspaper chills me to the bone hence my late eruption was interesting but not what i like all else suits me in this killed a mosquito a1 abode  about politics a determination was come to by the president that he had been an idiot emissaries came to gurr and me to kiss and be friends my man proposed i should have a personal interview i said it was quite useless i had nothing to say i had offered him the chance to inform me had pressed it on him and had been very unpleasantly received and now time was then it was decided that i was to be made a culprit against germany the german captaina delightful fellow and our constant visitorwrote to say that as a german officer he could not come even to say farewell we all wrote back in the most friendly spirit telling him politely that some of these days he would be sorry and we should be delighted to see our friend again since then i have seen no german shadow  mataafa has been proclaimed a rebel the president did this act and then resigned by singular good fortune mataafa has not yet moved no thanks to our idiot governors they have shot their bolt they have made a rebel of the only man to their own knowledge on the report of their own spy who held the rebel party in check and having thus called on war to fall they can do no more sit equally expertes of vis and counsel regarding their handiwork it is always a cry with these folks that he mataafa had no ammunition i always said it would be found and we know of five boatloads that have found their way to malie already where there are traders there will be ammunition aphorism by r l s  now what am i to do next  lives of the stevensons historia samoae a history for children fiction i have had two hard months at fiction i want a change stevensons i am expecting some more material perhaps better wait samoa rather tempting might be useful to the islandsand to me for it will be written in admirable temper i have never agreed with any party and see merits and excuses in all should do it if i did very slackly and easily as if half in conversation history for children this flows from my lessons to austin no book is any good the best i have seen is freemans old english history but his style is so rasping and a child can learn more if hes clever i found my sketch of general aryan history given in conversation to have been practically correctat least what i mean is freeman had very much the same stuff in his early chapters only not so much and i thought not so well placed and the child remembered some of it now the difficulty is to give this general idea of main place growth and movement it is needful to tack it on a yarn now scotch is the only history i know it is the only history reasonably represented in my library it is a very good one for my purpose owing to two civilisations having been face to face throughoutor rather roman civilisation face to face with our ancient barbaric life and government down to yesterday to 1750 anyway but the tales of a grandfather stand in my way i am teaching them to austin now and they have all scotts defects and all scotts hopeless merit i cannot compete with that and yet so far as regards teaching history how he has missed his chances i think ill try i really have some historic sense i feel that in my bones then theres another thing scott never knew the highlands he was always a borderer he has missed that whole long strange pathetic story of our savages and besides his style is not very perspicuous to childhood gad i think ill have a flutter buridans ass whither to go what to attack must go to other letters shall add to this if i have time     to w craibe angus        vailima samoa november 1891  my dear mr angusherewith the invaluable sheets they came months after your letter and i trembled but here they are and i have scrawled my vile name on them and thocht shame as i did it i am expecting the sheets of your catalogue so that i may attack the preface please give me all the time you can the sooner the better you might even send me early proofs as they are sent out to give me more incubation i used to write as slow as judgment now i write rather fast but i am still a slow study and sit a long while silent on my eggs unconscious thought there is the only method macerate your subject let it boil slow then take the lid off and look inand there your stuff is good or bad but the journalists method is the way to manufacture lies it is willworshipif you know the luminous quaker phrase and the will is only to be brought in the field for study and again for revision the essential part of work is not an act it is a state  i do not know why i write you this trash  many thanks for your handsome dedication i have not yet had time to do more than glance at mrs begg it looks interestingyours very truly       robert louis stevenson     to miss annie h ide        vailima samoa november 1891  my dear louisayour picture of the church the photograph of yourself and your sister and your very witty and pleasing letter came all in a bundle and made me feel i had my moneys worth for that birthday i am now i must be one of your nearest relatives exactly what we are to each other i do not know i doubt if the case has ever happened beforeyour papa ought to know and i dont believe he does but i think i ought to call you in the meanwhile and until we get the advice of counsel learned in the law my namedaughter well i was extremely pleased to see by the church that my namedaughter could draw by the letter that she was no fool and by the photograph that she was a pretty girl which hurts nothing see how virtues are rewarded my first idea of adopting you was entirely charitable and here i find that i am quite proud of it and of you and that i chose just the kind of namedaughter i wanted for i can draw too or rather i mean to say i could before i forgot how and i am very far from being a fool myself however much i may look it and i am as beautiful as the day or at least i once hoped that perhaps i might be going to be and so i might so that you see we are well met and peers on these important points i am very glad also that you are older than your sister so should i have been if i had had one so that the number of points and virtues which you have inherited from your namefather is already quite surprising  i wish you would tell your fathernot that i like to encourage my rivalthat we have had a wonderful time here of late and that they are having a cold day on mulinuu and the consuls are writing reports and i am writing to the times and if we dont get rid of our friends this time i shall begin to despair of everything but my namedaughter  you are quite wrong as to the effect of the birthday on your age from the moment the deed was registered as it was in the public press with every solemnity the 13th of november became your own and only birthday and you ceased to have been born on christmas day ask your father i am sure he will tell you this is sound law you are thus become a month and twelve days younger than you were but will go on growing older for the future in the regular and human manner from one 13th november to the next the effect on me is more doubtful i may as you suggest live for ever i might on the other hand come to pieces like the onehorse shay at a moments notice doubtless the step was risky but i do not the least regret that which enables me to sign myself your revered and delighted namefather       robert louis stevenson     to charles baxter        vailima november 1891  dear charlesafter dealing with some matters of business i believe thats a by this time i suppose you will have heard from mcclure and the beach of falesá will be decided on for better for worse the end of the wrecker goes by this mail an awfae relief i am now free and can do what i please what do i please i kenna ill bide a wee theres a childs history in the wind and theres my grandfathers life begun and theres a histry of samoa in the last four or five years beguntheres a kind of sense to this book it may help the samoans it may help me for i am bound on the altar here for antigermanism then theres the pearl fisher about a quarter done and theres various short stories in various degrees of incompleteness deil theres plenty grist but the mills unco slaw tomorrow or next day when the mails through ill attack one or other or maybe something else all these schemes begin to laugh at me for the days far through and i believe the pen grows heavy however i believe the wrecker is a good yarn of its poor sort and it is certainly well nourished with facts no realist can touch me there for by this time i do begin to know something of life in the xixth century which no novelist either in france or england seems to know much of you must have great larks over masonry youre away up in the ranks now and according to works that i have read doubtless design assassinations but i am an outsider and i have a certain liking for a light unto my path which would deter me from joining the rank and file of so vast and dim a confraternity at your altitude it becomes of course amusing and perhaps useful yes i remember the ljr26 and the constitution and my homily on liberty and yours on reverence which was never writtenso i never knew what reverence was i remember i wanted to write justice also but i forget who had the billet my dear papa was in a devil of a taking and i had to go and lunch at ferriers in a strangely begrutten state which was infra dig for a homilist on liberty it was about four i suppose that we met in the lothian roadhad we the price of two bitters between us questionable  your bookseller i have lost his letter i mean the maid has arranging my room and so have to send by you wrote me a letter about old bailey papers gosh i near swarfed damd man i near had deed ot its only yin or twa volumes i want say 500 or 1000 pages of the stuff and the worthy man much doubting proposed to bury me in volumes please allay his rage and apologise that i have not written him direct his note was civil and purposelike and please send me a copy of henleys book of verses mine has disappeared       r l s     to sidney colvin        nov 25th 1891  my dear colvin my dear colvini wonder how often im going to write it in spite of the loss of three days as i have to tell and a lot of weeding and cacao planting i have finished since the mail left four chapters fortyeight pages of my samoa history it is true that the first three had been a good deal drafted two years ago but they had all to be written and rewritten and the fourth chapter is all new chapter i elements of discordnative ii elements of discordforeign iii the success of laupepa iv brandeis v will probably be called the rise of mataafa vi furor consularisa devil of a long chapter vii stuebel the pacificator viii government under the treaty of berlin ix practical suggestions say threesixths of it are done maybe more by this mail five chapters should go and that should be a good half of it say sixty pages and if you consider that i sent by last mail the end of the wrecker coming on for seventy or eighty pages and the mail before that the entire tale of the beach of falesá  i do not think i can be accused of idleness this is my season i often work six and seven and sometimes eight hours and the same day i am perhaps weeding or planting for an hour or two moreand i dare say you know what hard work weeding isand it all agrees with me at this time of the yearlikelike idleness if a man of my years could be idle  my first visit to apia was a shock to me every second person the ghost of himself and the place reeking with infection but i have not got the thing yet and hope to escape this shows how much stronger i am think of me flitting through a town of influenza patients seemingly unscathed we are all on the cacao planting  the next day my wife and i rode over to the german plantation vailele whose manager is almost the only german left to speak to us seventy labourers down with influenza it is a lovely ride halfway down our mountain towards apia then turn to the right ford the river and three miles of solitary grass and cocoa palms to where the sea beats and the wild wind blows unceasingly about the plantation house on the way down fanny said now what would you do if you saw colvin coming up  next day we rode down to apia to make calls  yesterday the mail came and the fat was in the fire  nov 29th book27 all right i must say i like your order and the papers are some of them up to dick and no mistake i agree with you the lights seem a little turned down the truth is i was far through if you understand scots and came none too soon to the south seas where i was to recover peace of body and mind no man but myself knew all my bitterness in those days remember that the next time you think i regret my exile and however low the lights are the stuff is true and i believe the more effective after all what i wish to fight is the best fought by a rather cheerless presentation of the truth the world must return some day to the word duty and be done with the word reward there are no rewards and plenty duties and the sooner a man sees that and acts upon it like a gentleman or a fine old barbarian the better for himself  there is my usual puzzle about publishers chatto ought to have it as he has all the other essays these all belong to me and chatto publishes on terms longman has forgotten the terms we are on let him look up our first correspondence and he will see i reserved explicitly as was my habit the right to republish as i choose had the same arrangement with henley magazine of art and with tulloch frasersfor any necessary note or preface it would be a real service if you would undertake the duty yourself i should love a preface by you as short or as long as you choose three sentences thirty pages the thing i should like is your name and the excuse of my great distance seems sufficient i shall return with this the sheets corrected as far as i have them the rest i will leave if you will to you entirely let it be your book and disclaim what you dislike in the preface you can say it was at my eager prayer i should say i am the less willing to pass chatto over because he behaved the other day in a very handsome manner he asked leave to reprint damien i gave it to him as a present explaining i could receive no emolument for a personal attack and he took out my share of profits and sent them in my name to the leper fund i could not bear after that to take from him any of that class of books which i have always given him tell him the same terms will do clark to print uniform with the others  i have lost all the days since this letter began rehandling chapter iv of the samoa racket i do not go in for literature address myself to sensible people rather than to sensitive and indeed it is a kind of journalism i have no right to dally if it is to help it must come soon in two months from now it shall be done and should be published in the course of march i propose cassell gets it i am going to call it a footnote to history eight years of trouble in samoa i believe i recoil from serious names they seem so much too pretentious for a pamphlet it will be about the size of treasure island i believe of course as you now know my case of conscience cleared itself off and i began my intervention directly to one of the parties the other the chief justice i am to inform of my book the first occasion god knows if the book will do any goodor harm but i judge it right to try there is one mans life certainly involved and it may be all our lives i must not stand and slouch but do my best as best i can but you may conceive the difficulty of a history extending to the present week at least and where almost all the actors upon all sides are of my personal acquaintance the only way is to judge slowly and write boldly and leave the issue to fate i am far indeed from wishing to confine myself to creative work that is a loss the other repairs the one chance for a man and above all for one who grows elderly ahem is to vary drainage and repair that is the one thing i understandthe cultivation of the shallow solum of my brain but i would rather from soon on be released from the obligation to write in five or six years this plantationsuppose it and us still to existshould pretty well support us and pay wages not before and already the six years seem long to me if literature were but a pastime  i have interrupted myself to write the necessary notification to the chief justice  i see in looking up longmans letter that it was as usual the letter of an obliging gentleman so do not trouble him with my reminder i wish all my publishers were not so nice and i have a fourth and a fifth baying at my heels but for these of course they must go wanting  dec 2ndno answer from the chief justice which is like him but surely very wrong in such a case the lunch bell i have been off work playing patience and weeding all morning yesterday and the day before i drafted eleven and revised nine pages of chapter v and the truth is i was extinct by lunchtime and played patience sourly the rest of the day tomorrow or next day i hope to go in again and win lunch 2nd bell  dec 2nd afternooni have kept up the idleness blew on the pipe to belles piano then had a ride in the forest all by my nainsel back and piped again and now dinner nearing take up this sheet with nothing to say the weird figure of faauma is in the room washing my windows in a black lavalava kilt with a red handkerchief hanging from round her neck between her breasts not another stitch her hair close cropped and oiled when she first came here she was an angelic little stripling but she is now in full floweror halfflowerand grows buxom as i write i hear her wet cloth moving and grunting with some industry for i had a word this day with her husband on the matter of work and mealtime when she is always late and she has a vague reverence for papa as she and her enormous husband address me when anything is wrong her husband is lafaele sometimes called the archangel of whom i have writ you often rest of our household talolo cook pulu kitchen boy good steady industrious lads henry back again from savaii where his love affair seems not to have prospered with what looks like a spearwound in the back of his head of which mr reticence says nothing simi manuele and two other labourers outdoors lafaele is provost of the livestock whereof now three milkcows one bullcalf one heifer jack macfarlane the mare harold tifaga jack donald and edinburghseven horseso and the stallioneight horses five cattle total if my arithmetic be correct thirteen head of beasts i dont know how the pigs stand or the ducks or the chickens but we get a good many eggs and now and again a duckling or a chickling for the table the pigs are more solemn and appear only on birthdays and sich  monday dec 7on friday morning about eleven 1500 cacao seeds arrived and we set to and toiled from twelve that day to six and went to bed pretty tired next day i got about an hour and a half at my history and was at it again by 810 and except an hour for lunch kept at it till four pm yesterday i did some history in the morning and slept most of the afternoon and today being still averse from physical labour and the mail drawing nigh drew out of the squad and finished for press the fifth chapter of my history fiftynine pages in one month which you will allow me to say is a devil of a large order it means at least 177 pages of writing 89000 words and hours going to and fro among my notes however this is the way it has to be done the job must be done fast or it is of no use and it is a curious yarn honestly i think people should be amused and convinced if they could be at the pains to look at such a damned outlandish piece of machinery which of course they wont and much i care  when i was filling baskets all saturday in my dull mulish way perhaps the slowest worker there surely the most particular and the only one that never looked up or knocked off i could not but think i should have been sent on exhibition as an example to young literary men here is how to learn to write might be the motto you should have seen us the verandah was like an irish bog our hands and faces were bedaubed with soil and faauma was supposed to have struck the right note when she remarked à propos of nothing too much eleele soil for me the cacao you must understand has to be planted at first in baskets of plaited cocoaleaf from four to ten natives were plaiting these in the woodshed four boys were digging up soil and bringing it by the boxful to the verandah lloyd and i and belle and sometimes s who came to bear a hand were filling the baskets removing stones and lumps of clay austin and faauma carried them when full to fanny who planted a seed in each and then set them packed close in the corners of the verandah from twelve on friday till five pm on saturday we planted the first 1500 and more than 700 of a second lot you cannot dream how filthy we were and we were all properly tired they are all at it again today bar belle and me not required and glad to be out of it the chief justice has not yet replied and i have news that he received my letter what a man  i have gone crazy over bourgets sensations ditalie hence the enclosed dedication28 a mere cry of gratitude for the best fun ive had over a new book this ever so     to fred orr      the following is in answer to an application for an autograph from a    young gentleman in the united  states       vailima upolu samoa november 28th 1891  dear siryour obliging communication is to hand i am glad to find that you have read some of my books and to see that you spell my name right this is a point for some reason of great difficulty and i believe that a gentleman who can spell stevenson with a v at sixteen should have a show for the presidency before fifty by that time    i nearer to the wayside inn  predict that you will have outgrown your taste for autographs but perhaps your son may have inherited the collection and on the morning of the great day will recall my prophecy to your mind and in the papers of 1921 say this letter may arouse a smile  whatever you do read something else besides novels and newspapers the first are good enough when they are good the second at their best are worth nothing read great books of literature and history try to understand the roman empire and the middle ages be sure you do not understand when you dislike them condemnation is noncomprehension and if you know something of these two periods you will know a little more about today and may be a good president  i send you my best wishes and am yours       robert louis stevenson    author of a vast quantity of little books     to e l burlingame      the next letter announces to his new york publishers the beginning of    his volume on the troubles of samoa a footnote to history       vailima december 1891  my dear burlingamethe end of the wrecker having but just come in you will i dare say be appalled to receive three possibly four chapters of a new book of the least attractive sort a history of nowhere in a corner or no time to mention running to a volume well it may very likely be an illusion it is very likely no one could possibly wish to read it but i wish to publish it if you dont cotton to the idea kindly set it up at my expense and let me know your terms for publishing the great affair to me is to have per return if it might be four or fivebetter say half a dozensets of the roughest proofs that can be drawn there are a good many men here whom i want to read the blessed thing and not one would have the energy to read ms at the same time if you care to glance at it and have the time i should be very glad of your opinion as to whether i have made any step at all towards possibly inducing folk at home to read matter so extraneous and outlandish i become heavy and owlish years sit upon me it begins to seem to me to be a mans business to leave off his damnable faces and say his say else i could have made it pungent and light and lively in considering kindly forget that i am r l s think of the four chapters as a book you are reading by an inhabitant of our lovely but fatil islands and see if it could possibly amuse the hebetated public i have to publish anyway you understand i have a purpose beyond i am concerned for some of the parties to this quarrel what i want to hear is from curiosity what i want you to judge of is what we are to do with the book in a business sense to me it is not business at all i had meant originally to lay all the profits to the credit of samoa when it comes to the pinch of writing i judge this unfairi give too muchand i mean to keep if there be any profit at all onehalf for the artisan the rest i shall hold over to give to the samoans for that which i choose and against work done i think i have never heard of greater insolence than to attempt such a subject yet the tale is so strange and mixed and the people so oddly characteredabove all the whitesand the high note of the hurricane and the warships is so well prepared to take popular interest and the latter part is so directly in the days movement that i am not without hope that some may read it and if they dont a murrain on them here is for the first time a tale of greekshomeric greeksmingled with moderns and all true odysseus alongside of rajah brooke proportion gardée and all true here is for the first time since the greeks that i remember the history of a handful of men where all know each other in the eyes and live close in a few acres narrated at length and with the seriousness of history talk of the modern novel here is a modern history and if i had the misfortune to found a school the legitimate historian might lie down and die for he could never overtake his material here is a little tale that has not careted its vates sacer is another point       r l s     to henry james      mr henry james was in the habit of sending out for stevensons    reading books that seemed likely to interest him and among the last    had been m paul bourgets sensations ditalie       december 7th 1891  my dear henry jamesthanks for yours your former letter was lost so it appears was my long and masterly treatise on the tragic muse i remember sending it very well and there went by the same mail a long and masterly tractate to gosse about his daddys life for which i have been long expecting an acknowledgment and which is plainly gone to the bottom with the other if you see gosse please mention it these gems of criticism are now lost literature like the tomes of alexandria i could not do em again and i must ask you to be content with a dull head a weary hand and short commons for today as i am physically tired with hard work of every kind the labours of the planter and the author both piled upon me mountain deep i am delighted beyond expression by bourgets book he has phrases which affect me almost like montaigne i had read ere this a masterly essay of his on pascal this book does it i write for all his essays by this mail and shall try to meet him when i come to europe the proposal is to pass a summer in france i think in royat where the faithful could come and visit me they are now not many i expect henry james to come and break a crust or two with us i believe it will be only my wife and myself and she will go over to england but not i or possibly incog to southampton and then to boscombe to see poor lady shelley i am writingtrying to write in a babel fit for the bottomless pit my wife her daughter her grandson and my mother all shrieking at each other round the housenot in war thank god but the din is ultra martial and the note of lloyd joins in occasionally and the cause of this todo is simply cacao whereof chocolate comes you may drink of our chocolate perhaps in five or six years from now and not know it it makes a fine bustle and gives us some hard work out of which i have slunk for today  i have a story coming out god knows when or how it answers to the name of the beach of falesá and i think well of it i was delighted with the tragic muse i thought the muse herself one of your best works i was delighted also to hear of the success of your piece as you know i am a dam failure29 and might have dined with the dinner club that daudet and these parties frequented  next dayi have just been breakfasting at baiae and brindisi and the charm of bourget hagrides me i wonder if this exquisite fellow all made of fiddlestrings and scent and intelligence could bear any of my bald prose if you think he could ask colvin to send him a copy of these last essays of mine when they appear and tell bourget they go to him from a south sea island as literal homage i have read no new book for years that gave me the same literary thrill as his sensations ditalie if as i imagine my cutanddry literature would be death to him and worse than deathjournalismbe silent on the point for i have a great curiosity to know him and if he doesnt know my work i shall have the better chance of making his acquaintance i read the pupil the other day with great joy your little boy is admirable why is there no little boy like that unless he hails from the great republic  here i broke off and wrote bourget a dedication no use resisting its a love affair o hes exquisite i bless you for the gift of him i have really enjoyed this book as ialmost as iused to enjoy books when i was going twentytwentythree and these are the years for reading       r l s     to sidney colvin        vailima tuesday dec 1891  siri have the honour to report further explorations of the course of the river vaea with accompanying sketch plan the party under my command consisted of one horse and was extremely insubordinate and mutinous owing to not being used to go into the bush and being halfbroken anywayand that the wrong half the route indicated for my party was up the bed of the socalled river vaea which i accordingly followed to a distance of perhaps two or three furlongs eastward from the house of vailima where the stream being quite dry the bush thick and the ground very difficult i decided to leave the main body of the force under my command tied to a tree and push on myself with the point of the advance guard consisting of one man the valley had become very narrow and airless foliage close shut above dry bed of the stream much excavated so that i passed under fallen trees without stooping suddenly it turned sharply to the north at right angles to its former direction i heard living water and came in view of a tall face of rock and the stream spraying down it it might have been climbed but it would have been dangerous and i had to make my way up the steep earth banks where there is nowhere any looting for man only for trees which made the rounds of my ladder i was near the top of this climb which was very hot and steep and the pulses were buzzing all over my body when i made sure there was one external sound in my ears and paused to listen no mistake a sound of a millwheel thundering i thought close by yet below me a huge millwheel yet not going steadily but with a schottische movement and at each fresh impetus shaking the mountain there where i was i just put down the sound to the mystery of the bush where no sound now surprises meand any sound alarms i only thought it would give jack a fine fright down where he stood tied to a tree by himself and he was badly enough scared when i left him the good folks at home identified it it was a sharp earthquake  illustration   1 mepi tree                 4 4 banana patches   2 carruthers road             5 waterfall   3 vailima plantation house     6 banyan tree  at the top of the climb i made my way again to the watercourse it is here running steady and pretty full strange these intermittenciesand just a little below the main stream is quite dry and all the original brook has gone down some lava gallery of the mountainand just a little further below it begins picking up from the left hand in little boggy tributaries and in the inside of a hundred yards has grown a brook again30 the general course of the brook was i guess se the valley still very deep and whelmed in wood it seemed a swindle to have made so sheer a climb and still find yourself at the bottom of a well but gradually the thing seemed to shallow the trees to seem poorer and smaller i could see more and more of the silver sprinkles of sky among the foliage instead of the sombre piling up of tree behind tree and here i had two scaresfirst away up on my right hand i heard a bull low i think it was a bull from the quality of the low which was singularly songful and beautiful the bulls belong to me but how did i know that the bull was aware of that and my advance guard not being at all properly armed we advanced with great precaution until i was satisfied that i was passing eastward of the enemy it was during this period that a pool of the river suddenly boiled up in my face in a little fountain it was in a very dreary marshy part among dilapidated trees that you see through holes in the trunks of and if any kind of beast or elf or devil had come out of that sudden silver ebullition i declare i do not think i should have been surprised it was perhaps a thing as curiousa fish with which these head waters of the stream are alive they are some of them as long as my finger should be easily caught in these shallows and some day ill have a dish of them  very soon after i came to where the stream collects in another banana swamp with the bananas bearing well beyond the course is again quite dry it mounts with a sharp turn a very steep face of the mountain and then stops abruptly at the lip of a plateau i suppose the top of vaea mountain plainly no more springs herethere was no smallest furrow of a watercourse beyondand my task might be said to be accomplished but such is the animated spirit in the service that the whole advance guard expressed a sentiment of disappointment that an exploration so far successfully conducted should come to a stop in the most promising view of fresh successes and though unprovided either with compass or cutlass it was determined to push some way along the plateau marking our direction by the laborious process of bending down sitting upon and thus breaking the wild cocoanut trees this was the less regretted by all from a delightful discovery made of a huge banyan growing here in the bush with flyingbuttressed flying buttresses and huge arcs of trunk hanging high overhead and trailing down new complications of root i climbed some way up what seemed the original beginning it was easier to climb than a ships rigging even rattled everywhere there was foothold and handhold it was judged wise to return and rally the main body who had now been left alone for perhaps forty minutes in the bush  the return was effected in good order but unhappily i only arrived like so many other explorers to find my main body or rearguard in a condition of mutiny the work it is to be supposed of terror it is right i should tell you the vaea has a bad name an aitu fafinefemale devil of the woodssuccubushaunting it and doubtless jack had heard of her perhaps during my absence saw her lucky jack anyway he was neither to hold nor to bind and finally after nearly smashing me by accident and from mere scare and insubordination several times deliberately set in to kill me but poor jack the tree he selected for that purpose was a banana i jumped off and gave him the heavy end of my whip over the buttocks then i took and talked in his ear in various voices you should have heard my altoit was a dreadful devilish notei knew jack knew it was an aitu then i mounted him again and he carried me fairly steadily hell learn yet he has to learn to trust absolutely to his rider till he does the risk is always great in thick bush where a fellow must try different passages and put back and forward and pick his way by hairsbreadths  the expedition returned to vailima in time to receive the visit of the r c bishop he is a superior man much above the average of priests  thursdayyesterday the same expedition set forth to the southward by what is known as carruthers road at a fallen tree which completely blocks the way the main body was as before left behind and the advance guard of one now proceeded with the exploration at the great tree known as mepi tree after maben the surveyor the expedition struck forty yards due west till it struck the top of a steep bank which it descended the whole bottom of the ravine is filled with sharp lava blocks quite unrolled and very difficult and dangerous to walk among no water in the course scarce any sign of water and yet surely water must have made this bold cutting in the plateau and if so why is the lava sharp my science gave out but i could not but think it ominous and volcanic the course of the stream was tortuous but with a resultant direction a little by west of north the sides the whole way exceeding steep the expedition buried under fathoms of foliage presently water appeared in the bottom a good quantity perhaps thirty or forty cubic feet with pools and waterfalls a tree that stands all along the banks here must be very fond of water its roots lie closepacked down the stream like hanks of guts so as to make often a corrugated walk each root ending in a blunt tuft of filaments plainly to drink water twice there came in small tributaries from the left or western sidethe whole plateau having a smartish inclination to the east one of the tributaries in a handsome little web of silver hanging in the forest twice i was startled by birds one that barked like a dog another that whistled loud ploughmans signals so that i vow i was thrilled and thought i had fallen among runaway blacks and regretted my cutlass which i had lost and left behind while taking bearings a good many fishes in the brook and many crayfish one of the last with a queer glowworm head like all our brooks the water is pure as air and runs over red stones like rubies the foliage along both banks very thick and high the place close the walking exceedingly laborious by the time the expedition reached the fork it was felt exceedingly questionable whether the moral of the force were sufficiently good to undertake more extended operations a halt was called the men refreshed with water and a bath and it was decided at a drumhead council of war to continue the descent of the embassy water straight for vailima whither the expedition returned in rather poor condition and wet to the waist about 4 pm  thus in two days the two main watercourses of this country have been pretty thoroughly explored and i conceive my instructions fully carried out the main body of the second expedition was brought back by another officer despatched for that purpose from vailima casualties one horse wounded one man bruised no deathsas yet but the bruised man feels today as if his case was mighty serious  dec 25 91your note with a very despicable bulletin of health arrived only yesterday the mail being a day behind it contained also the excellent times article which was a sight for sore eyes i am still taboo the blessed germans will have none of me and i only hope they may enjoy the times article tis my revenge i wish you had sent the letter too as i have no copy and do not even know what i wrote the last day with a bad headache and the mail going out however it must have been about right for the times article was in the spirit i wished to arouse i hope we can get rid of the man before it is too late he has set the natives to war but the natives by gods blessing do not want to fight and i think it will fizzle outno thanks to the man who tried to start it but i did not mean to drift into these politics rather to tell you what i have done since i last wrote  well i worked away at my history for a while and only got one chapter done no doubt this spate of work is pretty low now and will be soon dry but god bless you what a lot i have accomplished wrecker done beach of falesá done half the history cest étonnant i hear from burlingame by the way that he likes the end of the wrecker tis certainly a violent dark yarn with interesting plain turns of human nature then lloyd and i went down to live in haggards rooms where fanny presently joined us haggards rooms are in a strange old buildingold for samoa and has the effect of the antique like some strange monastery i would tell you more of it but i think im going to use it in a tale the annexe close by had its door sealed poor dowdney lost at sea in a schooner the place is haunted the vast empty sheds the empty store the airless hot long low rooms the claps of wind that set everything flyinga strange uncanny house to spend christmas in  jan 1st92for a day or two i have sat close and wrought hard at the history and two more chapters are all but done about thirty pages should go by this mail which is not what should be but all i could overtake will any one ever read it i fancy not people dont read history for reading but for education and displayand who desires education in the history of samoa with no population no past no future or the exploits of mataafa malietoa and consul knappe colkitto and galasp are a trifle to it well it cant be helped and it must be done and better or worse its capital fun there are two to whom i have not been kindgerman consul becker and the english captain hand rn  on dec 30th i rode down with belle to go to if you please the fancy ball when i got to the beach i found the barometer was below 29° the wind still in the east and steady but a huge offensive continent of clouds and vapours forming to leeward it might be a hurricane i dared not risk getting caught away from my work and leaving belle returned at once to vailima next dayyesterdayit was a tearer we had storm shutters up i sat in my room and wrote by lamplightten pages if you please seven of them draft and some of these compiled authorities so that was a brave days work about two a huge tree fell within sixty paces of our house a little after a second went and we sent out boys with axes and cut down a third which was too near the house and buckling like a fishing rod at dinner we had the front door closed and shuttered the back door open the lamp lit the boys in the cookhouse were all out at the cookhouse door where we could see them looking in and smiling lauilo and faauma waited on us with smiles the excitement was delightful some very violent squalls came as we sat there and every one rejoiced it was impossible to help it a soul of putty had to sing all night it blew the roof was continually sounding under missiles in the morning the verandahs were half full of branches torn from the forest there was a last very wild squall about six the rain like a thick white smoke flying past the house in volleys and as swift it seemed as rifle balls all with a strange strident hiss such as i have only heard before at sea and indeed thought to be a marine phenomenon since then the wind has been falling with a few squalls mostly rain but our road is impassable for horses we hear a schooner has been wrecked and some native houses blown down in apia where belle is still and must remain a prisoner lucky i returned while i could but the great good is this much breadfruit and bananas have been destroyed if this be general through the islands famine will be imminent and whoever blows the coals there can be no war do i then prefer a famine to a war you ask not always but just now i am sure the natives do not want a war i am sure a war would benefit no one but the white officials and i believe we can easily meet the famineor at least that it can be met that would give our officials a legitimate opportunity to cover their past errors  jan 2ndi woke this morning to find the blow quite ended the heaven was all a mottled grey even the east quite colourless the downward slope of the island veiled in wafts of vapour blue like smoke not a leaf stirred on the tallest tree only three miles away below me on the barrier reef i could see the individual breakers curl and fall and hear their conjunct roaring rise as it still rises at 1 pm like the roar of a thoroughfare close by i did a good mornings work correcting and clarifying my draft and have now finished for press eight chapters ninetyone pages of this piece of journalism four more chapters say fifty pages remain to be done i should gain my wager and finish this volume in three months that is to say the end should leave me per february mail i cannot receive it back till the mail of april yes it can be out in time pray god that it be in time to help  how do journalists fetch up their drivel i aim only at clearness and the most obvious finish positively at no higher degree of merit not even at brevityi am sure it could have been all done with double the time in twothirds of the space and yet it has taken me two months to write 45500 words and be damned to my wicked prowess i am proud of the exploit the real journalist must be a man not of brass only but bronze chapter ix gapes for me but i shrink on the margin and go on chattering to you this last part will be much less offensive strange to say to the germans it is becker they will never forgive me for knappe i pity and do not dislike becker i scorn and abominate here is the tableau i elements of discord native ii elements of discord foreign iii the sorrows of laupepa iv brandeis v the battle of matautu vi last exploits of becker vii the samoan camps viii affairs of lautii and fangalii ix furor consularis x the hurricane xi stuebel recluse xii the present government i estimate the whole roughly at 70000 words should anybody ever dream of reading it it would be found amusing 70000300  233 printed pages a respectable little fivebob volume to bloom unread in shop windows after that ill have a spank at fiction and rest i shall rest in the grave or when i come to italy if only the public will continue to support me i lost my chance not dying there seems blooming little fear of it now i worked close on five hours this morning the day before close on nine and unless i finish myself off with this letter ill have another hour and a half or aiblins twa before dinner poor man how you must envy me as you hear of these orgies of work and you scarce able for a letter but lord colvin how lucky the situations are not reversed for i have no situation nor am fit for any life is a steigh brae here have at knappe and no more clavers  jan 3rdthere was never any man had so many irons in the fire except jim pinkerton31 i forgot to mention i have the most gallant suggestion from lang with an offer of ms authorities which turns my brain its all about the throne of poland and buried treasure in the mackay country and alan breck can figure there in glory  yesterday j and i set off to blacklocks american consul who lives not far from that little village i have so often mentioned as lying between us and apia i had some questions to ask him for my history thence we must proceed to vailele where i had also to crossexamine the plantation manager about the battle there we went by a track i had never before followed down the hill to vaisigano which flows here in a deep valley and was unusually full so that the horses trembled in the ford the whole bottom of the valley is full of various streams posting between strips of forest with a brave sound of waters in one place we had a glimpse of a fall some way higher up and then sparkling in sunlight in the midst of the green valley then up by a winding path scarce accessible to a horse for steepness to the other side and the open cocoanut glades of the plantation here we rode fast did a mighty satisfactory afternoons work at the plantation house and still faster back on the return jack fell with me but got up again when i felt him recovering i gave him his head and he shoved his foot through the rein i got him by the bit however and all was well he had mud over all his face but his knees were not broken we were scarce home when the rain began again that was luck it is pouring now in torrents we are in the height of the bad season lloyd leaves along with this letter on a change to san francisco he had much need of it but i think this will brace him up i am as you see a tower of strength i can remember riding not so far and not near so fast when i first came to samoa and being shattered next day with fatigue now i could not tell i have done anything have rehandled my battle of fangalii according to yesterdays informationfour pages rewritten and written already some halfdozen pages of letters  i observe with disgust that while of yore when i own i was guilty you never spared me abusebut now when i am so virtuous where is the praise do admit that i have become an excellent letterwriterat least to you and that your ingratitude is imbecileyours ever       r l s   footnotes    1 in the missionary work which is being done among the samoans     mr stevenson was especially interested he was an observant     shrewd yet ever generous critic of all our religious and     educational organisations his knowledge of native character and     life enabled him to understand missionary difficulties while his     genial contact with all sorts and conditions of men made him keen to     detect deficiencies in men and methods and apt in useful     suggestion the above is the testimony of the mr clarke here     mentioned rev w e clarke of the london missionary society this

first serial tale says mr clarke ever read by samoans in     their own language was the story of the bottle imp which found     its way into print at samoa and was read with wonder and delight in     many a thatched samoan hut before it won the admiration of readers     at home in the english form the story was published first in black     and white and afterwards in the volume called island

as a lad to accompany his father on the     official trips of inspection round the coast    24 mr rudyard kipling was at this time planning a trip to samoa     but the plan was unfortunately not carried out and he and stevenson     never met    25 readers of the wrecker will not need to be reminded that this     is the name of the personage on whom the mystery in that story     hinges    26

course but below in many places dry or lost compare     the late lord pembrokes south sea bubbles p 212one odd     thing connected with these ravines is the fact that the higher you     go the more water you find unlike the thames which begins i     believe in half a mile of dusty lane and expands in its brimming     breadth as it approaches the sea a samoan stream begins in bubbling     plenty and ends in utter drought a mile or two from the salt water     gradually as you ascend you become more and more hopeful moist     patches of sand appear here and there then tiny pools that a fallen     leaf might cover then larger ones with little threadlike runs of     water between them larger and larger till at last you reach some     hard ledge of trap over which a glorious stream gurgles and     splashes into a pool ample enough for the bath of an elephant    31 in the wrecker as to the story thus suggested by mr andrew     lang see below pp 171 187 etc     xii  life in samoacontinued  second year at vailima  januarydecember 1892   the new year found stevenson down with his first attack of the influenza epidemic then virulent all over the world but the illness was not sufficient to stop his work and in the first two months of the year he was busy continuing his conscientious labours on the footnote to history seeing the wrecker and the beach of falesá through the press planning the south sea plantation novel sophia scarlet which never got beyond that inchoate stage and writing the continuation to kidnapped first intended to bear the name of the hero david balfour and afterwards changed to catriona with this he proceeded swimmingly completing it between february and september in a shorter time than any other of his sustained narratives and on publication its success was great by may he had finished the footnote and then had a dash at the first chapters of the young chevalier which stand in their truncated state a piece of work as vivid and telling as he had ever done early in the autumn he struck a still fuller note in the draft of the first chapters of weir of hermiston  during this year the household at vailima received a new temporary inmate in the person of mr graham balfour a cousin whom stevenson had not previously known but with whom he soon formed the closest and most confidential friendship of his later life in the summer and early autumn he was much taken up both with politics and with hospitalities as hereinafter narrated he made and was thwarted in a serious attempt to effect a reconciliation between the two rival chiefs and continued his series of letters to the times showing up the incompetence and worse of the responsible treaty officials in august he took lively pleasure in a visit paid to the islands by lady jersey and some members of her family from australia during the course of their stay he conducted the visitors to the rebel camp under aliases as the needs of the time required and in a manner that seemed like the realisation of a chapter of a waverley novel a month or two later he became aware with more amusement than alarm of measures for his deportation set on foot but not carried through by the treaty officials for a man of his temper the political muddle and mismanagement of which the samoan islands were the sceneand not only these however much he might lament them for the sake of the inhabitants but even the risks he ran of serious personal consequences from his own actionadded to life at least as much of zest and excitement as of annoyance  in october he determined not without serious financial misgivings and chiefly in deference to his mothers urgency to enlarge his house at vailima by putting up a new block adjoining and communicating with that which he had hitherto inhabited the work was promptly and efficiently carried out by the german firm and completed by the end of the year quite towards the close of december copies of the footnote to history reached samoa and the book so far from being a cause of offence to his friends the managers of that firm as both he and they had feared was found acceptable and devoid of offence by them a result celebrated in the convivial manner described in the last letter of this section on the whole the year had been a prosperous one full of successful work and eager interests although darkened in its later months by disquietude on account of his wifes health he had himself well maintained the improved strength and the renewed capacity both for literary work and outdoor activity which life in the south seas had brought him from the first     to e l burlingame        vailima jan 2nd 92  my dear burlingameoverjoyed you were pleased with the wrecker and shall consider your protests there is perhaps more art than you think for in the peccant chapter where i have succeeded in packing into one a dedication an explanation and a termination surely you had not recognised the phrase about boodle it was a quotation from jim pinkerton and seemed to me agreeably skittish however all shall be prayerfully considered  to come to a more painful subject herewith go three more chapters of the wretched history as you see i approach the climax i expect the book to be some 70000 words of which you have now 45 can i finish it for next mail i am going to try tis a long piece of journalism and full of difficulties here and there of this kind and that and will make me a power of friends to be sure there is one becker who will probably put up a window to me in the church where he was baptized and i expect a testimonial from captain hand  sorry to let the mail go without the scott this has been a bad month with me and i have been below myself i shall find a way to have it come by next or know the reason why the mail after anyway  a bit of a sketch map appears to me necessary for my history perhaps two if i do not have any tis impossible any one should follow and i even when not at all interested demand that i shall be able to follow even a tourist book without a map is a cross to me and there must be others of my way of thinking i inclose the very artless one that i think needful vailima in case you are curious is about as far again behind tanugamanono as that is from the sea  mclure is publishing a short story of mine some 50000 words i think the beach of falesá when hes done with it i want you and cassell to bring it out in a little volume i shall send you a dedication for it i believe it good indeed to be honest very good good gear that pleases the merchant  the other map that i half threaten is a chart for the hurricane get me kimberleys report of the hurricane not to be found here it is of most importance i must have it with my proofs of that part if i cannot have it earlier which now seems impossibleyours in hot haste       r l stevenson     to miss adelaide boodle      at the news that his correspondent was occupied teaching and    entertaining a class of children in a kilburn basement stevenson    bethinks himself of helping her by writing an account of samoa and    samoan life for children       vailima january 4th 1892  my dear adelaidewe were much pleased with your letter and the news of your employment admirable your method but will you not run dry of fairy stories please salute your pupils and tell them that a long lean elderly man who lives right through on the under side of the world so that down in your cellar you are nearer him than the people in the street desires his compliments this man lives in an island which is not very long and extremely narrow the sea beats round it very hard so that it is difficult to get to shore there is only one harbour where ships come even that is very wild and dangerous four ships of war were broken there a little while ago and one of them is still lying on its side on a rock clean above water where the sea threw it as you might throw your fiddle bow on the table all round the harbour the town is strung out it is nothing but wooden houses only there are some churches built of stone not very large but the people have never seen such fine buildings almost all the houses are of one story away at one end lives the king of the whole country his palace has a thatched roof which stands upon posts it has no walls but when it blows and rains they have venetian blinds which they let down between the posts and make it very snug there is no furniture and the king and queen and the courtiers sit and eat on the floor which is of gravel the lamp stands there too and every now and then it is upset these good folks wear nothing but a kilt about their waists unless to go to church or for a dance or the new year or some great occasion the children play marbles all along the street and though they are generally very jolly yet they get awfully cross over their marbles and cry and fight like boys and girls at home another amusement in country places is to shoot fish with a bow and arrow all round the beach there is bright shallow water where fishes can be seen darting or lying in shoals the child trots round the shore and wherever he sees a fish lets fly an arrow and misses and then wades in after his arrow it is great fun i have tried it for the child and i never heard of it doing any harm to the fishes so what could be more jolly the road up to this lean mans house is uphill all the way and through forests the forests are of great trees not so much unlike the trees at home only here and there are some very queer ones mixed with them cocoanut palms and great forest trees that are covered with blossom like red hawthorn but not near so bright and from all the trees thick creepers hang down like ropes and nastylooking weeds that they call orchids grow in the forks of the branches and on the ground many prickly things are dotted which they call pineapples i suppose every one has eaten pineapple drops  on the way up to the lean mans house you pass a little village all of houses like the kings house so that as you ride through you can see everybody sitting at dinner or if it be night lying in their beds by lamplight for all these people are terribly afraid of ghosts and would not lie in the dark for any favour after the village there is only one more house and that is the lean mans for the people are not very many and live all by the sea and the whole inside of the island is desert woods and mountains when the lean man goes into this forest he is very much ashamed to say it but he is always in a terrible fright the wood is so great and empty and hot and it is always filled with curious noises birds cry like children and bark like dogs and he can hear people laughing and felling trees and the other day when he was far in the woods he heard a great sound like the biggest millwheel possible going with a kind of dotandcarryone movement like a dance that was the noise of an earthquake away down below him in the bowels of the earth and that is the same thing as to say away up towards you in your cellar in kilburn all these noises make him feel lonely and scared and he doesnt quite know what he is scared of once when he was just about to cross a river a blow struck him on the top of his head and knocked him headforemost down the bank and splash into the water it was a nut i fancy that had fallen from a tree by which accidents people are sometimes killed but at the time he thought it was a black boy  aha say you and what is a black boy well there are here a lot of poor people who are brought here from distant islands to labour as slaves for the germans they are not at all like the king or his people who are brown and very pretty but these are black as negroes and as ugly as sin poor souls and in their own lands they live all the time at war and cook and eat mens flesh the germans thrash them with whips to make them work and every now and then some run away into the bush as the forest is called and build little sheds of leaves and eat nuts and roots and fruit and dwell there by themselves in the great desert sometimes they are bad and wild and come down in the villages and steal and kill and people whisper to each other that some of them have gone back to their horrid old habits and catch men and women in order to eat them but it is very likely not true and the most of them are only poor stupid trembling halfstarved pitiful creatures like frightened dogs their life is all very well when the sun shines as it does eight or nine months in the year but it is very different the rest of the time the wind rages here most violently the great trees thrash about like whips the air is filled with leaves and great branches flying about like birds and the sound of the trees falling shakes the earth it rains too as it never rains at home you can hear a shower while it is yet half a mile away hissing like a showerbath in the forest and when it comes to you the water blinds your eyes and the cold drenching takes your breath away as though some one had struck you in that kind of weather it must be dreadful indeed to live in the woods one man alone by himself and you must know that if the lean man feels afraid to be in the forest the people of the island and the black boys are much more afraid than he for they believe the woods to be quite filled with spirits some are like pigs and some are like flying things but others and these are thought the most dangerous come in the shape of beautiful young women and young men beautifully dressed in the island manner with fine kilts and fine necklaces and crowns of scarlet seeds and flowers woe betide he or she who gets to speak with one of these they will be charmed out of their wits and come home again quite silly and go mad and die so that the poor black boy must be always trembling and looking about for the coming of the womendevils  sometimes the womendevils go down out of the woods into the villages and here is a tale the lean man heard last year one of the islanders was sitting in his house and he had cooked fish there came along the road two beautiful young women dressed as i told you who came into his house and asked for some of his fish it is the fashion in the islands always to give what is asked and never to ask folks names so the man gave them fish and talked to them in the island jesting way and presently he asked one of the women for her red necklace which is good manners and their way he had given the fish and he had a right to ask for something back i will give it you by and by said the woman and she and her companion went away but he thought they were gone very suddenly and the truth is they had vanished the night was nearly come when the man heard the voice of the woman crying that he should come to her and she would give the necklace and he looked out and behold she was standing calling him from the top of the sea on which she stood as you might on the table at that fear came on the man he fell on his knees and prayed and the woman disappeared it was known afterwards that this was once a woman indeed but should have died a thousand years ago and has lived all that while as a devil in the woods beside the spring of a river saumaiafe sowmyaffy is her name in case you want to write to herever your friend tusitala talewriter       alias robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      the south sea novel here mentioned sophia scarlet never got    beyond the rough draft of an opening chapter or two       vailima jan 31st 92  my dear colvinno letter at all from you and this scratch from me here is a year that opens ill lloyd is off to the coast sickthe coast means california over most of the pacifici have been down all month with influenza and am just recoveringi am overlaid with proofs which i am just about half fit to attend to one of my horses died this morning and another is now dying on the front lawnlloyds horse and fannys such is my quarrel with destiny but i am mending famously come and go on the balcony have perfectly good nights and though i still cough have no oppression and no hemorrhage and no fever so if i can find time and courage to add no more you will know my news is not altogether of the worst a year or two ago and what a state i should have been in now your silence i own rather alarms me but i tell myself you have just miscarried had you been too ill to write some one would have written me understand i send this brief scratch not because i am unfit to write more but because i have 58 galleys of the wrecker and 102 of the beach of falesá to get overhauled somehow or other in time for the mail and for three weeks i have not touched a pen with my finger  feb 1stthe second horse is still alive but i still think dying the first was buried this morning my proofs are done it was a rough two days of it but done consummatum est ua uma i believe the wrecker ends well if i know what a good yarn is the last four chapters make a good yarnbut pretty horrible the beach of falesá i still think well of but it seems its immoral and theres a todo and financially it may prove a heavy disappointment the plaintive request sent to me to make the young folks married properly before that night i refused you will see what would be left of the yarn had i consented32 this is a poison bad world for the romancer this anglosaxon world i usually get out of it by not having any women in it at all but when i remember i had the treasure of franchard refused as unfit for a family magazine i feel despair weigh upon my wrists  as i know you are always interested in novels i must tell you that a new one is now entirely planned it is to be called sophia scarlet and is in two parts part i the vanilla planter part ii the overseers no chapters i think just two dense blocks of narrative the first of which is purely sentimental but the second has some rows and quarrels and winds up with an explosion if you please i am just burning to get at sophia but i must do this samoan journalismthats a cursed duty the first part of sophia bar the first twenty or thirty pages writes itself the second is more difficult involving a good many charactersabout ten i thinkwho have to be kept all moving and give the effect of a society i have three women to handle out and wellaway but only sophia is in full tone sophia and two men windermere the vanilla planter who dies at the end of part i and rainsforth who only appears in the beginning of part ii the fact is i blush to own it but sophia is a regular novel heroine and hero and false accusation and love and marriage and all the rest of itall planted in a big south sea plantation run by exenglish officersà la stewarts plantation in tahiti33 there is a strong undercurrent of labour trade which gives it a kind of uncle tom flavour absit omen  the first start is hard it is hard to avoid a little tedium here but i think by beginning with the arrival of the three miss scarlets hot from school and society in england i may manage to slide in the information the problem is exactly a balzac one and i wish i had his fistfor i have already a better methodthe kinetic whereas he continually allowed himself to be led into the static but then he had the fist and the most i can hope is to get out of it with a modicum of grace and energy but for sure without the strong impression the full dark brush three people have had it the real creators brush scott see much of the antiquary and the heart of midlothian especially all round the trial before during and afterbalzacand thackeray in vanity fair everybody else either paints thin or has to stop to paint or paints excitedly so that you see the author skipping before his canvas here is a long way from poor sophia scarlet    this day is published     sophia scarlet            by  robert louis stevenson     to j m barrie      the following is the first of several letters to mr j m barrie    for whose work stevenson had a warm admiration and with whom he soon    established by correspondence a cordial friendship       vailima samoa february 1892  dear mr barriethis is at least the third letter i have written you but my correspondence has a bad habit of not getting so far as the post that which i possess of manhood turns pale before the business of the address and envelope but i hope to be more fortunate with this for besides the usual and often recurrent desire to thank you for your workyou are one of four that have come to the front since i was watching and had a corner of my own to watch and there is no reason unless it be in these mysterious tides that ebb and flow and make and mar and murder the works of poor scribblers why you should not do work of the best order the tides have borne away my sentence of which i was weary at any rate and between authors i may allow myself so much freedom as to leave it pending we are both scots besides and i suspect both rather scotty scots my own scotchness tends to intermittency but is at times erisypelitousif that be rightly spelt lastly i have gathered we had both made our stages in the metropolis of the winds our virgils grey metropolis and i count that a lasting bond no place so brands a man  finally i feel it a sort of duty to you to report progress this may be an error but i believed i detected your hand in an articleit may be an illusion it may have been by one of those industrious insects who catch up and reproduce the handling of each emergent manbut ill still hope it was yoursand hope it may please you to hear that the continuation of kidnapped is under way i have not yet got to alan so i do not know if he is still alive but david seems to have a kick or two in his shanks i was pleased to see how the anglosaxon theory fell into the trap i gave my lowlander a gaelic name and even commented on the fact in the text yet almost all critics recognised in david and alan a saxon and a celt i know not about england in scotland at least where gaelic was spoken in fife little over the century ago and in galloway not much earlier i deny that there exists such a thing as a pure saxon and i think it more than questionable if there be such a thing as a pure celt  but what have you to do with this and what have i let us continue to inscribe our little bits of tales and let the heathen rageyours with sincere interest in your career       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        vailima feb 1892  my dear colvinthis has been a busyish month for a sick man first faaumathe bronze candlestick whom otherwise i called my butlerbolted from the bed and bosom of lafaele the archangel hercules prefect of the cattle there was a deuce to pay and hercules was inconsolable and immediately started out after a new wife and has had one up on a visit but says she has no conversation and i think he will take back the erring and possibly repentant candlestick whom we all devoutly prefer as she is not only highly decorative but goodnatured and if she does little work makes no rows i tell this lightly but it really was a heavy business many were accused of complicity and rafael was really very sorry i had to hold beds of justiceliterallyseated in my bed and surrounded by lying samoans seated on the floor and there were many picturesque and still inexplicable passages it is hard to reach the truth in these islands  the next incident overlapped with this s and fanny found three strange horses in the paddock for long now the boys have been forbidden to leave their horses here one hour because our grass is overgrazed s came up with the news and i saw i must now strike a blow to the pound with the lot said i he proposed taking the three himself but i thought that too dangerous an experiment said i should go too and hurried into my boots so as to show decision taken in the necessary interviews they came of coursethe interviewsand i explained what i was going to do at huge length and stuck to my guns i am glad to say the natives with their usual purely speculative sense of justice highly approved the step after reflection meanwhile off went s and i with the three corpora delicti and a good job i went once when our circus began to kick we thought all was up but we got them down all sound in wind and limb i judged i was much fallen off from my elliot forefathers who managed this class of business with neatness and despatch  as we got down to town we met the mother and daughter of my friend  bathed in tears they had left the house over a row which i have not time or spirits to describe this matter dashed me a good deal and the first decentlooking day i mounted and set off to see if i could not patch things up halfway down it came on to rain tropic style and i came back from my second outing drenched like a drowned mani was literally blinded as i came back among these sheets of water and the consequence was i was laid down with diarrhoea and threatenings of samoa colic for the inside of another week meanwhile up came laulii34 in whose house mrs and miss  have taken refuge one of mrs s grievances is that her son has married one of these porkeaters and cannibals as a matter of fact there is no memory of cannibalism in samoa and a strange thing it was to hear the cannibal laulii describe her sorrows she is singularly pretty and sweet her training reflects wonderful credit on her husband and when she began to describe to usto act to us in the tone of an actress walking through a rehearsalthe whole bearing of her angry guests indicating the really tragic notes when they came in so that fanny and i were ashamed to laugh and touching off the merely ludicrous with infinite tact and sly humour showing in fact in her whole picture of a couple of irate barbarian women the whole play and sympathy of what we call the civilised mind the contrast was seizing i speak with feeling today again being the first day humanly possible for me i went down to apia with fanny and between two and three hours did i argue with that old womannot immovable would she had been but with a mechanical mind like a piece of a musical snuffbox that returned always to the same startingpoint not altogether base for she was longsuffering with me and professed even gratitude and was just in a sense to her son and showed here and there moments of genuine and not undignified emotion but o on the other side what lapseswhat a mechanical movement of the brain what occasional trapdoor devils of meanness what a wooden front of pride i came out damped and saddened and to say truth a trifle sick my wife had better luck with the daughter but o it was a weary business  to add to my griefbut thats politics before i sleep tonight i have a confession to make when i was sick i tried to get to work to finish that samoa thing wouldnt go and at last in the colic time i slid off into david balfour35 some 50 pages of which are drafted and like me well really i think it is spirited and theres a heroine that up to now seems to have attractions absit omen david on the whole seems excellent alan does not come in till the tenth chapter and i am only at the eighth so i dont know if i can find him again but david is on his feet and doing well and very much in love and mixed up with the lord advocate and the untitled lord lovat and all manner of great folk and the tale interferes with my eating and sleeping the join is bad i have not thought to strain too much for continuity so this part be alive i shall be content but theres no doubt david seems to have changed his style deil hae him and much i care if the tale travel  friday feb 19thtwo incidents today which i must narrate after lunch it was raining pitilessly we were sitting in my mothers bedroom and i was reading aloud kinglakes charge of the light brigade and we had just been all seized by the horses aligning with lord george paget when a figure appeared on the verandah a little slim small figure of a lad with blond ie limed hair a propitiatory smile and a nose that alone of all his features grew pale with anxiety i come here stop was about the outside of his english and i began at once to guess that he was a runaway labourer36 and that the bushknife in his hand was stolen it proved he had a mate who had lacked his courage and was hidden down the road they had both made up their minds to run away and had come here stop i could not turn out the poor rogues one of whom showed me marks on his back into the drenching forest i could not reason with them for they had not enough english and not one of our boys spoke their tongue so i bade them feed and sleep here tonight and tomorrow i must do what the lord shall bid me  near dinner time i was told that a friend of lafaeles had found human remains in my bush after dinner a figure was seen skulking across towards the waterfall which produced from the verandah a shout in my most stentorian tones o ai le ingoa literally who the name which serves here for whats your business as well it proved to be lafaeles friend i bade a kitchen boy lauilo go with him to see the spot for though it had ceased raining the whole island ran and dripped lauilo was willing enough but the friend of the archangel demurred he had too much business he had no time all right i said you too much frightened i go along which of course produced the usual shout of delight from all those who did not require to go i got into my saranac snow boots lauilo got a cutlass mary carter our sydney maid joined the party for a lark and off we set i tell you our guide kept us moving for the dusk fell swift our woods have an infamous reputation at the best and our errand to say the least of it was grisly at last they found the remains they were old which was all i cared to be sure of it seemed a strangely small picklebanes to stand for a big flourishing buckislander and their situation in the darkening and dripping bush was melancholy all at once i found there was a second skull with a bullethole i could have stuck my two thumbs insay anybody elses one thumb my samoans said it could not be there were not enough bones i put the two pieces of skull together and at last convinced them whereupon in a flash they found the not unromantic explanation this poor brave had succeeded in the height of a samoan warriors ambition he had taken a head which he was never destined to show to his applauding camp wounded himself he had crept here into the bush to die with his useless trophy by his side his date would be about fifteen years ago in the great battle between laupepa and talavou which took place on my land sir tomorrow we shall bury the bones and fire a salute in honour of unfortunate courage  do you think i have an empty life or that a man jogging to his club has so much to interest and amuse himtouch and try him too but that goes along with the others no pain no pleasure is the iron law so here i stop again and leave as i left yesterday my political business untouched and lo here comes my pupil i believe so i stop in time  march 2ndsince i last wrote fifteen chapters of david balfour have been drafted and five tirés au clair i think it pretty good theres a blooming maiden that costs anxietyshe is as virginal as billy but david seems there and alive and the lord advocate is good and so i think is an episodic appearance of the master of lovat in chapter xvii i shall get david abroadalan went already in chapter xii the book should be about the length of kidnapped this early part of it about ds evidence in the appin case is more of a story than anything in kidnapped but there is no doubt there comes a break in the middle and the tale is practically in two divisions in the first james more and the mgregors and catriona only show in the second the appin case being disposed of and james stewart hung they rule the roast and usurp the interestshould there be any left why did i take up david balfour i dont know a sudden passion  monday i went down in the rain with a colic to take the chair at a public meeting dined with haggard sailed off to my meeting and fought with wild beasts for three anxious hours all was lost that any sensible man cared for but the meeting did not break upthanks a good deal to r l sand the man who opposed my election and with whom i was all the time wrangling proposed the vote of thanks to me with a certain handsomeness i assure you i had earned it haggard and the great abdul his highcaste indian servant imported by my wife were sitting up for me with supper and i suppose it was twelve before i got to bed tuesday raining my mother rode down and we went to the consulate to sign a factory and commission thence i to the lawyers to the printing office and to the mission it was dinner time when i returned home  this morning our cookboy having suddenly leftinjured feelingsthe archangel was to cook breakfast i found him lighting the fire before dawn his eyes blazed he had no word of any language left to use and i saw in him to my wonder the strongest workings of gratified ambition napoleon was no more pleased to sign his first treaty with austria than was lafaele to cook that breakfast all morning when i had hoped to be at this letter i slept like one drugged and you must take this which is all i can give you for what it is worth     d b     memoirs of his adventures at home and abroad the second part    wherein are set forth the misfortunes in which he was involved upon    the appin murder his troubles with lord advocate prestongrange    captivity on the bass rock journey into france and holland and    singular relations with james more drummond or macgregor a son of    the notorious rob roy  chaptersi a beggar on horseback ii the highland writer iii i go to pilrig iv lord advocate prestongrange v butter and thunder vi i make a fault in honour vii the bravo viii the heather on fire ix i begin to be haunted with a redheaded man x the wood by silvermills xi on the march again with alan xii gillane sands xiii the bass rock xiv black andies tale of tod lapraik xv i go to inveraray  that is it as far as drafted chapters iv v vii ix and xiv i am specially pleased with the last being an episodical bogie story about the bass rock told there by the keeper     to william morris      the following draft letter addressed to mr william morris was found    among stevensons papers after his death it has touches of    affectation and constraint not usual with him and it is no doubt on    that account that he did not send it but though not in his best    manner it seems worth printing as illustrating the variety of his    interests and admirations in literature       vailima samoa feb 1892  mastera plea from a place so distant should have some weight and from a heart so grateful should have some address i have been long in your debt master and i did not think it could be so much increased as you have now increased it i was long in your debt and deep in your debt for many poems that i shall never forget and for sigurd before all and now you have plunged me beyond payment by the saga library and so now true to human nature being plunged beyond payment i come and bark at your heels  for surely master that tongue that we write and that you have illustrated so nobly is yet alive she has her rights and laws and is our mother our queen and our instrument now in that living tongue where has one sense whereas another in the heathslayings story p 241 line 13 it bears one of its ordinary senses elsewhere and usually through the two volumes which is all that has yet reached me of this entrancing publication whereas is made to figure for where  for the love of god my dear and honoured morris use where and let us know whereas we are wherefore our gratitude shall grow whereby you shall be the more honoured wherever men love clear language whereas now although we honour we are troubled  whereunder please find inscribed to this very impudent but yet very anxious document the name of one of the most distant but not the youngest or the coldest of those who honour you       robert louis stevenson     to mrs charles fairchild      the projected visit of mr kipling with his wife and brotherinlaw    to samoa which is mentioned towards the close of this letter never    took place much to the regret of both authors       vailima march 1892  my dear mrs fairchildi am guilty in your sight but my affairs besiege me the chiefjusticeship of a family of nineteen persons is in itself no sinecure and sometimes occupies me for days two weeks ago for four days almost entirely and for two days entirely besides which i have in the last few months written all but one chapter of a history of samoa for the last eight or nine years and while i was unavoidably delayed in the writing of this awaiting material put in onehalf of david balfour the sequel to kidnapped add the ordinary impediments of life and admire my busyness i am now an old but healthy skeleton and degenerate much towards the machine by six at work stopped at halfpast ten to give a history lesson to a stepgrandson eleven lunch after lunch we have a musical performance till two then to work again bath 440 dinner five cards in the evening till eight and then to bedonly i have no bed only a chest with a mat and blanketsand read myself to sleep this is the routine but often sadly interrupted then you may see me sitting on the floor of my verandah haranguing and being harangued by squatting chiefs on a question of a road or more privately holding an inquiry into some dispute among our familiars myself on my bed the boys on the floorfor when it comes to the judicial i play dignityor else going down to apia on some more or less unsatisfactory errand altogether it is a life that suits me but it absorbs me like an ocean that is what i have always envied and admired in scott with all that immensity of work and study his mind kept flexible glancing to all points of natural interest but the lean hot spirits such as mine become hypnotised with their bit occupationsif i may use scotch to youit is so far more scornful than any english idiom well i cant help being a skeleton and you are to take this devious passage for an apology  i thought aladdin37 capital fun but why in fortune did he pretend it was moral at the end the socalled nineteenth century où vatil se nicher tis a trifle but pyle would do well to knock the passage out and leave his boguey tale a boguey tale and a good one at that  the arrival of your box was altogether a great success to the castaways you have no idea where we live do you know in all these islands there are not five hundred whites and no postal delivery and only one villageit is no moreand would be a mean enough village in europe we were asked the other day if vailima were the name of our post town and we laughed do you know though we are but three miles from the village metropolis we have no road to it and our goods are brought on the packsaddle and do you knowor i should rather say can you believeor in the famous old tichborne trial phrase would you be surprised to learn that all you have read of vailimaor subpriorsford as i call itis entirely false and we have no icemachine and no electric light and no water supply but the cistern of the heavens and but one public room and scarce a bedroom apiece but of course it is well known that i have made enormous sums by my evanescent literature and you will smile at my false humility the point however is much on our minds just now we are expecting an invasion of kiplings very glad we shall be to see them but two of the party are ladies and i tell you we had to hold a council of war to stow them you european ladies are so particular with all of mine sleeping has long become a public function as with natives and those who go down much into the sea in ships  dear mrs fairchild i must go to my work i have but two words to say in conclusion  first civilisation is rot  second console a savage with more of the milk of that overcivilised being your adorable schoolboy  as i wrote these remarkable words i was called down to eight oclock prayers and have just worked through a chapter of joshua and five verses with five treble choruses of a samoan hymn but the music was good our boys and precentress tis always a woman that leads did better than i ever heard them and to my great pleasure i understood it all except one verse this gave me the more time to try and identify what the parts were doing and further convict my dull ear beyond the fact that the soprano rose to the tonic above on one occasion i could recognise nothing this is sickening but i mean to teach my ear better before i am done with it or this vile carcase  i think it will amuse you for a last word to hear that our precentressshe is the washerwomanis our shame she is a good healthy comely strapping young wench full of energy and seriousness a splendid workwoman delighting to train our chorus delighting in the poetry of the hymns which she reads aloud on the least provocation with a great sentiment of rhythm well then what is curious ah we did not know but it was told us in a whisper from the cookhouseshe is not of good family dont let it get out please everybody knows it of course here there is no reason why europe and the states should have the advantage of me also and the rest of my housefolk are all chiefpeople i assure you and my late overseer far the best of his race is a really serious chief with a good name tina is the name it is not in the almanach de gotha it must have got dropped at press the odd thing is we rather share the prejudice i have almost alwaysthough not quite alwaysfound the higher the chief the better the man through all the islands or at least that the best man came always from a highish rank i hope helen will continue to prove a bright exception  with love to fairchild and the huge schoolboy i am my dear mrs fairchild yours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        vailima march 9th 1892  my dear s ctake it not amiss if this is a wretched letter i am eaten up with business every day this week i have had some business impedimenti am even now waiting a deputation of chiefs about the roadand my precious morning was shattered by a polite old scourge of a faipuleparliament mancome begging all the time david balfour is skelping along i began it the 13th of last month i have now 12 chapters 79 pages ready for press or within an ace and by the time the month is out onehalf should be completed and ill be back at drafting the second half what makes me sick is to think of scott turning out guy mannering in three weeks what a pull of work heavens what thews and sinews and here am i my head spinning from having only rewritten seven not very difficult pagesand not very good when done weakling generation it makes me sick of myself to make such a fash and bobbery over a rotten end of an old nursery yarn not worth spitting on when done still there is no doubt i turn out my work more easily than of yore and i suppose i should be singly glad of that and if i got my book done in six weeks seeing it will be about half as long as a scott and i have to write everything twice it would be about the same rate of industry it is my fair intention to be done with it in three months which would make me about onehalf the man sir walter was for application and driving the dull pen of the merit we shall not talk but i dont think davie is without merit  march 12thand i have this day triumphantly finished 15 chapters 100 pagesbeing exactly onehalf as near as anybody can guess of david balfour the book to be about a fifth as long again altogether as treasure island could i but do the second half in another month but i cant i fear i shall have some belated material arriving by next mail and must go again at the history is it not characteristic of my broken tenacity of mind that i should have left davie balfour some five years in the british linen companys office and then follow him at last with such vivacity but i leave you again the last 15th chapter ought to be rewrote or part of it and i want the half completed in the month and the month is out by midnight though to be sure last month was february and i might take grace these notes are only to show i hold you in mind though i know they can have no interest for man or god or animal  i should have told you about the club we have been asked to try and start a sort of weekly ball for the halfcastes and natives ourselves to be the only whites and we consented from a very heavy sense of duty and with not much hope two nights ago we had twenty people up received them in the front verandah entertained them on cake and lemonade and i made a speechembodying our proposals or conditions if you likefor i suppose thirty minutes no joke to speak to such an audience but it is believed i was thoroughly intelligible i took the plan of saying everything at least twice in a different form of words so that if the one escaped my hearers the other might be seized one white man came with his wife and was kept rigorously on the front verandah below you see what a sea of troubles this is like to prove but it is the only chanceand when it blows up it must blow up i have no more hope in anything than a dead frog i go into everything with a composed despair and dont mindjust as i always go to sea with the conviction i am to be drowned and like it before all other pleasures but you should have seen the return voyage when nineteen horses had to be found in the dark and nineteen bridles all in a drench of rain and the club just constituted as such sailed away in the wet under a cloudy moon like a bad shilling and to descend a road through the forest that was at that moment the image of a respectable mountain brook my wife who is president with power to expel had to begin her functions  25th marchheaven knows what day it is but i am ashamed all the more as your letter from bournemouth of all placespoor old bournemouthis to hand and contains a statement of pleasure in my letters which i wish i could have rewarded with a long one what has gone on a vast of affairs of a mingled strenuous inconclusive desultory character much waste of time much riding to and fro and little transacted or at least peracted  let me give you a review of the present state of our live stocksix boys in the bush six souls about the house talolo the cook returns again today after an absence which has cost me about twelve hours of riding and i suppose eight hours solemn sitting in council i am sorry indeed for the chief justice of samoa i said it is more than i am fit for to be chief justice of vailimalauilo is steward both these are excellent servants we gave a luncheon party when we buried the samoan bones and i assure you all was in good style yet we never interfered the food was good the wine and dishes went round as by mechanismstewards assistant and washman arrick a new hebridee black boy hired from the german firm not so ugly as most but not pretty neither not so

say literally a common woman of course we have outislanders who may be villeins but we give them the benefit of the doubt which is impossible with helen of vailima our blot our pitted speck the pitted

night before after dinner on my endless business took a cup of tea in the mission like an ass then took a cup of coffee like a fool at haggards then fell into a discussion with the american consul i went to bed at haggards came suddenly broad awake and lay sleepless the live night it felt chill i had only a sheet and had to make a light and range the house for a coveri found one in the hall a macintosh so back to my sleepless bed and to lie there till dawn in the morning i had a longish ride to take in a day of a blinding staggering sun and got home by eleven our luncheon hour with my head rather swimmy the only time i have feared the sun since i was in samoa however i got no harm but did not go to the club lay off lazied played the pipe and read a novel by james paynsometimes quite interesting and in one place really very funny with the quaint humour of the man much interested the other day as i rode past a house i saw where a samoan had written a word on a board and there was an inverted a perfectly formed but upside down you never saw such a thing in europe but it is as common as dirt in polynesia mens names are tattooed on the forearm it is common to find a subverted letter tattooed there here is a tempting problem for psychologists  i am now on terms again with the german consulate i know not for how long not of course with the president which i find a relief still with the chief justice and the english consul for haggard i have a genuine affection he is a loveable man  wearyful man here is the yarn of loudon dodd not as he told it but as it was afterwards

about the treasure the master39 will appear and it is to a great extent a tale of prince charlie after the 45 and a love story forbye the hero is a melancholy exile and marries a young woman who interests the prince and there is the devil to pay i think the master kills him in a duel but dont know yet not having yet seen my second heroine nothe master doesnt kill him they fight he is wounded

was the hurricane a difficult problem it so tempted one to be literary and i feel sure the less of that there is in my little handbook the more chance it has of some utility then the events are complicated seven ships to tell of and sometimes three of them together o it was quite a job but i think i have my facts pretty correct and for once in my sickening yarn they are handsome facts creditable to all concerned not to be written ofand i should think scarce to be readwithout a thrill i doubt i have got no hurricane into it the intricacies of the yarn absorbing me too much but thereits done somehow and time presses hard on my heels the book with my best expedition may come just too late to be of use in which case i shall have made a handsome present of some months of my life for nothing and to nobody well through her the most ancient heavens are fresh and strong41  30thafter i had written you i reread my hurricane which is very poor the life of the journalist is hard another couple of writings and i could make a good thing i believe and it must go as it is but of course this book is not written for honour and glory and the few who will read it may not know the difference very little time i go down with the mail shortly dine at the chinese restaurant and go to the club to dance with islandresses think of my going out once a week to dance  politics are on the

by barbey daurevilly   les diabohques              correspondence de henri beyle stendahl  yours sincerely       r l stevenson     to the rev s j whitmee      in this letter the essential points of stevensons policy for samoa    are defined more clearly than anywhere else his correspondent an    experienced missionary who had been absent from the islands and    lately returned and whom stevenson describes as being of a nature    essentially childlike and candid had been induced to support the    idea of a oneman power as necessary for putting an end to the    existing confusion and to suggest the chief justice mr    cedercrantz as the person to wield such power in the present letter    and a subsequent conversation stevenson was able to persuade his    correspondent to abandon at least that part of his proposal which    concerned the chief justice       vailima sunday better day better deed april 24th 1892       private and confidential  dear mr whitmeei have reflected long and fully on your paper and at your kind request give you the benefit of my last thoughts  i i cannot bring myself to welcome your idea of one man i fear we are too far away from any moderative influence and suppose it to be true that the paper is bought we should not even have a voice could we be sure to get a gordon or a lawrence ah very well but in this outoftheway place are these extreme experiments wise remember baker with much that he has done i am in full sympathy and the man though wholly insincere is a thousand miles from illmeaning and see to what excesses he was forced or led  ii but i willingly admit the idea is possible with the right man and this brings me with greater conviction to my next point i cannot endorse and i would rather beg of you to reconsider your recommendation of the chief justice i told you the man has always attracted me yet as i have earnestly reconsidered the points against him i find objection growing  but there is yet another argument i have to lay before you we are both to write upon this subject many of our opinions coincide and as i said the other day on these we may reasonably suppose that we are not far wrong now here is a point on which we shall directly counter no doubt but this will lessen the combined weight of our arguments where they coincide and to avoid this effect it might seem worth while to you to modify or cancel the last paragraph of your article  iii but i now approach what seems to me by far the most important white man here white man there samoa is to stand or fall bar actual seizure on the samoan question and upon this my mind is now really made up i do not believe in laupepa alone i do not believe in mataafa alone i know that their conjunction implies peace i am persuaded that their separation means either war or paralysis it is the result of the past which we cannot change but which we must accept and use or suffer by i have now made up my mind to do all that i may be ablelittle as it isto effect a reconciliation between these two men laupepa and mataafa persuaded as i am that there is the one door of hope and it is my intention before long to approach both in this sense now from the course of our interview i was pleased to see that you were if not equally strong with myself at least inclined to much the same opinion and in a carefully weighed paper such as that you read me i own i should be pleased to have this cardinal matter touched upon at home it is not it cannot be understood mataafa is thought a rebel the germans profit by the thought to pursue their career of vengeance for fagalii the two men are perpetually offered as alternativesthey are no such thingthey are complementary authority supposing them to survive will be impossible without both they were once friends fools and meddlers set them at odds they must be friends again or have so much wisdom and public virtue as to pretend a friendship there is my policy for samoa and i wish you would at least touch upon that point i care not how because although i am far from supposing you feel it to be necessary in the same sense or to the same degree as i do i am well aware that no man knows samoa but must see its huge advantages excuse this long and tedious lecture which i see i have to mark private and confidential or i might get into deep water and believe me yours very truly       robert louis stevenson

balfours adventures in east lothian i suppose there must be a mapmaker of some taste in edinburgh i wish few other names in but what i have given as far as possible as soon as may be i will let you have the text when you might even find some amusement in seeing that the maps fill the bill if your mapmaker be a poor creature plainness is best if he were a fellow of some genuine go he might give it a little of the birdseye quality i leave this to your good taste if i have time i will copy the dedication to go herewith i am pleased with it the first map suppose we take two would go in at the beginning the second at chapter xi the topography is very much worked into the story and i have alluded in the dedication to our common fancy for exploring auld reekie  the list of books came duly for which many thanks i am plunged to the nostrils in various businessyours ever       r l s     to sidney colvin        vailima may 1st 1892  my dear colvinas i rode down last night about six i saw a sight i must try to tell you of in front of me right over the top of the forest into which i was descending was a vast cloud the front of it accurately represented the somewhat rugged longnosed and beetlebrowed profile of a man crowned by a huge kalmuck cap the flesh part was of a heavenly pink the cap the moustache the eyebrows were of a bluish grey to see this with its childish exactitude of design and colour and hugeness of scaleit covered at least 25°held me spellbound as i continued to gaze the expression began to change he had the exact air of closing one eye dropping his jaw and drawing down his nose had the thing not been so imposing i could have smiled and then almost in a moment a shoulder of leadencoloured bank drove in front and blotted it my attention spread to the rest of the cloud and it was a thing to worship it rose from the horizon and its top was within thirty degrees of the zenith the lower parts were like a glacier in shadow varying from dark indigo to a clouded white in exquisite gradations the sky behind so far as i could see was all of a blue already enriched and darkened by the night for the hill had what lingered of the sunset but the top of my titanic cloud flamed in broad sunlight with the most excellent softness and brightness of fire and jewels enlightening all the world it must have been far higher than mount everest and its glory as i gazed up at it out of the night was beyond wonder close by rode the little crescent moon and right over its western horn a great planet of about equal lustre with itself the dark woods below were shrill with that noisy business of the birds evening worship when i returned after eight the moon was near down she seemed little brighter than before but now that the cloud no longer played its part of a nocturnal sun we could see that sight so rare with us at home that it was counted a portent so customary in the tropics of the dark sphere with its little gilt band upon the belly the planet had been setting faster and was now below the crescent they were still of an equal brightness  i could not resist trying to reproduce this in words as a specimen of these incredibly beautiful and imposing meteors of the tropic sky that make so much of my pleasure here though a ships deck is the place to enjoy them o what awful scenery from a ships deck in the tropics people talk about the alps but the clouds of the trade wind are alone for sublimity  now to try and tell you what has been happening the state of these islands and of mataafa and laupepa malietoas ambo had been much on my mind i went to the priests and sent a message to mataafa at a time when it was supposed he was about to act he did not act delaying in true native style and i determined i should go to visit him i have been very good not to go sooner to live within a few miles of a rebel camp to be a novelist to have all my family forcing me to go and to refrain all these months counts for virtue but hearing that several people had gone and the government done nothing to punish them and having an errand there which was enough to justify myself in my own eyes i half determined to go and spoke of it with the halfcaste priest and here confound it up came laupepa and his guards to call on me we kept him to lunch and the old gentleman was very good and amiable he asked me why i had not been to see him i reminded him a law had been made and told him i was not a small boy to go and ask leave of the consuls and perhaps be refused he told me to pay no attention to the law but come when i would and begged me to name a day to lunch the next day i think it was early in the morning a man appeared he had metal buttons like a policemanbut he was none of our apia force he was a rebel policeman and had been all night coming round inland through the forest from malie he brought a letter addressed    i lana susuga   to his excellency     misi mea           mr thingumbob  so as not to compromise me i can read samoan now though not speak it it was to ask me for last wednesday my difficulty was great i had no man here who was fit or who would have cared to write for me and i had to postpone the visit so i gave up halfaday with a groan went down to the priests arranged for monday week to go to malie and named thursday as my day to lunch with laupepa i was sharply ill on wednesday mail day but on thursday i had to trail down and go through the dreary business of a feast in the kings wretched shanty full in view of the presidents fine new house it made my heart burn  this gave me my chance to arrange a private interview with the king and i decided to ask mr whitmee to be my interpreter on friday being too much exhausted to go down i begged him to come up he did i told him the heads of what i meant to say and he not only consented but said if we got on well with the king he would even proceed with me to malie yesterday in consequence i rode down to ws house by eight in the morning waited till ten received a message that the king was stopped by a meeting with the president and faipule made another engagement for seven at night came up went down waited till eight and came away again bredouille and a dead body the poor weak enslaved king had not dared to come to me even in secret now i have today for a rest and tomorrow to malie shall i be suffered to embark it is very doubtful they are on the trail on thursday a policeman came up to me and began that a boy had been to see him and said i was going to see mataafaand what did you say said ii told him i did not know about where you were going said hea very good answer said i and turned away it is lashing rain today but tomorrow rain or shine i must at least make the attempt and i am so weary and the weather looks so bad i could half wish they would arrest me on the beach all this bother and pother to try and bring a little chance of peace all this opposition and obstinacy in people who remain here by the mere forbearance of mataafa who has a great force within six miles of their government buildings which are indeed only the residences of white officials to understand how i have been occupied you must know that misi mea has had another letter and this time had to answer himself think of doing so in a language so obscure to me with the aid of a bible concordance and dictionary what a wonderful baboo compilation it must have been i positively expected to hear news of its arrival in malie by the sound of laughter i doubt if you will be able to read this scrawl but i have managed to scramble somehow up to date and tomorrow one way or another should be interesting but as for me i am a wreck as i have no doubt style and handwriting both testify  8 pmwonderfully rested feel almost fit for tomorrows dreary excursionnot that it will be dreary if the weather favour but otherwise it will be death and a native feast and i fear i am in for a big one is a thing i loathe i wonder if you can really conceive me as a politician in this extramundane spherepresiding at public meetings drafting proclamations receiving misaddressed letters that have been carried all night through tropical forests it seems strange indeed and to you who know me really must seem stranger i do not say i am free from the itch of meddling but god knows this is no tempting job to meddle in i smile at picturesque circumstances like the misi mea monsieur chose is the exact equivalent correspondence but the business as a whole bores and revolts me i do nothing and say nothing and then a day comes and i say this can go on no longer  930 pmthe wretched native dilatoriness finds me out news has just come that we must embark at six tomorrow i have divided the night in watches and hope to be called tomorrow at four and get under way by five it is a great chance if it be managed but i have given directions and lent my own clock to the boys and hope the best if i get called at four we shall do it nicely goodnight i must turn in  may 3rdwell we did get off by about 530 or byr lady quarter to six myself on donald the huge grey carthorse with a shipbag across my saddle bow fanny on musu and belle on jack we were all feeling pretty tired and sick and i looked like heaven knows what on the carthorse death on the pale horse i suggestedand young hunt the missionary who met me today on the same charger squinted up at my perch and remarked theres a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft the boat was ready and we set off down the lagoon about seven four oars and talolo my cook steering  may 9th monday anywayand see what good resolutions came to here is all this time past and no speed made well we got to malie and were received with the most friendly consideration by the rebel chief belle and fanny were obviously thought to be my two wives they were served their kava together as were mataafa and myself talolo utterly broke down as interpreter long speeches were made to me by mataafa and his orators of which he could make nothing but they were very much surprisedhis way of pronouncing obligedand as he could understand nothing that fell from me except the same form of words the dialogue languished and all business had to be laid aside we had kava42 and then a dish of arrowroot one end of the house was screened off for us with a fine tapa and we lay and slept the three of us heads and tails upon the mats till dinner after dinner his illegitimate majesty and myself had a walk and talked as well as my twopenny samoan would admit then there was a dance to amuse the ladies before the house and we came back by moonlight the sky piled full of high faint clouds that long preserved some of the radiance of the sunset the lagoon was very shallow we continually struck for the moon was young and the light baffling and for a long time we were accompanied by and passed and repassed a huge whaleboat from savaii pulling perhaps twelve oars and containing perhaps forty people who sang in time as they went so to the hotel where we slept and returned the next tuesday morning on the three same steeds  meanwhile my business was still untransacted and on saturday morning i sent down and arranged with charlie taylor to go down that afternoon i had scarce got the saddlebags fixed and had not yet mounted when the rain began but it was no use delaying now off i went in a wild waterspout to apia found charlie salé taylora sesquipedalian young halfcastenot yet ready had a snack of bread and cheese at the hotel while waiting him and then off to malie it rained all the way seven miles the road which begins in triumph dwindles down to a nasty boggy rocky footpath with weeds up to a horsemans knees and there are eight pig fences to jump nasty beastly jumpsthe next morning we found one all messed with blood where a horse had come to griefbut my jack is a clever fencer and altogether we made good time and got to malie about dark it is a village of very fine native houses high domed oval buildings open at the sides or only closed with slatted venetians to be sure mataafas is not the worst it was already quite dark within only a little fire of cocoashell blazed in the midst and showed us four servants the chief was in his chapel whence we heard the sound of chaunting presently he returned taylor and i had our soaking clothes changed family worship was held kava brewed i was exhibited to the chiefs as a man who had ridden through all that rain and risked deportation to serve their master they were bidden learn my face and remember upon all occasions to help and serve me then dinner and politics and fine speeches until twelve at nighto and some more kavawhen i could sit up no longer my usual bedtime is eight you must remember then one end of the house was screened off for me alone and a bed madeyou never saw such a couchi believe of nearly fifty half at least fine mats by mataafas daughter kalala here i reposed alone and on the other side of the tapa majesty and his household armed guards and a drummer patrolled about the house all night they had no shift poor devils but stood to arms from sundown to sunup  about four in the morning i was awakened by the sound of a whistle pipe blown outside on the dark very softly and to a pleasing simple air i really think i have hit the first phrase  illustration andante tranquillo  it sounded very peaceful sweet and strange in the dark and i found this was a part of the routine of my rebels night and it was done he said to give good dreams by a little before six taylor and i were in the saddle again fasting my riding boots were so wet i could not get them on so i must ride barefoot the morning was fair but the roads very muddy the weeds soaked us nearly to the waist salé was twice spilt at the fences and we got to apia a bedraggled enough pair all the way along the coast the paté small wooden drum was beating in the villages and the people crowding to the churches in their fine clothes thence through the mangrove swamp among the black mud and the green mangroves and the black and scarlet crabs to mulinuu to the doctors where i had an errand and so to the inn to breakfast about nine after breakfast i rode home conceive such an outing remember the pallid brute that lived in skerryvore like a weevil in a biscuit and receive the intelligence that i was rather the better for my journey twenty miles ride sixteen fences taken ten of the miles in a drenching rain seven of them fasting and in the morning chill and six stricken hours political discussions by an interpreter to say nothing of sleeping in a native house at which many of our excellent literati would look askance of itself  you are to understand if i take all this bother it is not only from a sense of duty or a love of meddlingdamn the phrase take your choicebut from a great affection for mataafa he is a beautiful sweet old fellow and he and i grew quite fulsome on saturday night about our sentiments i had a messenger from him today with a flannel undershirt which i had left behind like a gibbering idiot and perpetrated in reply another baboo letter it rains again today without mercy blessed welcome rains making up for the paucity of the late wet season and when the showers slacken i can hear my stream roaring in the hollow and tell myself that the cacaos are drinking deep i am desperately hunted to finish my samoa book before the mail goes this last chapter is equally delicate and necessary the prayers of the congregation are requested eheu and it will be ended before this letter leaves and printed in the states ere you can read this scribble the first dinner gong has sounded je vous salue monsieur et cher confrère tofa soifua sleep long life as our samoan salutation of farewell runs  friday may 13thwell the last chapter by far the most difficult and ungrateful is well under way i have been from six to seven hours upon it daily since i last wrote and that is all i have done forbye working at samoan rather hard and going down on wednesday evening to the club i make some progress now at the language i am teaching belle which clears and exercises myself i am particularly taken with the finesse of the pronouns the pronouns are all dual and plural and the first person both in the dual and plural has a special exclusive and inclusive form you can conceive what fine effects of precision and distinction can be reached in certain cases take ruth i vv 8 to 13 and imagine how those pronouns come in it is exquisitely elegant and makes the mouth of the littérateur to water i am going to exercitate my pupil over those verses today for pronoun practice  tuesdayyesterday came yours well well if the dears prefer a week why ill give them ten days but the real document from which i have scarcely varied ran for one night43 i think you seem scarcely fair to wiltshire who had surely under his beastignorant ways right noble qualities and i think perhaps you scarce do justice to the fact that this is a place of realism à outrance nothing extenuated or coloured looked at so is it not with all its tragic features wonderfully idyllic with great beauty of scene and circumstance and will you please to observe that almost all that is ugly is in the whites ill apologise for papa randal if you like but if i told you the whole truthfor i did extenuate thereand he seemed to me essential as a figure and essential as a pawn in the game wiltshires disgust for him being one of the small efficient motives in the story now it would have taken a fairish dose to disgust wiltshireagain the idea of publishing the beach substantively is droppedat once both on account of expostulation and because it measured shorter than i had expected and it was only taken up when the proposed volume beach de mar petered out it petered out thus the chief of the short stories got sucked into sophia scarletand sophia is a book i am much taken with and mean to get to as soon asbut not beforei have done david balfour and the young chevalier so you see you are like to hear no more of the pacific or the nineteenth century for a while the young chevalier is a story of sentiment and passion which i mean to write a little differently from what i have been doingif i can hit the key rather more of a sentimental tremolo to it it may thus help to prepare me for sophia which is to contain three ladies and a kind of a love affair between the heroine and a dying planter who is a poet large orders for r l s  o the german taboo is quite over no soul attempts to support the c j or the president they are past hope the whites have just refused their taxesi mean the council has refused to call for them and if the council consented nobody would pay tis a farce and the curtain is going to fall briefly consequently in my history i say as little as may be of the two dwindling stars poor devils i liked the one and the other has a little wife now lying in there was no man born with so little animosity as i when i heard the c j was in low spirits and never left his house i could scarce refrain from going to him  it was a fine feeling to have finished the history there ought to be a future state to reward that grind its not literature you know only journalism and pedantic journalism i had but the one desire to get the thing as right as might be and avoid false concordseven if that and it was more than there was time for however there it is done and if samoa turns up again my book has to be counted with being the only narrative extant milton and iif you kindly excuse the juxtapositionharnessed ourselves to strange waggons and i at least will be found to have plodded very soberly with my load there is not even a good sentence in it but perhapsi dont knowit may be found an honest clear volume  wednesdaynever got a word set down and continues on thursday 19th may his own marriage day as ever was news yes the c j came up to call on us after five months cessation on my side and a decidedly painful interchange of letters i could not go downcould notto see him my three ladies received him however he was very agreeable as usual but refused wine beer water lemonade chocolate and at last a cigarette then my wife asked him so you refuse to break bread and he waved his hands amiably in answer all my three ladies received the same impression that he had serious matters in his mind now we hear he is quite cockahoop since the mail came and going about as before his troubles darkened but what did he want with me tis thought he had received a despatchand that he misreads it so we fully believe to the effect that they are to have war ships at command and can make their little war after all if it be so and they do it it will be the meanest wanton slaughter of poor men for the salaries of two white failures but what was his errand with me perhaps to warn me that unless i behave he now hopes to be able to pack me off in the curaçoa when she comes  i have celebrated my holiday from samoa by a plunge at the beginning of the young chevalier i am afraid my touch is a little broad in a love story i cant mean one thing and write another as for women i am no more in any fear of them i can do a sort all right age makes me less afraid of a petticoat but i am a little in fear of grossness however this david balfours love affair thats all rightmight be read out to a mothers meetingor a daughters meeting the difficulty in a love yarn which dwells at all on love is the dwelling on one string it is manifold i grant but the root fact is there unchanged and the sentiment being very intense and already very much handled in letters positively calls for a little pawing and gracing with a writer of my prosaic literalness and pertinency of point of view this all shoves toward grossnesspositively even toward the far more damnable closeness this has kept me off the sentiment hitherto and now i am to try lord of course meredith can do it and so could shakespeare but with all my romance i am a realist and a prosaist and a most fanatical lover of plain physical sensations plainly and expressly rendered hence my perils to do love in the same spirit as i did for instance d balfours fatigue in the heather my dear sir there were grossnessready made and hence how to sugar however i have nearly done with mariemadeleine and am in good hopes of mariesalomé the real heroine the other is only a prologuial heroine to introduce the hero  fridayanyway the first prologuial episode is done and fanny likes it there are only four characters francis blair of balmile jacobite lord gladsmuir my hero the master of ballantrae paradou a wineseller of avignon mariemadeleine his wife these two last i am now done with and i think they are successful and i hope i have balmile on his feet and the style seems to be found it is a little charged and violent sins on the side of violence but i think will carry the tale i think it is a good idea so to introduce my hero being made love to by an episodic woman this queer talei mean queer for mehas taken a great hold upon me where the devil shall i go next this is simply the tale of a coup de tête of a young man and a young woman with a nearly perhaps a wholly tragic sequel which i desire to make thinkable right through and sensible to make the reader as far as i shall be able eat and drink and breathe it mariesalomé des saintesmaries is i think the heroines name she has got to be yet sursum corda so has the young chevalier whom i have not yet touched and who comes next in order characters balmile or lord gladsmuir comme vous voulez prince charlie earl marischal master of ballantrae and a spy and dr archie campbell and a few nondescripts then of women mariesalomé and flora blair seven at the outside really four full lengths and i suppose a halfdozen episodic profiles how i must bore you with these ineptitudes have patience i am going to bed it is of all hours eleven i have been forced in since i began to write to you to blatter to fanny on the subject of my heroine there being two cruces as to her life and history how came she alone and how far did she go with the chevalier the second must answer itself when i get near enough to see the first is a backbreaker yet i know there are many reasons why a fille de famille romantic adventurous ambitious innocent of the world might run from her home in these days might she not have been threatened with a convent might there not be some huguenot business mixed in here am i far from books if you can help me with a suggestion i shall say god bless you she has to be new run away from a strict family welljustified in her own wild but honest eyes and meeting these three men charles edward marischal and balmile through the accident of a fire at an inn she must not run from a marriage i think it would bring her in the wrong frame of mind once i can get her sola on the highway all were well with my narrative perpend and help if you can  lafaele long i hope familiar to you has this day received the visit of his son from tonga and the son proves to be a very pretty attractive young daughter i gave all the boys kava in honour of her arrival along with a lean sidewhiskered tongan dimly supposed to be lafaeles stepfather and they have been having a good time in the end of my verandah i hear simi my present incapable steward talking tongan with the nondescript papa simi our outdoor boy burst a succession of bloodvessels over our work and i had to make a position for the wreck of one of the noblest figures of a man i ever saw i believe i may have mentioned the other day how i had to put my horse to the trot the canter and at last the gallop to run him down in a photograph i hope to send you perhaps with this you will see simi standing in the verandah in profile as a steward one of his chief points is to break crystal he is great on fracturewhat do i sayexplosion he cleans a glass and the shards scatter like a comets bowels  nbif i should by any chance be deported the first of the rules hung up for that occasion is to communicate with you by telegraphmind i do not fear it but it is possible  monday 25thwe have had a devil of a morning of upset and bustle the bronze candlestick faauma has returned to the family in time to take her position of stepmamma and it is pretty to see how the child is at once at home and all her terrors ended  27th mail dayand i dont know that i have much to report i may have to leave for malie as soon as these mail packets are made up tis a necessity if it be one i rather deplore i think i should have liked to lazy but i dare say all it means is the delay of a day or so in harking back to david balfour that respectable youth chides at being left where he is now in glasgow with the lord advocate and after five years in the british linen who shall blame him i was all forenoon yesterday down in apia dictating and lloyd typewriting the conclusion of samoa and then at home correcting till the dinner bell and in the evening again till eleven of the clock this morning i have made up most of my packets and i think my mail is all ready but two more and the tag of this i would never deny as d b might say that i was rather tired of it but i have a damned good dose of the devil in my pipestem atomy i have had my little holiday outing in my kick at the young chevalier and i guess i can settle to david balfour tomorrow or friday like a little man i wonder if any one had ever more energy upon so little strengthi know there is a frost the samoa book can only increase thati cant help it that book is not written for me but for miss manners but i mean to break that frost inside two years and pull off a big success and vanity whispers in my ear that i have the strength if i havent whistle ower the lave ot i can do without glory and perhaps the time is not far off when i can do without coin it is a time coming soon enough anyway and i have endured some two and forty years without public shame and had a good time as i did it if only i could secure a violent death what a fine success i wish to die in my boots no more land of counterpane for me to be drowned to be shot to be thrown from a horseay to be hanged rather than pass again through that slow dissolution  i fancy this gloomy ramble is caused by a twinge of age i put on an undershirt yesterday it was the only one i could find that barely came under my trousers and just below it a fine healthy rheumatism has now settled like a fire in my hip from such small causes do these valuable considerations flow  i shall now say adieu dear sir having ten rugged miles before me and the horrors of a native feast and parliament without an interpreter for today i go aloneyours ever       r l s     to sidney colvin    describing a family expedition to visit mataafa at malie        vailima sunday 29th may 1892  how am i to overtake events on wednesday as soon as my mail was finished i had a wild whirl to look forward to immediately after dinner belle lloyd and i set out on horseback they to the club i to haggards thence to the hotel where i had supper ready for them all next day we hung round apia with our whole housecrowd in sunday array hoping for the mail steamer with a menagerie on board no such luck the ship delayed and at last about three i had to send them home again a failure of a days pleasuring that does not bear to be discussed lloyd was so sickened that he returned the same night to vailima belle and i held on sat most of the evening on the hotel verandah stricken silly with fatigue and disappointment and genuine sorrow for our poor boys and girls and got to bed with rather dismal appreciations of the morrow  these were more than justified and yet i never had a jollier day than friday 27th by 730 belle and i had breakfast we had scarce done before my mother was at the door on horseback and a boy at her heels to take her not very dashing charger home again by 810 we were all on the landing pier and it was 920 before we had got away in a boat with two inches of green wood on the keel of her no rudder no mast no sail no boat flag two defective rowlocks two wretched apologies for oars and two boysone a tongan halfcaste one a white lad son of the tonga schoolmaster and a sailor ladto pull us all this was our first taste of the tender mercies of taylor the sesquipedalian halfcaste introduced two letters back i believe we had scarce got round mulinuu when salé taylors heart misgave him he thought we had missed the tide called a halt and set off ashore to find canoes two were found in one my mother and i were embarked with the two biscuit tins my present to the feast and the bag with our dry clothes on which my mother was perchedand her cap was on the top of itfeminine hearts please sympathise all under the guidance of salé in the other belle and our guest tauilo a chiefwoman the mother of my cook were to have followed and the boys were to have been left with the boat but tauilo refused and the four belle tauilo frank the sailorboy and jimmie the tongan halfcaste set off in the boat across that rapidly shoaling bay of the lagoon  how long the next scene lasted i could never tell salé was always trying to steal away with our canoe and leave the other four probably for six hours in an empty leaky boat without so much as an orange or a cocoanut on board and under the direct rays of the sun i had at last to stop him by taking the spare paddle off the outrigger and sticking it in the grounddepth perhaps two feetwidth of the bay say three miles at last i bid him land me and my mother and go back for the other ladies the coast is so rugged said saléwhat i said all these villages and no landingplacesuch is the nature of samoans said he well ill find a landingplace i thought and presently i said now we are going to land therewe can but try said the bland salé with resignation never saw a better landingplace in my life here the boat joined us my mother and salé continued in the canoe alone and belle and i and tauilo set off on foot for malie tauilo was about the size of both of us put together and a piece over she used us like a nurse with children i had started barefoot belle had soon to pull off her gala shoes and stockings the mud was as deep as to our knees and so slippery that moving as we did in indian file between dense scratching tufts of sensitive belle and i had to take hands to support each other and tauilo was steadying belle from the rear you can conceive we were got up to kill belle in an embroidered white dress and white hat i in a suit of bedford cords hot from the sydney tailors and conceive us below inkblack to the knees with adhesive clay and above streaming with heat i suppose it was better than three miles but at last we made the end of malie i asked if we could find no water to wash our feet and our nursemaid guided us to a pool we sat down on the pool side and our nursemaid washed our feet and legs for usladies first i suppose out of a sudden respect to the insane european fancies such a luxury as you can scarce imagine i felt a new man after it but before we got to the kings house we were sadly muddied once more it was 1 pm when we arrived the canoe having beaten us by about five minutes so we made fair time over our bogholes  but the war dances were over and we came in time to see only the tail end some two hours of the food presentation in mataafas house three chairs were set for us covered with fine mats of course a native house without the blinds down is like a verandah all the green in front was surrounded with sheds some of flapping canvas some of green palm boughs where in three sides of a huge oblong the natives sat by villages in a fine glow of manyhued array there were folks in tapa and folks in patchwork there was every colour of the rainbow in a spot or a cluster there were men with their heads gilded with powdered sandalwood others with heads all purple stuck full of the petals of a flower in the midst there was a growing field of outspread food gradually covering acres the gifts were brought in now by chanting deputations now by carriers in a file they were brandished aloft and reclaimed over with polite sacramental exaggerations by the official receiver he a stalwart welloiled quadragenarian shone with sweat from his exertions brandishing cooked pigs at intervals from one of the squatted villages an orator would arise the field was almost beyond the reach of any human speaking voice the proceedings besides continued in the midst yet it was possible to catch snatches of this elaborate and cutanddry oratoryit was possible for me for instance to catch the description of my gift and myself as the alii tusitala o le alii o malo tetelethe chief write information the chief of the great governments gay designation in the house in our three curule chairs we sat and looked on on our left a little group of the family in front of us at our feet an ancient talkingman crowned with green leaves his profile almost exactly dantes popo his name he had worshipped idols in his youth he had been full grown before the first missionary came hither from tahiti this makes him over eighty near by him sat his son and colleague in the group on our left his little grandchild sat with her legs crossed and her hands turned the model already at some three years old of samoan etiquette still further off to our right mataafa sat on the ground through all the business and still i saw his lips moving and the beads of his rosary slip stealthily through his hand we had kava and the kings drinking was hailed by the popos father and son with a singular ululation perfectly new to my ears it means to the expert long live tuiatua to the inexpert is a mere voice of barbarous wolves we had dinner retired a bit behind the central pillar of the house and when the king was done eating the ululation was repeated i had my eyes on mataafas face and i saw pride and gratified ambition spring to life there and be instantly sucked in again it was the first time since the difference with laupepa that popo and his son had openly joined him and given him the due cry as tuiatuaone of the eight royal names of the islands as i hope you will know before this reaches you  not long after we had dined the foodbringing was over the gifts carefully noted and tallied as they came in were now announced by a humorous orator who convulsed the audience introducing singing notes now on the name of the article now on the number six thousand odd heads of taro three hundred and nineteen cooked pigs and one thing that particularly caught me by good luck a single turtle for the kingle tasi mo le tupu then came one of the strangest sights i have yet witnessed the two most important persons there bar mataafa were popo and his son they rose holding their long shod rods of talking men passed forth from the house broke into a strange dance the father capering with outstretched arms and rod the son crouching and gambolling beside him in a manner indescribable and presently began to extend the circle of this dance among the acres of cooked food whatever they leaped over whatever they called for became theirs to see mediæval dante thus demean himself struck a kind of a chill of incongruity into our philistine souls but even in a great part of the samoan concourse these antique and i understand quite local manners awoke laughter one of my biscuit tins and a live calf were among the spoils he claimed but the large majority of the cooked food having once proved his dignity he represented to the king  then came the turn of le alii tusitala he would not dance but he was givenfive live hens four gourds of oil four fine tapas a hundred heads of taro two cooked pigs a cooked shark two or three cocoanut branches strung with kava and the turtle who soon after breathed his last i believe from sunstroke it was a royal present for the chief of the great powers i should say the gifts were on the proper signal dragged out of the field of food by a troop of young men all with their lavalavas kilted almost into a loincloth the art is to swoop on the foodfield pick up with unerring swiftness the right things and quantities swoop forth again on the open and separate leaving the gifts in a new pile so you may see a covey of birds in a cornfield this reminds me of a very inhumane but beautiful passage i had forgotten in its place the giftgiving was still in full swing when there came a troop of some ninety men all in tapa lavalavas of a purplish colour they paused and of a sudden there went up from them high into the air a flight of live chickens which as they came down again were sent again into the air for perhaps a minute from the midst of a singular turmoil of flying arms and shouting voices i assure you it was very beautiful to see but how many chickens were killed  no sooner was my food set out than i was to be going i had a little serious talk with mataafa on the floor and we went down to the boat where we got our food aboard such a cargolike the swiss family robinson we said however a squall began tauilo refused to let us go and we came back to the house for half an hour or so when my ladies distinguished themselves by walking through a fono council my mother actually taking up a position between mataafa and popo it was about five when we startedturtle pigs taro etc my mother belle myself tauilo a portly friend of hers with the voice of an angel and a pronunciation so delicate and true that you could follow samoan as she sang and the two tired boys frank and jimmie with the two bad oars and the two slippery rowlocks to impel the whole salé taylor took the canoe and a strong samoan to paddle him presently after he went inshore and passed us a little after with his arms folded and two strong samoans impelling him apiaward this was too much for belle who hailed taunted him and made him return to the boat with one of the samoans setting jimmie instead in the canoe then began our torment salé and the samoan took the oars sat on the same thwart where they could get no swing on the boat had they tried and deliberately ladled at the lagoon we lay enchanted night fell there was a light visible on shore it did not move the two women sang belle joining them in the hymns she has learned at family worship then a squall came up we sat a while in roaring midnight under rivers of rain and when it blew by there was the light again immovable a second squall followed one of the worst i was ever out in we could scarce catch our breath in the cold dashing deluge when it went we were so cold that the water in the bottom of the boat which i was then baling seemed like a warm footbath in comparison and belle and i who were still barefoot were quite restored by laving in it  all this time i had kept my temper and refrained as far as might be from any interference for i saw in our friends mulish humour he always contrived to twist it to our disadvantage but now came the acute point young frank now took an oar he was a little fellow near as frail as myself and very short if he weighed nine stone it was the outside but his blood was up he took stroke moved the big samoan forward to bow and set to work to pull him round in fine style instantly a kind of race competitionalmost race hatredsprang up we jeered the samoan salé declared it was the trim of the boat if this lady was aft tauilos portly friend he would row round frank we insisted on her coming aft and frank still rowed round the samoan when the samoan caught a crab the thing was continual with these wretched oars and rowlocks we shouted and jeered when frank caught one salé and the samoan jeered and yelled but anyway the boat moved and presently we got up with mulinuu where i finally lost my temper when i found that salé proposed to go ashore and make a visitin fact we all three did it is not worth while going into but i must give you one snatch of the subsequent conversation as we pulled round apia bay this samoan said salé received seven german bullets in the field of fangalii i am delighted to hear it said belle his brother was killed there pursued salé and belle prompt as an echo then there are no more of the family how delightful salé was sufficiently surprised to change the subject he began to praise franks rowing with insufferable condescension but it is after all not to be wondered at said he because he has been for some time a sailor my good man is it three or five years that you have been to sea and frank in a defiant shout two whereupon so high did the illfeeling run that we three clapped and applauded and shouted so that the president whose house we were then passing doubtless started at the sounds it was nine when we got to the hotel at first no food was to be found but we skirmished up some bread and cheese and beer and brandy and having changed our wet clothes for the rather less wet in our bags supped on the verandah  on saturday 28th i was wakened about 630 long past my usual hour by a benevolent passerby my turtle lay on the verandah at my door and the man woke me to tell me it was dead as it had been when we put it on board the day before all morning i ran the gauntlet of men and women coming up to me mr stevenson your turtle is dead i gave half of it to the hotel keeper so that his cook should cut it up and we got a damaged shell and two splendid meals beefsteak one day and soup the next the horses came for us about 930 it was waterspouting we were drenched before we got out of the town the road was a fine going highland trout stream it thundered deep and frequent and my mothers horse would not better on a walk at last she took pity on us and very nobly proposed that belle and i should ride ahead we were mighty glad to do so for we were cold presently i said i should ride back for my mother but it thundered again belle is afraid of thunder and i decided to see her through the forest before i returned for my other heni may say my other wet hen about the middle of the wood where it is roughest and steepest we met three packhorses with barrels of limejuice i piloted belle past theseit is not very easy in such a roadand then passed them again myself to pilot my mother this effected it began to thunder again so i rode on hard after belle when i caught up with her she was singing samoan hymns to support her terrors we were all back changed and at table by lunch time 11 am nor have any of us been the worse for it sinsyne that is pretty good for a woman of my mothers age and an invalid of my standing above all as tauilo was laid up with a bad cold probably increased by rage  friday 3rd juneon wednesday the club could not be held and i must ride down town and to and fro all afternoon delivering messages then dined and rode up by the young moon i had plenty news when i got back there is great talk in town of my deportation it is thought they have written home to downing street requesting my removal which leaves me not much alarmed what i do rather expect is that h j moors and i may be haled up before the c j to stand a trial for lèsemajesty well well try and live it through  the rest of my history since monday has been unadulterated david balfour in season and out of season night and day david and his innocent haremlet me be just he never has more than the twoare on my mind think of david balfour with a pair of fair ladiesvery nice ones toohanging round him i really believe david is as good a character as anybody has a right to ask for in a novel i have finished drafting chapter xx today and feel it all ready to froth when the spigot is turned  o i forgotand do forget what did i mean a waft of cloud has fallen on my mind and i will write no more  wednesday i believe 8th junelots of david and lots of david and the devil any other news yesterday we were startled by great guns firing a salute and today whitmee missionary rode up to lunch and we learned it was the curaçoa come in the ship according to rumour in which i was to be deported i went down to meet my fate and the captain is to dine with me saturday so i guess i am not going this voyage even with the particularity with which i write to you how much of my life goes unexpressed my troubles with a madman by the name of  a genuine living lunatic i believe and jolly dangerous my troubles about poor  all these have dropped out yet for moments they were very instant and one of them is always present with me  i have finished copying chapter xxi of davidsolus cum sola we travel together chapter xxii solus cum sola we keep house together is already drafted to the end of xxi makes more than 150 pages of my manuscriptdamn this hairand i only designed the book to run to about 200 but when you introduce the female sect a book does run away with you i am very curious to see what you will think of my two girls my own opinion is quite clear i am in love with both i foresee a few pleasant years of spiritual flirtations the creator if i may name myself for the sake of argument by such a name is essentially unfaithful for the duration of the two chapters in which i dealt with miss grant i totally forgot my heroine and evenbut this is a flat secrettried to win away david i think i must try some day to marry miss grant im blest if i dont think ive got that hair out which seems triumph enough so i conclude  tuesdayyour infinitesimal correspondence has reached me and i have the honour to refer to it with scorn it contains only one statement of conceivable interest that your health is better the rest is null and so far as disquisitory unsound i am all right but david balfour is ailing this came from my visit to the manofwar where i had a cup of tea and the most of that night walked the verandah with extraordinary convictions of guilt and ruin many of which but not all proved to have fled with the day taking david along with them he rip in chapter xxii  on saturday i went down to the town and fetched up captain gibson to dinner sunday i was all day at samoa and had a pile of visitors yesterday got my mail including your despicable sheet was fooled with a visit from the high chief asi went down at 4 pm to my samoan lesson from whitmeei think i shall learn from him he does not fool me with cockshot rules that are demolished next day but professes ignorance like a man the truth is the grammar has still to be expiscateddined with haggard and got home about nine  wednesdaythe excellent clarke up here almost all day yesterday a man i esteem and like to the soles of his boots i prefer him to any one in samoa and to most people in the world a real good missionary with the inestimable advantage of having grown up a layman pity they all cant get that it recalls my old proposal which delighted lady taylor so much that every divinity student should be thirty years old at least before he was admitted boys switched out of college into a pulpit what chance have they that any should do well amazes me and the most are just what was to be expected  saturdayi must tell you of our feast it was long promised to the boys and came off yesterday in one of their new houses my good simelé arrived from savaii that morning asking for political advice then we had tauilo elenas father a talking man of tauilos family talolos cousin and a boy of simelés family who attended on his dignity then metu the meatmanyou have never heard of him but he is a great person in our householdbrought a lady and a boyand there was another infanteight guests in all and we sat down thirty strong you should have seen our procession going about two oclock all in our best clothes to the hall of feasting all in our sundays best the new house had been hurriedly finished the rafters decorated with flowers the floor spread native style with green leaves we had given a big porker twentyfive pounds of fresh beef a tin of biscuit cocoanuts etc our places were all arranged with much care the native ladies of the house facing our party the sides filled up by the men the guests please observe the two chief people male and female were placed with our family the rest between s and the native ladies after the feast was over we had kava and the calling of the kava was a very elaborate affair and i thought had like to have made simelé very angry he is really a considerable chief but he and tauilo were not called till after all our family and the guests i suppose the principle being that he was still regarded as one of the household i forgot to say that our black boy did not turn up when the feast was ready off went the two cooks found him decorated him with huge red hibiscus flowershe was in a very dirty undershirtbrought him back between them like a reluctant maid and thrust him into a place between faauma and elena where he was petted and ministered to when his turn came in the kava drinkingand you may be sure in their contemptuous affectionate kindness for him as for a good dog it came rather earlier than it oughthe was cried under a new name aleki is what they make of his own name arrick but instead of the cup of  le ipu a aleki it was called le ipu a vailima and it was explained that he had taken his chiefname a jest at which the plantation still laughs kava done i made a little speech henry translating if i had been well i should have alluded to all but i was scarce able to sit up so only alluded to my guest of all this month the tongan tomas and to simelé partly for the jest of making him translate compliments to himself the talking man replied with many handsome compliments to me in the usual flood of samoan fluent neatness and we left them to an afternoon of singing and dancing must stop now as my right hand is very bad again i am trying to write with my left  sundayabout halfpast eight last night i had gone to my own room fanny and lloyd were in fannys every one else in bed only two boys on the premisesthe two little brown boys mitaiele michael age i suppose 11 or 12 and the new steward a wallis islander speaking no english and about fifty words of samoan recently promoted from the bush work and a most good anxious timid lad of 15 or 16looks like 17 or 18 of coursethey grow fast here in comes mitaiele to lloyd and told some rigmarole about paatalise the stewards name wanting to go and see his family in the bushbut he has no family in the bush said lloyd no said mitaiele they went to the boys bed they sleep in the walledin compartment of the verandah once my dressingroom and called at once for me he lay like one asleep talking in drowsy tones but without excitement and at times cheeping like a frightened mouse he was quite cool to the touch and his pulse not fast his breathing seemed wholly ventral the bust still the belly moving strongly presently he got from his bed and ran for the door with his head down not three feet from the floor and his body all on a stretch forward like a striking snake i say ran but this strange movement was not swift lloyd and i mastered him and got him back in bed soon there was another and more desperate attempt to escape in which lloyd had his ring broken then we bound him to the bed humanely with sheets ropes boards and pillows he lay there and sometimes talked sometimes whispered sometimes wept like an angry child his principal word was faamolemolepleaseand he kept telling us at intervals that his family were calling him during this interval by the special grace of god my boys came home we had already called in arrick the black boy now we had that hercules lafaele and a man savea who comes from paatalises own island and can alone communicate with him freely lloyd went to bed i took the first watch and sat in my room reading while lafaele and arrick watched the madman suddenly arrick called me i ran into the verandah there was paatalise free of all his bonds and lafaele holding him to tell what followed is impossible we were five people at himlafaele and savea very strong men lloyd i and arrick and the struggle lasted until 1 am before we had him bound one detail for a specimen lloyd and i had charge of one leg we were both sitting on it and lo we were both tossed into the airi i dare say a couple of feet at last we had him spreadeagled to the iron bedstead by his wrists and ankles with matted rope a most inhumane business but what could we do it was all we could do to manage it even so the strength of the paroxysms had been steadily increasing and we trembled for the next and now i come to pure rider haggard lafaele announced that the boy was very bad and he would get some medicine which was a family secret of his own some leaves were brought mysteriously in chewed placed on the boys eyes dropped in his ears see hamlet and stuck up his nostrils as he did this the weird doctor partly smothered the patient with his hand and by about 2 am he was in a deep sleep and from that time he showed no symptom of dementia whatever the medicine says lafaele is principally used for the wholesale slaughter of families he himself feared last night that his dose was fatal only one other person on this island knows the secret and she lafaele darkly whispers has abused it this remarkable tree we must try to identify  the manofwar doctor came up today gave us a straitwaistcoat taught us to bandage examined the boy and saw he was apparently wellhe insisted on doing his work all morning poor lad and when he first came down kissed all the family at breakfast the doctor was greatly excited as may be supposed about lafaeles medicine  tuesdayall yesterday writing my mail by the hand of belle to save my wrist this is a great invention to which i shall stick if it can be managed we had some alarm about paatalise but he slept well all night for a benediction this lunatic asylum exercise has no attractions for any of us  i dont know if i remembered to say how much pleased i was with across the plains in every way inside and out and you and me the critics seem to taste it too as well as could be hoped and i believe it will continue to bring me in a few shillings a year for a while but such books pay only indirectly  to understand the full horror of the mad scene and how well my boys behaved remember that they believed ps ravings they knew that his dead family thirty strong crowded the front verandah and called on him to come to the other world they knew that his dead brother had met him that afternoon in the bush and struck him on both temples and remember we are fighting the dead and they had to go out again in the black night which is the dead mans empire yet last evening when i thought p was going to repeat the performance i sent down for lafaele who had leave of absence and he and his wife came up about eight oclock with a lighted brand these are the things for which i have to forgive my old cattleman his manifold shortcomings they are heroicso are the shortcomings to be sure  it came over me the other day suddenly that this diary of mine to you would make good pickings after i am dead and a man could make some kind of a book out of it without much trouble so for gods sake dont lose them and they will prove a piece of provision for my poor old family as simelé calls it  about my coming to europe i get more and more doubtful and rather incline to ceylon again as place of meeting i am so absurdly well here in the tropics that it seems like affectation yet remember i have never once stood sydney anyway i shall have the money for it all ahead before i think of such a thing  we had a bowl of punch on your birthday which my incredible mother somehow knew and remembered  by the time you receive this my samoan book will i suppose be out and the worst known if i am burned in effigy for it no more need be said if on the other hand i get off cheap with the authorities this is to say that supposing a vacancy to occur i would condescend to accept the office of hbms consul with parts pendicles and appurtenances there is a very little work to do except some little entertaining to which i am bound to say my family and in particular the amanuensis who now guides the pen look forward with delight i with manly resignation the real reasons for the step would be three 1st possibility of being able to do some good or at least certainty of not being obliged to stand always looking on helplessly at what is bad 2nd larks for the family 3rd and perhaps not altogether least a house in town and a boat and a boats crew44  but i find i have left out another reason 4th growing desire on the part of the old man virulent for anything in the nature of a salaryyears seem to invest that idea with new beauty  i sometimes sit and yearn for anything in the nature of an income that would come inmine has all got to be gone and fished for with the immortal mind of man what i want is the income that really comes in of itself while all you have to do is just to blossom and exist and sit on chairs think how beautiful it would be not to have to mind the critics and not even the darkest of the crowdsidney colvin i should probably amuse myself with works that would make your hair curl if you had any left       r l s     to t w dover      stevensons correspondent in this case is an artisan who had been    struck by the truth of a remark in his essay on beggars that it is    only or mainly the poor who habitually give to the poor and who    wrote to ask whether it was from experience that stevenson knew this       vailima plantation upolu samoa june 20th 1892  sirin reply to your very interesting letter i cannot fairly say that i have ever been poor or known what it was to want a meal i have been reduced however to a very small sum of money with no apparent prospect of increasing it and at that time i reduced myself to practically one meal a day with the most disgusting consequences to my health at this time i lodged in the house of a workingman and associated much with others at the same time from my youth up i have always been a good deal and rather intimately thrown among the workingclasses partly as a civil engineer in outoftheway places partly from a strong and i hope not illfavoured sentiment of curiosity but the place where perhaps i was most struck with the fact upon which you comment was the house of a friend who was exceedingly poor in fact i may say destitute and who lived in the attic of a very tall house entirely inhabited by persons in varying stages of poverty as he was also in illhealth i made a habit of passing my afternoon with him and when there it was my part to answer the door the steady procession of people begging and the expectant and confident manner in which they presented themselves struck me more and more daily and i could not but remember with surprise that though my father lived but a few streets away in a fine house beggars scarce came to the door once a fortnight or a month from that time forward i made it my business to inquire and in the stories which i am very fond of hearing from all sorts and conditions of men learned that in the time of their distress it was always from the poor they sought assistance and almost always from the poor they got it  trusting i have now satisfactorily answered your question which i thank you for asking i remain with sincere compliments       robert louis stevenson     to e l burlingame        vailima summer 1892  my dear burlingamefirst of all you have all the corrections on the wrecker i found i had made what i meant and forgotten it and was so careless as not to tell you  second of course and by all means charge corrections on the samoa book to me but there are not near so many as i feared the lord hath dealt bountifully with me and i believe all my advisers were amazed to see how nearly correct i had got the truck at least i was with this you will receive the whole revise and a typewritten copy of the last chapter and the thing now is speed to catch a possible revision of the treaty i believe cassells are to bring it out but baxter knows and the thing has to be crammed through prestissimo à la chasseur  you mention the belated barbeys what about the equally belated pineros and i hope you will keep your bookshop alive to supplying me continuously with the saga library i cannot get enough of sagas i wish there were nine thousand talk about realism  all seems to flourish with you i also prosper none the less for being quit of that abhorred task samoa i could give a supper party here were there any one to sup never was such a disagreeable task but the thing had to be told  there i trust i am done with this cursed chapter of my career bar the rotten eggs and broken bottles that may follow of course pray remember speed is now all that can be asked hoped or wished i give up all hope of proofs revises proof of the map or sic like and you on your side will try to get it out as reasonably seemly as may be  whole samoa book herewith glory be to godyours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      the following consists of scraps merely taken from a letter almost    entirely occupied with private family affairs       vailima saturday 2nd july 1892  the character of my handwriting is explained alas by scriveners cramp this also explains how long i have let the paper lie plain  1 pmi was busy copying david balfour with my left handa most laborious taskfanny was down at the native house superintending the floor lloyd down in apia and belle in her own house cleaning when i heard the latter calling on my name i ran out on the verandah and there on the lawn beheld my crazy boy with an axe in his hand and dressed out in green ferns dancing i ran downstairs and found all my house boys on the back verandah watching him through the diningroom i asked what it meantdance belong his place they saidi think this no time to dance said i has he done his workno they told me away bush all morning but there they all stayed on the back verandah i went on alone through the diningroom and bade him stop he did so shouldered the axe and began to walk away but i called him back walked up to him and took the axe out of his unresisting hands the boy is in all things so good that i can scarce say i was afraid only i felt it had to be stopped ere he could work himself up by dancing to some craziness our house boys protested they were not afraid all i know is they were all watching him round the back door and did not follow me till i had the axe as for the out boys who were working with fanny in the native house they thought it a very bad business and made no secret of their fears  wednesday 6thi have no account to give of my stewardship these days and theres a day more to account for than mere arithmetic

hours sans intermission  tuesday 12thi am doing no work and my mind is in abeyance fanny and belle are sewingmachining in the next room i have been pulling down their hair and fanny has been kicking me and now i am driven out austin i have been chasing about the verandah now he has gone to his lessons and i make believe to write to you in despair but there is nothing in my mind i swim in mere vacancy my head is like a rotten nut i shall soon have to begin to work again or i shall carry away some part of the machinery i have got your insufficient letter for which i scorn to thank you i have had no review by gosse none by birrell another time if i have a letter in the times you might send me the text as well also please send me a cricket bat and a cake and when i come home for the holidays i should like to have a ponyi am sir your obedient servant       jacob tonson  psi am quite well i hope you are quite well the world is too much with us and my mother bids me bind my hair and

of my pleasure and admiration how poorly kipling compares he is all smart journalism and cleverness it is all bright and shallow and limpid like a business papera good one sentend but there is no blot

had rather a bad time suppressing the old gentleman who was really in a very garrulous stage as for getting him in order i could do but little towards that however there are one or two points of interest which may justify us in printing the swinging of his stick and not knowing the sailor of coruiskin in particular and the account of how he wrote the lives in the bell book particularly please me i hope my own little introduction is not egoistic or rather i do not care if it is it was that old gentlemans blood that brought me to samoa  by the by vols vii viii and ix of adamss history have never come to hand no more have the dictionaries  please send me stonehenge on the horse stories and interludes by barry pain and edinburgh sketches and memoirs by david masson the wrecker has turned up so far as i have seen it is very satisfactory but on pp 548 549 there has been a devil of a miscarriage the two latin quotations instead of following each other being separated doubtless for printing considerations by a line of prose my compliments to the printers there is doubtless such a thing as good printing but there is such a thing as good sense  the sequel to kidnapped david balfour by name is about threequarters done and gone to press for serial publication by what i can find out it ought to be through hand with that and ready for volume form early next springyours very sincerely       r l s     to andrew lang      mr andrew lang had been supplying stevenson with some books and    historical references for his proposed novel the young chevalier       vailima august 1892  my dear langi knew you would prove a trusty purveyor the books you have sent are admirable i got the name of my hero out of brownblair of balmylefrancie blair but whether to call the story blair of balmyle or whether to call it the young chevalier i have not yet decided the admirable cameronian tractperhaps you will think this a cheatis to be boned into david balfour where it will fit better and really furnishes me with a desired foothold over a boggy place  later no it wont go in and i fear i must give up the idolatrous occupant upon the throne a phrase that overjoyed me beyond expression i am in a deuce of a flutter with politics which i hate and in which i certainly do not shine but a fellow cannot stand aside and look on at such an exhibition as our government taint decent no gent can hold a candle to it but its a grind to be interrupted by midnight messengers and pass your days writing proclamations which are never proclaimed and petitions which aint petited and letters to the times which it makes my jaw yawn to reread and all your time have your heart with david balfour he has just left glasgow this morning for edinburgh james more has escaped from the castle it is far more real to me than the behring sea or the baring brothers eitherhe got the news of james mores escape from the lord advocate and started off straight to comfort catriona you dont know her shes james mores daughter and a respectable young wumman the miss grants think sothe lord advocates daughtersso there cant be anything really wrong pretty soon we all go to holland and be hanged thence to dunkirk and be damned and the tale concludes in paris and be pollparrotted this is the last authentic news you are not a real hardworking novelist not a practical novelist so you dont know the temptation to let your characters maunder dumas did it and lived but it is not war it aint sportsmanlike and i have to be stopping their chatter all the time browns appendix is great reading    my only grief is that i cant   use the idolatrous occupant  yours ever       r l s  blessing and praising you for a useful though idolatrous occupant of kensington     to miss adelaide boodle      samoa and the samoans for children continued after an eight months    pause       vailima plantation samoan islands august 14th 1892  my dear miss boodlethe lean man is exceedingly ashamed of himself and offers his apologies to the little girls in the cellar just above if they will be so good as to knock three times upon the floor he will hear it on the other side of his floor and will understand that he is forgiven i believe i got you and the childrenor rather left you and the childrenstill on the road to the lean mans house when you get up there a great part of the forest has been cleared away it comes back again pretty quick though not quite so high but everywhere except where the weeders have been kept busy young trees have sprouted up and the cattle and the horses cannot be seen as they feed in this clearing there are two or three houses scattered about and between the two biggest i think the little girls in the cellar would first notice a sort of thing like a gridiron on legs made of logs and wood sometimes it has a flag flying on it made of rags of old clothes it is a fort so i am told built by the person here who would be much the most interesting to the girls in the cellar this is a young gentleman of eleven years of age answering to the name of austin it was after reading a book about the red indians that he thought it more prudent to create this place of strength as the red indians are in north america and this fort seems to me a very useless kind of building i am anxious to hope that the two may never be brought together when austin is not engaged in building forts nor on his lessons which are just as annoying to him as other childrens lessons are to them he walks sometimes in the bush and if anybody is with him talks all the time when he is alone i dont think he says anything and i dare say he feels very lonely and frightened just as the lean man does at the queer noises and the endless lines of the trees he finds the strangest kinds of seeds some of them bright coloured like lollipops or really like precious stones some of them in odd cases like tobaccopouches he finds and collects all kinds of little shells with which the whole ground is scattered and which though they are the shells of land animals like our snails are nearly of as many shapes and colours as the shells on our seabeaches in the streams that come running down out of the mountains and which are all as clear and bright as mirror glass he sees eels and little bright fish that sometimes jump together out of the surface of the brook in a little knot of silver and freshwater prawns which lie close under the stones and can be seen looking up at him with eyes of the colour of a jewel he sees all kinds of beautiful birds some of them blue and white some of them blue and white and red and some of them coloured like our pigeons at home and these last the little girls in the cellar may like to know live almost entirely on nutmegs as they fall ripe off the trees another little bird he may sometimes see as the lean man saw him only this morning a little fellow not so big as a mans hand exquisitely neat of a pretty bronze black like ladies shoes and who sticks up behind him much as a peacock does his little tail shaped and fluted like a scallop shell  here are a lot of curious and interesting things that austin sees round him every day and when i was a child at home in the old country i used to play and pretend to myself that i saw things of the same kind that the rooms were full of orange and nutmeg trees and the cold town gardens outside the windows were alive with parrots and with lions what do the little girls in the cellar think that austin does he makes believe just the other way he pretends that the strange great trees with their broad leaves and slabsided roots are european oaks and the places on the road up where you and i and the little girls in the cellar have already gone he calls by oldfashioned faraway european names just as if you were to call the cellar stair and the corner of the next streetif you could only manage to pronounce the namesupolu and savaii and so it is with all of us with austin and the lean man and the little girls in the cellar wherever we are it is but a stage on the way to somewhere else and whatever we do however well we do it it is only a preparation to do something else that shall be different  but you must not suppose that austin does nothing but build forts and walk among the woods and swim in the rivers on the contrary he is sometimes a very busy and useful fellow and i think the little girls in the cellar would have admired him very nearly as much as he admired himself if they had seen him setting off on horseback with his hand on his hip and his pockets full of letters and orders at the head of quite a procession of huge white carthorses with packsaddles and big brown native men with nothing on but gaudy kilts mighty well he managed all his commissions and those who saw him ordering and eating his singlehanded luncheon in the queer little chinese restaurant on the beach declare he looked as if the place and the town and the whole archipelago belonged to him but i am not going to let you suppose that this great gentleman at the head of all his horses and his men like the king of france in the old rhyme would be thought much of a dandy on the streets of london on the contrary if he could be seen there with his dirty white cap and his faded purple shirt and his little brown breeks that do not reach his knees and the bare shanks below and the bare feet stuck in the stirrup leathers for he is not quite long enough to reach the irons i am afraid the little boys and girls in your part of the town might feel very much inclined to give him a penny in charity so you see that a very very big man in one place might seem very small potatoes in another just as the kings palace here of which i told you in my last would be thought rather a poor place of residence by a surrey gipsy and if you come to that even the lean man himself who is no end of an important person if he were picked up from the chair where he is now sitting and slung down feet foremost in the neighbourhood of charing cross would probably have to escape into the nearest shop or take the consequences of being mobbed and the ladies of his family who are very pretty ladies and think themselves uncommonly welldressed for samoa would if the same thing were done to them be extremely glad to get into a cab  i write to you by the hands of another because i am threatened again with scriveners cramp my health is beyond reproach i wish i could say as much for my wifes which is far from the thing give us some news of yours and even when none of us write do not suppose for a moment that we are forgetful of our old gamekeeper our prettiest walk an alley of really beautiful green sward which leads through fannys garden to the river and the bridge and the beginning of the high woods on the mountainside where the tapu a fafine or spirit of the land has her dwelling and the workboys fear to go alone is called by a name that i think our gamekeeper has heard beforeadelaide road  with much love from all of us to yourself and all good wishes for your future and the future of the children in the cellar believe me your affectionate friend       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        vailima august 1892  my dear colvinyou will have no letter at all this month and it is really not my fault i have been saving my hand as much as possible for davy balfour only this morning i was getting on first rate with him when about halfpast nine there came a prick in the middle of the ball of my thumb and i had to take to the left hand and two words a minute i fear i slightly exaggerate the speed of my left hand about a word and a half in the minutewhich is dispiriting to the last degree your last letter with the four excellent reviews and the good news about the wrecker was particularly welcome i have already written to charles baxter about the volume form appearance of the beach of falesá in spite of bad thumbs and other interruptions i hope to send to baxter by this mail the whole first part a good deal more than half of david balfour ready for press this is pretty satisfactory and i think ought to put us beyond the reach of financial catastrophe for the year  a cousin of mine graham balfour arrived along with your last it was rather a lark fanny belle and i stayed down at the hotel two nights expecting the steamer and we had seven horses down daily for the party and the baggage these were on one occasion bossed by austin age eleven im afraid i cannot do that now said he in answer to some communication as i am taking charge of the men here in the course of the forenoon he took his men to get their lunch and had his own by himself at the chinese restaurant what a day for a boy the steamer came in at last on saturday morning after breakfast we three were out at the place of anchorage in the hotel boat as she came up spotting rather anxiously for our guest whom none of us had ever seen we chose out some rather awful cads and tried to make up our mind to them they were the least offensive yet observed among an awful crew of cabin passengers but when the simon pure appeared at last upon the scene he was as nice a young fellow as you would want followed a time of giddy gloryone crowded hour of glorious lifewhen i figured about the deck with attendant shemales in the character of the local celebrity was introduced to the least unpresentable of the ruffians on board dogged about the deck by a diminutive hebrew with a kodak the click of which kept time to my progress like a pair of castanets and filled up in the captains room on iced champagne at 830 of gods morning the captain in question cap morse is a great south sea character like the side of a house and the greenroom of a musichall but with all the saving qualities of the seaman the celebrity was a great success with this untutored observer he was kind enough to announce that he expected rather with awe a much more thoughtful person and i think i pleased him much with my parting salutation well captain i suppose you and i are the two most notorious men in the pacific i think it will enable you to see the captain if i tell you that he recited to us in cold blood the words of a new comic song doubtless a tribute to my literary character i had often heard of captain morse and always had detested all that i was told and detested the man in confidence just as you are doing but really he has a wonderful charm of strength loyalty and simplicity the whole celebrity business was particularly characteristic the captain has certainly never read a word of mine and as for the jew with the kodak he had never heard of me till he came on board there was a third admirer who sent messages in to the captains cabin asking if the lion would accept a gift of websters unabridged i went out to him and signified a manly willingness to accept a gift of anything he stood and bowed before me his eyes danced with excitement mr stevenson he said and his voice trembled your name is very well known to me i have been in the publishing line in canada and i have handled many of your works for the trade come i said heres genuine appreciation  from this gaudy scene we descended into the hotel boat with our new second cousin got to horse and returned to vailima passing shot of kodak once more on the nulivae bridge where the little jew was posted with his little jew wife each about three feet six in stature and as vulgar as a lodging house clock  we were just writing this when another passenger from the ship arrived up here at vailima this is a nice quiet simple blueeyed little boy of pennsylvania quaker folk threatened with consumption of my sort he has been sent here by his doctor on the strength of my case i am sure if the case be really parallel he could not have been better done by as we had a roast pig for dinner we kept him for that meal and the rain coming on just when the moon should have risen kept him again for the night so you see it is now tomorrow  graham balfour the new cousin and lloyd are away with clark the missionary on a school inspecting malaga really perhaps the prettiest little bit of opera in real life that can be seen and made all the prettier by the actors being children i have come to a collapse this morning on db wrote a chapter one way half recopied it in another and now stand halting between the two like buridans donkey these sorts of cruces always are to me the most insoluble and i should not wonder if db stuck there for a week or two this is a bother for i understand mcclure talks of beginning serial publication in december if this could be managed what with db the apparent success of the wrecker falesá and some little pickings from across the plainsnot to mention as quite hopeless the history of samoathis should be rather a profitable year as it must be owned it has been rather a busy one the trouble is if i miss the december publication it may take the devil and all of a time to start another syndicate i am really tempted to curse my conscientiousness if i hadnt recopied davie he would now be done and dead and buried and here i am stuck about the middle with an immediate publication threatened and the fear before me of having after all to scamp the essential business of the end at the same time though i love my davy i am a little anxious to get on again on the young chevalier i have in nearly all my works been trying one racket to get out the facts of life as clean and naked and sharp as i could manage it in this other book i want to try and megilp them together in an atmosphere of sentiment and i wonder whether twentyfive years of life spent in trying this one thing will not make it impossible for me to succeed in the other however it is the only way to attempt a love story you cant tell any of the facts and the only chance is to paint an atmosphere  it is a very warm morningthe parrot is asleep on the door she heard her name and immediately awakenedand my brains are completely addled by having come to grief over davy  hurray a subject discovered the parrot is a little white cockatoo of the small variety it belongs to belle whom it guards like a watch dog it chanced that when she was sick some months ago i came over and administered some medicine unnecessary to say belle bleated whereupon the parrot bounded upon me and buried his neb in my backside from that day on the little wretch attacked me on every possible occasion usually from the rear though she would also follow me along the verandah and as i went downstairs attack my face this was far from funny i am a person of average courage but i dont think i was ever more cordially afraid of anything than of this miserable atomy and the deuce of it was that i could not but admire her appalling courage and there was no means of punishing such a threadpaper creature without destroying it entirely act ii on grahams arrival i gave him my room and came out to lloyds in the lower floor of bellesi beg your pardonthe parrotshouse the first morning i was to wake belle early so that breakfast should be seen to for our guest it was a mighty pretty dawn the birds were singing extraordinary strong all was peace and there was the damned parrot hanging to the knob of belles door courage my heart on i went and cockie buried her bill in the joint of my thumb i believe that job would have killed that bird but i was more happily inspiredi caught it up and flung it over the verandah as far as i could throw i must say it was violently done and i looked with some anxiety to see in what state of preservation it would alight down it came however on its two feet uttered a few oaths in a very modified tone of voice and set forth on the return journey to its mansion its wings being cut and its gait in walking having been a circumstance apparently not thoroughly calculated by its maker it took about twentyfive minutes to get home again now here is this remarkable pointthat bird has never bitten me since when i have early breakfast she and the cat come down and join me and she sits on the back of my chair when i am at work with the door shut she sits outside and demolishes the door with that same beak which was so recently reddened with my hearts bloodand in the evening she does her business all over my clothes in the most friendly manner in the world i ought to add a word about the parrot and the cat three cats were brought by belle from sydney this one alone remains faithful and domestic one of the funniest things i have ever seen was polly and maud over a piece of bacon polly stood on one leg held the bacon in the other regarded maudie with a secret and sinister look and very slowly and quietlyfar too quietly for the word i have to usegnashed her bill at her maudie came up quite close there she stuckshe was afraid to come nearer to go away she was ashamed and she assisted at the final and very deliberate consumption of the bacon making about as poor a figure as a cat can make  next daydate totally unknown or rather it is now known but is reserved because it would certainly prove inconsistent with dates previously given i went down about two oclock in company with a couple of chance visitors to apia it was smoking hot not a sign of any wind and the sun scorching your face i found the great haggard in hourly expectation of lady jersey surrounded by crowds of very indifferent assistants and i must honestly saythe only time i ever saw him socross he directed my attention to all the new paint his own handiwork he said and made me visit the bathroom which he has just fixed up i think i never saw a man more miserable and happy at the same time had some hock and a seltzer went down town met fanny and belle and so home in time for a magnificent dinner of prawns and an eel cooked in oil both from our own river  this morning the overseerthe new overseer mr austin strongwent down in charge of the packhorses and a squad of men himself riding a white horse with extreme dignity and what seemed to onlookers a perhaps somewhat theatrical air of command he returned triumphantly all his commissions apparently executed with success bringing us a mailnot your mail colonial waysand the news of lady jerseys arrival and reception among flying flags and banging guns  as soon as i had concluded my flattering description of polly she bit one of my toes to the blood but put not your trust in shemales though to say the truth she looks more like a russian colonel  aug 15thon the saturday night fanny and i went down to haggards to dine and be introduced to lady jersey she is there with her daughter lady margaret and her brother captain leigh a very nice kind of glassinhiseye kind of fellow it is to be presumed i made a good impression for the meeting has had a most extraordinary sequel fanny and i slept in haggards billiard room which happens to be lloyds bungalow in the morning she and i breakfasted in the back parts with haggard and captain leigh and it was then arranged that the captain should go with us to malie on the tuesday under a false name so that government house at sydney might by no possibility be connected with a rebel camp on sunday afternoon up comes haggard in a state of huge excitement lady j insists on going too in the character of my cousin i write her a letter under the name of miss amelia balfour proposing the excursion and this morning up comes a copy of verses from amelia i wrote to mataafa announcing that i should bring two cousins instead of one that the second was a lady unused to samoan manners and it would be a good thing if she could sleep in another house with ralala sent a copy of this to amelia and at the same time made all arrangements dating my letter 1745 we shall go on ahead on the malie road she is to follow with haggard and captain leigh and overtake us at the ford of the gasigasi whence haggard will return and the rest of us pursue our way to the rebeldom  this lark is certainly huge it is all nonsense that it can be concealed miss amelia balfour will be at once identified with the queen of sydney as they call her and i would not in the least wonder if the visit proved the signal of war with this i have no concern and the thing wholly suits my book and fits my predilections for samoa what a pity the mail leaves and i must leave this adventure to be continued in our next but i need scarcely say that all this is deadly privatei expect it all to come out not without explosion only it must not be through me or you we had a visit yesterday from a person by the name of count nerli who is said to be a good painter altogether the aristocracy clusters thick about us in which radiant light as the mail must now be really put up i leave myself until next monthyours ever       r l s     to the countess of jersey      following up the last letter stevenson here tells the story of the    visit paid to apia by the countess of jersey who had come over from    sydney with her brother captain leigh and her young daughter lady    margaret villiers a warm friendship writes lady jersey was the    immediate result we constantly met either in the hospitable abode    of our host mr bazett haggard or in mr stevensons delightful    mountain home and passed many happy hours in riding walking and    conversation the previous letter has shown how it was arranged that    the party should pay a visit of curiosity to the rebel king or    more properly the rival claimant to the kingly power mataafa in his    camp at malie and how stevenson at once treated the adventure as a    chapter out of a waverley novel the wife of the new governor of new    south wales writes lady jersey on her part could not pay such a    visit in her own name so mr stevenson adopted me as his cousin    amelia balfour this transparent disguise was congenial to his    romantic instincts and he writes concerning the arrangements made    for the expedition carefully dating his letter aug 14 1745       august 14 1745  to miss amelia balfourmy dear cousinwe are going an expedition to leeward on tuesday morning if a lady were perhaps to be encountered on horsebacksay towards the gasigasi riverabout six am i think we should have an episode somewhat after the style of the 45 what a misfortune my dear cousin that you should have arrived while your cousin graham was occupying my only guestchamberfor osterley park is not so large in samoa as it was at homebut happily our friend haggard has found a corner for you  the king over the waterthe gasigasi waterwill be pleased to see the clan of balfour mustering so thick around his standard  i have one serious word been so lucky as to get a really secret interpreter so all is for the best in our little adventure into the waverley novelsi am your affectionate cousin       robert louis stevenson  observe the stealth with which i have blotted my signature but we must be political à outrance     to the countess of jersey   my dear cousini send for your information a copy of my last letter to the gentleman in question tis thought more wise in consideration of the difficulty and peril of the enterprise that we should leave the town in the afternoon and by several detachments if you would start for a ride with the master of haggard and captain lockhart of lee say at three oclock of the afternoon you would make some rencounters by the wayside which might be agreeable to your political opinions all present will be staunch  the master of haggard might extend his ride a little and return through the marsh and by the nuns house i trust that has the proper flavour so as a little to diminish the effect of separationi remain your affectionate cousin to command       o tusitala  psit is to be thought this present year of grace will be historical     to sidney colvin      this letter tells without preface the story of the expedition planned    in the preceding       vailima august 1892  my dear colvinthis is friday night the i believe 18th or 20th august or september i shall probably regret tomorrow having written you with my own hand like the apostle paul but i am alone over here in the workmans house where i and belle and lloyd and austin are pigging the rest are at cards in the main residence i have not joined them because belly belong me has been kicking up and i have just taken 15 drops of laudanum  on tuesday the party set outself in white cap velvet coat cords and yellow half boots belle in a white kind of suit and white cap to match mine lloyd in white clothes and long yellow boots and a straw hat graham in khakis and gaiters henry my old overseer in blue coat and black kilt and the great lafaele with a big shipbag on his saddlebow we left the mail at the po had lunch at the hotel and about 150 set out westward to the place of tryst this was by a little shrunken brook in a deep channel of mud on the far side of which in a thicket of low trees all full of moths of shadow and butterflies of sun we lay down to await her ladyship whisky and water then a sketch of the encampment for which we all posed to belle passed off the time until 330 then i could hold on no longer 30 minutes late had the secret oozed out were they arrested i got my horse crossed the brook again and rode hard back to the vaea cross roads whence i was aware of white clothes glancing in the other long straight radius of the quadrant i turned at once to return to the place of tryst but d overtook me and almost bore me down shouting ride ride like a hero in a ballad lady margaret and he were only come to shew the place they returned and the rest of our party reinforced by captain leigh and lady jersey set on for malie the delay was due to ds infinite precautions leading them up lanes by back ways and then down again to the beach road a hundred yards further on  it was agreed that lady jersey existed no more she was now my cousin amelia balfour that relative and i headed the march she is a charming woman all of us like her extremely after trial on this somewhat rude and absurd excursion and we ameliad or miss balfourd her with great but intermittent fidelity when we came to the last village i sent henry on ahead to warn the king of our approach and amend his discretion if that might be as he left i heard the villagers asking which was the great lady and a little further at the borders of malie itself we found the guard making a music of bugles and conches then i knew the game was up and the secret out a considerable guard of honour mostly children accompanied us but for our good fortune we had been looked for earlier and the crowd was gone  dinner at the kings he asked me to say grace i could think of nonenever could graham suggested benedictus benedicat at which i leaped we were nearly done when old popo inflicted the atua howl of which you have heard already right at lady jerseys shoulder she started in fine stylethere i said we have been giving you a chapter of scott but this goes beyond the waverley novels after dinner kava lady j was served before me and the king drank last it was the least formal kava i ever saw in that houseno names called no show of ceremony all my ladies are well trained and when belle drained her bowl the king was pleased to clap his hands then he and i must retire for our private interview to another house he gave me his own staff and made me pass before him and in the interview which was long and delicate he twice called me afioga ah that leaves you cold but i am samoan enough to have been moved susuga is my accepted rank to be called afiogaheavens what an advanceand it leaves europe cold but it staggered my henry the first time it was complicated lana susuga ma lana afiogahis excellency and his majesty the next time plain majesty henry then begged to interrupt the interview and tell who he washe is a small family chief in savaii not very smalli do not wish the king says he to think me a boy from apia on our return to the palace we separated i had asked for the ladies to sleep alonethat was understood but that tusitalahis afioga tusitalashould go out with the other young men and not sleep with the highborn females of his familywas a doctrine received with difficulty lloyd and i had one screen graham and leigh another and we slept well  in the morning i was first abroad before dawn not very long already there was a stir of birds a little after i heard singing from the kings chapelexceeding goodand went across in the hour when the east is yellow and the morning bank is breaking up to hear it nearer all about the chapel the guards were posted and all saluted tusitala i could not refrain from smiling so there is a place too i thought where sentinels salute me mine has been a queer life  illustration  breakfast was rather a protracted business and that was scarce over when we were called to the great house now finishedrecall your earlier letters to see a royal kava this function is of rare use i know grown samoans who have never witnessed it it is besides as you are to hear a piece of prehistoric history crystallised in figures and the facts largely forgotten an acted hieroglyph the house is really splendid in the rafters in the midst two carved and coloured model birds are posted the only thing of the sort i have ever remarked in samoa the samoans being literal observers of the second commandment at one side of the egg our party sat amataafa b  lady j c  belle d  tusitala e graham f  lloyd g  captain leigh h  henry i  popo the xs round are the high chiefs each man in his historical position one side of the house is set apart for the king alone we were allowed there as his guests and henry as our interpreter it was a huge trial to the lad when a speech was made to me which he must translate and i made a speech in answer which he had to orate fullbreathed to that big circle he blushed through his dark skin but looked and acted like a gentleman and a young fellow of sense then the kava came to the king he poured one drop in libation drank another and flung the remainder outside the house behind him next came the turn of the old shapeless stone marked t it stands for one of the kings titles tamasoalii mataafa is tamasoalii this day but cannot drink for it and the stone must first be washed with water and then have the bowl emptied on it thenthe order i cannot recallcame the turn of y and z two orators of the name of malietoa the first took his kava down plain like an ordinary man the second must be packed to bed under a big sheet of tapa and be massaged by anxious assistants and rise on his elbow groaning to drink his cup w a great hereditary war man came next five times the cupbearers marched up and down the house and passed the cup on five times it was filled and the generals name and titles heralded at the bowl and five times he refused it after examination as too small it is said this commemorates a time when malietoa at the head of his army suffered much for want of supplies then this same military gentleman must drink five cups one from each of the great names all which took a precious long time he acted very well haughtily and in a society tone outlining the part the difference was marked when he subsequently made a speech in his own character as a plain godfearing chief a few more high chiefs then tusitala one more and then lady jersey one more and then captain leigh and so on with the rest of our partyhenry of course excepted you see in public lady jersey followed mejust so far was the secret kept  then we came home belle graham and lloyd to the chinamans i with lady jersey to lunch so severally home thursday i have forgotten saturday i began again on davie on sunday the jersey party came up to call and carried me to dinner as i came out to ride home the searchlights of the curaçoa were lightening on the horizon from many miles away and next morning she came in tuesday was huge fun a reception at haggards all our party dined there lloyd and i in the absence of haggard and leigh had to play aidedecamp and host for about twenty minutes and i presented the population of apia at random but luck helping without one mistake wednesday we had two middies to lunch thursday we had eeles and hoskyn lieutenant and doctorvery very nice fellowssimple good and not the least dull to dinner saturday graham and i lunched on board graham belle lloyd dined at the gs and austin and the whole of our servants went with them to an evening entertainment the more bold returning by lanternlight yesterday sunday belle and i were off by about half past eight left our horses at a public house and went on board the curaçoa in the wardroom skiff were entertained in the wardroom thence on deck to the service which was a great treat three fiddles and a harmonium and excellent choir and the great ships company joining on shore in haggards big boat to lunch with the party thence all together to vailima where we read aloud a ouida romance we have been secretly writing in which haggard was the hero and each one of the authors had to draw a portrait of him or herself in a ouida light leigh lady j fanny r l s belle and graham were the authors  in the midst of this gay life i have finally recopied two chapters and drafted for the first time three of davie balfour but it is not a life that would continue to suit me and if i have not continued to write to you you will scarce wonder and today we all go down again to dinner and tomorrow they all come up to lunch the world is too much with us but it now nears an end today already the curaçoa has sailed and on saturday or sunday lady jersey will follow them in the mail steamer i am sending you a wire by her hands as far as sydney that is to say either you or cassell about falesá i will not allow it to be called uma in book form that is not the logical name of the story nor can i have the marriage contract omitted and the thing is full of misprints abominable in the picture uma is rot so is the old man and the negro but wiltshire is splendid and case will do it seems badly illuminated but this may be printing how have i seen this first number not through your attention guilty one lady jersey had it and only mentioned it yesterday45  i ought to say how much we all like the jersey party leigh is very amusing in his way lady margaret is a charming girl and lady jersey is in all ways admirable so unfussy so plucky so very kind and gracious my boy henry was enraptured with the manners of the tamaitai sili chief lady among our other occupations i did a bit of a supposed epic describing our tryst at the ford of the gasegase and belle and i made a little book of caricatures and verses about incidents on the visit  tuesdaythe wild round of gaiety continues after i had written to you yesterday the brain being wholly extinct i played piquet all morning with graham after lunch down to call on the us consul hurt in a steeplechase thence back to the new girls school which lady j was to open and where my ladies met me lady j is really an orator with a voice of gold the rest of us played our unremarked parts missionaries haggard myself a samoan chief holding forth in turn myself with at least a golden brevity thence fanny belle and i to town to our billiard room in haggards back garden where we found lloyd and where graham joined us the three men first dressed with the ladies in a corner and then to leave them a free field we went off to haggard and leighs quarters whereafter all to dinner where our two parties a brother of colonel kitcheners a passing globetrotter and clarke the missionary a very gay evening with all sorts of chaff and mirth and a moonlit ride home and to bed before 1230 and now today we have the jerseyhaggard troupe to lunch and i must pass the morning dressing ship  thursday sept 1sti sit to write to you now 715 all the world in bed except myself accounted for and belle and graham down at haggards at dinner not a leaf is stirring here but the moon overhead now of a good bigness is obscured and partly revealed in a whirling covey of thin stormclouds by jove it blows above  from 8 till 1115 on tuesday i dressed ship and in particular cleaned crystal my specialty about 1130 the guests began to arrive before i was dressed and between while i had written a parody for lloyd to sing yesterday wednesday i had to start out about 3 for town had a long interview with the head of the german firm about some work in my new house got over to lloyds billiardroom about six on the way whither i met fanny and belle coming down with one kitchener a brother of the colonels dined in the billiardroom discovered we had forgot to order oatmeal whereupon in the moonlit evening i set forth in my tropical array mess jacket and such to get the oatmeal and meet a young fellow cand not a bad young fellow either only an idiotas drunk as croesus he wept with me he wept for me he talked like a bad character in an impudently bad farce i could have laughed aloud to hear and could make you laugh by repeating but laughter was not uppermost  this morning at about seven i set off after the lost sheep i could have no horse all that could be mountedwe have one girthsore and one deadlame in the establishmentwere due at a picnic about 1030 the morning was very wet and i set off barefoot with my trousers over my knees and a macintosh presently i had to take a side path in the bush missed it came forth in a great oblong patch of taro solemnly surrounded by forestno soul no sign no soundand as i stood there at a loss suddenly between the showers out broke the note of a harmonium and a womans voice singing an air that i know very well but have as usual forgot the name of twas from a great way off but seemed to fill the world it was strongly romantic and gave me a point which brought me by all sorts of forest wading to an open space of palms these were of all ages but mostly at that age when the branches arch from the ground level range themselves with leaves exquisitely green the whole interspace was overgrown with convolvulus purple yellow and white often as deep as to my waist in which i floundered aimlessly the very mountain was invisible from here the rain came and went now in sunlit april showers now with the proper tramp and rattle of the tropics all this while i met no sight or sound of man except the voice which was now silent and a damned pigfence that headed me off at every corner do you know barbed wire think of a fence of it on rotten posts and you barefoot but i crossed it at last with my heart in my mouth and no harm done thence at last to cs no c next place i came to was in the zone of woods they offered me a buggy and set a black boy to wash my legs and feet washum legs belong that fellow whiteman was the command so at last i ran down my son of a gun in the hotel sober and with no story to tell penitent i think as i sat and looked at him i knew from my inside the biggest truth in life there is only one thing that we cannot forgive and that is uglinessour ugliness there is no ugliness no beauty only that which makes me ipse sicken or rejoice and poor c makes me sicken yet according to canons he is not amiss home by buggy and my poor feet up three miles of root boulder gravel and liquid mud slipping back at every step  sunday sept 4thhope you will be able to read a word of the last no joke writing by a bad lantern with a groggy hand and your glasses mislaid not that the hand is not better as you see by the absence of the amanuensis hitherto mail came friday and a communication from yourself much more decent than usual for which i thank you glad the wrecker should so hum but lord what fools these mortals be  so far yesterday the citation being wrung from me by remembrance of many reviews i have now received all falesá and my admiration for that tale rises i believe it is in some ways my best work i am pretty sure at least i have never done anything better than wiltshire  monday 13th september 1892on wednesday the spinsters of apia gave a ball to a select crowd fanny belle lloyd and i rode down met haggard by the way and joined company with him dinner with haggard and thence to the ball the chief justice appeared it was immediately remarked and whispered from one to another that he and i had the only red sashes in the roomand they were both of the hue of blood sir blood he shook hands with myself and all the members of my family then the cream came and i found myself in the same set of a quadrille with his honour we dance here in apia a most fearful and wonderful quadrille i dont know where the devil they fished it from but it is rackety and prancing and embraceatory beyond words perhaps it is best defined in haggards expression of a gambado when i and my great enemy found ourselves involved in this gambol and crossing hands and kicking up and being embraced almost in common by large and quite respectable females weor itried to preserve some rags of dignity but not for long the deuce of it is that personally i love this man his eye speaks to me i am pleased in his society we exchanged a glance and then a grin the man took me in his confidence and through the remainder of that prance we pranced for each other hard to imagine any position more ridiculous a week before he had been trying to rake up evidence against me by browbeating and threatening a halfwhite interpreter that very morning i had been writing most villainous attacks upon him for the times and we meet and smile anddamn itlike each other i do my best to damn the man and drive him from these islands but the weakness enduresi love him this is a thing i would despise in anybody else but he is so jolly insidious and ingratiating no sir i cant dislike him but if i dont make hay of him it shall not be for want of trying  yesterday we had two germans and a young american boy at lunch and in the afternoon vailima was in a state of siege ten white people on the front verandah at least as many brown in the cookhouse and countless blacks to see the black boy arrick  which reminds me arrick was sent friday was a week to the german firm with a note and was not home on time lloyd and i were going bedward it was late with a bright moonah poor dog you know no such moons as thesewhen home came arrick with his head in a white bandage and his eyes shining he had had a fight with other blacks malaita boys many against one and one with a knife i knicked em down three four he cried and had himself to be taken to the doctors and bandaged next day he could not work glory of battle swelled too high in his threadpaper breast he had made a onestringed harp for austin borrowed it came to fannys room and sang warsongs and danced a war dance in honour of his victory and it appears by subsequent advices that it was a serious victory enough four of his assailants went to hospital and one is thought in danger all vailima rejoiced at this news  five more chapters of david 22 to 27 go to baxter all love affair seems pretty good to me will it do for the young person i dont know since the beach i know nothing except that men are fools and hypocrites and i know less of them than i was fond enough to fancy     to mrs charles fairchild        vailima august 1892  my dear mrs fairchildthank you a thousand times for your letter you are the angel of the sort of information that i care about i appoint you successor to the newspaper press and i beg of you whenever you wish to gird at the age or think the bugs out of proportion to the roses or despair or enjoy any cosmic or epochal emotion to sit down again and write to the hermit of samoa what do i think of it all well i love the romantic solemnity of youth and even in this form although not without laughter i have to love it still they are such ducks but what are they made of we were just as solemn as that about atheism and the stars and humanity but we were all for belief anywaywe held atheism and sociology of which none of us nor indeed anybody knew anything for a gospel and an iron rule of life and it was lucky enough or there would have been more windows broken what is apt to puzzle one at first sight in the new youth is that with such rickety and risky problems always at heart they should not plunge down a niagara of dissolution but let us remember the high practical timidity of youth i was a particularly brave boythis i think of myself looking backand plunged into adventures and experiments and ran risks that it still surprises me to recall but dear me what a fear i was in of that strange blind machinery in the midst of which i stood and with what a compressed heart and what empty lungs i would touch a new crank and await developments i do not mean to say i do not fear life still i do and that terror for an adventurer like myself is still one of the chief joys of living  but it was different indeed while i was yet girt with the priceless robes of inexperience then the fear was exquisite and infinite and so when you see all these little ibsens who seem at once so dry and so excitable and faint in swathes over a play i supposefor a wager that would seem to me merely tedious smile behind your hand and remember the little dears are all in a blue funk it must be very funny and to a spectator like yourself i almost envy it but never get desperate human nature is human nature and the roman empire since the romans founded it and made our european human nature what it is bids fair to go on and to be true to itself these little bodies will all grow up and become men and women and have heaps of fun nay and are having it now and whatever happens to the fashion of the age it makes no differencethere are always high and brave and amusing lives to be lived and a change of key however exotic does not exclude melody even chinamen hard as we find it to believe enjoy being chinese and the chinaman stands alone to be unthinkable natural enough as the representative of the only other great civilisation take my people here at my doors their life is a very good one it is quite thinkable quite acceptable to us and the little dears will be soon skating on the other foot sooner or later in each generation the onehalf of them at least begin to remember all the material they had rejected when first they made and nailed up their little theory of life and these become reactionaries or conservatives and the ship of man begins to fill upon the other tack  here is a sermon by your leave it is your own fault you have amused and interested me so much by your breath of the new youth which comes to me from so far away where i live up here in my mountain and secret messengers bring me letters from rebels and the government sometimes seizes them and generally grumbles in its beard that stevenson should really be deported o my life is the more lively never fear  it has recently been most amusingly varied by a visit from lady jersey i took her over mysteriously under the pseudonym of my cousin miss amelia balfour to visit mataafa our rebel and we had great fun and wrote a ouida novel on our life here in which every author had to describe himself in the ouida glamour and of whichfor the jerseys intend printing iti must let you have a copy my wifes chapter and my description of myself should i think amuse you but there were finer touches still as when belle and lady jersey came out to brush their teeth in front of the rebel kings palace and the night guard squatted opposite on the grass and watched the process or when i and my interpreter and the king with his secretary mysteriously disappeared to conspireever yours sincerely       r l stevenson     to the children in the cellar      this time the children in the kilburn cellar are addressed direct    with only a brief word at the end to their instructress       vailima plantation samoan islands september 4th 1892  dear children in the cellari told you before something of the black boys who come here for work on the plantations and some of whom run away and live a wild life in the forests of the islands now i want to tell you of one who lived in the house of the lean man like the rest of them here he is a little fellow and when he goes about in old battered cheap european clothes looks very small and shabby when first he came he was as lean as a tobaccopipe and his smile like that of almost all the others was the sort that makes you half wish to smile yourself and half wish to cry however the boys in the kitchen took him in hand and fed him up they would set him down alone to table and wait upon him till he had his fill which was a good long time to wait and the first thing we noticed was that his little stomach began to stick out like a pigeons breast and then the food got a little wider spread and he started little calves to his legs and last of all he began to get quite saucy and impudent so that we could know what sort of a fellow he really was when he was no longer afraid of being thrashed he is really what you ought to call a young man though i suppose nobody in the whole wide world has any idea of his age and as far as his behaviour goes you can only think of him as a big little child with a good deal of sense when austin built his fort against the indians arick for that is the black boys name liked nothing so much as to help him and this is very funny when you think that of all the dangerous savages in this island arick is one of the most dangerous the other day besides he made austin a musical instrument of the sort they use in his own country a harp with only one string he took a stick about three feet long and perhaps four inches round the under side he hollowed out in a deep trench to serve as sounding box the two ends of the upper side he made to curve upward like the ends of a canoe and between these he stretched the single string he plays upon it with a match or a little piece of stick and sings to it songs of his own country of which no person here can understand a single word and which are very likely all about fighting with his enemies in battle and killing them and i am sorry to say cooking them in a ground oven and eating them for supper when the fight is over  for arick is really what you might call a savage though a savage is a very different person in reality and a very much nicer from what he is made to appear in little books he is the sort of person that everybody smiles to or makes faces at or gives a smack to as he goes by the sort of person that all the girls on the plantation give the best seat to and help first and love to decorate with flowers and ribbons and yet all the while are laughing at him the sort of person who likes best to play with austin and whom austin perhaps when he is allowed likes best to play with he is all grins and giggles and little steps out of dances and little droll ways to attract peoples attention and set them laughing and yet when you come to look at him closer you will find that his body is all covered with scars this was when he was a child there was a war as is the way in these wild islands between his village and the next much as if there were war in london between one street and another and all the children ran about playing in the middle of the trouble and i dare say took no more notice of the war than you children in london do of a general election but sometimes at general elections english children may get run over by processions in the street and it chanced that as little arick was running about in the bush and very busy about his playing he ran into the midst of the warriors on the other side these speared him with a poisoned spear and his own people when they had found him lying for dead and in order to cure him of the poison cut him up with knives that were probably made of fishbones  this is a very savage piece of childlife and arick for all his goodnature is still a very savage person i have told you how the black boys sometimes run away from the plantations and live behind alone in the forest building little sheds to protect them from the rain and sometimes planting little gardens of food but for the most part living the best they can upon the nuts of the trees and yams that they dig with their hands out of the earth i do not think there can be anywhere in the world people more wretched than these runaways they cannot return for they would only return to be punished they can never hope to see again their own land or their own peopleindeed i do not know what they can hope but just to find enough yams every day to keep them from starvation and in the wet season of the year which is our summer and your winter and the rain falls day after day far harder and louder than the loudest thunderplump that ever fell in england and the noon is sometimes so dark that the lean man is glad to light his lamp to write by i can think of nothing so dreary as the state of these poor runaway slaves in the houseless bush you are to remember besides that the people of this island hate and fear them because they are cannibals sit and tell tales of them about their lamps at night in their own comfortable houses and are sometimes afraid to lie down to sleep if they think there is a lurking black boy in the neighbourhood well now arick is of their own race and language only he is a little more lucky because he has not run away and how do you think that he proposed to help them he asked if he might not have a gun what do you want with a gun arick was asked and he said quite simply and with his nice goodnatured smile that if he had a gun he would go up into the high bush and shoot black boys as men shoot pigeons he said nothing about eating them nor do i think he really meant to i think all he wanted was to clear the property of vermin as gamekeepers at home kill weasels or housewives mice  the other day he was sent down on an errand to the german firm where many of the black boys live it was very late when he came home on a bright moonlight night he had a white bandage round his head his eyes shone and he could scarcely speak for excitement it seems some of the black boys who were his enemies at home had attacked him and one with a knife by his own account he had fought very well but the odds were heavy the man with the knife had cut him both in the head and back he had been struck down and if some of the black boys of his own side had not come to the rescue he must certainly have been killed i am sure no christmasbox could make any of you children so happy as this fight made arick a great part of the next day he neglected his work to play upon the onestringed harp and sing songs about his great victory and today when he is gone upon his holiday he has announced that he is going back to the german firm to have another battle and another triumph i do not think he will go all the same or i should be more uneasy for i do not want to have my arick killed and there is no doubt that if he begins to fight again he will be likely to go on with it very far for i have seen him once when he saw or thought he saw an enemy it was one of our dreadful days of rain the sound of it like a great waterfall or like a tempest of wind blowing in the forest and there came to our door two runaway black boys seeking work in such weather as that my enemys dog as shakespeare says should have had a right to shelter but when arick saw these two poor rogues coming with their empty bellies and drenched clothes and one of them with a stolen cutlass in his hand through that world of falling water he had no thought of pity in his heart crouching behind one of the pillars of the verandah which he held in his two hands his mouth drew back into a strange sort of smile his eyes grew bigger and bigger and his whole face was just like the one word murder in big capitals  now i have told you a great deal too much about poor aricks savage nature and now i must tell you about a great amusement he had the other day there came an english ship of war in the harbour and the officers very good naturedly gave an entertainment of songs and dances and a magiclantern to which arick and austin were allowed to go at the door of the hall there were crowds of black boys waiting and trying to peep in the way children at home lie about and peep under the tent of a circus and you may be sure arick was a very proud person when he passed them all by and entered the hall with his ticket i wish i knew what he thought of the whole performance but the housekeeper of the lean man who sat just in front of him tells me what seemed to startle him the most the first thing was when two of the officers came out with blackened faces like christy minstrel boys and began to dance arick was sure that they were really black and his own people and he was wonderfully surprised to see them dance this new european style of dance but the great affair was the magiclantern the hall was made quite dark which was very little to aricks taste he sat there behind the housekeeper nothing to be seen of him but eyes and teeth and his heart beating finely in his little scarred breast and presently there came out on the white sheet that great bright eye of light that i am sure all you children must have often seen it was quite new to arick he had no idea what would happen next and in his fear and excitement he laid hold with his little slim black fingers like a birds claws on the neck of the housekeeper in front of him all through the rest of the show as one picture followed another on the white sheet he sat there gasping and clutching at the housekeepers neck and goodness knows whether he were more pleased or frightened doubtless it was a very fine thing to see all these bright pictures coming out and dying away again one after another but doubtless it was rather alarming also for how was it done and at last when there appeared upon the screen the head of a black woman as it might be his own mother or sister and the black woman of a sudden began to roll her eyes the fear or the excitement whichever it was wrung out of him a loud shuddering sob and i think we all ought to admire his courage when after an evening spent in looking on at such wonderful miracles he and austin set out alone through the forest to the lean mans house it was late at night and pitch dark when some of the party overtook the little white boy and the big black boy marching among the trees with their lantern i have told you the wood has an ill name and all the people of the island believe it to be full of devils but even if you do not believe in the devils it is a pretty dreadful place to walk in by the moving light of a lantern with nothing about you but a curious whirl of shadows and the black night above and beyond but arick kept his courage up and i dare say austins too with a perpetual chatter so that the people coming after heard his voice long before they saw the shining of the lantern  my dear miss boodlewill i be asking too much that you should send me back my letters to the children or copies if you prefer i have an idea that they may perhaps help in time to make up a book on the south seas for children i have addressed the cellar so long this time that you must take this note for yourself and excuse yours most sincerely       r l stevenson     to sidney colvin        thursday 15th september 1892  my dear colvinon tuesday we had our young adventurer46 ready and fanny belle he and i set out about three of a dark deadly hot and deeply unwholesome afternoon belle had the lad behind her i had a pint of champagne in either pocket a parcel in my hands and as jack had a girth sore and i rode without a girth i might be said to occupy a very unstrategic position on the way down a little dreary beastly drizzle beginning to come out of the darkness fanny put up an umbrella her horse bounded reared cannoned into me cannoned into belle and the lad and bolted for home it really might and ought to have been an a1 catastrophe but nothing happened beyond fannys nerves being a good deal shattered of course she could not tell what had happened to us until she got her horse mastered  next day haggard went off to the commission and left us in charge of his house all our people came down in wreaths of flowers we had a boat for them haggard had a flag in the commission boat for us and when at last the steamer turned up the young adventurer was carried on board in great style with a new watch and chain and about three pound ten of tips and five big baskets of fruit as freewill offerings to the captain captain morse had us all to lunch champagne flowed so did compliments and i did the affable celebrity lifesized it made a great sendoff for the young adventurer as the boat drew off he was standing at the head of the gangway supported by three handsome ladiesone of them a real fullblown beauty madame green the singerand looking very engaging himself between smiles and tears not that he cried in public my but we were a tired crowd however it is always a blessing to get home and this time it was a sort of wonder to ourselves that we got back alive casualties fannys back jarred horse incident belle bad headache tears and champagne self idiocy champagne fatigue lloyd ditto ditto as for the adventurer i believe he will have a delightful voyage for his little start in life but there is always something touching in a mites first launch  date unknowni am now well on with the third part of the débâcle47 the two first i liked much the second completely knocking me so far as it has gone this third part appears the ramblings of a dull man who has forgotten what he has to sayhe reminds me of an mp but sedan was really great and i will pick no holes the batteries under fire the redcross folk the county chargeperhaps above all major bouroche and the operations all beyond discussion and every word about the emperor splendid  september 30thdavid balfour done and its author along with it or nearly so strange to think of even our doctor here repeating his nonsense about debilitating climate why the work i have been doing the last twelve months in one continuous spate mostly with annoying interruptions and without any collapse to mention would be incredible in norway but i have broken down now and will do nothing as long as i possibly can with david balfour i am very well pleased in fact these labours of the last yeari mean falesá and d b not samoa of courseseem to me to be nearer what i mean than anything i have ever done nearer what i mean by fiction the nearest thing before was kidnapped i am not forgetting the master of ballantrae but that lacked all pleasurableness and hence was imperfect in essence so you see if i am a little tired i do not repent  the third part of the débâcle may be all very fine but i cannot read it it suffers from impaired vitality and uncertain aim two deadly sicknesses vitalthats what i am at first wholly vital with a buoyancy of life then lyrical if it may be and picturesque always with an epic value of scenes so that the figures remain in the minds eye for ever  october 8thsuppose you sent us some of the catalogues of the parties what vends statutes i dont want colossal herculeses but about quarter size and less if the catalogues were illustrated it would probably be found a help to weak memories these may be found to alleviate spare moments when we sometimes amuse ourselves by thinking how fine we shall make the palace if we do not go pop perhaps in the same way it might amuse you to send us any pattern of wall paper that might strike you as cheap pretty and suitable for a room in a hot and extremely bright climate it should be borne in mind that our climate can be extremely dark too our sittingroom is to be in varnished wood the room i have particularly in mind is a sort of bed and sittingroom pretty large lit on three sides and the colour in favour of its proprietor at present is a topazy yellow but then with what colour to relieve it for a little workroom of my own at the back i should rather like to see some patterns of unglossywell ill be hanged if i can describe this redits not turkish and its not roman and its not indian but it seems to partake of the two last and yet it cant be either of them because it ought to be able to go with vermillion ah what a tangled web we weaveanyway with what brains you have left choose me and send me somemanypatterns of this exact shade  a few days ago it was haggards birthday and we had him and his cousin to dinnerbless me if i ever told you of his cousinhe is here anyway and a fine pleasing specimen so that we have concluded after our own happy experience that the climate of samoa must be favourable to cousins48 then we went out on the verandah in a lovely moonlight drinking port hearing the cousin play and sing till presently we were informed that our boys had got up a siva in lafaeles house to which we were invited it was entirely their own idea the house you must understand is onehalf floored and onehalf bare earth and the daïs stands a little over knee high above the level of the soil the daïs was the stage with three footlights we audience sat on mats on the floor and the cook and three of our workboys sometimes assisted by our two ladies took their places behind the footlights and began a topical vailima song the burden was of course that of a samoan popular song about a white man who objects to all that he sees in samoa and there was of course a special verse for each one of the partylloyd was called the dancing man practically the chiefs handsome son of vailima he was also in his character i suppose of overseer compared to a policemanbelle had that day been the almoner in a semicomic distribution of wedding rings and thimbles bought cheap at an auction to the whole plantation company fitting a ring on every mans finger and a ring and a thimble on both the womens this was very much in character with her native name teuila the adorner of the uglyso of course this was the point of her verse and at a given moment all the performers displayed the rings upon their fingers pelema the cousinour cousin was described as watching from the house and whenever he saw any boy not doing anything running and doing it himself fannys verse was less intelligible but it was accompanied in the dance with a pantomime of terror wellfitted to call up her haunting indefatigable and diminutive presence in a blue gown     to gordon browne        vailima samoa autumn 1892    to the artist who did the illustrations to uma  dear siri only know you under the initials g b but you have done some exceedingly spirited and satisfactory illustrations to my story the beach of falesá and i wish to write and thank you expressly for the care and talent shown such numbers of people can do good black and whites so few can illustrate a story or apparently read it you have shown that you can do both and your creation of wiltshire is a real illumination of the text it was exactly so that wiltshire dressed and looked and you have the line of his nose to a nicety his nose is an inspiration nor should i forget to thank you for case particularly in his last appearance it is a singular factwhich seems to point still more directly to inspiration in your casethat your missionary actually resembles the fleshandblood person from whom mr tarleton was drawn the general effect of the islands is all that could be wished indeed i have but one criticism to make that in the background of case taking the dollar from mr tarletons headheadnot hand as the fools have printed itthe natives have a little too much the look of africans  but the great affair is that you have been to the pains to illustrate my story instead of making conscientious black and whites of people sitting talking i doubt if you have left unrepresented a single pictorial incident i am writing by this mail to the editor in the hopes that i may buy from him the originals and i am dear sir your very much obliged       robert louis stevenson     to miss morse      the next is an answer to an acknowledgment from a lady in the united    states one of many similar which he from time to time received of    help and encouragement derived from his writings       vailima samoan islands october 7th 1892  dear madami have a great diffidence in answering your valued letter it would be difficult for me to express the feelings with which i read itand am now trying to reread it as i dictate this  you ask me to forgive what you say must seem a liberty and i find that i cannot thank you sufficiently or even find a word with which to qualify your letter dear madam such a communication even the vainest man would think a sufficient reward for a lifetime of labour that i should have been able to give so much help and pleasure to your sister is the subject of my grateful wonder  that she being dead and speaking with your pen should be able to repay the debt with such a liberal interest is one of those things that reconcile us with the world and make us take hope again i do not know what i have done to deserve so beautiful and touching a compliment and i feel there is but one thing fit for me to say here that i will try with renewed courage to go on in the same path and to deserve if not to receive a similar return from others  you apologise for speaking so much about yourselves dear madam i thought you did so too little i should have wished to have known more of those who were so sympathetic as to find a consolation in my work and so graceful and so tactful as to acknowledge it in such a letter as was yours  will you offer to your mother the expression of a sympathy which coming from a stranger must seem very airy but which yet is genuine and accept for yourself my gratitude for the thought which inspired you to write to me and the words which you found to express it       robert louis stevenson     to miss taylor      lady taylor had died soon after the settlement of the stevenson    family at vailima the second paragraph refers to a test which had    been set before an expert in the reading of character by handwriting       vailima samoan islands october 7th 1892  my dear idai feel very much the implied reproof in yours just received but i assure you there is no fear of our forgetting either una or yourself or your dear mother who was one of the women i have most admired and loved in the whole of my way through life the truth is that fanny writes to nobody and that i am on the whole rather overworked i compose lots of letters to lots of unforgotten friends but when it comes to taking the pen between my fingers there are many impediments hence it comes that i am now writing to you by an amanuensis at which i know you will be very angry well it was hobsons choice a little while ago i had very bad threatenings of scriveners cramp and if belle fannys daughter of whom you remember to have heard had not taken up the pen for my correspondence i doubt you would never have heard from me again except in the way of books i wish you and una would be so good as to write to us now and then even without encouragement an unsolicited letter would be almost certain sooner or later depending on the activity of the conscience to produce some sort of an apology for an answer  all this upon one condition that you send me your friends description of my looks age and character the character of my work i am not so careful about but did you ever hear of anything so tantalizing as for you to tell me the story and not send me your notes i expect it was a device to extract an answer and as you see it has succeeded let me suggest if your friend be handy that the present letter would be a very delicate test it is in one persons handwriting it expresses the ideas of another of the writer herself you know nothing i should be very curious to know what the sibyl will make of such a problem  if you carry out your design of settling in london you must be sure and let us have the new address i swear we shall write some timeand if the interval be long you must just take it on your own head for prophesying horrors you remember how you always said we were but an encampment of bedouins and that you would awake some morning to find us fled for ever nothing unsettled me more than these illjudged remarks i was doing my best to be a sedentary semirespectable man in a suburban villa and you were always shaking your head at me and assuring me what i knew to be partly true that it was all a farce even here when i have sunk practically all that i possess and have good health and my fill of congenial fighting and could not possibly get away if i wanted ever soeven here and now the recollection of these infidel prophesies rings in my ears like an invitation to the sea tu las voulu  i know you want some of our news and it is all so far away that i know not when to begin we have a big house and we are building anotherpray god that we can pay for it i am just reminded that we have no less than eight several places of habitation in this place which was a piece of uncleared forest some three years ago i think there are on my pay rolls at the present moment thirteen human souls not counting two washerwomen who come and go in addition to this i am at daggers drawn with the government have had my correspondence stopped and opened by the chief justiceit was correspondence with the socalled rebel kingand have had boys examined and threatened with deportation to betray the secrets of my relations with the same person in addition to this i might direct attention to those trifling exercises of the fancy my literary works and i hope you wont think that i am likely to suffer from ennui nor is fanny any less active ill or well rain or shine a little blue indefatigable figure is to be observed howking about certain patches of garden she comes in heated and bemired up to the eyebrows late for every meal she has reached a sort of tragic placidity whenever she plants anything new the boys weed it up whenever she tries to keep anything for seed the houseboys throw it away and she has reached that pitch of a kind of noble dejection that she would almost say she did not mind anyway her cabbages have succeeded talolo our native cook and a very good one too likened them the other day to the head of a german and even this hyperbolical image was grudging i remember all the trouble you had with servants at the roost the most of them were nothing to the trances that we have to go through here at times when i have to hold a bed of justice and take evidence which is never twice the same and decide practically blindfold and after i have decided have the accuser take back the accusation in block and beg for mercy for the culprit conceive the annoyance of all this when you are very fond of bothyour affectionate friend       robert louis stevenson     to e l burlingame        vailima plantation samoan islands oct 10th 1892  my dear burlingameit is now as you see the 10th of october and there has not reached the island of upolu one single copy or rag of a copy of the samoa book i lie there has come one and that in the pocket of a missionary man who is at daggers drawn with me who lends it to all my enemies conceals it from all my friends and is bringing a lawsuit against me on the strength of expressions in the same which i have forgotten and now cannot see this is pretty tragic i think you will allow and i was inclined to fancy it was the fault of the post office but i hear from my sisterinlaw mrs sanchez that she is in the same case and has received no footnote i have also to consider that i had no letter from you last mail although you ought to have received by that time my grandfather and scott and me and my grandfather taking one consideration with another therefore i prefer to conceive that no 743 broadway has fallen upon gentle and continuous slumber and is become an enchanted palace among publishing houses if it be not so if the footnotes were really sent i hope you will fall upon the post office with all the vigour you possess how does the wrecker go in the states it seems to be doing exceptionally well in englandyours sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      this letter contains the first announcement of the scheme of weir of    hermiston       vailima october 28th 1892  my dear colvinthis is very late to begin the monthly budget but i have a good excuse this time for i have had a very annoying fever with symptoms of sore arm and in the midst of it a very annoying piece of business which suffered no delay or idleness  the consequence of all this was that my fever got very much worse and your letter has not been hitherto written but my dear fellow do compare these little larky fevers with the fine healthy prostrating colds of the dear old dead days at home here was i in the middle of a pretty bad one and i was able to put it in my pocket and go down day after day and attend to and put my strength into this beastly business do you see me doing that with a catarrh and if i had done so what would have been the result  last night about four oclock belle and i set off to apia whither my mother had preceded us she was at the mission we went to haggards there we had to wait the most unconscionable time for dinner i do not wish to speak lightly of the amanuensis who is unavoidably present but i may at least say for myself that i was as cross as two sticks dinner came at last we had the tinned soup which is usually the pièce de resistance in the halls of haggard and we pitched into it followed an excellent salad of tomatoes and crayfish a good indian curry a tender joint of beef a dish of pigeons a pudding cheese and coffee i was so overeaten after this hunger and burst that i could scarcely move and it was my sad fate that night in the character of the local author to eloquute before the publicmr stevenson will read a selection from his own worksa degrading picture i had determined to read them the account of the hurricane i do not know if i told you that my book has never turned up here or rather only one copy has and that in the unfriendly hands of  it has therefore only been seen by enemies and this combination of mystery and evil report has been greatly envenomed by some illjudged newspaper articles from the states altogether this specimen was listened to with a good deal of uncomfortable expectation on the part of the germans and when it was over was applauded with unmistakable relief the public hall where these revels came off seems to be unlucky for me i never go there but to some stonebreaking job last time it was the public meeting of which i must have written you this time it was this uneasy but not on the whole unsuccessful experiment belle my mother and i rode home about midnight in a fine display of lightning and witchfires my mother is absent so that i may dare to say that she struck me as voluble the amanuensis did not strike me the same way she was probably thinking but it was really rather a weird business and i saw what i have never seen before the witchfires gathered into little bright blue points almost as bright as a nightlight  saturdaythis is the day that should bring your letter it is gray and cloudy and windless thunder rolls in the mountain it is a quarter past six and i am alone sir alone in this workmans house belle and lloyd having been down all yesterday to meet the steamer they were scarce gone with most of the horses and all the saddles than there began a perfect picnic of the sick and maim iopu with a bad foot faauma with a bad shoulder fanny with yellow spots it was at first proposed to carry all these to the doctor particularly faauma whose shoulder bore an appearance of erysipelas that sent the amateur below no horses no saddle now i had my horse and i could borrow lafaeles saddle and if i went alone i could do a job that had long been waiting and that was to interview the doctor on another matter off i set in a hazy moonlight night windless like today the thunder rolling in the mountain as today in the still groves these little mushroom lamps glowing blue and steady singly or in pairs well i had my interview said everything as i had meant and with just the result i hoped for the doctor and i drank beer together and discussed german literature until nine and we parted the best of friends i got home to a silent house of sleepers only fanny awaiting me we talked awhile in whispers on the interview then i got a lantern and went across to the workmans house now empty and silent myself sole occupant so to bed prodigious tired but mighty content with my nights work and today with a headache and a chill have written you this page while my new novel waits of this i will tell you nothing except the various names under consideration first it ought to be calledbut of

saturday we expected captain morse of the alameda to come up to lunch and on friday with genuine south sea hospitality had a pig killed on the saturday morning no pig some of the boys seemed to give a doubtful account of themselves our next neighbour below in the wood is a bad fellow and very intimate with some of our boys for whom his confounded house is like a flypaper for flies to add to all this there was on the saturday a great public presentation of food to the king and parliament men an occasion on which it is almost dignified for a samoan to steal anything and entirely dignified for him to steal a pig  the amanuensis went to the talolo as it is called and saw something so very pleasing she begs to interrupt the letter to tell it the different villagers came in in bandsled by the maid of the village followed by the young warriors it was a very fine sight for some three thousand people are said to have assembled the men wore nothing but magnificent headdresses and a bunch of leaves and were oiled and glistening in the sunlight one band had no maid but was led by a tiny child of about fivea serious little creature clad in a ribbon of grass and a fine headdress who skipped with elaborate leaps in front of the warriors like a little kid leading a band of lions      am  the am being done i go on again all this made it very possible that even if none of our boys had stolen the pig some of them might know the thief besides the theft as it was a theft of meat prepared for a guest had something of the nature of an insult and my face in native phrase was ashamed accordingly we determined to hold a bed of justice it was done last night after dinner i sat at the head of the table graham on my right hand henry simelé at my left lloyd behind him the house company sat on the floor around the wallstwelve all told i am described as looking as like braxfield as i could manage with my appearance graham who is of a severe countenance looked like rhadamanthus lloyd was hideous to the view and simelé had all the fine solemnity of a samoan chief the proceedings opened by my delivering a samoan prayer which may be translated thusour god look down upon us and shine into our hearts help us to be far from falsehood so that each one of us may stand before thy face in his integritythen beginning with simelé every one came up to the table laid his hand on the bible and repeated clause by clause after me the following oathi fear it may sound even comic in english but it is a very pretty piece of samoan and struck direct at the most lively superstitions of the race this is the holy bible here that i am touching behold me o god if i know who it was that took away the pig or the place to which it was taken or have heard anything relating to it and shall not declare the samebe made an end of by god this life of mine they all took it with so much seriousness and firmness that as graham said if they were not innocent they would make invaluable witnesses i was so far impressed by their bearing that i went no further and the funny and yet strangely solemn scene came to an end  sunday nov 6thhere is a long story to go back upon and i wonder if i have either time or patience for the task  wednesday i had a great idea of matchmaking and proposed to henry that faalé would make a good wife for him i wish i had put this down when it was fresher in my mind it was so interesting an interview my gentleman would not tell if i were on or not i do not know yet i will tell you next week may i tell the sister of my father no better not tell her when it is donebut will not your family be angry if you marry without asking themmy village what does my village want mats i said i thought the girl would grow up to have a great deal of sense and my gentleman flew out upon me she had sense now he said  thursday we were startled by the note of guns and presently after heard it was an english warship graham and i set off at once and as soon as we met any townsfolk they began crying to me that i was to be arrested it was the vossische zeitung article which had been quoted in a paper went on board and saw captain bourke he did not even knownot even guesswhy he was here having been sent off by cablegram from auckland it is hoped the same ship that takes this off europewards may bring his orders and our news but which is it to be heads or tails if it is to be german i hope they will deport me i should prefer it so i do not think that i could bear a german officialdom and should probably have to leave sponte mea which is only less picturesque and more expensive  8thmail day all well not yet put in prison whatever may be in store for me no time even to sign this lame letter     to j m barrie        vailima plantation samoan islands november 1st 1892  dear mr barriei can scarce thank you sufficiently for your extremely amusing letter no the auld licht idyls never reached mei wish it had and i wonder extremely whether it would not be good for me to have a pennyworth of the auld licht pulpit it is a singular thing that i should live here in the south seas under conditions so new and so striking and yet my imagination so continually inhabit that cold old huddle of grey hills from which we come i have just finished david balfour i have another book on the stocks the young chevalier which is to be part in france and part in scotland and to deal with prince charlie about the year 1749 and now what have i done but begun a third which is to be all moorland together and is to have for a centrepiece a figure that i think you will appreciatethat of the immortal braxfieldbraxfield himself is my grand premier or since you are so much involved in the british drama let me say my heavy lead  your descriptions of your dealings with lord rintoul are frightfully unconscientious you should never write about anybody until you persuade yourself at least for the moment that you love him above all anybody on whom your plot revolves it will always make a hole in the book and if he has anything to do with the mechanism prove a stick in your machinery but you know all this better than i do and it is one of your most promising traits that you do not take your powers too seriously the little minister ought to have ended badly we all know it did and we are infinitely grateful to you for the grace and good feeling with which you lied about it if you had told the truth i for one could never have forgiven you as you had conceived and written the earlier parts the truth about the end though indisputably true to fact would have been a lie or what is worse a discord in art if you are going to make a book end badly it must end badly from the beginning now your book began to end well you let yourself fall in love with and fondle and smile at your puppets once you had done that your honour was committedat the cost of truth to life you were bound to save them it is the blot on richard feverel for instance that it begins to end well and then tricks you and ends ill but in that case there is worse behind for the illending does not inherently issue from the plotthe story had in fact ended well after the great last interview between richard and lucyand the blind illogical bullet which smashes all has no more to do between the boards than a fly has to do with the room into whose open window it comes buzzing it might have so happened it needed not and unless needs must we have no right to pain our readers i have had a heavy case of conscience of the same kind about my braxfield story braxfieldonly his name is hermistonhas a son who is condemned to death plainly there is a fine tempting fitness about this and i meant he was to hang but now on considering my minor characters i saw there were five people who wouldin a sense who mustbreak prison and attempt his rescue they were capable hardy folks too who might very well succeed why should they not then why should not young hermiston escape clear out of the country and be happy if he could with his but soft i will not betray my secret or my heroine suffice it to breathe in your ear that she was what hardy calls and others in their plain way dont a pure woman50 much virtue in a capital letter such as yours was  write to me again in my infinite distance tell me about your new book no harm in telling me i am too far off to be indiscreet there are too few near me who would care to hear i am rushes by the riverside and the stream is in babylon breathe your secrets to me fearlessly and if the trade wind caught and carried them away there are none to catch them nearer than australia unless it were the tropic birds in the unavoidable absence of my amanuensis who is buying eels for dinner i have thus concluded my dispatch like st paul with my own hand  and in the inimitable words of lord kames faur ye weel ye bitchyours very truly       robert louis stevenson     to e l burlingame        vailima plantation nov 2nd 1892  my dear burlingamein the first place i have to acknowledge receipt of your munificent cheque for three hundred and fifty dollars glad you liked the scott voyage rather more than i did upon the whole as the proofs have not turned up at all there can be no question of returning them and i am therefore very much pleased to think you have arranged not to wait the volumes of adams arrived along with yours of october 6th one of the dictionaries has also blundered home apparently from the colonies the other is still to seek i note and sympathise with your bewilderment as to falesá my own direct correspondence with mr baxter is now about three months in abeyance altogether you see how well it would be if you could do anything to wake up the post office not a single copy of the footnote has yet reached samoa but i hear of one having come to its address in hawaii glad to hear good news of stoddardyours sincerely       r l stevenson  pssince the above was written an aftermath of post matter came in among which were the proofs of my grandfather i shall correct and return them but as i have lost all confidence in the post office i shall mention here first galley 4th line from the bottom for as read or  should i ever again have to use my work without waiting for proofs bear in mind this golden principle from a congenital defect i must suppose i am unable to write the word orwherever i write it the printer unerringly puts asand those who read for me had better wherever it is possible substitute or for as this the more so since many writers have a habit of using as which is death to my temper and confusion to my face       r l s     to lieutenant eeles      the following is addressed to one of stevensons best friends among    the officers of hms the curaçoa which had been for some time on    the south pacific station       vailima plantation upolu samoan islands november 15th 1892  dear eelesin the first place excuse me writing to you by another hand as that is the way in which alone all my correspondence gets effected before i took to this method or rather before i found a victim it simply didnt get effected  thank you again and again first for your kind thought of writing to me and second for your extremely amusing and interesting letter you can have no guess how immediately interesting it was to our family first of all the poor soul at nukufetau is an old friend of ours and we have actually treated him ourselves on a former visit to the island i dont know if hoskin would approve of our treatment it consisted i believe mostly in a present of stout and a recommendation to put nails in his watertank we also as you seem to have done recommended him to leave the island and i remember very well how wise and kind we thought his answer he had halfcaste children he said who would suffer and perhaps be despised if he carried them elsewhere if he left them there alone they would almost certainly miscarry and the best thing was that he should stay and die with them but the cream of the fun was your meeting with buckland we not only know him but as the french say we dont know anybody else he is our intimate and adored original andprepare your mindhe was is and ever will be tommy haddon51 as i dont believe you to be inspired i suspect you to have suspected this at least it was a mighty happy suspicion you are quite right tommy is really a good chap though about as comic as they make them  i was extremely interested in your fiji legend and perhaps even more so in your capital account of the curaçoas misadventure alas we have nothing so thrilling to relate all hangs and fools on in this isle of misgovernment without change though not without novelty but wholly without hope unless perhaps you should consider it hopeful that i am still more immediately threatened with arrest the confounded thing is that if it comes off i shall be sent away in the ringarooma instead of the curaçoa the former ship burst upon us by the runshe had been sent off by despatch and without ordersand to make me a little more easy in my mind she brought newspapers clamouring for my incarceration since then i have had a conversation with the german consul he said he had read a review of my samoa book and if the review were fair must regard it as an insult and one that would have to be resented at the same time i learn that letters addressed to the german squadron lie for them here in the post office reports are current of other english ships being on the wayi hope to goodness yours will be among the number and i gather from one thing and another that there must be a holy row going on between the powers at home and that the issue like all else connected with samoa is on the knees of the gods one thing however is pretty sureif that issue prove to be a german protectorate i shall have to tramp can you give us any advice as to a fresh field of energy we have been searching the atlas and it seems difficult to fill the bill how would rarotonga do i forget if you have been there the best of it is that my new house is going up like winking and i am dictating this letter to the accompaniment of saws and hammers a hundred black boys and about a score draught oxen perished or at least barely escaped with their lives from the mud holes on our road bringing up the materials it will be a fine legacy to higms protectorate and doubtless the governor will take it for his country house51 the ringarooma people by the way seem very nice i liked stansfield particularly  our middy53 has gone up to san francisco in pursuit of the phantom education we have good word of him and i hope he will not be in disgrace again as he was when the hope of the british navyneed i say that i refer to admiral burneyhonoured us last the next time you come as the new house will be finished we shall be able to offer you a bed nares and meiklejohn may like to hear that our new room is to be big enough to dance in it will be a very pleasant day for me to see the curaçoa in port again and at least a proper contingent of her officers skipping in my all  we have just had a feast on my birthday at which we had three of the ringaroomas and i wish they had been three curaçoassay yourself hoskin and burney the ever great consider this an invitation our boys had got the thing up regardless there were two huge sowso brutes of animals that would have broken down a hansom cabfour smaller pigs two barrels of beef and a horror of vegetables and fowls we sat down between forty and fifty in a big new native house behind the kitchen that you have never seen and ate and public spoke till all was blue then we had about half an hours holiday with some beer and sherry and brandy and soda to restrengthen the european heart and then out to the old native house to see a siva finally all the guests were packed off in a trackless black night and down a road that was rather fitted for the curaçoa than any human pedestrian though to be sure i do not know the draught of the curaçoa my ladies one and all desire to be particularly remembered to our friends on board and all look forward as i do myself in the hope of your returnyours sincerely       robert louis stevenson  and let me hear from you again     to charles baxter      the following extract gives a hint of stevensons intended management    of one of the most difficult points in the plot of weir of    hermiston       1st dec 92   i have a novel on the stocks to be called the justiceclerk it is pretty scotch the grand premier is taken from braxfieldoh by the by send me cockburns memorialsand some of the story iswellqueer the heroine is seduced by one man and finally disappears with the other man who shot him mind you i expect the justiceclerk to be my masterpiece my braxfield is already a thing of beauty and a joy for ever and so far as he has gone far my best character  latersecond thought i wish pitcairns criminal trials quam primum also an absolutely correct text of the scots judiciary oath  also in case pitcairn does not come down late enough i wish as full a report as possible of a scotch murder trial between 17901820 understand the fullest possible  is there any book which would guide me as to the following facts  the justiceclerk tries some people capitally on circuit certain evidence cropping up the charge is transferred to the jcs own son of course in the next trial the jc is excluded and the case is called before the lordjustice general  where would this trial have to be i fear in edinburgh which would not suit my view could it be again at the circuit town       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        nov 30 1892  my dear colvinanother grimy little odd and end of paper for which you shall be this month repaid in kind and serve you jolly well right this is a strange life i live always on the brink of deportation mens lives in the scaleand well you know my character if i were to pretend to you that i was not amused you would justly scorn me the new house is roofed it will be a braw house and what is better i have my yearly bill in and i find i can pay for it for all which mercies etc i must have made close on £4000 this year all told but what is not so pleasant i seem to have come near to spending them i have been in great alarm with this new house on the cards all summer and came very near to taking in sail but i live here so entirely on credit that i determined to hang on  dec 1sti was saying yesterday that my life was strange and did not think how well i spoke yesterday evening i was briefed to defend a political prisoner before the deputy commissioner what do you think of that for a vicissitude  dec 3rdnow for a confession when i heard you and cassells had decided to print the bottle imp along with falesá i was too much disappointed to answer the bottle imp was the pièce de résistance for my volume island nights entertainments however that volume might have never got done and i send you two others in case they should be in time  first have the beach of falesá  then a fresh false title island nights entertainments and then  the bottle imp a cue from an old melodrama  the isle of voices  the waif woman a cue from a saga  of course these two others are not up to the mark of the bottle imp but they each have a certain merit and they fit in style by saying a cue from an old melodrama after the b i you can get rid of my note if this is in time it will be splendid and will make quite a volume  should you and cassells prefer you can call the whole volume i n ethough the beach of falesá is the child of a quite different inspiration they all have a queer realism even the most extravagant even the isle of voices the manners are exact  should they come too late have them typewritten and return to me here the typewritten copies  sunday dec 4th3rd startbut now more humbly and with the aid of an amanuensis first one word about page 2 my wife protests against the waif woman and i am instructed to report the same to you54  dec 5tha horrid alarm rises that our october mail was burned crossing the plains if so you lost a beautiful long letteri am sure it was beautiful though i remember nothing about itand i must say i think it serves you properly well that i should continue writing to you at such length is simply a vicious habit for which i blush at the same time please communicate at once with charles baxter whether you have or have not received a letter posted here oct 12th as he is going to cable me the fate of my mail  now to conclude my news the german firm have taken my book like angels and the result is that lloyd and i were down there at dinner on saturday where we partook of fifteen several dishes and eight distinct forms of intoxicating drink to the credit of germany i must say there was not a shadow of a headache the next morning i seem to have done as well as my neighbours for i hear one of the clerks expressed the next morning a gratified surprise that mr stevenson stood his drink so well it is a strange thing that any race can still find joy in such athletic exercises i may remark in passing that the mail is due and you have had far more than you deserve       r l s     to mrs fleeming jenkin        december 5th 1892  my dear mrs jenkin so much said i come with guilty speed to what more immediately concerns myself spare us a month or two for old sakes sake and make my wife and me happy and proud we are only fourteen days from san francisco just about a month from liverpool we have our new house almost finished the thing can be done i believe we can make you almost comfortable it is the loveliest climate in the world our political troubles seem near an end it can be done it must do please make a virtuous effort come and take a glimpse of a new world i am sure you do not dream of and some old friends who do often dream of your arrival  alas i was just beginning to get eloquent and there goes the lunch bell and after lunch i must make up the mail  do come you must not come in february or marchbad months from april on it is delightfulyour sincere friend       robert louis stevenson     to henry james        december 5th 1892  my dear jameshow comes it so great a silence has fallen the still small voice of selfapproval whispers me it is not from me i have looked up my register and find i have neither written to you nor heard from you since june 22nd on which day of grace that invaluable work began this is not as it should be how to get back i remember acknowledging with rapture the lesson of the master and i remember receiving marbot was that our last relation  hey well anyway as you may have probably gathered from the papers i have been in devilish hot water and what may be new to you devilish hard at work in twelve calendar months i finished the wrecker wrote all of falesá but the first chapter well much of the history of samoa did something here and there to my life of my grandfather and began and finished david balfour what do you think of it for a year since then i may say i have done nothing beyond draft three chapters of another novel the justiceclerk which ought to be a snorter and a blowerat least if it dont make a spoon it will spoil the horn of an aurochs if thats how it should be spelt  on the hot water side it may entertain you to know that i have been actually sentenced to deportation by my friends on mulinuu cj cedercrantz and baron senfft von pilsach the awful doom however declined to fall owing to circumstances over which i only heard of it so to speak last night i mean officially but i had walked among rumours the whole tale will be some day put into my hand and i shall share it with humorous friends  it is likely however by my judgment that this epoch of gaiety in samoa will soon cease and the fierce white light of history will beat no longer on yours sincerely and his fellows here on the beach we ask ourselves whether the reason will more rejoice over the end of a disgraceful business or the unregenerate man more sorrow over the stoppage of the fun for say what you please it has been a deeply interesting time you dont know what news is nor what politics nor what the life of man till you see it on so small a scale and with your own liberty on the board for stake i would not have missed it for much and anxious friends beg me to stay at home and study human nature in brompton drawingrooms farceurs and anyway you know that such is not my talent i could never be induced to take the faintest interest in brompton qua brompton or a drawingroom qua a drawingroom i am an epick writer with a k to it but without the necessary genius  hurry up with another book of stories i am now reduced to two of my contemporaries you and barrieo and kiplingyou and barrie and kipling are now my muses three and with kipling as you know there are reservations to be made and you and barrie dont write enough i should say i also read anstey when he is serious and can almost always get a happy day out of marion crawfordce nest pas toujours la guerre but its got life to it and guts and it moves did you read the witch of prague nobody could read it twice of course and the first time even it was necessary to skip e pur si muove but barrie is a beauty the little minister and the window in thrums eh stuff in that young man but he must see and not be too funny genius in him but theres a journalist at his elbowtheres the risk look what a page is the glove business in the window knocks a man flat thats guts if you please  why have i wasted the little time that is left with a sort of naked review article i dont know im sure i suppose a mere ebullition of congested literary talk i am beginning to think a visit from friends would be due wish you could come  let us have your news anyway and forgive this silly stale effusionyours ever       robert louis stevenson     to j m barrie       vailima december 1892  dear j m barrieyou will be sick of me soon i cannot help it i have been off my work for some time and reread the edinburgh eleven and had a great mind to write a parody and give you all your sauce back again and see how you would like it yourself and then i read for the first timei know not how the window in thrums i dont say that it is better than the minister its less of a taleand there is a beauty a material beauty of the tale ipse which clever critics nowadays long and love to forget it has more real flaws but somehow it iswell i read it last anyway and its by barrie and hes the man for my money the glove is a great page it is startlingly original and as true as death and judgment tibbie birse in the burial is great but i think it was a journalist that got in the word official the same character plainly had a word to say to thomas haggard thomas affects me as a liei beg your pardon doubtless he was somebody you knew that leads people so far astray the actual is not the true  i am proud to think you are a scotchmanthough to be sure i know nothing of that country being only an english tourist quo gavin ogilvy i commend the hard case of mr gavin ogilvy to j m barrie whose work is to me a source of living pleasure and heartfelt national pride there are two of us now that the shirra might have patted on the head and please do not think when i thus seem to bracket myself with you that i am wholly blinded with vanity jess is beyond my frontier line i could not touch her skirt i have no such glamour of twilight on my pen i am a capable artist but it begins to look to me as if you were a man of genius take care of yourself for my sake its a devilish hard thing for a man who writes so many novels as i do that i should get so few to read and i can read yours and i love them  a pity for you that my amanuensis is not on stock today and my own hand perceptibly worse than usualyours       robert louis stevenson        december 5th 1892  psthey tell me your health is not strong man come out here and try the prophets chamber theres only one bad point to uswe do rise early the amanuensis states that you are a lover of silenceand that ours is a noisy houseand she is a chatterboxi am not answerable for these statements though i do think there is a touch of garrulity about my premises we have so little to talk about you see the house is three miles from town in the midst of great silent forests there is a burn close by and when we are not talking you can hear the burn and the birds and the sea breaking on the coast three miles away and six hundred feet below us and about three times a month a belli dont know where the bell is nor who rings it it may be the bell in hans andersens story for all i know it is never hot here86 in the shade is about our hottestand it is never cold except just in the early mornings take it for all in all i suppose this island climate to be by far the healthiest in the worldeven the influenza entirely lost its sting only two patients died and one was a man nearly eighty and the other a child below four months i wont tell you if it is beautiful for i want you to come here and see for yourself everybody on the premises except my wife has some scotch blood in their veinsi beg your pardonexcept the nativesand then my wife is a dutchwomanand the natives are the next thing conceivable to highlanders before the fortyfive we would have some grand cracks       r l s  come it will broaden your mind and be the making of me     to charles baxter      this correspondent had lately been on a tour in sweden       vailima december 28th 1892  my dear charlesyour really decent letter to hand and here i am answering it to the merry note of the carpenters hammer in an upper room of the new house this upper floor is almost done now but the grrrrrreat all below is still unlined it is all to be varnished redwood i paid a big figure but do not repent the trouble has been so minimised the work has been so workmanlike and all the parties have been so obliging what a pity when you met the buried majesty of swedenthe sovereign of my cedercrantzyou did not breathe in his ear a word of samoa    o sovereign of my cedercrantz   conceive how his plump carcase pants   to leave the spot he now is treed in   and skip with all the dibbs to sweden   o sovereign of my cedercrantz   the lowly plea i now advantz   remove this man of light and leadin   from us to more congenial sweden  this kind of thing might be kept up a lapland night let us bury the great jokeshade of tennyson forgive  i am glad to say you can scarce receive the second bill for the house until next mail which gives more room to turn round in yes my rate of expenditure is hellish it is funny it crept up and up and when we sat upon one vent another exploded lloyd and i grew grey over the monthly returns but every damned month there is a new extra however we always hope the next will prove less recalcitrant in which faith we advance trembling  the desiderated advertisement i think i have told you was mighty near supplied that is if deportation would suit your view the ship was actually sought to be hired yes it would have been an advertisement and rather a lark and yet a blooming nuisance for my part i shall try to do without  no one has thought fit to send me atalanta55 and i have no proof at all of d balfour which is far more serious how about the d b map as soon as there is a proof it were well i should see it to accord the text theretoor tother way about if needs must remember i had to go much on memory in writing that work did you observe the dedication and how did you like it if it dont suit you i am to try my hand againyours ever       r l s   footnotes    32 editors and publishers since those days we have been déniaisés     with a vengeance had actually been

by the new year of 1893 the fine addition to the house at vailima was finished and its pleasantness and comfort went far to console stevenson for the cost but the year was on the whole a less fortunate one for the inmates than the last a proclamation concerning penalties for sedition in the samoan islands which from its tenor could have been aimed at no one else but stevenson had been issued at the close of 1892 by the high commissioner at fiji and with its modification and practical withdrawal by order of the foreign office at home the last threat of unpleasant consequences in connection with his political action disappeared but a sharp second attack of influenza in january lowered his vitality and from a trip which the family took for the sake of change to sydney in the month of february they returned with health unimproved in april the illness of mrs stevenson caused her husband some weeks of acute distress and anxiety in august he suffered the chagrin of witnessing the outbreak of the war which he had vainly striven to prevent between the two rival kings and the defeat and banishment of mataafa whom he knew to be the one man of governing capacity among the native chiefs and whom in the interest alike of whites and natives he had desired to see the powers not crush but conciliate on the other hand he had the satisfaction of seeing the chief justice and president removed from the posts they had so incompetently filled and superseded by new and better men the task imposed by the three powers upon these officials was in truth an impossible one but their characters and endeavours earned respect and with the american chief justice in particular mr c j ide whom he had already known as one of the land commissioners and with his family the vailima household lived on terms of cordial friendship in september stevenson took a healthtrip to honolulu which again turned out unsuccessful for some weeks he was down with a renewed attack of fever and prostration and his wife had to come from samoa to nurse and fetch him home later in the autumn he mended again  during no part of the year were stevensons working powers up to the mark in the early summer he finished the ebb tide but on a plan much abridged from its original intention and with an unusual degree of strain and effort with st ives and his own family history he made fair progress but both of these he regarded as in a manner holiday tasks not calling for any very serious exercise of his powers in connection with the latter he took an eager interest as his correspondence will show in the researches which friends and kinsmen undertook for him in scotland he fell into arrears in regard to one or two magazine stories for which he had contracted and with none of his more ambitious schemes of romance sophia scarlet the young chevalier heathercat and weir of hermiston did he feel himself well able to cope this fallingoff of his power of production brought with it no small degree of inward strain and anxiety he had not yet put by any provision for his wife and stepfamily the income from the moderate fortune left by his father naturally going to his mother during her life his earnings had since 1887 been considerable at the rate of £4000 a year or thereabouts but his building expenses and large mode of life at vailima together with his habitual generosity which scarce knew check or limit towards the less fortunate of his friends and acquaintances in various parts of the world made his expenditure about equal to his income the idea originally entertained of turning part of the vailima estate into a profitable plantation turned out chimerical the thought began to haunt him what if his power of earning were soon to cease and occasional signs of inward depression and lifeweariness began to appear in his correspondence but it was only in writing and then but rarely that he let such signs appear to those about him he retained the old affectionate charm and inspiring gaiety undiminished fulfilling without failure the words of his own prayer give us to awake with smiles give us to labour smiling as the sun lightens the world so let our lovingkindness make bright this house of our habitation     to sidney colvin        vailima january 1893  my dear colvinyou are properly paid at last and it is like you will have but a shadow of a letter i have been pretty thoroughly out of kilter first a fever that would neither come on nor go off then acute dyspepsia in the weakening grasp of which i get wandering between the waking state and one of nightmare why the devil does no one send me atalanta and why are there no proofs of d balfour sure i should have had the whole at least the half of them by now and it would be all for the advantage of the atalantans i have written to cassell  co matter of falesá you will please arrange with him meaning you what he may decide i shall abide so consider your hand free and act for me without fear or favour i am greatly pleased with the illustrations it is very strange to a southseayer to see hawaiian women dressed like samoans but i guess thats all one to you in middlesex its about the same as if london city men were shown going to the stock exchange as pifferari but no matter none will sleep worse for it i have accepted cassells proposal as an amendment to one of mine that d b is to be brought out first under the title catriona without pictures and when the hour strikes kidnapped and catriona are to form vols i and ii of the heavily illustrated adventures of david balfour at 7s 6d each sold separately  s letter was vastly sly and dry and shy56 i am not afraid now two attempts have been made both have failed and i imagine these failures strengthen me above all this is true of the last where my weak point was attempted on every other i am strong only force can dislodge me for public opinion is wholly on my side all races and degrees are united in heartfelt opposition to the men of mulinuu the news of the fighting was of no concern to mortal man it was made much of because men love talk of battles and because the government pray god daily for some scandal not their own but it was only a brisk episode in a clan fight which has grown apparently endemic in the west of tutuila at the best it was a twopenny affair and never occupied my mind five minutes  i am so weary of reports that are without foundation and threats that go without fulfilment and so much occupied besides by the raging troubles of my own wame that i have been very slack on politics as i have been in literature with incredible labour i have rewritten the first chapter of the justiceclerk it took me about ten days and requires another athletic dressing after all and that is my story for the month the rest is grunting and grutching  consideranda for the beach  i whether to add one or both the tales i sent you  ii whether to call the whole volume island nights entertainments  iii whether having waited so long it would not be better to give me another mail in case i could add another member to the volume and a little better justify the name  if i possibly can draw up another story i will what annoyed me about the use of the bottle imp was that i had always meant it for the centrepiece of a volume of märchen which i was slowly to elaborate you always had an idea that i depreciated the b i i cant think wherefore i always particularly liked itone of my best works and ill to equal and that was why i loved to keep it in portfolio till i had time to grow up to some other fruit of the same venue however that is disposed of now and we must just do the best we can  i am not aware that there is anything to add the weather is hellish waterspouts mists chills the foul fiends own weather following on a week of expurgated heaven so it goes at this bewildering season i write in the upper floor of my new house of which i will send you some day a plan to measure tis an elegant structure surely and the proid of me oi was asked to pay for it just now and genteelly refused and then agreed in view of general goodwill to pay a half of what is still due  24th january 1893this ought to have gone last mail and was forgotten my best excuse is that i was engaged in starting an influenza to which class of exploit our household has been since then entirely dedicated we had eight cases one of them very bad and oneminecomplicated with my old friend bluidy jack57 luckily neither fanny lloyd or belle took the confounded thing and they were able to run the household and nurse the sick to admiration  some of our boys behaved like real trumps perhaps the prettiest performance was that of our excellent henry simelé or as we sometimes call him davy balfour henry i maun premeese is a chief the humblest samoan recoils from emptying slops as you would from cheating at cards now the last nights of our bad time when we had seven down together it was enough to have made anybody laugh or cry to see henry going the rounds with a slopbucket and going inside the mosquito net of each of the sick protestant and catholic alike to pray with them  i must tell you that in my sickness i had a huge alleviation and began a new story this i am writing by dictation and really think it is an art i can manage to acquire the relief is beyond description it is just like a schooltreat to me and the amanuensis bears up extraordinar the story is to be called st ives i give you your choice whether or not it should bear the subtitle experiences of a french prisoner in england we were just getting on splendidly with it when this cursed mail arrived and requires to be attended to it looks to me very like as if st ives would be ready before any of the others but you know me and how impossible it is i should predict the amanuensis has her head quite turned and believes herself to be the author of this novel and is to some extentand as the creature  has not been wholly useless in the matter i told you so am i propose to foster her vanity by a little commemoration gift the name of the hero is anne de st yveshe englishes his name to st ives during his escape it is my idea to get a ring made which shall either represent anne or a s y a of course would be amethyst and s sapphire which is my favourite stone anyway and was my fathers before me but what would the exslade professor do about the letter y or suppose he took the other version how would he meet the case the two ns these things are beyond my knowledge which it would perhaps be more descriptive to call ignorance but i place the matter in the meanwhile under your consideration and beg to hear your views i shall tell you on some other occasion and when the am is out of hearing how very much i propose to invest in this testimonial but i may as well inform you at once that i intend it to be cheap sir damned cheap my idea of running amanuenses is by praise not pudding flattery and not coins i shall send you when the time is ripe a ring to measure by  to resume our sad tale after the other seven were almost wholly recovered henry lay down to influenza on his own account he is but just better and it looks as though fanny were about to bring up the rear as for me i am all right though i was reduced to dictating anne in the deafanddumb alphabet which i think you will admit is a comble  politics leave me extraordinary cold it seems that so much of my purpose has come off and cedercrantz and pilsach are sacked the rest of it has all gone to water the tripleheaded ass at home in his plenitude of ignorance prefers to collect the taxes and scatter the mataafas by force or the threat of force it may succeed and i suppose it will it is none the less for that expensive harsh unpopular and unsettling i am young enough to have been annoyed and altogether eject and renegate the whole idea of political affairs success in that field appears to be the organisation of failure enlivened with defamation of character and much as i love pickles and hot water in your true phrase i shall take my pickles in future from crosse and blackwell and my hot water with a dose of good glenlivat  do not bother at all about the wallpapers we have had the whole of our new house varnished and it looks beautiful i wish you could see the hall poor room it had to begin life as an infirmary during our recent visitation but it is really a handsome comely place and when we get the furniture and the pictures and what is so very much more decorative the picture frames will look sublime  jan 30thi have written to charles asking for rowlandsons syntax and dance of death out of our house and begging for anything about fashions and manners fashions particularly for 1814 can you help both the justice clerk and st ives fall in that fated year indeed i got into st ives while going over the annual register for the other there is a kind of fancy list of chaps of st ives it begins in edinb castle i story of a lion rampant that was a toy he had made and given to a girl visitor ii story of a pair of scissors iii st ives receives a bundle of money iv st ives is shown a house v the escape vi the

know where to stop apropos i want a book about paris and the first return of the émigrés and all up to the cent jours dye ken anything in my way i want in particular to know about them and the napoleonic functionaries and officers and to get the colour and some vital details of the business of exchange of departments from one side to the other58 ten chapters are drafted and viii recopied by me but will want another dressing for luck it is merely a story of adventure rambling along but that is perhaps the guard that sets my genius best as alan might have said i wish i could feel as easy about the other but there all novels are a heavy burthen while they are doing and a sensible disappointment when they are done  for gods sake let me have a copy of the new german samoa white book       r l s     to charles baxter      telling how the projected tale the pearl fisher had been cut down    and in its new form was to be called the schooner farallone    afterwards changed to the ebb tide       vailima february 1893  my dear charlesi have had the influenza as i believe you know this has been followed by two goes of my old friend bloodie jacke and i have had fefethe island complaintfor the second time in two months all this and the fact that both my womenkind require to see a doctor and some wish to see lord jersey before he goes home all send me off on a months holiday to sydney i may get my mail or i may not depends on freight weather and the captains goodnaturehe is one of those who most religiously fear apia harbour it is quite a superstition with american captains odd note american sailors who make british hair grey by the way they carry canvas appear to be actually more nervous when it comes to coast and harbour work this is the only holiday i have had for more than 2 years i dare say it will be as long again before i take another and i am going to spend a lot of money ahem  on the other hand you can prepare to dispose of the serial rights of the schooner farallone a most grim and gloomy tale it will run to something between jekyll and hyde and treasure island i will not commit myself beyond this but i anticipate from 65 to 70000 words could almost pledge myself not shorter than 65000 but wont the tale can be sent as soon as you have made arrangements i hope to finish it in a month six weeks bar the worst accidents for certain i should say this is the butt end of what was once the pearl fisher there is a peculiarity about this tale in its new form it ends with a conversion we have been tempted rather to call it the schooner farallone a tract by r l s and l o it would make a boss tract the three main charactersand there are only fourare barats insurance frauds thieves and wouldbe murderers so the companys good devil a woman there by good luck so its pure tis a mostwhats the expressionunconventional work       r l s     to sidney colvin        at sea ss mariposa feb 19th 93  my dear colvinyou will see from this heading that i am not dead yet nor likely to be i was pretty considerably out of sorts and that is indeed one reason why fanny belle and i have started out for a months lark to be quite exact i think it will be about five weeks before we get home we shall stay between two and three in sydney already though we only sailed yesterday i am feeling as fit as a fiddle fanny ate a whole fowl for breakfast to say nothing of a tower of hot cakes belle and i floored another hen betwixt the pair of us and i shall be no sooner done with the present amanuensing racket than i shall put myself outside a pint of guinness if you think this looks like dying of consumption in apia i can only say i differ from you in the matter of david i have never yet received my proofs at all but shall certainly wait for your suggestions certainly chaps 17 to 20 are the hitch and i confess i hurried over them with both wings spread this is doubtless what you complain of indeed i placed my single reliance on miss grant if she couldnt ferry me over i felt i had to stay there  about island nights entertainments all you say is highly satisfactory go in and win  the extracts from the times i really cannot trust myself to comment upon they were infernally satisfactory so and perhaps still more so was a letter i had at the same time from lord pembroke if i have time as i go through auckland i am going to see sir george grey  now i really think thats all the business i have been rather sick and have had two small hemorrhages but the second i believe to have been accidental no good denying that this annoys because it do however you must expect influenza to leave some harm and my spirits appetite peace on earth and goodwill to men are all on a rising market during the last week the amanuensis was otherwise engaged whereupon i took up pitched into and about one half demolished another tale once intended to be called the pearl fisher but now razeed and called the schooner farallone59 we had a capital start the steamer coming in at sunrise and just giving us time to get our letters ere she sailed again the manager of the german firm o strange changed days danced attendance upon us all morning his boat conveyed us to and from the steamer  feb 21stall continues well amanuensis bowled over for a day but afoot again and jolly fanny enormously bettered by the voyage i have been as jolly as a sandboy as usual at sea the amanuensis sits opposite to me writing to her offspring fanny is on deck i have just supplied her with the canadian pacific agent and so left her in good hands you should hear me at table with the ulster purser and a little punning microscopist called davis belle does some kind of abstruse boswellising after the first meal having gauged the kind of jests that would pay here i observed boswell is barred during this cruise  23rdwe approach auckland and i must close my mail all goes well with the trio both the ladies are hanging round a beauthe samethat i unearthed for them i am general provider and especially great in the beaux business i corrected some proofs for fanny yesterday afternoon fell asleep over them in the saloonand the whole ship seems to have been down beholding me after i woke up had a hot bath a whisky punch and a cigarette and went to bed and to sleep too at 830 a recrudescence of vailima hours awoke today and had to go to the saloon clock for the hourno sign of dawnall

mending belle in a terrific state of dentistry troubles which now seem calmed and myself with a succession of gentle colds out of which i at last succeeded in cooking up a fine pleurisy by stopping and stewing in a perfectly airless stateroom i seem to have got rid of the pleurisy poor fanny had very little fun of her visit having been most of the time on a diet of maltine and slopsand this while the rest of us were rioting on oysters and mushrooms belles only devil in the hedge was the dentist as for me i was entertained at the general assembly of the presbyterian church likewise at a sort of artistic club made speeches at both and may therefore be said to have been like saint paul all things to all men i have an account of the latter racket which i meant to have enclosed in this had some splendid photos taken likewise a medallion by a french sculptor met graham who returned with us as far as auckland have seen a good deal too of sir george grey what a wonderful old historic figure to be walking on your arm and recalling ancient events and instances it makes a man small and yet the extent to which he approved what i had doneor rather have tried to doencouraged me sir george is an expert at least he knows these races he is not a small employé with an inkpot and a whitaker  take it for all in all it was huge fun even fanny had some lively sport at the beginning belle and i all through we got fanny a dress on the sly gaudy black velvet and duchesse lace and alas she was only able to wear it once but well hope to see more of it at samoa it really is lovely both dames are royally outfitted in silk stockings etc we return as from a raid with our spoils and our wounded i am now very dandy i announced two years ago that i should change slovenly youth all

scotland from 1488 to 1624 as to the name of stevenson    and its adoption by some members of the proscribed clan of macgregor    stevenson had been greatly interested by the facts laid before him by    his correspondent here mentioned mr macgregor stevenson of new    york and had at first delightedly welcomed the idea that his own    ancestors might have been fellowclansmen of rob roy but further    correspondence on the subject of his own descent held with a trained    genealogist his namesake mr j horne stevenson of edinburgh    convinced him that the notion must be abandoned       april 1893   about the justiceclerk i long to go at it but will first try to get a short story done since january i have had two severe illnesses my boy and some heartbreaking anxiety over fanny and am only now convalescing i came down to dinner last night for the first time and that only because the service had broken down and to relieve an inexperienced servant nearly four months now i have rested my brains and if it be true that rest is good for brains i ought to be able to pitch in like a giant refreshed before the autumn i hope to send you some justiceclerk or weir of hermiston as colvin seems to prefer i own to indecision received syntax dance of death and pitcairn which last i have read from end to end since its arrival with vast improvement what a pity it stops so soon i wonder is there nothing that seems to prolong the series why doesnt some young man take it up how about my old friend fountainhalls decisions i remember as a boy that there was some good reading there perhaps you could borrow me that and send it on loan and perhaps laings memorials therewith and a work im ashamed to say i have never read balfours letters i have come by accident through a correspondent on one very curious and interesting factnamely that stevenson was one of the names adopted by the macgregors at the proscription the details supplied by my correspondent are both convincing and amusing but it would be highly interesting to find out more of this       r l s     to sidney colvin      these notes are in reply to a set of queries and suggestions as to    points that seemed to need clearing in the tale of catriona as    first published in atalanta under the title david balfour       vailima april 1893  1 slip 3 davie would be attracted into a similar dialect as he is latereg with doig chapter xix this is truly scottish  4 to lightly correct to lightly is a good regular scots verb  15 see allan ramsays works  15 16 ay and that is one of the pigments with which i am trying to draw the character of prestongrange tis a most curious thing to render that kind insignificant mask to make anything precise is to risk my effect and till the day he died davie was never sure of what p was after not only so very often p didnt know himself there was an element of mere liking for davie there was an element of being determined in case of accidents to keep well with him he hoped his barbara would bring him to her feet besides and make him manageable that was why he sent him to hope park with them but davie cannot know i give you the inside of davie and my method condemns me to give only the outside both of prestongrange and his policy   ill give my mind to the technicalities yet to me they seem a part of the story which is historical after all   i think they wanted alan to escape but when or where to say so i will try   20 dean ill try and make that plainer  chap xiii i fear it has to go without blows if i could get the pairno cant be   xiv all right will abridge   xv id have to put a note to every word and he who cant read scots can never enjoy tod lapraik   xvii quite right i can make this plainer and will   xviii i know but i have to hurry here this is the broken back of my story some business briefly transacted i am leaping for barbaras apronstrings  slip 57 quite right again i shall make it plain  chap xx i shall make all these points clear about lady prestongrange not lady grant only miss grant my dear though lady prestongrange quoth the dominie i am taken with your idea of her death and have a good mind to substitute a featureless aunt  slip 78 i dont see how to lessen this effect there is really not much said of it and i know catriona did it but ill try   89 i know this is an old puzzle of mine you see cs dialect is not wholly a bed of roses if only i knew the gaelic well ill try for another expression  the end i shall try to work it over james was at dunkirk ordering posthorses for his own retreat catriona did have her suspicions aroused by the letter and careless gentleman i told you soor she did at leastyes the blood moneyi am bothered about the portmanteau it is the presence of catriona that bothers me the rape of the pockmantie is historic  to me i own it seems in the proof a very pretty piece of workmanship david himself i refuse to discuss he is the lord advocate i think a strong sketch of a very difficult character james more sufficient and the two girls very pleasing creatures but o dear me i came near losing my heart to barbara i am not quite so constant as david and even hewell he didnt know it anyway tod lapraik is a piece of living scots if i had never writ anything but that and thrawn janet still id have been a writer the defects of d b are inherent i fear but on the whole i am far indeed from being displeased with the tailie one thing is sure there has been no such drawing of scots character since scott and even he never drew a full length like davie with his shrewdness and simplicity and stockishness and charm yet youll see the public wont want it they want more alan well they cant get it and readers of tess can have no use for my david and his innocent but real love affairs  i found my fame much grown on this return to civilisation digito monstrari is a new experience people all looked at me in the streets in sydney and it was very queer here of course i am only the white chief in the great house to the natives and to the whites either an ally or a foe it is a much healthier state of matters if i lived in an atmosphere of adulation i should end by kicking against the pricks o my beautiful forest o my beautiful shining windy house what a joy it was to behold them again no chance to take myself too seriously here  the difficulty of the end is the mass of matter to be attended to and the small time left to transact it in i mean from alans danger of arrest but i have just seen my way out i do believe  easter sundayi have now got as far as slip 28 and finished the chapter of the law technicalities well these seemed to me always of the essence of the story which is the story of a cause célèbre moreover they are the justification of my inventions if these men went so far granting davie sprung on them would they not have gone so much further but of course i knew they were a difficulty determined to carry them through in a conversation approached this it seems with cowardly anxiety and filled it with gabble sir gabble i have left all my facts but have removed 42 lines i should not wonder but what ill end by rewriting it it is not the technicalities that shocked you it was my bad art it is very strange that x should be so good a chapter and ix and xi so uncompromisingly bad it looks as if xi also would have to be reformed if x had not cheered me up i should be in doleful dumps but x is alive anyway and life is all in all  thursday april 5thwell theres no disguise possible fanny is not well and we are miserably anxious  friday 7thi am thankful to say the new medicine relieved her at once a crape has been removed from the day for all of us to make things better the morning is ah such a morning as you have never seen heaven upon earth for sweetness freshness depth upon depth of unimaginable colour and a huge silence broken at this moment only by the faraway murmur of the pacific and the rich piping of a single bird you cant conceive what a relief this is it seems a new world she has such extraordinary recuperative power that i do hope for the best i am as tired as man can be this is a great trial to a family and i thank god it seems as if ours was going to bear it well and o if it only lets up it will be but a pleasant memory we are all seedy bar lloyd fanny as per above self nearly extinct belle utterly overworked and bad toothache cook down with a bad foot butler prostrate with a bad leg eh what a faimly  sundaygrey heaven raining torrents of rain occasional thunder and lightning everything to dispirit but my invalids are really on the mend the rain roars like the sea in the sound of it there is a strange and ominous suggestion of an approaching tramp something nameless and measureless seems to draw near and strikes me cold and yet is welcome i lie quiet in bed today and think of the universe with a good deal of equanimity i have at this moment but the one objection to it the fracas with which it proceeds i do not love noise i am like my grandfather in that and so many years in these still islands has ingrained the sentiment perhaps here are no trains only men pacing barefoot no cars or carriages at worst the rattle of a horses shoes among the rocks beautiful silence and so soon as this robustious rain takes off i am to drink of it again by oceanfuls  april 16thseveral pages of this letter destroyed as beneath scorn the wailings of a crushed worm matter in which neither you nor i can take stock fanny is distinctly better i believe all right now i too am mending though i have suffered from crushed wormery which is not good for the body and damnation to the soul i feel tonight a baseless anxiety to write a lovely poem à propos des bottes de ma grandmère qui etaient à revers i see i am idiotic ill try the poem  17ththe poem did not get beyond plovers and lovers i am still however harassed by the unauthentic muse if i cared to encourage herbut i have not the time and anyway we are at the vernal equinox it is funny enough but my pottering verses are usually made like the godgifted organ voices at the autumnal and this seems to hold at the antipodes there is here some odd secret of nature i cannot speak of politics we wait and wonder it seems this is partly a guess ide wont take the c j ship unless the islands are disarmed and that england hesitates and holds off by my own idea strongly corroborated by sir george i am writing no more letters but i have put as many irons in against this folly of the disarming as i could manage it did not reach my ears till nearly too late what a risk to take what an expense to incur and for how poor a gain apart from the treachery of it my dear fellow politics is a vile and a bungling business i used to think meanly of the plumber but how he shines beside the politician  thursdaya general steady advance fanny really quite chipper and jollyself on the rapid mend and with my eye on forests that are to falland my finger on the axe which wants stoning  saturday 22still all for the best but i am having a heartbreaking time over david i have nearly all corrected but have to consider the heather on fire the wood by silvermills and the last chapter they all seem to me off colour and i am not fit to better them yet no proof has been sent of the title contents or dedication     to a conan doyle      the reference in the postscript here is i believe to the journals    of the society for psychical research       vailima apia samoa april 5th 1893  dear siryou have taken many occasions to make yourself very agreeable to me for which i might in decency have thanked you earlier it is now my turn and i hope you will allow me to offer you my compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of sherlock holmes that is the class of literature that i like when i have the toothache as a matter of fact it was a pleurisy i was enjoying when i took the volume up and it will interest you as a medical man to know that the cure was for the moment effectual only the one thing troubles me can this be my old friend joe belli am yours very truly       robert louis stevenson  psand lo here is your address supplied me here in samoa but do not take mine o frolic fellow spookist from the same source mine is wrong       r l s     to sidney colvin      the outbreak of hostilities was at this date imminent between mulinuu    the party of laupepa recognised and supported by the three powers    and malie the party of mataafa       vailima 25th april 1893  my dear colvintoday early i sent down to maben secretary of state an offer to bring up people from malie keep them in my house and bring them down day by day for so long as the negotiation should last i have a favourable answer so far this i would not have tried had not old sir george grey put me on my mettle never despair was his word and i am one of the few people who have lived long enough to see how true that is well thereupon i plunged in and the thing may do me great harm but yet i do not think sofor i think jealousy will prevent the trial being made and at any rate it is another chance for this distracted archipelago of children sat upon by a clique of fools if by the gift of god i can doi am allowed to try to doand succeed but no the prospect is too bright to be entertained  today we had a ride down to tanugamanono and then by the new wood paths one led us to a beautiful clearing with four native houses taro yams and the like excellently planted and old folauthe samoan jewsitting and whistling there in his newfound and welldeserved wellbeing it was a good sight to see a samoan thus before the world further up on our way home we saw the world clear and the wide die of the shadow lying broad we came but a little further and found in the borders of the bush a banyan it must have been 150 feet in height the trunk and its acolytes occupied a great space above that in the peaks of the branches quite a forest of ferns and orchids were set and over all again the huge spread of the boughs rose against the bright west and sent their shadow miles to the eastward i have not often seen anything more satisfying than this vast vegetable  sundaya heavenly day again the world all dead silence save when from far down below us in the woods comes up the crepitation of the little wooden drum that beats to church scarce a leaf stirs only now and again a great cool gush of air that makes my papers fly and is gonethe king of samoa has refused my intercession between him and mataafa and i do not deny this is a good riddance to me of a difficult business in which i might very well have failed what else is to be done for these silly folks  may 12thand this is where i had got to before the mail arrives with i must say a real gentlemanly letter from yourself sir that is the sort of letter i want now ill make my little proposal60 i will accept childs play and pans pipes then i want pastoral the manse the islet leaving out if you like all the prefacial matter and beginning at i then the portrait of robert hunter beginning whether he was originally big or little and ending fearless and gentle so much for mem and portraits beggars sections i and ii random memories ii and lantern bearers im agreeable these are my selections i dont know about pulvis et umbra either but must leave that to you but just what you please  about davie i elaborately wrote last time but still davie is not done i am grinding singly at the ebb tide as we now call the farallone the most of it will go this mail about the following let there be no mistake i will not write the abstract of kidnapped write it who will i will not boccaccio must have been a clever fellow to write both argument and story i am not et je me récuse  we call it the ebb tide a trio and quartette but that secondary name you may strike out if it seems dull to you the book however falls in two halves when the fourth character appears i am on p 82 if you want to know and expect to finish on i suppose 110 or so but it goes slowly as you may judge from the fact that this three weeks past i have only struggled from p 58 to p 82 twentyfour pages et encore sure to be rewritten in twentyone days this is no prizetaker not much waverley novels about this  may 16thi believe it will be ten chapters of the ebb tide that go to you the whole thing should be completed in i fancy twelve and the end will follow punctually next mail it is my great wish that this might get into the illustrated london news for gordon browne to illustrate for whom in case he should get the job i give you a few notes a purao is a tree giving something like a fig with flowers he will find some photographs of an old marine curiosity shop in my collection which may help him attwaters settlement is to be entirely overshadowed everywhere by tall palms see photographs of fakarava the verandahs of the house are 12 ft wide dont let him forget the figure head for which i have a great use in the last chapter it stands just clear of the palms on the crest of the beach at the head of the pier the flagstaff not far off the pier he will understand is perhaps three feet above high water not more at any price the sailors of the farallone are to be dressed like white sailors of course for other things i remit this excellent artist to my photographs  i cant think what to say about the tale but it seems to me to go off with a considerable bang in fact to be an extraordinary work but whether popular attwater is a no end of a courageous attempt i think you will admit how far successful is another affair if my island aint a thing of beauty ill be damned please observe wiseman and wishart for incidental grimness they strike me as in it also kindly observe the captain and adar i think that knocks spots in short as you see im a trifle vainglorious but o it has been such a grind the devil himself would allow a man to brag a little after such a crucifixion and indeed im only bragging for a change before i return to the darned thing lying waiting for me on p 88 where i last broke down i break down at every paragraph i may observe and lie here and sweat till i can get one sentence wrung out after another strange doom after having worked so easily for so long did ever anybody see such a story of four characters  later 230it may interest you to know that i am entirely tapu and live apart in my chambers like a caged beast lloyd has a bad cold and graham and belle are getting it accordingly i dwell here without the light of any human countenance or voice and strap away at the ebb tide until as now i can no more fanny can still come but is gone to glory now or to her garden page 88 is done and must be done over again tomorrow and i confess myself exhausted pity a man who cant work on along when he has nothing else on earth to do but i have ordered jack and am going for a ride in the bush presently to refresh the machine then back to a lonely dinner and durance vile i acquiesce in this hand of fate for i think another cold just now would just about do for me i have scarce yet recovered the two last  may 18thmy progress is crabwise and i fear only ix chapters will be ready for the mail i am on p 88 again and with half an idea of going back again to 85 we shall see when we come to read i used to regard reading as a pleasure in my old light days all the house are down with the iffluenza in a body except fanny and me the iffluenza appears to become endemic here but it has always been a scourge in the islands witness the beginning of the ebb tide which was observed long before the iffle had distinguished himself at home by such napoleonic conquests i am now of course quite a recluse and it is very stale and there is no amanuensis to carry me over my mail to which i shall have to devote many hours that would have been more usefully devoted to the ebb tide for you know you can dictate at all hours of the day and at any odd moment but to sit down and write with your red right hand is a very different matter  may 20thwell i believe ive about finished the thing i mean as far as the mail is to take it chapter x is now in lloyds hands for remarks and extends in its present form to p 93 incl on the 12th of may i see by looking back i was on p 82 not for the first time so that i have made 11 pages in nine livelong days well up a high hill he heaved a huge round stone but this flaubert business must be resisted in the premises or is it the result of iffluenza god forbid fanny is down now and the last link that bound me to my fellow men is severed i sit up here and write and read renans origines which is certainly devilish interesting i read his nero yesterday it is very good o very good but he is quite a michelet the general views and such a piece of character painting excellent but his method sheer lunacy you can see him take up the block which he had just rejected and make of it the cornerstone a maddening way to deal with authorities and the result so little like history that one almost blames oneself for wasting time but the time is not wasted the conspectus is always good and the blur that remains on the mind is probably just enough i have been enchanted with the unveiling of revelations grigsby what a lark and how picturesque that return of the false nero the apostle john is rather discredited and to think how one had read the thing so often and never understood the attacks upon st paul i remember when i was a child and we came to the four beasts that were all over eyes the sickening terror with which i was filled if that was heaven what in the name of davy jones and the aboriginal nightmare could hell be take it for all in all lantéchrist is worth reading the histoire d israël did not surprise me much i had read those hebrew sources with more intelligence than the new testament and was quite prepared to admire ahab and jezebel etc indeed ahab has always been rather a hero of mine i mean since the years of discretion  may 21stand here i am back again on p 85 the last chapter demanding an entire revision which accordingly it is to get and where my mail is to come in god knows this forced violent alembicated style is most abhorrent to me it cant be helped the note was struck years ago on the janet nicoll and has to be maintained somehow and i can only hope the intrinsic horror and pathos and a kind of fierce glow of colour there is to it and the surely remarkable wealth of striking incident may guide our little shallop into port if gordon browne is to get it he should see the brassey photographs of papeete but mind the three waifs were never in the town only on the beach and in the calaboose by george but its a good thing to illustrate for a man like that fanny is all right again false alarm i was down yesterday afternoon at papauta and heard much growling of war and the delightful news that the c j and the president are going to run away from mulinuu and take refuge in the tivoli hotel  23rd mail daythe ebb tide all but i take it fifteen pages is now in your handspossibly only about eleven pp it is hard to say but there it is and you can do your best with it personally i believe i would in this case make even a sacrifice to get gordon browne and copious illustration i guess in ten days i shall have finished with it then i go next to d balfour and get the proofs ready a nasty job for me as you know and then well perhaps ill take a go at the family history i think that will be wise as i am so much off work and then i suppose weir of hermiston but it may be anything i am discontented with the ebb tide naturally there seems such a veil of words over it and i like more and more naked writing and yet sometimes one has a longing for full colour and there comes the veil again the young chevalier is in very full colour and i fear it for that reasonever       r l s     to s r crockett      glencorse church in the pentlands mentioned by stevenson with so    much emotion in the course of this letter served him for the scene    of chapter vi in weir of hermiston where his old associations and    feelings in connection with the place have so admirably inspired him       vailima samoa may 17th 1893  dear mr crocketti do not owe you two letters nor yet nearly one sir the last time i heard of you you wrote about an accident and i sent you a letter to my lawyer charles baxter which does not seem to have been presented as i see nothing of it in his accounts query was that lost i should not like you to think i had been so unmannerly and so inhuman if you have written since your letter also has miscarried as is much the rule in this part of the world unless you register  your book is not yet to hand but will probably follow next month i detected you early in the bookman which i usually see and noted you in particular as displaying a monstrous ingratitude about the footnote well mankind is ungrateful mans ingratitude to man makes countless thousands mourn quo rabor words to that effect by the way an anecdote of a cautious sailor bill bill says i to him or words to that effect  i shall never take that walk by the fishers tryst and glencorse i shall never see auld reekie i shall never set my foot again upon the heather here i am until i die and here will i be buried the word is out and the doom written or if i do come it will be a voyage to a further goal and in fact a suicide which however if i could get my family all fixed up in the money way i might perhaps perform or attempt but there is a plaguey risk of breaking down by the way and i believe i shall stay here until the end comes like a good boy as i am if i did it i should put upon my trunks passenger tohades  how strangely wrong your information is in the first place i should never carry a novel to sydney i should post it from here in the second place weir of hermiston is as yet scarce begun its going to be excellent no doubt but it consists of about twenty pages i have a tale a shortish tale in length but it has proved long to do the ebb tide some part of which goes home this mail it is by me and mr osbourne and is really a singular work there are only four characters and three of them are banditswell two of them are and the third is their comrade and accomplice it sounds cheering doesnt it barratry and drunkenness and vitriol and i cannot tell you all what are the beams of the roof and yeti dont knowi sort of think theres something in it youll see which is more than i ever can whether davis and attwater come off or not  weir of hermiston is a much greater undertaking and the plot is not good i fear but lord justiceclerk hermiston ought to be a plum of other schemes more or less executed it skills not to speak  i am glad to hear so good an account of your activity and interests and shall always hear from you with pleasure though i am and must continue a mere sprite of the inkbottle unseen in the flesh please remember me to your wife and to the fouryearold sweetheart if she be not too engrossed with higher matters do you know where the road crosses the burn under glencorse church go there and say a prayer for me moriturus salutat see that its a sunny day i would like it to be a sunday but thats not possible in the premises and stand on the righthand bank just where the road goes down into the water and shut your eyes and if i dont appear to you well it cant be helped and will be extremely funny  i have no concern here but to work and to keep an eye on this distracted people i live just now wholly alone in an upper room of my house because the whole family are down with influenza bar my wife and myself i get my horse up sometimes in the afternoon and have a ride in the woods and i sit here and smoke and write and rewrite and destroy and rage at my own impotence from six in the morning till eight at night with trifling and not always agreeable intervals for meals  i am sure you chose wisely to keep your country charge there a minister can be something not in a town in a town the most of them are empty housesand public speakers why should you suppose your book will be slated because you have no friends a new writer if he is any good will be acclaimed generally with more noise than he deserves but by this time you will know for certaini am yours sincerely       robert louis stevenson  psbe it known to this fluent generation that i r l s in the fortythird of my age and the twentieth of my professional life wrote twentyfour pages in twentyone days working from six to eleven and again in the afternoon from two to four or so without fail or interruption such are the gifts the gods have endowed us withal such was the facility of this prolific writer       r l s     to augustus st gaudens        vailima samoa may 29th 1893  my dear godlike sculptori wish in the most delicate manner in the world to insinuate a few commissions  no 1 is for a couple of copies of my medallion as giltedged and hightoned as it is possible to make them one is for our house here and should be addressed as above the other is for my friend sidney colvin and should be addressedsidney colvin esq keeper of the print room british museum london  no 2 this is a rather large order and demands some explanation our house is lined with varnished wood of a dark ruddy colour very beautiful to see at the same time it calls very much for gold there is a limit to picture frames and really you know there has to be a limit to the pictures you put inside of them accordingly we have had an idea of a certain kind of decoration which i think you might help us to make practical what we want is an alphabet of gilt letters very much such as people play with and all mounted on spikes like drawingpins say two spikes to each letter one at top and i one at bottom say that they were this height i i and that you chose a model of some really exquisitely fine clear type from some roman monument and that they were made either of metal or some composition giltthe point is could not you in your land of wooden houses get a manufacturer to take the idea and manufacture them at a venture so that i could get two or three hundred pieces or so at a moderate figure you see suppose you entertain an honoured guest when he goes he leaves his name in gilt letters on your walls an infinity of fun and decoration can be got out of hospitable and festive mottoes and the doors of every room can be beautified by the legend of their names i really think there is something in the idea and you might be able to push it with the brutal and licentious manufacturer using my name if necessary though i should think the name of the godlike sculptor would be more germane in case you should get it started i should tell you that we should require commas in order to write the samoan language which is full of words written thus lau tie tie as the samoan language uses but a very small proportion of the consonants we should require a double or treble stock of all vowels and of f g l u n p s t and v  the other day in sydney i think you might be interested to hear i was sculpt a second time by a man called  as well as i can remember and read i mustnt criticise a present and he had very little time to do it in it is thought by my family to be an excellent likeness of mark twain this poor fellow by the by met with the devil of an accident a model of a statue which he had just finished with a desperate effort was smashed to smithereens on its way to exhibition  please be sure and let me know if anything is likely to come of this letter business and the exact cost of each letter so that i may count the cost before orderingyours sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin     relating the toilsome completion of the ebb tide and beginning   of the account of his grandfather robert stevenson in history of a   family of engineers       vailima 29th may 1893  my dear colvinstill grinding at chap xi i began many days ago on p 93 and am still on p 93 which is exhilarating but the thing takes shape all the same and should make a pretty lively chapter for an end of it for xiii is only a footnote ad explicandum  june the 1stback on p 93 i was on 100 yesterday but read it over and condemned it  10 ami have worked up again to 97 but how the deuce fly away with literature for the basest sport in creation but its got to come straight and if possible so that i may finish d balfour in time for the same mail what a getting upstairs this is flaubert outdone belle graham and lloyd leave today on a malaga down the coast to be absent a week or so this leaves fanny me and  who seems a nice kindly fellow  june 2ndi am nearly dead with dyspepsia oversmoking and unremunerative overwork last night i went to bed by seven woke up again about ten for a minute to find myself lightheaded and altogether off my legs went to sleep again and woke this morning fairly fit i have crippled on to p 101 but i havent read it yet so do not boast what kills me is the frame of mind of one of the characters i cannot get it through of course that does not interfere with my total inability to write so that yesterday i was a living halfhour upon a single clause and have a gallery of variants that would surprise you and this sort of trouble which i cannot avoid unfortunately produces nothing when done but alembication and the farfetched well read it with mercy  8 amgoing to bed have read it and believe the chapter practically done at last but lord it has been a business  june 3rd 815the draft is finished the end of chapter xii and the tale and i have only eight pages wiederzuarbeiten this is just a cry of joy in passing  1030knocked out of time did 101 and 102 alas no more today as i have to go down town to a meeting just as well though as my thumb is about done up  sunday june 4thnow for a little snippet of my life yesterday 1230 in a heavenly day of sun and trade i mounted my horse and set off a boy opens my gate for me sleep and long life a blessing on your journey says he and i reply sleep long life a blessing on the house then on down the lime lane a rugged narrow winding way that seems almost as if it was leading you into lyonesse and you might see the head and shoulders of a giant looking in at the corner of the road i meet the inspector of taxes and hold a diplomatic interview with him he wants me to pay taxes on the new house i am informed i should not till next year and we part re infecta he promising to bring me decisions i assuring him that if i find any favouritism he will find me the most recalcitrant taxpayer on the island then i have a talk with an old servant by the wayside a little further i pass two children coming up love say i are you two chieflyproceeding inland and they say love yes and the interesting ceremony is finished down to the post office where i find vitrolles and heaven reward you the white book just arrived per upolu having gone the wrong way round by australia also six copies of island nights entertainments some of weatheralls illustrations are very clever but o lord the lagoon i did say it was shallow but o dear not so shallow as that a man could stand up in it i had still an hour to wait for my meeting so postmaster davis let me sit down in his room and i had a bottle of beer in and read a gentleman of france have you seen it coming out in longmans my dear colvin tis the most exquisite pleasure a real chivalrous yarn like the dumas and yet unlike thereafter to the meeting of the five newspaper proprietors business transacted i have to gallop home and find the boys waiting to be paid at the doorstep  monday 5thyesterday sunday the rev dr brown secretary to the wesleyan mission and the man who made the war in the western islands and was tried for his life in fiji came up and we had a long important talk about samoa o if i could only talk to the home men but what would it matter none of them know none of them care if we could only have macgregor here with his schooner you would hear of no more troubles in samoa that is what we want a man that knows and likes the natives qui paye de sa personne and is not afraid of hanging when necessary we dont want bland swedish humbugs and fussy footering german barons that way the maelstrom lies and we shall soon be in it  i have today written 103 and 104 all perfectly wrong and shall have to rewrite them this tale is devilish and chapter xi the worst of the lot the truth is of course that i am wholly worked out but its nearly done and shall go somehow according to promise i go against all my gods and say it is not worth while to massacre yourself over the last few pages of a rancid yarn that the reviewers will quite justly tear to bits as for d b no hope i fear this mail but well see what the afternoon does for me  415well its done those tragic 16 pp are at last finished and i have put away thirtytwo pages of chips and have spent thirteen days about as nearly in hell as a man could expect to live through its done and of course it aint worth while and who cares there it is and about as grim a tale as was ever written and as grimy and as hateful                                                                   sacred

                     10th september 1889                tuesday 6thi am exulting to do nothing it pours with rain from the westward very unusual kind of weather i was standing out on the little verandah in front of my room this morning and there went through me or over me a wave of extraordinary and apparently baseless emotion i literally staggered and then the explanation came and i knew i had found a frame of mind and body that belonged to scotland and particularly to the neighbourhood of callander very odd these identities of sensation and the world of connotations implied highland huts and peat smoke and the brown swirling rivers and wet clothes and whisky and the romance of the past and that indescribable bite of the whole thing at a mans heart which isor rather lies at the bottom ofa story  i dont know if you are a barbey daurévillyan i am i have a great delight in his norman stories do you know the chevalier des touches and lensorcelée they are admirable they reek of the soil and the past but i was rather thinking just now of le rideau cramoisi and its adorable setting of the stopped coach the dark street the homegoing in the inn yard and the red blind illuminated without doubt there was an identity of sensation one of those conjunctions in life that had filled barbey full to the brim and permanently bent his memory  i wonder exceedingly if i have done anything at all good and who can tell me and why should i wish to know in so little a while i and the english language and the bones of my descendants will have ceased to be a memory and yetand yetone would like to leave an image for a few years upon mens mindsfor fun this is a very dark frame of mind consequent on overwork and the conclusion of the excruciating ebb tide adieu  what do you suppose should be done with the ebb tide it would make a volume of 200 pp on the other hand i might likely have some more stories soon the owl death in the pot the sleeper awakened all these are possible the owl might be half as long the sleeper awakened ditto death in the pot a deal shorter i believe then theres the gobetween which is not impossible altogether the owl the sleeper awakened and the gobetween end reasonably well death in the pot is an ungodly massacre o well the owl only ends well in so far as some lovers come together and nobody is killed at the moment but you know they are all doomed they are chouan fellows61  friday 9thwell the mail is in no bluebook depressing letter from c a long amusing ramble from my mother vast masses of romeike they are going to war now and what will that lead to and what has driven them to it but the persistent misconduct of these two officials i know i ought to rewrite the end of this bloody ebb tide well i cant cest plus fort que moi it has to go the way it is and be jowned to it from what i make out of the reviews62 i think it would be better not to republish the ebb tide but keep it for other tales if they should turn up very amusing how the reviews pick out one story and damn the rest and it is always a different one be sure you send me the article from le temps talking of which aint it manners in france to acknowledge a dedication i have never heard a word from le sieur bourget  saturday 17thsince i wrote this last i have written a whole chapter of my grandfather and read it tonight it was on the whole much appreciated and i kind of hope it aint bad myself tis a third writing but it wants a fourth by next mail i believe i might send you 3 chapters that is to say family annals the service of the northern lights and the building of the bell rock possibly even 4a houseful of boys i could finish my grandfather very easy now my father and uncle alan stop the way i propose to call the book northern lights memoirs of a family of engineers i tell you it is going to be a good book my idea in sending ms would be to get it set up two proofs to me one to professor swan ardchapel helensburghmark it private and confidentialone to yourself and come on with criticisms but ill have to see the total plan of the book is this       i domestic annals      ii the service of the northern lights     iii the building of the bell rock      iv a houseful of boys or the family in baxters place       v education of an engineer      vi the grandfather     vii alan stevenson    viii thomas stevenson    there will be an introduction the surname of stevenson which has   proved a mighty queer subject of inquiry but lord if i were among   libraries  sunday 18thi shall put in this envelope the end of the evertobeexecrated ebb tide or stevensons blooming error also a paper apart for david balfour the slips must go in another enclosure i suspect owing to their beastly bulk anyway there are two pieces of work off my mind and though i could wish i had rewritten a little more of david yet it was plainly to be seen it was impossible all the points indicated by you have been brought out but to rewrite the end in my present state of overexhaustion and fictionphobia would have been madness and i let it go as it stood my grandfather is good enough for me these days i do not work any less on the whole if anything a little more but it is different  the slips go to you in four packets i hope they are what they should be but do not think so i am at a pitch of discontent with fiction in all its formor my formsthat prevents me being able to be even interested i have had to stop all drink smoking i am trying to stop also it annoys me dreadfully and yet if i take a glass of claret i have a headache the next day o and a good headache too none of your trifles  well sir heres to you and farewellyours ever       r l s     to edmund gosse        june 10th 1893  my dear gossemy mother tells me you never received the very long and careful letter that i sent you more than a year ago or is it two years  i was indeed so much surprised at your silence that i wrote to henry james and begged him to inquire if you had received it his reply was an if possible higher power of the same silence whereupon i bowed my head and acquiesced but there is no doubt the letter was written and sent and i am sorry it was lost for it contained among other things an irrecoverable criticism of your fathers life with a number of suggestions for another edition which struck me at the time as excellent  well suppose we call that cried off and begin as before it is fortunate indeed that we can do so being both for a while longer in the day but alas when i see works of the late j a s63 i can see no help and no reconciliation possible i wrote him a letter i think three years ago heard in some roundabout way that he had received it waited in vain for an answer which had probably miscarried and in a humour between frowns and smiles wrote to him no more and now the strange poignant pathetic brilliant creature is gone into the night and the voice is silent that uttered so much excellent discourse and i am sorry that i did not write to him again yet i am glad for him light lie the turf the saturday is the only obituary i have seen and i thought it very good upon the whole i should be half tempted to write an in memoriam but i am submerged with other work are you going to do it i very much admire your efforts that way you are our only academician  so you have tried fiction i will tell you the truth when i saw it announced i was so sure you would send it to me that i did not order it but the order goes this mail and i will give you news of it yes honestly fiction is very difficult it is a terrible strain to carry your characters all that time and the difficulty of according the narrative and the dialogue in a work in the third person is extreme that is one reason out of half a dozen why i so often prefer the first it is much in my mind just now because of my last work just off the stocks three days ago the ebb tide a dreadful grimy business in the third person where the strain between a vilely realistic dialogue and a narrative style pitched about in phrase four notes higher than it should have been has sown my head with grey hairs or i believe soif my head escaped my heart has them  the truth is i have a little lost my way and stand bemused at the crossroads a subject ay i have dozens i have at least four novels begun they are none good enough and the mill waits and ill have to take second best the ebb tide i make the world a present of i expect and i suppose deserve to be torn to pieces but there was all that good work lying useless and i had to finish it  all your news of your family is pleasant to hear my wife has been very ill but is now better i may say i am ditto the ebb tide having left me high and dry which is a good example of the mixed metaphor our home and estate and our boys and the politics of the island keep us perpetually amused and busy and i grind away with an odd dogged down sensationand an idea in petto that the game is about played out i have got too realistic and i must break the trammelsi mean i would if i could but the yoke is heavy i saw with amusement that zola says the same thing and truly the débâcle was a mighty big book i have no need for a bigger though the last part is a mere mistake in my opinion but the emperor and sedan and the doctor at the ambulance and the horses in the field of battle lord how gripped it is what an epical performance according to my usual opinion i believe i could go over that book and leave a masterpiece by blotting and no ulterior art but that is an old story ever new with me taine gone and renan and symonds and tennyson and browning the suns go swiftly out and i see no suns to follow nothing but a universal twilight of the demidivinities with parties like you and me and lang beating on toy drums and playing on penny whistles about glowworms but zola is big anyway he has plenty in his belly too much that is all he wrote the débâcle and he wrote la bête humaine perhaps the most excruciatingly silly book that i ever read to an end and why did i read it to an end w e g because the animal in me was interested in the lewdness not sincerely of course my mind refusing to partake in it but the flesh was slightly pleased and when it was done i cast it from me with a peal of laughter and forgot it as i would forget a montépin taine is to me perhaps the chief of these losses i did luxuriate in his origines it was something beyond literature not quite so good if you please but so much more systematic and the pages that had to be written always so adequate robespierre napoleon were both excellent good  june 18th 93well i have left fiction wholly and gone to my grandfather and on the whole found peace by next month my grandfather will begin to be quite grown up i have already three chapters about as good as done by which of course as you know i mean till further notice or the next discovery i like biography far better than fiction myself fiction is too free in biography you have your little handful of facts little bits of a puzzle and you sit and think and fit em together this way and that and get up and throw em down and say damn and go out for a walk and its real soothing and when done gives an idea of finish to the writer that is very peaceful of course its not really so finished as quite a rotten novel it always has and always must have the incurable illogicalities of life about it the fathoms of slack and the miles of tedium still thats where the fun comes in and when you have at last managed to shut up the castle spectre dulness the very outside of his door looks beautiful by contrast there are pages in these books that may seem nothing to the reader but you remember what they were you know what they might have been and they seem to you witty beyond comparison in my grandfather ive had for instance to give up the temporal order almost entirely doubtless the temporal order is the great foe of the biographer it is so tempting so easy and lo there you are in the bogever yours       r l stevenson  with all kind messages from self and wife to you and yours my wife is very much better having been the early part of this year alarmingly ill she is now all right only complaining of trifles annoying to her but happily not interesting to her friends i am in a hideous state having stopped drink and smoking yes both no wine no tobacco and the dreadful part of it is thatlooking forwardi havewhat shall i saynauseating intimations that it ought to be for ever     to henry james     vailima plantation samoan islands june 17th 1893  my dear henry jamesi believe i have neglected a mail in answering yours you will be very sorry to hear that my wife was exceedingly ill and very glad to hear that she is better i cannot say that i feel any more anxiety about her we shall send you a photograph of her taken in sydney in her customary island habit as she walks and gardens and shrilly drills her brown assistants she was very ill when she sat for it which may a little explain the appearance of the photograph it reminds me of a friend of my grandmothers who used to say when talking to younger women aweel when i was young i wasnae just exactly what ye wad call bonny but i was pale penetratin and interestin i would not venture to hint that fanny is no bonny but there is no doubt but that in this presentment she is pale penetratin and interestin  as you are aware i have been wading deep waters and contending with the great ones of the earth not wholly without success it is you may be interested to hear a dreary and infuriating business if you can get the fools to admit one thing they will always save their face by denying another if you can induce them to take a step to the right hand they generally indemnify themselves by cutting a caper to the left i always held upon no evidence whatever from a mere sentiment or intuition that politics was the dirtiest the most foolish and the most random of human employments i always held but now i know it fortunately you have nothing to do with anything of the kind and i may spare you the horror of further details  i received from you a book by a man by the name of anatole france why should i disguise it i have no use for anatole he writes very prettily and then afterwards baron marbot was a different pair of shoes so likewise is the baron de vitrolles whom i am now perusing with delight his escape in 1814 is one of the best pages i remember anywhere to have read but marbot and vitrolles are dead and what has become of the living it seems as if literature were coming to a stand i am sure it is with me and i am sure everybody will say so when they have the privilege of reading the ebb tide my dear man the grimness of that story is not to be depicted in words there are only four characters to be sure but they are such a troop of swine and their behaviour is really so deeply beneath any possible standard that on a retrospect i wonder i have been able to endure them myself until the yarn was finished well there is always one thing it will serve as a touchstone if the admirers of zola admire him for his pertinent ugliness and pessimism i think they should admire this but if as i have long suspected they neither admire nor understand the mans art and only wallow in his rancidness like a hound in offal then they will certainly be disappointed in the ebb tide alas poor little tale it is not even rancid  by way of an antidote or febrifuge i am going on at a great rate with my history of the stevensons which i hope may prove rather amusing in some parts at least the excess of materials weighs upon me my grandfather is a delightful comedy part and i have to treat him besides as a serious and in his way a heroic figure and at times i lose my way and i fear in the end will blur the effect however à la grâce de dieu ill make a spoon or spoil a horn you see i have to do the building of the bell rock by cutting down and packing my grandsires book which i rather hope i have done but do not know and it makes a huge chunk of a very different style and quality between chapters ii and iv and it cant be helped it is just a delightful and exasperating necessity you know the stuff is really excellent narrative only perhaps theres too much of it there is the rub well well it will be plain to you that my mind is affected it might be with less the ebb tide and northern lights are a full meal for any plain man  i have written and ordered your last book the real thing so be sure and dont send it what else are you doing or thinking of doing news i have none and dont want any i have had to stop all strong drink and all tobacco and am now in a transition state between the two which seems to be near madness you never smoked i think so you can never taste the joys of stopping it but at least you have drunk and you can enter perhaps into my annoyance when i suddenly find a glass of claret or a brandyandwater give me a splitting headache the next morning no mistake about it drink anything and theres your headache tobacco just as bad for me if i live through this breach of habit i shall be a whitelivered puppy indeed actually i am so made or so twisted that i do not like to think of a life without the red wine on the table and the tobacco with its lovely little coal of fire it doesnt amuse me from a distance i may find it the garden of eden when i go in but i dont like the colour of the gateposts suppose somebody said to you you are to leave your home and your books and your clubs and go out and camp in midafrica and command an expedition you would howl and kick and flee i think the same of a life without wine and tobacco and if this goes on ive got to go and do it sir in the living flesh  i thought bourget was a friend of yours and i thought the french were a polite race he has taken my dedication with a stately silence that has surprised me into apoplexy did i go and dedicate my book64 to the nasty alien and the norrid frenchman and the bloody furrineer well i wouldnt do it again and unless his case is susceptible of explanation you might perhaps tell him so over the walnuts and the wine by way of speeding the gay hours sincerely i thought my dedication worth a letter  if anything be worth anything here below do you know the story of the man who found a button in his hash and called the waiter what do you call that says he well said the waiter what dyou expect expect to find a gold watch and chain heavenly apologue is it not i expected rather to find a gold watch and chain i expected to be able to smoke to excess and drink to comfort all the days of my life and i am still indignantly staring on this button its not even a button its a teetotal badgeever yours       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        saturday 24th  june 1893  my dear colvinyesterday morning after a day of absolute temperance i awoke to the worst headache i had had yet accordingly temperance was said farewell to quinine instituted and i believe my pains are soon to be over we wait with a kind of sighing impatience for war to be declared or to blow finally off living in the meanwhile in a kind of childrens hour of firelight and shadow and preposterous tales the king seen at night galloping up our road upon unknown errands and covering his face as he passes our cook mataafa daily surrounded when he awakes with fresh white mans boxes query ammunition and professing to be quite ignorant of where they come from marches of bodies of men across the island concealment of ditto in the bush the coming on and off of different chiefs and such a mass of ravelment and ragtag as the devil himself could not unwind  wednesday 28 juneyesterday it rained with but little intermission but i was jealous of news graham and i got into the saddle about 1 oclock and off down to town in town there was nothing but rumours going in the night drums had been beat the men had run to arms on mulinuu from as far as vaiala and the alarm proved false there were no signs of any gathering in apia proper and the secretary of state had no news to give i believed him too for we are brither scots then the temptation came upon me strong to go on to the ford and see the mataafa villages where we heard there was more afoot off we rode when we came to vaimusu the houses were very full of men but all seemingly unarmed immediately beyond is that river over which we passed in our scamper with lady jersey it was all solitary three hundred yards beyond is a second ford and therei came face to face with war under the trees on the further bank sat a picket of seven men with winchesters their faces bright their eyes ardent as we came up they did not speak or move only their eyes followed us the horses drank and we passed the ford talofa i said and the commandant of the picket said talofa and then when we were almost by remembered himself and asked where we were going to faamuiná i said and we rode on every house by the wayside was crowded with armed men there was the european house of a chinaman on the righthand side a flag of truce flying over the gateindeed we saw three of these in what little way we penetrated into mataafas linesall the foreigners trying to protect their goods and the chinamans verandah overflowed with men and girls and winchesters by the way we met a party of about ten or a dozen marching with their guns and cartridgebelts and the cheerful alacrity and brightness of their looks set my head turning with envy and sympathy arrived at vaiusu the houses about the malae village green were thronged with men all armed on the outside of the councilhouse which was all full within there stood an orator he had his back turned to his audience and seemed to address the world at large all the time we were there his strong voice continued unabated and i heard snatches of political wisdom rising and falling  the house of faamuiná stands on a knoll in the malae thither we mounted a boy ran out and took our horses and we went in faamuiná was there himself his wife palepa three other chiefs and some attendants and here again was this exulting spectacle as of people on their marriage day faamuiná when i last saw him was an elderly limping gentleman with much of the debility of age it was a brighteyed boy that greeted me the lady was no less excited all had cartridgebelts we stayed but a little while to smoke a selui i would not have kava made as i thought my escapade was already dangerous perhaps even blameworthy enough on the way back we were much greeted and on coming to the ford the commandant came and asked me if there were many on the other side very many said i not that i knew but i would not lead them on the ice that is well said he and the little picket laughed aloud as we splashed into the river we returned to apia through apia and out to windward as far as vaiala where the word went that the men of the vaimauga had assembled we met two boys carrying pigs and saw six young men busy cooking in a cookhouse but no sign of an assembly no arms no blackened faces i forgot as we turned to leave faamuinás there ran forward a man with his face blackened and the back of his lavalava girded up so as to show his tattooed hips naked he leaped before us cut a wonderful caper and flung his knife high in the air and caught it it was strangely savage and fantastic and highspirited i have seen a child doing the same antics long before in a dance so that it is plainly an accepted solemnity i should say that for weeks the children have been playing with spears up by the plantation i took a short cut which shall never be repeated through grass and weeds over the horses heads and among rolling stones i thought we should have left a horse there but fortune favoured us so home a little before six in a dashing squall of rain to a bowl of kava and dinner but the impression on our minds was extraordinary the sight of that picket at the ford and those ardent happy faces whirls in my head the old aboriginal awoke in both of us and knickered like a stallion  it is dreadful to think that i must sit apart here and do nothing i do not know if i can stand it out but you see i may be of use to these poor people if i keep quiet and if i threw myself in i should have a bad job of it to save myself there i have written this to you and it is still but 730 in the day and the sun only about one hour up can i go back to my old grandpapa and men sitting with winchesters in my minds eye no war is a huge entraînement there is no other temptation to be compared to it not one we were all wet we had been about five hours in the saddle mostly riding hard and we came home like schoolboys with such a lightness of spirits and i am sure such a brightness of eye as you could have lit a candle at  do you appreciate the height and depth of my temptation that i have about nine miles to ride and i can become a general officer and tonight i might seize mulinuu and have the c j under arrest and yet i stay here it seems incredible so huge is the empire of prudence and the second thought  thursday 29thi had two priests to luncheon yesterday the bishop and père rémy they were very pleasant and quite clean too which has been known sometimes not to beeven with bishops monseigneur is not unimposing with his white beard and his violet girdle he looks splendidly episcopal and when our three waiting lads came up one after another and kneeled before him in the big hall and kissed his ring it did me good for a piece of pageantry rémy is very engaging he is a little nervous eager man like a governess and brimful of laughter and small jokes so is the bishop indeed and our luncheon party went off merrilyfar more merrily than many a german spread though with so much less liquor one trait was delicious with a complete ignorance of the protestant that i would scarce have imagined he related to us as news little stories from the gospels and got the names all wrong his comments were delicious and to our ears a thought irreverent ah il connaissait son monde allez il était fin notre seigneur etc  fridaydown with fanny and belle to lunch at the international heard there about the huge folly of the hour all the mulinuu ammunition having been yesterday marched openly to vaults in matafele and this morning on a cry of protest from the whites openly and humiliatingly disinterred and marched back again people spoke of it with a kind of shrill note that did not quite satisfy me they seemed not quite well at ease luncheon over we rode out on the malie road all was quiet in vaiusu and when we got to the second ford alas there was no picketwhich was just what belle had come to sketch on through quite empty roads the houses deserted never a gun to be seen and at last a drum and a penny whistle playing in vaiusu and a cricket match on the malae went up to faamuinás he is a trifle uneasy though he gives us kava i cannot see what ails him then it appears that he has an engagement with the chief justice at halfpast two to sell a piece of land is this the reason why war has disappeared we ride back stopping to sketch here and there the fords a flag of truce etc i ride on to public hall committee and pass an hour with my committees very heavily to the hotel to dinner then to the ball and home by eleven very tired at the ball i heard some news of how the chief of letonu said that i was the source of all this trouble and should be punished and my family as well this and the rudeness of the man at the ford of the gasegase looks but ill i should have said that faamuiná as he approached the first ford was spoken to by a girl and immediately said goodbye and plunged into the bush the girl had told him there was a war party out from mulinuu and a little further on as we stopped to sketch a flag of truce the beating of drums and the sound of a bugle from that direction startled us but we saw nothing and i believe mulinuu is at least at present incapable of any act of offence one good job these threats to my home and family take away all my childish temptation to go out and fight our force must be here to protect ourselves i see panic rising among the whites i hear the shrill note of it in their voices and they talk already about a refuge on the war ships there are two here both german and the orlando is expected presently  sunday 9th julywell the war has at last begun for four or five days apia has been filled by these poor children with their faces blacked and the red handkerchief about their brows that makes the malietoa uniform and the boats have been coming in from the windward some of them 50 strong with a drum and a bugle on boardthe bugle always illplayedand a sort of jester leaping and capering on the sparred nose of the boat and the whole crew uttering from time to time a kind of menacing ululation friday they marched out to the bush and yesterday morning we heard that some had returned to their houses for the night as they found it so uncomfortable after dinner a messenger came up to me with a note that the wounded were arriving at the mission house fanny lloyd and i saddled and rode off with a lantern it was a fine starry night though pretty cold we left the lantern at tanugamanono and then down in the starlight i found apia and myself in a strange state of flusteration my own excitement was gloomy and i may say truculent others appeared imbecile some sullen the best place in the whole town was the hospital a longish framehouse it was with a big table in the middle for operations and ten samoans each with an average of four sympathisers stretched along the walls clarke was there steady as a die miss large little spectacled angel showed herself a real trump the nice clean german orderlies in their white uniforms looked and meant business i hear a fine story of miss largea castiron teetotallergoing to the publichouse for a bottle of brandy  the doctors were not there when i arrived but presently it was observed that one of the men was going cold he was a magnificent samoan very dark with a noble aquiline countenance like an arab i suppose and was surrounded by seven people fondling his limbs as he lay he was shot through both lungs and an orderly was sent to the town for the german naval doctors who were dining there meantime i found an errand of my own both clarke and miss large expressed a wish to have the public hall of which i am chairman and i set off down town and woke people out of their beds and got a committee together and with a great deal of difficulty from one man whom we finally overwhelmed got the public hall for them bar the one man the committee was splendid and agreed in a moment to share the expense if the shareholders object back to the hospital about 1130 found the german doctors there two men were going now one that was shot in the bowelshe was dying rather hard in a gloomy stupor of pain and laudanum silent with contorted face the chief shot through the lungs was lying on one side awaiting the last angel his family held his hands and legs they were all speechless only one woman suddenly clasped his knee and keened for the inside of five seconds and fell silent again went home and to bed about two am what actually passed seems undiscoverable but the mataafas were surely driven back out of vaitele that is a blow to them and the resistance was far greater than had been anticipatedwhich is a blow to the laupepas all seems to indicate a long and bloody war  franks house in mulinuu was likewise filled with wounded many dead bodies were brought in i hear with certainty of five wrapped in mats and a pastor goes tomorrow to the field to bring others the laupepas brought in eleven heads to mulinuu and to the great horror and consternation of the native mind one proved to be a girl and was identified as that of a taupouor maid of the villagefrom savaii i hear this morning with great relief that it has been returned to malie wrapped in the most costly silk handkerchiefs and with an apologetic embassy this could easily happen the girl was of course attending on her father with ammunition and got shot her hair was cut short to make her fathers war headdresseven as our own sinas is at this moment and the decollator was probably in his red flurry of fight wholly unconscious of her sex i am sorry for him in the future he must make up his mind to many bitter jestsperhaps to vengeance but what an end to one chosen for her beauty and in the time of peace watched over by trusty crones and hunchbacks  eveningcan i write or not i played lawn tennis in the morning and after lunch down with graham to apia ulu he that was shot in the lungs still lives he that was shot in the bowels is gone to his fathers poor fierce child i was able to be of some very small help and in the way of helping myself to information to prove myself a mere gazer at meteors but there seems no doubt the mataafas for the time are scattered the most of our friends are involved in this disaster and mataafa himselfwho might have swept the islands a few months agofor him to fall so poorly doubles my regret they say the taupou had a gun and fired probably an excuse manufactured ex post facto i go down tomorrow at 12 to stay the afternoon and help miss large in the hospital today when i first entered it there were no attendants only the wounded and their friends all equally sleeping and their heads poised upon the wooden pillows there is a pretty enough boy there slightly wounded whose fate is to be envied two girls and one of the most beautiful with beaming eyes tend him and sleep upon his pillow in the other corner another young man very patient and brave lies wholly deserted yet he seems to me far the better of the two but not so pretty heavens what a difference that makes in our not very well proportioned bodies and our finely hideous faces the 132ndrather the 164ththis way or that sixteen heads in all at mulinuu i am so stiff i can scarce move without a howl  monday 10thsome news that mataafa is gone to savaii by way of manono this may mean a great deal more warfaring and no great issue when sosimo came in this morning with my breakfast he had to lift me up it is no joke to play lawn tennis after carrying your right arm in a sling so many years what a hard unjust business this is on the 28th if mataafa had moved he could have still swept mulinuu he waited and i fear he is now only the stick of a rocket  wednesday 12thno more political news but many rumours the government troops are off to manono no word of mataafa o there is a passage in my mothers letter which puzzles me as to a date is it next christmas you are coming or the christmas after this is most important and must be understood at once if it is next christmas i could not go to ceylon for lack of gold and you would have to adopt one of the following alternatives 1st either come straight on here and pass a month with us tis the rainy season but we have often lovely weather or 2nd come to hawaii and i will meet you there hawaii is only a weeks sail from s francisco making only about sixteen days on the heaving ocean and the steamers run once a fortnight so that you could turn round and you could thus pass a day or two in the statesa fortnight evenand still see me but i have sworn to take no further excursions till i have money saved to pay for them and to go to ceylon and back would be torture unless i had a lot you must answer this at once please so that i may know what to do we would dearly like you to come on here ill tell you how it can be done i can come up and meet you at hawaii and if you had at all got over your seasickness i could just come on board and we could return together to samoa and you could have a month of our life here which i believe you could not help liking our horses are the devil of course miserable screws and some of them a little vicious i had a dreadful frightthe passage in my mothers letter is recrossed and i see it says the end of 94 so much the better then but i would like to submit to you my alternative plan i could meet you at hawaii and reconduct you to hawaii so that we could have a full six weeks together and i believe a little over and you would see this place of mine and have a sniff of native life native foods native housesand perhaps be in time to see the german flag raised who knowsand we could generally yarn for all we were worth i should like you to see vailima and i should be curious to know how the climate affected you it is quite hit or miss it suits me it suits graham it suits all our family others it does not suit at all it is either gold or poison i rise at six the rest at seven lunch is at 12 at five we go to lawn tennis till dinner at six and to roost early  a man brought in a head to mulinuu in great glory they washed the black paint off and behold it was his brother when i last heard he was sitting in his house with the head upon his lap and weeping barbarous war is an ugly business but i believe the civilised is fully uglier but lord what fun  i should say we now have definite news that there are three womens heads it was difficult to get it out of the natives who are all ashamed and the women all in terror of reprisals nothing has been done to punish or disgrace these hateful innovators it was a false report that the head had been returned  thursday 13thmaatafa driven away from savaii i cannot write about this and do not know what should be the end of it  monday 17thhaggard and ahrens a german clerk to lunch yesterday there is no real certain news yet i must say no man could swear to any result but the sky looks horribly black for mataafa and so many of our friends along with him the thing has an abominable a beastly nightmare interest but its wonderful generally how little one cares about the wounded hospital sights etc things that used to murder me i was far more struck with the excellent way in which things were managed as if it had been a peepshow i held some of the things at an operation and did not care a dump  tuesday 18thsunday came the katoomba captain bickford cmg yesterday graham and i went down to call and find he has orders to suppress mataafa at once and has to go down today before daybreak to manono he is a very capable energetic man if he had only come ten days ago all this would have gone by but now the questions are thick and difficult 1 will mataafa surrender 2 will his people allow themselves to be disarmed 3 what will happen to them if they do 4 what will any of them believe after former deceptions the three consuls were scampering on horseback to leulumoega to the king no cusacksmith without whose accession i could not send a letter to mataafa i rode up here wrote my letter in the sweat of the concordance and with the ablebodied help of lloydand dined then down in continual showers and pitchy darkness and to cusacksmiths not returned back to the inn for my horse and to css when i find him just returned and he accepts my letter thence home by 1230 jolly tired and wet and today have been in a crispation of energy and illtemper raking my wretched mail together it is a hateful business waiting for the news it may come to a fearful massacre yetyours ever       r l s     to james s stevenson      this is addressed to a very remote cousin in quest of information    about the origins of the family       vailima samoa june 19th 1893  dear mr stevensoni am reminded by coming across some record of relations between my grandfather robert stevenson ce edinburgh and robert stevenson esq secretary to the royal exchange glasgow and i presume a son of hugh stevenson who died in tobago 16th april 1774 that i have not yet consulted my cousins in glasgow  i am engaged in writing a life of my grandfather my uncle alan and my father thomas and i find almost inconceivable difficulty in placing and understanding their and my descent  might i ask if you have any material to go upon the smallest notes would be like found gold to me and an old letter invaluable  i have not got beyond james stevenson and jean keir his spouse to whom robert the first  was born in 1675 could you get me further back have you any old notes of the trouble in the west indian business which took hugh and alan to their deaths how had they acquired so considerable a business at an age so early you see how the queries pour from me but i will ask nothing more in words suffice it to say that any information however insignificant as to our common forbears will be very gratefully received in case you should have any original documents it would be better to have copies sent to me in this outlandish place for the expense of which i will account to you as soon as you let me know the amount and it will be wise to register your letterbelieve me in the old honoured scottish phrase your affectionate cousin       robert louis stevenson     to henry james        apia july 1893  my dear henry jamesyes les trophées is on the whole a book65 it is excellent but is it a lifes work i always suspect you of a volume of sonnets up your sleeve when is it coming down i am in one of my moods of wholesale impatience with all fiction and all verging on it reading instead with rapture fountainhalls decisions you never read it well it hasnt much form and is inexpressibly dreary i should suppose to othersand even to me for pages its like walking in a mine underground and with a damned bad lantern and picking out pieces of ore this and war will be my excuse for not having read your doubtless charming work of fiction the revolving year will bring me round to it and i know when fiction shall begin to feel a little solid to me again that i shall love it because its james do you know when i am in this mood i would rather try to read a bad book its not so disappointing anyway and fountainhall is prime two big folio volumes and all dreary and all true and all as terse as an obituary and about one interesting fact on an average in twenty pages and ten of them unintelligible for technicalities theres literature if you like it feeds it falls about you genuine like rain rain nobody has done justice to rain in literature yet surely a subject for a scot but then you cant do rain in that ledgerbook style that i am trying foror between a ledgerbook and an old ballad how to get over how to escape from the besotting particularity of fiction roland approached the house it had green doors and window blinds and there was a scraper on the upper step to hell with roland and the scraperyours ever       r l s     to a conan doyle        vailima july 12 1893  my dear dr conan doylethe white company has not yet turned up but when it doeswhich i suppose will be next mailyou shall hear news of me i have a great talent for compliment accompanied by a hateful even a diabolic frankness  delighted to hear i have a chance of seeing you and mrs doyle mrs stevenson bids me say what is too true that our rations are often spare are you great eaters please reply  as to ways and means here is what you will have to do leave san francisco by the down mail get off at samoa and twelve days or a fortnight later you can continue your journey to auckland per upolu which will give you a look at tonga and possibly fiji by the way make this a first part of your plans a fortnight even of vailima diet could kill nobody  we are in the midst of war here rather a nasty business with the headtaking and there seems signs of other trouble but i believe you need make no change in your design to visit us all should be well over and if it were not why you need not leave the steameryours very truly       robert louis stevenson     to charles baxter        19th july 93   we are in the thick of warsee illustrated london newswe have only two outside boys left to us nothing is doing and per contra little paying my life here is dear but i can live within my income for a time at leastso long as my prices keep upand it seems a clear duty to waste none of it on gadding about  my life of my family fills up intervals and should be an excellent book when it is done but big damnably big  my dear old man i perceive by a thousand signs that we grow old and are soon to pass away i hope with dignity if not with courage at least i am myself very ready or would bewill bewhen i have made a little money for my folks the blows that have fallen upon you are truly terrifying i wish you strength to bear them it is strange i must seem to you to blaze in a birmingham prosperity and happiness and to myself i seem a failure the truth is i have never got over the last influenza yet and am miserably out of heart and out of kilter lungs pretty right stomach nowhere spirits a good deal overshadowed but well come through it yet and cock our bonnets i confess with sorrow that i am not yet quite sure about the intellects but i hope it is only one of my usual periods of nonwork they are more unbearable now because i cannot rest no rest but the grave for sir walter o the words ring in a mans head       r l s     to sidney colvin        vailima august 1893  my dear colvinquite impossible to write your letter is due today a nasty rainylike morning with huge blue clouds and a huge indigo shadow on the sea and my lamp still burning at near 7 let me humbly give you news fanny seems on the whole the most or the only powerful member of the family for some days she has been the flower of the flock belle is begging for quinine lloyd and graham have both been down with belly belong him black boy speech as for me i have to lay aside my lawn tennis having as was to be expected had a smart but eminently brief hemorrhage i am also on the quinine flask i have been recasting the beginning of the hanging judge or weir of hermiston then i have been cobbling on my grandfather whose last chapter there are only to be four is in the form of pieces of paper a huge welter of inconsequence and that glimmer of faith or hope which one learns at this trade that somehow and some time by perpetual staring and glowering and rewriting order will emerge it is indeed a queer hope there is one piece for instance that i want ini cannot put it one place for a good reasoni cannot put it another for a betterand every time i look at it i turn sick and put the ms away  well your letter hasnt come and a number of others are missing it looks as if a mailbag had gone on so ill blame nobody and proceed to business  it looks as if i was going to send you the first three chapters of my grandfather if they were set up it would be that much anxiety off my mind i have a strange feeling of responsibility as if i had my ancestors souls in my charge and might miscarry with them  theres a lot of work gone into it and a lot more is needed still chapter i seems about right to me and much of chapter ii chapter iii i know nothing of as i told you and chapter iv is at present all ends and beginnings but it can be pulled together  this is all i have been able to screw up to you for this month and i may add that it is not only more than you deserve but just about more than i was equal to i have been and am entirely useless just able to tinker at my grandfather the three chaptersperhaps also a little of the fourthwill come home to you next mail by the hand of my cousin graham balfour a very nice fellow whom i recommend to you warmlyand whom i think you will like this will give you time to consider my various and distracted schemes  all our wars are over in the meantime to begin again as soon as the warships leave adieu       r l s     to a conan doyle        vailima august 23rd 1893  my dear dr conan doylei am reposing after a somewhat severe experience upon which i think it my duty to report to you immediately after dinner this evening it occurred to me to renarrate to my native overseer simelé your story of the engineers thumb and sir i have done it it was necessary i need hardly say to go somewhat farther afield than you have done to explain for instance what a railway is what a steam hammer what a coach and horse what coining what a criminal and what the police i pass over other and no less necessary explanations but i did actually succeed and if you could have seen the drawn anxious features and the bright feverish eyes of simelé you would have for the moment at least tasted glory you might perhaps think that were you to come to samoa you might be introduced as the author of the engineers thumb disabuse yourself they do not know what it is to make up a story the engineers thumb god forgive me was narrated as a piece of actual and factual history nay and more i who write to you have had the indiscretion to perpetrate a trifling piece of fiction entitled the bottle imp parties who come up to visit my unpretentious mansion after having admired the ceilings by vanderputty and the tapestry by gobbling manifest towards the end a certain uneasiness which proves them to be fellows of an infinite delicacy they may be seen to shrug a brown shoulder to roll up a speaking eye and at last secret burst from them where is the bottle alas my friends i feel tempted to say you will find it by the engineers thumb talofasoifua  o au o lau

wide perhaps too many celebrities though i was delighted to reencounter my old friend du chaylu old murat is perhaps your highwater mark tis excellently human cheerful and real do it again madame de maintenon struck me as quite good have you any document for the decapitation it sounds steepish the devil of all that first part is that you see old dumas yet your louis xiv is distinctly good i am much interested with this book which fulfils a good deal and promises more question how far a historical novel should be wholly episodic i incline to that view with trembling i shake hands with you on old murat       r l s     to augustus st gaudens      mr st gaudens large medallion portrait in bronze executed from    sittings given in 1887 had at last found its way to apia but not    yet to vailima       vailima september 1893  my dear st gaudensi had determined not to write to you till i had seen the medallion but it looks as if that might mean the greek kalends or the day after tomorrow reassure yourself your part is done it is ours that haltsthe consideration of conveyance over our sweet little road on boys backs for we cannot very well apply the horses to this work there is only one you cannot put it in a panier to put it on the horses back we have not the heart beneath the beauty of r l s to say nothing of his verses which the publishers find heavy enough and the genius of the godlike sculptor the spine would snap and the wellknit limbs of the ahem carthorse would be loosed by death so you are to conceive me sitting in my house dubitative and the medallion chuckling in the warehouse of the german firm for some days longer and hear me meanwhile on the golden letters  alas they are all my fancy painted but the price is prohibitive i cannot do it it is another daydream burst another gable of abbotsford has gone down fortunately before it was builded so theres nobody injuredexcept me i had a strong conviction that i was a great hand at writing inscriptions and meant to exhibit and test my genius on the walls of my house and now i see i cant it is generally thus the battle of the golden letters will never be delivered on making preparation to open the campaign the king found himself face to face with invincible difficulties in which the rapacity of a mercenary soldiery and the complaints of an impoverished treasury played an equal partever yours       robert louis stevenson   i enclose a bill for the medallion have been trying to find your letter quite in vain and therefore must request you to pay for the bronze letters yourself and let me know the damage       r l s     to james s stevenson        vailima plantation island of upolu samoa sept 4th 1893  my dear cousini thank you cordially for your kinsmanlike reply to my appeal already the notes from the family bible have spared me one blunder which i had from some notes in my grandfathers own hand and now like the daughters of the horseleech my voice is raised again to put you to more trouble nether carsewell neilston i read my knowledge of scotland is fairly wide but it does not include neilston  however i find by the original statistical account it is a parish in renfrew do you know anything of it have you identified nether carsewell have the neilston parish registers been searched i see whole vistas of questions arising and here am i in samoa  i shall write by this mail to my lawyer to have the records searched and to my mother to go and inquire in the parish itself but perhaps you may have some further information and if so i should be glad of it if you have not pray do not trouble to answer as to your fathers blunder of stevenson of cauldwell it is now explained carsewell may have been confounded with cauldwell and it seems likely our man may have been a tenant or retainer of mure of cauldwell a very ancient and honourable family who seems to have been at least a neighbouring laird to the parish of neilston i was just about to close this when i observed again your obliging offer of service and i take you promptly at your word  do you think that you or your son could find a day to visit neilston and try to identify nether carsewell find what size of a farm it is to whom it belonged etc i shall be very much obliged i am pleased indeed to learn some of my books have given pleasure to your family and with all good wishes i remain your affectionate cousin       robert louis stevenson   the registers i shall have seen to through my lawyer     to george meredith        sept 5th1893 vailima plantation upolu samoa  my dear meredithi have again and again taken up the pen to write to you and many beginnings have gone into the waste paper basket i have one nowfor the second time in my lifeand feel a big man on the strength of it and no doubt it requires some decision to break so long a silence my health is vastly restored and i am now living patriarchally in this place six hundred feet above the sea on the shoulder of a mountain of 1500 behind me the unbroken bush slopes up to the backbone of the island 3 to 4000 without a house with no inhabitants save a few runaway black boys wild pigs and cattle and wild doves and flying foxes and many particoloured birds and many black and many white a very eerie dim strange place and hard to travel i am the head of a household of five whites and of twelve samoans to all of whom i am the chief and father my cook comes to me and asks leave to marryand his mother a fine old chief woman who has never lived here does the same you may be sure i granted the petition it is a life of great interest complicated by the tower of babel that old enemy and i have all the time on my hands for literary work  my house is a great place we have a hall fifty feet long with a great redwood stair ascending from it where we dine in statemyself usually dressed in a singlet and a pair of trousersand attended on by servants in a single garment a kind of kiltalso flowers and leavesand their hair often powdered with lime the european who came upon it suddenly would think it was a dream we have prayers on sunday nighti am a perfect pariah in the island not to have them oftener but the spirit is unwilling and the flesh proud and i cannot go it more it is strange to see the long line of the brown folk crouched along the wall with lanterns at intervals before them in the big shadowy hall with an oak cabinet at one end of it and a group of rodins which native taste regards as prodigieusement leste presiding over all from the topand to hear the long rambling samoan hymn rolling up god bless me what style but i am off business today and this is not meant to be literature  i have asked colvin to send you a copy of catriona which i am sometimes tempted to think is about my best work i hear word occasionally of the amazing marriage it will be a brave day for me when i get hold of it gower woodseer is now an ancient lean grim exiled scot living and labouring as for a wager in the tropics still active still with lots of fire in him but the youthah the youth where is it for years after i came here the critics those genial gentlemen used to deplore the relaxation of my fibre and the idleness to which i had succumbed i hear less of this now the next thing is they will tell me i am writing myself out and that my unconscientious conduct is bringing their grey hairs with sorrow to the dust i do not knowi mean i do know one thing for fourteen years i have not had a days real health i have wakened sick and gone to bed weary and i have done my work unflinchingly i have written in bed and written out of it written in hemorrhages written in sickness written torn by coughing written when my head swam for weakness and for so long it seems to me i have won my wager and recovered my glove i am better now have been rightly speaking since first i came to the pacific and still few are the days when i am not in some physical distress and the battle goes onill or well is a trifle so as it goes i was made for a contest and the powers have so willed that my battlefield should be this dingy inglorious one of the bed and the physic bottle at least i have not failed but i would have preferred a place of trumpetings and the open air over my head  this is a devilish egotistical yarn will you try to imitate me in that if the spirit ever moves you to reply and meantime be sure that away in the midst of the pacific there is a house on a wooded island where the name of george meredith is very dear and his memory since it must be no more is continually honouredever your friend       robert louis stevenson   remember me to mariette if you please and my wife sends her most kind remembrances to yourself       r l s     to charles baxter      finished on the way to honolulu for a health change which turned out    unfortunate with the help of mr jh stevenson and other    correspondents he had now as we have seen been able regretfully    giving up the possibility of a macgregor lineage to identify his    forbears as having about 1670 been tenant farmers at nether carsewell    in renfrewshire the german government at home had taken his    footnote to history much less kindly than his german neighbours on    the spot and the tauchnitz edition had been confiscated and    destroyed and its publisher fined       vailima and ss mariposa september 1893  my dear charleshere is a job for you it appears that about 1665 or earlier james stevenson in  of nether carsewell parish of neilston flourished will you kindly send an ablebodied reader to compulse the parish registers of neilston if they exist or go back as far also could any trace be found through nethercarsewell i expect it to have belonged to mure of cauldwell if this be so might not the cauldwell charter chest contain some references to their stevenson tenantry perpend upon it but clap me on the judicious ablebodied reader on the spot can i really have found the taproot of my illustrious ancestry at last souls of my fathers what a giggleiggleorious moment i have drawn on you for £400 also i have written to tauchnitz announcing i should bear onehalf part of his fines and expenses amounting to £62 10s the £400 includes £160 which i have laid out here in land vanu manutagithe vale of crying birds the wild doveis now mine it was fannys wish and she is to buy it from me again when she has made that much money  will you please order for me through your bookseller the mabinogion of lady charlotte guestif that be her nameand the original of cooks voyages lately published also i see announced a map of the great north road you might see what it is like if it is highly detailed or has any posting information i should like it  this is being finished on board the mariposa going north i am making the run to honolulu and back for healths sake no inclination to write moreas ever       r l s     to sidney colvin      on a first reading of the incomplete ms of the ebb tide without    its concluding chapters which are the strongest dislike of the    three detestableor rather two detestable and one    contemptiblechief characters had made me unjust to the imaginative    force and vividness of the treatment       vailima 23rd august  my dear colvinyour pleasing letter re the ebb tide to hand i propose if it be not too late to delete lloyds name he has nothing to do with the last half the first we wrote together as the beginning of a long yarn the second is entirely mine and i think it rather unfair on the young man to couple his name with so infamous a work above all as you had not read the two last chapters which seem to me the most ugly and cynical of all  you will see that i am not in a good humour and i am not it is not because of your letter but because of the complicated miseries that surround me and that i choose to say nothing of life is not all beer and skittles the inherent tragedy of things works itself out from white to black and blacker and the poor things of a day look ruefully on does it shake my castiron faith i cannot say it does i believe in an ultimate decency of things ay and if i woke in hell should still believe it but it is hard walking and i can see my own share in the missteps and can bow my head to the result like an old stern unhappy devil of a norseman as my ultimate character is  well il faut cultiver son jardin that last expression of poor unhappy human wisdom i take to my heart and go to st ives  24th augand did and worked about 2 hours and got to sleep ultimately and a the clouds has blawn away be sure well have some pleisand weather when a the clouds storms has blawn gone away verses that have a quite inexplicable attraction for me and i believe had for burns they have no merit but are somehow good i am now in a most excellent humour  i am deep in st ives which i believe will be the next novel done but it is to be clearly understood that i promise nothing and may throw in your face the very last thing you expector i expect st ives will to my mind not be wholly bad it is written in rather a funny style a little stilted and lefthanded the style of st ives also to some extent the style of r l s dictating st ives is unintellectual and except as an adventure novel dull but the adventures seem to me sound and pretty probable and it is a love story speed his wings  sunday nightde coeur un peu plus dispos monsieur et cher confrère je me remets à vous écrire st ives is now in the 5th chapter copying in the 14th chapter of the dictated draft i do not believe i shall end by disliking it  mondaywell here goes again for the news fanny is very well indeed and in good spirits i am in good spirits but not very well lloyd is in good spirits and very well belle has a real good fever which has put her pipe out wholly graham goes back this mail he takes with him three chapters of the family and is to go to you as soon as he can he cannot be much the master of his movements but you grip him when you can and get all you can from him as he has lived about six months with us and he can tell you just what is true and what is notand not the dreams of dear old ross66 he is a good fellow is he not  since you rather revise your views of the ebb tide i think lloyds name might stick but ill leave it to you ill tell you just how it stands up to the discovery of the champagne the tale was all planned between us and drafted by lloyd from that moment he has had nothing to do with it except talking it over for we changed our plan gave up the projected monte cristo and cut it down for a short story my impressioni beg your pardonthis is a local jokea firm here had on its beer labels sole importersis that it will never be popular but might make a little succès de scandale however im done with it now and not sorry and the crowd may rave and mumble its bones for what i care  hole essential67 i am sorry about the maps but i want em for next edition so see and have proofs sent you are quite right about the bottle and the great huish i must try to make it clear no i will not write a play for irving nor for the devil can you not see that the work of falsification which a play demands is of all tasks the most ungrateful and i have done it a long whileand nothing ever came of it  consider my new proposal i mean honolulu you would get the atlantic and the rocky mountains would you not for bracing and so much less sea and then you could actually see vailima which i would like you to for its beautiful and my home and tomb that is to be though its a wrench not to be planted in scotlandthat i can never denyif i could only be buried in the hills under the heather and a table tombstone like the martyrs where the whaups and plovers are crying did you see a man who wrote the stickit minister68 and dedicated it to me in words that brought the tears to my eyes every time i looked at them where about the graves of the martyrs the whaups are crying his heart remembers how ah by god it does singular that i should fulfil the scots destiny throughout and live a voluntary exile and have my head filled with the blessed beastly place all the time  and now a word as regards the delusions of the dear ross who remembers i believe my letters and fannys when we were first installed and were really hoeing a hard row we have salad beans cabbages tomatoes asparagus kohlrabi oranges limes barbadines pineapples cape gooseberriesgalore pints of milk and cream fresh meat five days a week it is the rarest thing for any of us to touch a tin and the gnashing of teeth when it has to be done is dreadfulfor no one who has not lived on them for six months knows what the hatred of the tin is as for exposure my weakness is certainly the reverse i am sometimes a month without leaving the verandahfor my sins be it said doubtless when i go about and as the doctor says expose myself to malaria i am in far better health and i would do so more toofor i do not mean to be sillybut the difficulties are great however you see how much the dear doctor knows of my diet and habits malaria practically does not exist in these islands it is a negligeable quantity what really bothers us a little is the mosquito affairthe socalled elephantiasisask ross about it a real romance of natural history quoi  hi stop you say the ebb tide is the working out of an artistic problem of a kind well i should just bet it was you dont like attwater but look at my three rogues theyre all there ill go bail three types of the bad man the weak man and the strong man with a weakness that are gone through and lived out  yes of course i was sorry for mataafa but a good deal sorrier and angrier about the mismanagement of all the white officials i cannot bear to write about that manono all destroyed one house standing in apolima the women stripped the prisoners beaten with whipsand the womens heads takenall under white auspices and for upshot and result of so much shame to the white powerstamasese already conspiring as i knew and preached in vain must be the case well well it is no fun to meddle in politics  i suppose youre right about simon69 but it is symon throughout in that blessed little volume my father bought for me in inverness in the year of grace 81 i believethe trial of james stewart with the jacobite pamphlet and the dying speech appendedout of which the whole of davie has already been begotten and which i felt it a kind of loyalty to follow i really ought to have it bound in velvet and gold if i had any gratitude and the best of the lark is that the name of david balfour is not anywhere within the bounds of it a pretty curious instance of the genesis of a book i am delighted at your good word for david i believe the two together make up much the best of my work and perhaps of what is in me i am not ashamed of them at least there is one hitch instead of three hours between the two parts i fear there have passed three years over davies character but do not tell anybody see if they can find it out for themselves and no doubt his experiences in kidnapped would go far to form him i would like a copy to go to g meredith  wednesdaywell here is a new move it is likely i may start with graham next week and go to honolulu to meet the other steamer and return i do believe a fortnight at sea would do me good yet i am not yet certain the crowded upsteamer sticks in my throat  tuesday 12th septyesterday was perhaps the brightest in the annals of vailima i got leave from captain bickford to have the band of the katoomba come up and they came fourteen of em with drum fife cymbals and bugles blue jackets white caps and smiling faces the house was all decorated with scented greenery above and below we had not only our own nine outdoor workers but a contract party that we took on in charity to pay their warfine the band besides as it came up the mountain had collected a following of children by the way and we had a picking of samoan ladies to receive them chicken ham cake and fruits were served out with coffee and lemonade and all the afternoon we had rounds of claret negus flavoured with rum and limes they played to us they danced they sang they tumbled our boys came in the end of the verandah and gave them a dance for a while it was anxious work getting this stopped once it had begun but i knew the band was going on a programme finally they gave three cheers for mr and mrs stevens shook hands formed up and marched off playingtill a kicking horse in the paddock put their pipes out something of the suddenestwe thought the big drum was gone but simelé flew to the rescue and so they wound away down the hill with ever another call of the bugle leaving us extinct with fatigue but perhaps the most contented hosts that ever watched the departure of successful guests simply impossible to tell how well these bluejackets behaved a most interesting lot of men this education of boys for the navy is making a class wholly aparthow shall i call thema kind of lowerclass public school boy wellmannered fairly intelligent sentimental as a sailor what is more shall be writ on board ship if anywhere  please send catriona to g meredith  ss mariposatomorrow i reach honolulu goodmorning to your honour       r l s     to sidney colvin      in the interval between the last letter and this the writer had been    down with a sharp and prolonged attack of fever at honolulu and mrs    stevenson had come from samoa to nurse and take him home       waikiki honolulu h i oct 23rd 1893  dear colvinmy wife came up on the steamer and we go home together in 2 days i am practically all right only sleepy and tired easily slept yesterday from 11 to 1145 from 1 to 250 went to bed at 8 pm and with an hours interval slept till 6 am close upon 14 hours out of the 24 we sail tomorrow i am anxious to get home though this has been an interesting visit and politics have been curious indeed to study we go to ppc on the queen this morning poor recluse lady abreuvée dinjures quelle est had a rather annoying lunch on board the american manofwar with a member of the pg provisional government and a good deal of antiroyalist talk which i had to sit outnot only for my hosts sake but my fellow guests at last i took the lead and changed the conversation       r l s   i am being busted here by party named hutchinson70 seems good   vailimanovemberhome again and found all well thank god i am perfectly well again and ruddier than the cherry please note that 8000 is not bad for a volume of short stories71 the merry men did a good deal worse the short story never sells i hope catriona will do that is the important the reviews seem mixed and perplexed and one had the peculiar virtue to make me angry i am in a fair way to expiscate my family history fanny and i had a lovely voyage down with our new cj and the american land commissioner and on the whole and for these disgusting steamers a pleasant ships company i cannot understand why you dont take to the hawaii scheme do you understand you cross the atlantic in six days and go from frisco to honolulu in seven thirteen days at sea in alli have no wish to publish the ebb tide as a book let it wait it will look well in the portfolio i would like a copy of course for that end and to look upont againwhich i scarce dare  laterthis is disgraceful i have done nothing neither work nor letters on the mé may day we had a great triumph our protestant boys instead of going with their own villages and families went of their own accord in the vailima uniform belle made coats for them on purpose to complete the uniform they having bought the stuff and they were hailed as they marched in as the tamaonathe rich mans children this is really a score it means that vailima is publicly taken as a family then we had my birthday feast a week late owing to diarrhoea on the proper occasion the feast was laid in the hall and was a singular mass of food 15 pigs 100 lbs beef 100 lbs pork and the fruit and filigree in a proportion we had sixty horseposts driven in the gate paddock how many guests i cannot guess perhaps 150 they came between three and four and left about seven seumanu gave me one of his names and when my name was called at the ava drinking behold it was au mai taua ma manuvao you would scarce recognise me if you heard me thus referred to  two days after we hired a carriage in apia fanny belle lloyd and i and drove in great style with a native outrider to the prison a huge gift of ava and tobacco under the seats the prison is now under the pule of an austrian captain wurmbrand a soldier of fortune in servia and turkey a charming clever kindly creature who is adored by his chiefs as he calls them meaning our political prisoners and we came into the yard walled about with tinned iron and drank ava with the prisoners and the captain it may amuse you to hear how it is proper to drink ava when the cup is handed you you reach your arm out somewhat behind you and slowly pour a libation saying with somewhat the manner of prayer ia taumafa e le atua ua matagofie le fesilafaga nei be it highchief partaken of by the god how high chief beautiful to view is this high chief gathering this pagan practice is very queer i should say that the prison ava was of that not very welcome form that we elegantly call spitava but of course there was no escape and it had to be drunk fanny and i rode home and i moralised by the way could we ever stand europe again did she appreciate that if we were in london we should be actually jostled in the street and there was nobody in the whole of britain who knew how to take ava like a gentleman tis funny to be thus of two civilisationsor if you like of one civilisation and one barbarism and as usual the barbarism is the more engaging  colvin you have to come here and see us in our native  mortal spot i just dont seem to be able to make up my mind to your not coming by this time you will have seen graham i hope and he will be able to tell you something about us and something reliable i shall feel for the first time as if you knew a little about samoa after that fanny seems to be in the right way now i must say she is very very well for her and complains scarce at all yesterday she went down solaat least accompanied by a groom to pay a visit belle lloyd and i went a walk up the mountain roadthe great public highway of the island where you have to go single file the object was to show belle that gaudy valley of the vaisigano which the road follows if the road is to be made and opened as our new chief justice promises it will be one of the most beautiful roads in the world but the point is this i forgot i had been three months in civilisation wearing shoes and stockings and i tell you i suffered on my soft feet coming home down hill on that stairway of loose stones i could have cried o yes another story i knew i had the house boys had not been behaving well so the other night i announced a fono and lloyd and i went into the boys quarters and i talked to them i suppose for half an hour and talolo translated lloyd was there principally to keep another ear on the interpreter else there may be dreadful misconceptions i rubbed all their ears except two whom i particularly praised and one mans wages i announced i had cut down by one half imagine his taking this smiling ever since he has been specially attentive and greets me with a face of really heavenly brightness this is another good sign of their really and fairly accepting me as a chief when i first came here if i had fined a man a sixpence he would have quit work that hour and now i remove half his income and he is glad to stay onnay does not seem to entertain the possibility of leaving and this in the face of one particular difficultyi mean our house in the bush and no society and no women society within decent reach  i think i must give you our staff in a tabular form            house

misifolo well poor dog he does his best i suppose you should see him scour it is a remark that has often been made by visitors you never see a samoan run except at vailima do you not suppose that makes me proud  i am pleased to see what a success the wrecker was having already in little more than a year outstripped the master of ballantrae  about david balfour in two volumes do see that they make it a decentlooking book and tell me do you think a little historical appendix would be of service lang bleats for one and i thought i might address it to him as a kind of open letter  dec 4thno time after all goodbye       r l s     to j horne stevenson      the following refers again to the introduction to the history of his    own family which stevenson was then preparing under the title a    family of engineers the correspondent was a specialist in    genealogical research i give this letter as a sample of many which    passed between these two namesakes on this subject omitting the    remainder as too technical to be of general interest       vailima samoa november 5th 1893  my dear stevensona thousand thanks for your voluminous and delightful collections baxterso soon as it is readywill let you see a proof of my introduction which is only sent out as a sprat to catch whales and you will find i have a good deal of what you have only mine in a perfectly desultory manner as is necessary to an exile my uncles pedigree is wrong there was never a stevenson of caldwell of course but they were tenants of the mures the farm held by them is in my introduction and i have already written to charles baxter to have a search made in the register house i hope he will have had the inspiration to put it under your surveillance your information as to your own family is intensely interesting and i should not wonder but what you and we and old john stevenson land labourer in the parish of dailly came all of the same stock ayrshireand probably cunninghamseems to be the home of the raceour part of it from the distribution of the namewhich your collections have so much extended without essentially changing my knowledge ofwe seem rather pointed to a british origin what you say of the engineers is fresh to me and must be well thrashed out this introduction of it will take a long while to walk aboutas perhaps i may be tempted to let it become long after all i am writing this for my own pleasure solely greetings to you and other speculatives of our date long bygone alasyours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson   psi have a different version of my grandfathers armsor my father had if i could find it       r l s     to john pn      the next two numbers are in answer to letters of appreciation    received from two small boys in england whose mother desires that    they should remain nameless       vailima samoa december 3rd 1893  dear johnniewell i must say you seem to be a tremendous fellow before i was eight i used to write storiesor dictate them at leastand i had produced an excellent history of moses for which i got £1 from an uncle but i had never gone the length of a play so you have beaten me fairly on my own ground i hope you may continue to do so and thanking you heartily for your nice letter i shall beg you to believe me yours truly       robert louis stevenson     to russell pn        vailima samoa december 3rd 1893  dear russelli have to thank you very much for your capital letter which came to hand here in samoa along with your mothers when you grow up and write stories like me you will be able to understand that there is scarce anything more painful than for an author to hold a pen he has to do it so much that his heart sickens and his fingers ache at the sight or touch of it so that you will excuse me if i do not write much but remain with compliments and greetings from one scot to anotherthough i was not born in ceylonyoure ahead of me thereyours very truly       robert louis stevenson     to alison cunningham        vailima december 5 1893  my dearest cummythis goes to you with a merry christmas and a happy new year the happy new year anyway for i think it should reach you about noors day i dare say it may be cold and frosty do you remember when you used to take me out of bed in the early morning carry me to the back windows show me the hills of fife and quote to me    a the hills are covered wi snaw     an winters noo come fairly  there is not much chance of that here i wonder how my mother is going to stand the winter it she can it will be a very good thing for her we are in that part of the year which i like the bestthe rainy or hurricane season when it is good it is very very good and when it is bad it is horrid and our fine days are certainly fine like heaven such a blue of the sea such green of the trees and such crimson of the hibiscus flowers you never saw and the air as mild and gentle as a babys breath and yet not hot  the mail is on the move and i must let upwith much love i am your laddie       r l s     to charles baxter      the following quotes the extract from fountainhalls decisions of    the lords of council etc which suggested to stevenson the romance    of cameronian days and the darien adventure of which under the title    of heathercat he only lived to write the first few introductory    chapters see vol xxi p 177 of this edition       6th december 1893  october 25 1685at privy council george murray lieutenant of the kings guard and others did on the 21st of september last obtain a clandestine order of privy council to apprehend the person of janet pringle daughter to the late clifton and she having retired out of the way upon information he got an order against andrew pringle her uncle to produce her but she having married andrew pringle her uncles son to disappoint all their designs of selling her a boy of thirteen years old but my boy is to be fourteen so i extract no furtherfountainhall i 320  may 6 1685wappus pringle of clifton was still alive after all and in prison for debt and transacts with lieutenant murray giving security for 7000 marksi 372  no it seems to have been her brother who had succeeded   my dear charlesthe above is my story and i wonder if any light can be thrown on it i prefer the girls father dead and the question is how in that case could lieutenant george murray get his order to apprehend and his power to sell her in marriage  ormight lieutenant g be her tutor and she fugitive to the pringles and on the discovery of her whereabouts hastily married  a good legal note on these points is very ardently desired by me it will be the cornerstone of my novel  this is fori am quite wrong to tell youfor you will tell othersand nothing will teach you that all my schemes are in the air and vanish and reappear again like shapes in the cloudsit is for heathercat whereof the first volume will be called the killing time and i believe i have authorities ample for that but the second volume is to be called i believe darien and for that i want i fear a good deal of truck    darien papers   carstairs papers   marchmont papers   jerviswoode correspondence  i hope may do me some sort of general history of the darien affair if there is a decent one which i misdoubt it would also be well to havethe one with most details if possible it is singular how obscure to me this decade of scots history remains 16901700a deuce of a want of light and grouping to it however i believe i shall be mostly out of scotland in my tale first in carolina next in darien i want alsoi am the daughter of the horseleech trulyblacks new large map of scotland sheets 3 4 and 5 a 7s 6d touch i believe if you can get the    caldwell papers  they had better come also and if there be any reasonable workbut no i must call a halt  i fear the song looks doubtful but ill consider of it and i can promise you some reminiscences which it will amuse me to write whether or not it will amuse the public to read of them but its an unco business to supply deidheid coapy     to j m barrie        vailima samoa december 7th 1893  my dear barriei have received duly the magnum opus and it really is a magnum opus72 it is a beautiful specimen of clarks printing paper sufficient and the illustrations all my fancy painted but the particular flower of the flock to whom i have hopelessly lost my heart is tibby birse i must have known tibby birse when she was a servants mantuamaker in edinburgh and answered to the name of miss broddie she used to come and sew with my nurse sitting with her legs crossed in a masculine manner and swinging her foot emphatically she used to pour forth a perfectly unbroken stream of gossip i didnt hear it i was immersed in far more important business with a box of bricks but the recollection of that thin perpetual shrill sound of a voice has echoed in my ears sinsyne i am bound to say she was younger than tibbie but there is no mistaking that and the indescribable and eminently scottish expression  i have been very much prevented of late having carried out thoroughly to my own satisfaction two considerable illnesses had a birthday and visited honolulu where politics are if possible a shade more exasperating than they are with us i am told that it was just when i was on the point of leaving that i received your superlative epistle about the cricket eleven in that case it is impossible i should have answered it which is inconsistent with my own recollection of the fact what i remember is that i sat down under your immediate inspiration and wrote an answer in every way worthy if i didnt as it seems proved that i couldnt it will never be done now however i did the next best thing i equipped my cousin graham balfour with a letter of introduction and from him if you know howfor he is rather of the scottish characteryou may elicit all the information you can possibly wish to have as to us and ours do not be bluffed off by the somewhat stern and monumental first impression that he may make upon you he is one of the best fellows in the world and the same sort of fool that we are only betterlooking with all the faults of vailimans and some of his owni say nothing about virtues  i have lately been returning to my wallowing in the mire when i was a child and indeed until i was nearly a man i consistently read covenanting books now that i am a greybeardor would be if i could raise the beardi have returned and for weeks back have read little else but wodrow walker shields etc of course this is with an idea of a novel but in the course of it i made a very curious discovery i have been accustomed to hear refined and intelligent criticsthose who know so much better what we are than we do ourselvestrace down my literary descent from all sorts of people including addison of whom i could never read a word well laigh i your lug sirthe clue was found my style is from the covenanting writers take a particular casethe fondness for rhymes i dont know of any english prosewriter who rhymes except by accident and then a stone had better be tied around his neck and himself cast into the sea but my covenanting buckies rhyme all the timea beautiful example of the unconscious rhyme above referred to  do you know and have you really tasted these delightful works if not it should be remedied there is enough of the auld licht in you to be ravished  i suppose you know that success has so far attended my bannersmy political banners i mean and not my literary in conjunction with the three great powers i have succeeded in getting rid of my president and my chiefjustice theyve gone home the one to germany the other to souwegia i hear little echoes of footfalls of their departing footsteps through the medium of the newspapers  whereupon i make you my salute with the firm remark that it is time to be done with trifling and give us a great book and my ladies fall into line with me to pay you a most respectful courtesy and we all join in the cry come to vailima  my dear sir your souls health is in ityou will never do the great book you will never cease to work in l etc till you come to vailima       robert louis stevenson     to r le gallienne        vailima samoa december 28th 1893  dear mr le galliennei have received some time ago through our friend miss taylor a book of yours but that was by no means my first introduction to your name the same book had stood already on my shelves i had read articles of yours in the academy and by a piece of constructive criticism which i trust was sound had arrived at the conclusion that you were logroller since then i have seen your beautiful verses to your wife you are to conceive me then as only too ready to make the acquaintance of a man who loved good literature and could make it i had to thank you besides for a triumphant exposure of a paradox of my own the literaryprostitute disappeared from view at a phrase of yoursthe essence is not in the pleasure but the sale true you are right i was wrong the author is not the whore but the libertine and yet i shall let the passage stand it is an error but it illustrated the truth for which i was contending that literaturepaintingall art  are no other than pleasures which we turn into trades  and more than all this i had and i have to thank you for the intimate loyalty you have shown to myself for the eager welcome you give to what is goodfor the courtly tenderness with which you touch on my defects i begin to grow old i have given my top note i fancyand i have written too many books the world begins to be weary of the old booth and if not weary familiar with the familiarity that breeds contempt i do not know that i am sensitive to criticism if it be hostile i am sensitive indeed when it is friendly and when i read such criticism as yours i am emboldened to go on and praise god  you are still young and you may live to do much the little artificial popularity of style in england tends i think to die out the british pig returns to his true love the love of the styleless of the shapeless of the slapdash and the disorderly there is trouble coming i think and you may have to hold the fort for us in evil days  lastly let me apologise for the crucifixion that i am inflicting on you bien à contrecoeur by my bad writing i was once the best of writers landladies puzzled as to my trade used to have their honest bosoms set at rest by a sight of a page of manuscriptah they would say no wonder they pay you for thatand when i sent it in to the printers it was given to the boys i was about thirtynine i think when i had a turn of scriveners palsy my hand got worse and for the first time i received clean proofs but it has gone beyond that now i know i am like my old friend james payn a terror to correspondents and you would not believe the care with which this has been writtenbelieve me to be very sincerely yours       robert louis stevenson     to mrs a baker      the next is in answer to a request for permission to print some of    the writings of r l s in braille type for the use of the blind       december 1893  dear madamthere is no trouble and i wish i could help instead as it is i fear i am only going to put you to trouble and vexation this braille writing is a kind of consecration and i would like if i could to have your copy perfect the two volumes are to be published as vols i and ii of the adventures of david balfour 1st kidnapped 2nd catriona i am just sending home a corrected kidnapped for this purpose to messrs cassell and in order that i may if possible be in time i send it to you first of all please as soon as you have noted the changes forward the same to cassell and co la belle sauvage yard ludgate hill  i am writing to them by this mail to send you catriona  you say dear madam you are good enough to say it is a keen pleasure to you to bring my book within the reach of the blind  conceive then what it is to me and believe me sincerely yours       robert louis stevenson     i was a barren tree before     i blew a quenchèd coal   i could not on their midnight shore     the lonely blind console    a moment lend your hand i bring     my sheaf for you to bind   and you can teach my words to sing     in the darkness of the blind       r l s     to henry james        apia december 1893  my dear henry jamesthe mail has come upon me like an armed man three days earlier than was expected and the lord help me it is impossible i should answer anybody the way they should be your jubilation over catriona did me good and still more the subtlety and truth of your remark on the starving of the visual sense in that book tis true and unless i make the greater effortand am as a step to that convinced of its necessityit will be more true i fear in the future i hear people talking and i feel them acting and that seems to me to be fiction my two aims may be described as    1st war to the adjective   2nd death to the optic nerve  admitted we live in an age of the optic nerve in literature for how many centuries did literature get along without a sign of it however ill consider your letter  how exquisite is your character of the critic in essays in london i doubt if you have done any single thing so satisfying as a piece of style and of insightyours ever       r l s     to sidney colvin      recounting a scene of gratitude for bounty shown by him to the    prisoners in apia gaol       vailima december 1893  my dear colvinone page out of my picture book i must give you fine burning day 12 past two pm we four begin to rouse up from reparatory slumbers yawn and groan get a cup of tea and miserably dress we have had a party the day before xmas day with all the boys absent but one and latterly two we had cooked all day long a cold dinner and lo at two our guests began to arrive though dinner was not till six they were sixteen and fifteen slept the night and breakfasted conceive then how unwillingly we climb on our horses and start off in the hottest part of the afternoon to ride 4 12 miles attend a native feast in the gaol and ride four and a half miles back but there is no help for it i am a sort of father of the political prisoners and have charge dâmes in that riotously absurd establishment apia gaol the twentythree i think it is chiefs act as under gaolers the other day they told the captain of an attempt to escape one of the lesser political prisoners the other day effected a swift capture while the captain was trailing about with the warrant the man came to see what was wanted came too flanked by the former gaoler my prisoner offers to show him the dark cell shoves him in and locks the door why do you do that cries the former gaoler a warrant says he finally the chiefs actually feed the soldiery who watch them  the gaol is a wretched little building containing a little room and three cells on each side of a central passage it is surrounded by a fence of corrugated iron and shows over the top of that only a gable end with the inscription o le fale puipui it is on the edge of the mangrove swamp and is reached by a sort of causeway of turf when we drew near we saw the gates standing open and a prodigious crowd outsidei mean prodigious for apia perhaps a hundred and fifty people the two sentries at the gate stood to arms passively and there seemed to be a continuous circulation inside and out the captain came to meet us our boy who had been sent ahead was there to take the horses and we passed inside the court which was full of food and rang continuously to the voice of the caller of gifts i had to blush a little later when my own present came and i heard my one pig and eight miserable pineapples being counted out like guineas in the four corners of the yard and along one wall there are makeshift dwarfish samoan houses or huts which have been run up since captain wurmbrand came to accommodate the chiefs before that they were all crammed into the six cells and locked in for the night some of them with dysentery they are wretched constructions enough but sanctified by the presence of chiefs we heard a man corrected loudly today for saying fale of one of them maota roared the highest chief presentpalace about eighteen chiefs gorgeously arrayed stood up to greet us and led us into one of these maotas where you may be sure we had to crouch almost to kneel to enter and where a row of pretty girls occupied one side to make the ava kava the highest chief present was a magnificent man as high chiefs usually are i find i cannot describe him his face is full of shrewdness and authority his figure like ajax his name auilua he took the head of the building and put belle on his right hand fanny was called first for the ava kava our names were called in english style the highchief wife of mr stan unpronounceable something mrs straw and the like and when we went into the other house to eat we found we were seated alternately with chiefs about thetable i was about to say but rather floor everything was to be done european style with a vengeance we were the only whites present except wurmbrand and still i had no suspicion of the truth they began to take off their ulas necklaces of scarlet seeds and hang them about our necks we politely resisted and were told that the king who had stopped off their siva had sent down to the prison a message to the effect that he was to give a dinner tomorrow and wished their secondhand ulas for it some of them were content others not there was a ring of anger in the boys voice as he told us we were to wear them past the kings house dinner over i must say they are moderate eaters at a feast we returned to the ava house and then the curtain drew suddenly up upon the set scene we took our seats and auilua began to give me a present recapitulating each article as he gave it out with some appropriate comment he called me several times their only friend said they were all in slavery had no money and these things were all made by the hands of their familiesnothing bought he had one phrase in which i heard his voice rise up to a note of triumph this is a present from the poor prisoners to the rich man thirteen pieces of tapa some of them surprisingly fine one i think unique thirty fans of every shape and colour a kava cup etc etc at first auilua conducted the business with weighty gravity but before the end of the thirty fans his comments began to be humorous when it came to a little basket he said here was a little basket for tusitala to put sixpence in when he could get hold of onewith a delicious grimace i answered as best as i was able through a miserable interpreter and all the while as i went on i heard the crier outside in the court calling my gift of food which i perceived was to be gargantuan i had brought but three boys with me it was plain that they were wholly overpowered we proposed to send for our gifts on the morrow but no said the interpreter that would never do they must go away today mulinuu must see my porters taking away the giftsmake em jella quoth the interpreter and i began to see the reason of this really splendid gift one half gratitude to meone half a wipe at the king  and now to introduce darker colours you must know this visit of mine to the gaol was just a little bit risky we had several causes for anxiety it might have been put up to connect with a tamasese rising tusitala and his family would be good hostages on the other hand there were the mulinuu people all about we could see the anxiety of captain wurmbrand no less anxious to have us go than he had been to see us come he was deadly white and plainly had a bad headache in the noisy scene presently the noise grew uproarious there was a rush at the gatea rush in not a rush outwhere the two sentries still stood passive auilua leaped from his place it was then that i got the name of ajax for him and the next moment we heard his voice roaring and saw his mighty figure swaying to and fro in the hurlyburly as the deuce would have it we could not understand a word of what was going on it might be nothing more than the ordinary grab racket with which a feast commonly concludes it might be something worse we made what arrangements we could for my tapa fans etc as well as for my five pigs my masses of fish taro etc and with great dignity and ourselves laden with ulas and other decorations passed between the sentries among the howling mob to our horses alls well that ends well owing to fanny and belle we had to walk and as lloyd said he had at last ridden in a circus the whole length of apia we paced our triumphal progress past the kings palace past the german firm at sogiyou can follow it on the mapamidst admiring exclamations of mawaiabeautifulit may be rendered o my aint they dandyuntil we turned up at last into our road as the dusk deepened into night it was really exciting and there is one thing sure no such feast was ever made for a single family and no such present ever given to a single white man it is something to have been the hero of it and whatever other ingredients there were undoubtedly gratitude was present as money value i have actually gained on the transaction  your note arrived little profit i must say scott has already put his nose in in st ives sir but his appearance is not yet complete nothing is in that romance except the story i have to announce that i am off work probably for six months i must own that i have overworked bitterlyoverworkedthere thats legible my hand is a thing that was and in the meanwhile so are my brains and here in the very midst comes a plausible scheme to make vailima pay which will perhaps let me into considerable expense just when i dont want it you know the vast cynicism of my view of affairs and how readily and as some people say with how much gusto i take the darker view  why do you not send me jerome k jeromes paper and let me see the ebb tide as a serial it is always very important to see a thing in different presentments i want every number politically we begin the new year with every expectation of a bust in 2 or 3 days a bust which may spell destruction to samoa i

vailimathe end  januarydecember 1894   this new year began for stevenson with an illness which seemed to leave none of the usual lowering consequences and for samoa with fresh rumours of war which were not realised until the autumn and thenat least in the shape of serious hostilitiesin the district of atua only and not in his own on the whole stevensons bodily health and vigour kept at a higher level than during the previous year but for serious imaginative writing he found himself still unfit and the sense that his old facility had for the time being failed him caused him much inward misgiving in his correspondence the misgiving mood was allowed to appear pretty freely but in personal intercourse his high spirits seemed to his family and visitors as unfailing as ever several things happened during the year to give him peculiar pleasure first at the beginning of the year the news of mr baxters carefully prepared scheme of the edinburgh edition and of its acceptance by the publishers concerned on this subject much correspondence naturally passed between him and mr baxter and myself over and above that which is here published and finally he resolved to leave all the details of the execution to us by the early autumn the financial success of the scheme was fully assured and made known to him by cable but he did not seem altogether to realise the full measure of relief from money anxieties which the assurance was meant to convey to him other pleasurable circumstances were the return of mr graham balfour after a prolonged absence the visit of a spirited and accomplished young english man of business and of letters mr sidney lysaght see below pp 385 388 etc and the frequent society of the officers of hms curaçoa with whom he was on terms of particular regard and cordiality lastly he was very deeply touched and gratified by the action of the native political prisoners towards whom he had shown much thoughtful kindness during their months of detention in volunteering as a testimony of gratitude after their release to remake with their own hands the branch road leading to his house the road of loving hearts as it came to be christened soon afterwards the anniversaries of his own birthday and of the american thanksgiving feast brought evidences hardly less welcome after so much contention and annoyance as the island affairs and politics had involved him in of the honour and affection in which he was held by all that was best in the white community by each succeeding mail came stronger proofs from home of the manner in which men of letters of the younger generation had come to regard him as a master an example and a friend  but in spite of all these causes of pleasure his letters showed that his old invincible spirit of inward cheerfulness was beginning not infrequently to give way to moods of depression and overstrained feeling the importunity of these moods was no doubt due to some physical premonition that his vital powers so frail from the cradle and always with so cheerful a courage overtaxed were near exhaustion during the first months of the year he attempted little writing in the late spring and early summer his work was chiefly on the annals of his family and on the tale st ives the latter he found uphill work after the first ten or twelve chapters which are in his happiest vein the narrative as he himself was painfully aware began to flag towards the end of october he gave it up for the time being and turned to a more arduous task the tragic weir of hermiston on this theme he felt his inspiration return and during the month of november and the first days of december wrought once more at the full pitch of his powers and in the conscious delight of their exercise on the third of december after a morning of happy work and pleasant correspondence he was seen gazing long and wistfully toward the forestclad mountain on a ledge of which he had desired that he should be buried in the afternoon he brought his mornings work to his wife the most exacting of his critics asked her whether it was not well done and in her glow of admiring assent found his confirmation and his reward nevertheless she could not throw off an oppressive sense of coming calamity he was reassuring her with gay and laughing talk when the sudden rupture of a bloodvessel in the brain laid him almost in a moment unconscious at her feet and before two hours were over he had passed away all the world knows how his body was carried by the loving hands of his native servants to the burialplace of his choice and rests there with the words of his own requiem engraved on his tombthe words which we have seen him putting on paper when he was at grips with death fifteen years before in california    home is the sailor home from sea    and the hunter home from the hill     to charles baxter      mr baxter after much preliminary consideration and inquiry had    matured and submitted to stevenson the scheme of the edinburgh    edition to which this letter is his reply the paper on treasure    island appeared in the idler for august 1889 and was afterwards    reprinted in the miscellany my first book chatto and windus    1894 see edinburgh edition miscellanies vol iv p 285       1st january 94  my dear charlesi am delighted with your idea and first i will here give an amended plan and afterwards give you a note of some of the difficulties    plan of the edinburgh edition14 vols   it may be a question whether my times letters might not be appended to the footnote with a note of the dates of discharge of cedercrantz and pilsach  i am particularly pleased with this idea of yours because i am come to a dead stop i never can remember how bad i have been before but at any rate i am bad enough just now i mean as to literature in health i am well and strong i take it i shall be six months before im heard of again and this time i could put in to some advantage in revising the text and if it were thought desirable writing prefaces i do not know how many of them might be thought desirable i have written a paper on treasure island which is to appear shortly master of ballantraei have one drafted the wrecker is quite sufficiently done already with the last chapter but i suppose an historic introduction to david balfour is quite unavoidable prince otto i dont think i could say anything about and black arrow dont want to but it is probable i could say something to the volume of travels in the verse business i can do just what i like better than anything else and extend underwoods with a lot of unpublished stuff À propos if i were to get printed off a very few poems which are somewhat too intimate for the public could you get them run up in some luxuous manner so that fools might be induced to buy them in just a sufficient quantity to pay expenses and the thing remain still in a manner private we could supply photographs of the illustrationsand the poems are of vailima and the familyi should much like to get this done as a surprise for fanny       r l s     to h b baildon        vailima january 15th 1894  my dear baildonlast mail brought your book and its dedication frederick street and the gardens and the shortlived jack o lantern are again with meand the note of the east wind and froebels voice and the smell of soup in thomsons stair truly you had no need to put yourself under the protection of any other saint were that saint our tamate himself yourself were enough and yourself coming with so rich a sheaf  for what is this that you say about the muses they have certainly never better inspired you than in jael and sisera and herodias and john the baptist good stout poems fiery and sound tis but a mask and behind it chuckles the god of the garden i shall never forget by the by an error of the press page 49 line 4 no infants lesson are the ways of god the is dropped  and this reminds me you have a bad habit which is to be comminated in my theory of letters same page two lines lower but the vultures track is surely as fine to the ear as but vultures track and this latter version has a dreadful baldness the reader goes on with a sense of impoverishment of unnecessary sacrifice he has been robbed by footpads and goes scouting for his lost article again in the second epode these fine verses would surely sound much finer if they began as a hardy climber who has set his heart than with the jejune as hardy climber i do not know why you permit yourself this licence with grammar you show in so many pages that you are superior to the paltry sense of rhythm which usually dictates itas though some poetaster had been suffered to correct the poets text by the way i confess to a heartfelt weakness for auriculasbelieve me the very grateful and characteristic pickthank but still sincere and affectionate       robert louis stevenson     to w h low        vailima january 15th 1894  my dear low  pray you stoop your proud head and sell yourself to some jew magazine and make the visit out i assure you this is the spot for a sculptor or painter this and no otheri dont say to stay there but to come once and get the living colour into them i am used to it i do not notice it rather prefer my grey freezing recollections of scotland but there it is and every morning is a thing to give thanks for and every night anotherbar when it rains of course  about the wreckerrather late days and i still suspect i had somehow offended you however alls well that ends well and i am glad i am forgivendid you not fail to appreciate the attitude of dodd he was a fizzle and a stick he knew it he knew nothing else and there is an undercurrent of bitterness in him and then the problem that pinkerton laid down why the artist can do nothing else is one that continually exercises myself he cannot granted but scott could and montaigne and julius caesar and many more and why cant r l s does it not amaze you it does me i think of the renaissance fellows and their allround human sufficiency and compare it with the ineffable smallness of the field in which we labour and in which we do so little i think david balfour a nice little book and very artistic and just the thing to occupy the leisure of a busy man but for the top flower of a mans life it seems to me inadequate small is the word it is a small age and i am of it i could have wished to be otherwise busy in this world i ought to have been able to build lighthouses and write david balfours too hinc illae lacrymae i take my own case as most handy but it is as illustrative of my quarrel with the age we take all these pains and we dont do as well as michael angelo or leonardo or even fielding who was an active magistrate or richardson who was a busy bookseller jai honte pour nous my ears burn  i am amazed at the effect which this chicago exhibition has produced upon you and others it set mrs fairchild literally madto judge by her letters and i wish i had seen anything so influential i suppose there was an aura a halo some sort of effulgency about the place for here i find you louder than the rest well it may be there is a time coming and i wonder when it comes whether it will be a time of little exclusive oneeyed rascals like you and me or parties of the old stamp who can paint and fight and write and keep books of double entry and sculp and scalp it might be you have a lot of stuff in the kettle and a great deal of it celtic i have changed my mind progressively about england practically the whole of scotland is celtic and the western half of england and all ireland and the celtic blood makes a rare blend for art if it is stiffened up with latin blood you get the french we were less lucky we had only scandinavians themselves decidedly artistic and the lowgerman lot however that is a good startingpoint and with all the other elements in your crucible it may come to something great very easily i wish you would hurry up and let me see it here is a long while i have been waiting for something good in art and what have i seen zolas débâcle and a few of kiplings tales are you a reader of barbey daurévilly he is a neverfailing source of pleasure to me for my sins i suppose what a work is the rideau cramoisi and lensorcelée and le chevalier des touches  this is degenerating into mere twaddle so please remember us all most kindly to mrs low and believe me ever yours       robert louis stevenson   pswere all your privateers voiceless in the war of 1812 did no one of them write memoirs i shall have to do my privateer from chic if you cant help me74 my application to scribner has been quite in vain see if you can get hold of some historic sharp in the club and tap him they must some of them have written memoirs or notes of some sort perhaps still unprinted if that be so get them copied for me       r l s     to sidney colvin        vailima jan 29th 1894  my dear colvini had fully intended for your education and moral health to fob you off with the meanest possible letter this month and unfortunately i find i will have to treat you to a good long account of matters here i believe i have told you before about tuimalealiifano and my taking him down to introduce him to the chief justice well tui came back to vailima one day in the blackest sort of spirits saying the war was decided that he also must join in the fight and that there was no hope whatever of success he must fight as a point of honour for his family and country and in his case even if he escaped on the field of battle deportation was the least to be looked for he said he had a letter of complaint from the great council of aana which he wished to lay before the chief justice and he asked me to accompany him as if i were his nurse we went down about dinner time and by the way received from a lurking native the famous letter in an official blue envelope gummed up to the edges it proved to be a declaration of war quite formal but with some variations that really made you bounce white residents were directly threatened bidden to have nothing to do with the kings party not to receive their goods in their houses etc under pain of an accident however the chief justice took it very wisely and mildly and between us he and i and tui made up a plan which has proved successfulso far the war is overfifteen chiefs are this morning undergoing a curious double process of law comparable to a court martial in which their complaints are to be considered and if possible righted while their conduct is to be criticised perhaps punished up to now therefore it has been a most successful policy but the danger is before us my own feeling would decidedly be that all would be spoiled by a single execution the great hope after all lies in the knotless rather flaccid character of the people these are no maoris all the powers that cedercrantz let go by disuse the new c j is stealthily and boldly taking back again perhaps some others also he has shamed the chiefs in mulinuu into a law against taking heads with a punishment of six years imprisonment and for a chief degradation to him has been left the sole conduct of this anxious and decisive inquiry if the natives stand it why well but i am nervous     to h b baildon        vailima january 30th 1894  my dear baildoncall not blessedyes if i could die just now or say in half a year i should have had a splendid time of it on the whole but it gets a little stale and my work will begin to senesce and parties to shy bricks at me and now it begins to look as if i should survive to see myself impotent and forgotten its a pity suicide is not thought the ticket in the best circles  but your letter goes on to congratulate me on having done the one thing i am a little sorry for a littlenot muchfor my father himself lived to think that i had been wiser than he but the cream of the jest is that i have lived to change my mind and think that he was wiser than i had i been an engineer and literature my amusement it would have been better perhaps i pulled it off of course i won the wager and it is pleasant while it lasts but how long will it last i dont know say the bells of old bow  all of which goes to show that nobody is quite sane in judging himself truly had i given way and gone in for engineering i should be dead by now well the gods know best   i hope you got my letter about the rescueadieu       r l s   true for you about the benefit except by kisses jests song et hoc genus omne man cannot convey benefit to another the universal benefactor has been there before him     to sidney colvin        feb 1894  dear colvinby a reaction when your letter is a little decent mine is to be naked and unashamed we have been much exercised no one can prophesy here of course and the balance still hangs trembling but i think it will go for peace  the mail was very late this time hence the paltriness of this note when it came and i had read it i retired with the ebb tide and read it all before i slept i did not dream it was near as good i am afraid i think it excellent a little indecision about attwater not much it gives me great hope as i see i can work in that constipated mosaic manner which is what i have to do just now with weir of hermiston  we have given a ball i send you a paper describing the event we have two guests in the house captaincount wurmbrand and monsieur albert de lautreppe lautreppe is awfully nicea quiet gentlemanly fellow gonflé de rêves as he describes himselfonce a sculptor in the atelier of henry crosse he knows something of art and is really a resource to me  letter from meredith very kind have you seen no more of graham  what about my grandfather the family history will grow to be quite a chapter  i suppose i am growing sensitive perhaps by living among barbarians i expect more civility look at this from the author of a very interesting and laudatory critique he gives quite a false description of something of mine and talks about my insolence frankly i supposed insolence to be a tapu word i do not use it to a gentleman i would not write it of a gentleman i may be wrong but i believe we did not write it of a gentleman in old days and in my view he clever fellow as he is wants to be kicked for applying it to me by writing a noveleven a bad onei do not make myself a criminal for anybody to insult this may amuse you but either there is a change in journalism too gradual for you to remark it on the spot or there is a change in me i cannot bear these phrases i long to resent them my forbears the tenant farmers of the mures would not have suffered such expressions unless it had been from cauldwell or rowallan or maybe auchendrane my family pride bristles i am like the negro i just heard last night who my great great great great grandfather wasever yours       r l s     to j h bates      the next is to a correspondent in cincinnati who had been the    founder of an r l s society in that city originally he writes    me under date april 7 1895 the outcome of a boyish fancy but it    has now grown into something more substantial       vailima samoa march 25th 1894  my dear mr joe h batesi shall have the greatest pleasure in acceding to your complimentary request i shall think it an honour to be associated with your chapter and i need not remind you for you have said it yourself how much depends upon your own exertions whether to make it to me a real honour or only a derision this is to let you know that i accept the position that you have seriously offered to me in a quite serious spirit i need scarce tell you that i shall always be pleased to receive reports of your proceedings and if i do not always acknowledge them you are to remember that i am a man very much occupied otherwise and not at all to suppose that i have lost interest in my chapter  in this world which as you justly say is so full of sorrow and suffering it will always please me to remember that my name is connected with some efforts after alleviation nor less so with purposes of innocent recreation which after all are the only certain means at our disposal for bettering human life  with kind regards to yourself to mr l c congdon to e m g bates and to mr edward hugh higlee bates and the heartiest wishes for the future success of the chapter believe me yours cordially       robert louis stevenson     to william archer        vailima samoa march 27th 1894  my dear archermany thanks for your theatrical world do you know it strikes me as being really very good i have not yet read much of it but so far as i have looked there is not a dull and not an empty page in it hazlitt whom you must often have thought of would have been pleased come to think of it i shall put this book upon the hazlitt shelf you have acquired a manner that i can only call august otherwise i should have to call it such amazing impudence the bauble shop and becket are examples of what i mean but it sets you weel  marjorie fleming i have known as you surmise for long she was possiblyno i take back possiblyshe was one of the greatest works of god your note about the resemblance of her verses to mine gave me great joy though it only proved me a plagiarist by the by was it not over the childs garden of verses that we first scraped acquaintance i am sorry indeed to hear that my esteemed correspondent tomarcher has such poor taste in literature75 i fear he cannot have inherited this trait from his dear papa indeed i may say i know it for i remember the energy of papas disapproval when the work passed through his hands on its way to a second birth which none regrets more than myself it is an odd fact or perhaps a very natural one i find few greater pleasures than reading my own works but i never o i never read the black arrow in that country tomarcher reigns supreme well and after all if tomarcher likes it it has not been written in vain  we have just now a curious breath from europe a young fellow just beginning letters and no fool turned up here with a letter of introduction in the wellknown blue ink and decorative hieroglyphs of george meredith his name may be known to you it is sidney lysaght he is staying with us but a day or two and it is strange to me and not unpleasant to hear all the names old and new come up again but oddly the new are so much more in number if i revisited the glimpses of the moon on your side of the ocean i should know comparatively few of them  my amanuensis deserts mei should have said you for yours is the loss my script having lost all bond with humanity one touch of nature makes the whole world kin that nobody can read my hand it is a humiliating circumstance that thus evens us with printers  you must sometimes think it strangeor perhaps it is only i that should so think itto be following the old round in the gas lamps and the crowded theatres when i am away here in the tropical forest and the vast silences  my dear archer my wife joins me in the best wishes to yourself and mrs archer not forgetting tom and i am yours very cordially       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      partly concerning a fresh rising this time of the partisans of    tamasese from the district of atua which had occurred and was after    some time suppressed partly in reference to the visit of mr sidney    lysaght partly in reply to a petition that his letters might be less    entirely taken up with native affairs of relatively little meaning    to his correspondent       vailima april 1894  my dear colvinthis is the very day the mail goes and i have as yet written you nothing but it was just as wellas it was all about my blacks and chocolates and what of it had relation to whites you will read some of in the times it means as you will see that i have at one blow quarrelled with all the officials of samoa the foreign office and i suppose her majesty the queen with milk and honey blest but youll see in the times i am very well indeed but just about dead and mighty glad the mail is near here and i can just give up all hope of contending with my letters and lie down for the rest of the day these times letters are not easy to write and i dare say the consuls say why then does he write them  i had miserable luck with st ives being already halfway through it a book i had ordered six months ago arrives at last and i have to change the first half of it from top to bottom how could i have dreamed the french prisoners were watched over like a female charity school kept in a grotesque livery and shaved twice a week and i had made all my points on the idea that they were unshaved and clothed anyhow however this last is better business if only the book had come when i ordered it À propos many of the books you announce dont come as a matter of fact when they are of any value it is best to register them your letter alas is not here i sent it down to the cottage with all my mail for fanny on sunday night a boy comes up with a lantern and a note from fanny to say the woods are full of atuas and i must bring a horse down that instant as the posts are established beyond her on the road and she does not want to have the fight going on between us impossible to get a horse so i started in the dark on foot with a revolver and my spurs on my bare feet leaving directions that the boy should mount after me with the horse try such an experience on our road once and do it if you please after you have been down town from nine oclock till six on board the shipofwar lunching teaching sunday school i actually do and making necessary visits and the saturday before having sat all day from 12past six to 12past four scriving at my times letter about halfway up just in fact at point of the outposts i met fanny coming up then all night long i was being wakened with scares that really should be looked into though i knew there was nothing in them and no bottom to the whole story and the drums and shouts and cries from tanugamanono and the town keeping up an allnight corybantic chorus in the moonlightthe moon rose lateand the searchlight of the warship in the harbour making a jewel of brightness as it lit up the bay of apia in the distance and then next morning about eight oclock a drum coming out of the woods and a party of patrols who had been in the woods on our left front which is our true rear coming up to the house and meeting there another party who had been in the woods on our right front  rear which is vaea mountain and 43 of them being entertained to ava and biscuits on the verandah and marching off at last in single file for apia briefly it is not much wonder if your letter and my whole mail was left at the cottage and i have no means of seeing or answering particulars  the whole thing was nothing but a bottomless scare it was obviously so you couldnt make a child believe it was anything else but it has made the consuls sit up my own private scares were really abominably annoying as for instance after i had got to sleep for the ninth time perhapsand that was no easy matter either for i had a crick in my neck so agonising that i had to sleep sitting upi heard noises as of a man being murdered in the boys house to be sure said i this is nothing again but if a mans head was being taken the noises would be the same so i had to get up stifle my cries of agony from the crick get my revolver and creep out stealthily to the boys house and there were two of them sitting up keeping watch of their own accord like good boys and whiling the time over a game of sweepi cascinothe whist of our islandersand one of them was our champion idiot misifolo and i suppose he was holding bad cards and losing all the timeand these noises were his humorous protests against fortune  well excuse this excursion into my blacks and chocolates it is the last you will have heard from lysaght how i failed to write last mail the said lysaght seems to me a very nice fellow we were only sorry he could not stay with us longer austin came back from school last week which made a great time for the amanuensis you may be sure then on saturday the curaçoa came insame commission with all our old friends and on sunday as already mentioned austin and i went down to service and had lunch afterwards in the wardroom the officers were awfully nice to austin they are the most amiable ship in the world and after lunch we had a paper handed round on which we were to guess and sign our guess of the number of leaves on the pineapple i never saw this game before but it seems it is much practised in the queens navee when all have betted one of the party begins to strip the pineapple head and the person whose guess is furthest out has to pay for the sherry my equanimity was disturbed by shouts of the american commodore and i found that austin had entered and lost about a bottle of sherry he turned with great composure and addressed me i am afraid i must look to you uncle louis the sunday school racket is only an experiment which i took up at the request of the late american land commissioner i am trying it for a month and if i do as ill as i believe and the boys find it only half as tedious as i do i think it will end in a month i have carte blanche and say what i like but does any single soul understand me  fanny is on the whole very much better lloyd has been under the weather and goes for a month to the south island of new zealand for some skating save the mark i get all the skating i want among officials  dear colvin please remember that my life passes among my blacks or chocolates if i were to do as you propose in a bit of a tiff it would cut you off entirely from my life you must try to exercise a trifle of imagination and put yourself perhaps with an effort into some sort of sympathy with these people or how am i to write to you i think you are truly a little too cockney with meever yours       robert louis stevenson     to w b yeats        vailima samoa april 14 1894  dear sirlong since when i was a boy i remember the emotions with which i repeated swinburnes poems and ballads some ten years ago a similar spell was cast upon me by merediths love in the valley the stanzas beginning when her mother tends her haunted me and made me drunk like wine and i remember waking with them all the echoes of the hills about hyères it may interest you to hear that i have a third time fallen in slavery this is to your poem called the lake isle of innisfree it is so quaint and airy simple artful and eloquent to the heartbut i seek words in vain enough that always night and day i hear lake water lapping with low sounds on the shore and am yours gratefully       robert louis stevenson     to george meredith      the young lady referred to in the following is mr merediths    daughter now mrs h sturgis the bearer of the introduction mr    sidney lysaght author of the marplot and one of the grenvilles    it is only in the first few chapters of mr merediths amazing    marriage that the character of gower woodseer has been allowed to    retain any likeness to that of r l s       vailima samoa april 17th 1894  my dear meredithmany good things have the gods sent to me of late first of all there was a letter from you by the kind hand of mariette if she is not too great a lady to be remembered in such a style and then there came one lysaght with a charming note of introduction in the wellknown hand itself we had but a few days of him and liked him well there was a sort of geniality and inward fire about him at which i warmed my hands it is long since i have seen a young man who has left in me such a favourable impression and i find myself telling myself o i must tell this to lysaght or this will interest him in a manner very unusual after so brief an acquaintance the whole of my family shared in this favourable impression and my halls have reechoed ever since i am sure he will be amused to know with widdicombe fair  he will have told you doubtless more of my news than i could tell you myself he has your european perspective a thing long lost to me i heard with a great deal of interest the news of box hill and so i understand it is to be enclosed allow me to remark that seems a far more barbaric trait of manners than the most barbarous of ours we content ourselves with cutting off an occasional head  i hear we may soon expect the amazing marriage you know how long and with how much curiosity i have looked forward to the book now in so far as you have adhered to your intention gower woodseer will be a family portrait age twentyfive of the highly respectable and slightly influential and fairly aged tusitala you have not known that gentleman console yourself he is not worth knowing at the same time my dear meredith he is very sincerely yoursfor what he is worth for the memories of old times and in the expectation of many pleasures still to come i suppose we shall never see each other again flitting youths of the lysaght species may occasionally cover these unconscionable leagues and bear greetings to and fro but we ourselves must be content to converse on an occasional sheet of notepaper and i shall never see whether you have grown older and you shall never deplore that gower woodseer should have declined into the pantaloon tusitala it is perhaps better so let us continue to see each other as we were and accept my dear meredith my love and respect       robert louis stevenson   psmy wife joins me in the kindest messages to yourself and mariette     to charles baxter        vailima april 17 94  my dear charlesst ives is now well on its way into the second volume there remains no mortal doubt that it will reach the threevolume standard  i am very anxious that you should send me  1st tom and jerry a cheap edition  2nd the book by ashtonthe dawn of the century i think it was calledwhich colvin sent me and which has miscarried and  3rd if it is possible a file of the edinburgh courant for the years 1811 1812 1813 or 1814 i should not care for a whole year if it were possible to find me three months winter months by preference it would do my business not only for st ives but for the justiceclerk as well suppose this to be impossible perhaps i could get the loan of it from somebody or perhaps it would be possible to have some one read a file for me and make notes this would be extremely bad as unhappily one mans food is another mans poison and the reader would probably leave out everything i should choose but if you are reduced to that you might mention to the man who is to read for me that balloon ascensions are in the order of the day  4th it might be as well to get a book on balloon ascension particularly in the early part of the century                                       iii at last this book has come from scribner and alas i have the first six or seven chapters of st ives to recast entirely who could foresee that they clothed the french prisoners in yellow but that one fatal factand also that they shaved them twice a weekdamns the whole beginning if it had been sent in time it would have saved me a deal of trouble  i have had a long letter from dr scott dalgleish 25 mayfield terrace asking me to put my name down to the ballantyne memorial committee i have sent him a pretty sharp answer in favour of cutting down the memorial and giving more to the widow and children if there is to be any foolery in the way of statues or other trash please send them a guinea but if they are going to take my advice and put up a simple tablet with a few heartfelt words and really devote the bulk of the subscriptions to the wife and family i will go to the length of twenty pounds if you will allow me and if the case of the family be at all urgent and at least i direct you to send ten pounds i suppose you had better see scott dalgleish himself on the matter i take the opportunity here to warn you that my head is simply spinning with a multitude of affairs and i shall probably forget a half of my business at last       r l s     to mrs sitwell        vailima april 1894  my dear friendi have at last got some photographs and hasten to send you as you asked a portrait of tusitala he is a strange person not so lean say experts but infinitely battered mighty active again on the whole going up and down our breakneck road at all hours of the day and night on horseback holding meetings with all manner of chiefs quite a political personagegod save the markin a small way but at heart very conscious of the inevitable flat failure that awaits every one i shall never do a better book than catriona that is my highwater mark and the trouble of production increases on me at a great rateand mighty anxious about how i am to leave my family an elderly man with elderly preoccupations whom i should be ashamed to show you for your old friend but not a hope of my dying soon and cleanly and winning off the stage rather i am daily better in physical health i shall have to see this business out after all and i think in that case they should havethey might havespared me all my illhealth this decade past if it were not to unbar the doors i have no taste for old age and my nose is to be rubbed in it in spite of my face i was meant to die young and the gods do not love me  this is very like an epitaph bar the handwriting which is anything but monumental and i dare say i had better stop fanny is down at her own cottage planting or deplanting or replanting i know not which and she will not be home till dinner by which time the mail will be all closed else she would join me in all good messages and remembrances of love i hope you will congratulate burne jones from me on his baronetcy i cannot make out to be anything but raspingly harrowingly sad so i will close and not affect levity which i cannot feel do not altogether forget me keep a corner of your memory for the exile       louis     to charles baxter        vailima may 1894  my dear charlesmy dear fellow i wish to assure you of the greatness of the pleasure that this edinburgh edition gives me i suppose it was your idea to give it that name no other would have affected me in the same manner do you remember how many years agoi would be afraid to hazard a guessone night when i communicated to you certain intimations of early death and aspiration after fame i was particularly maudlin and my remorse the next morning on a review of my folly has written the matter very deeply in my mind from yours it may easily have fled if any one at that moment could have shown me the edinburgh edition i suppose i should have died it is with gratitude and wonder that i consider the way in which i have been led could a more preposterous idea have occurred to us in those days when we used to search our pockets for coppers too often in vain and combine forces to produce the threepence necessary for two glasses of beer or wander down the lothian road without any than that i should be strong and well at the age of fortythree in the island of upolu and that you should be at home bringing out the edinburgh edition if it had been possible i should almost have preferred the lothian road edition say with a picture of the old dutch smuggler on the covers i have now something heavy on my mind i had always a great sense of kinship with poor robert fergussonso clever a boy so wild of such a mixed strain so unfortunate born in the same town with me and as i always felt rather by express intimation than from evidence so like myself now the injustice with which the one robert is rewarded and the other left out in the cold sits heavy on me and i wish you could think of some way in which i could do honour to my unfortunate namesake do you think it would look like affectation to dedicate the whole edition to his memory i think it would the sentiment which would dictate it to me is too abstruse and besides i think my wife is the proper person to receive the dedication of my lifes work at the same time it is very oddit really looks like the transmigration of soulsi feel that i must do something for fergusson burns has been before me with the gravestone it occurs to me you might take a walk down the canongate and see in what condition the stone is if it be at all uncared for we might repair it and perhaps add a few words of inscription  i must tell you what i just remembered in a flash as i was walking about dictating this letterthere was in the original plan of the master of ballantrae a sort of introduction describing my arrival in edinburgh on a visit to yourself and your placing in my hands the papers of the story i actually wrote it and then condemned the ideaas being a little too like scott i suppose now i must really find the ms and try to finish it for the ee it will give you what i should so much like you to have another corner of your own in that lofty monument  suppose we do what i have proposed about fergussons monument i wonder if an inscription like this would look arrogant    this stone originally erected   by robert burns has been   repaired at the   charges of robert louis stevenson   and is by him rededicated to   the memory of robert fergusson   as the gift of one edinburgh   lad to another  in spacing this inscription i would detach the names of fergusson and burns but leave mine in the text  or would that look like sham modesty and is it better to bring out the three roberts     to sidney colvin        vailima may 18th 1894  my dear colvinyour proposals for the edinburgh edition are entirely to my mind about the amateur emigrant it shall go to you by this mail well slashed if you like to slash some more on your own account i give you permission tis not a great work but since it goes to make up the two first volumes as proposed i presume it has not been written in vain76miscellanies i see with some alarm the proposal to print juvenilia does it not seem to you taking myself a little too much as grandfather william i am certainly not so young as i once wasa lady took occasion to remind me of the fact no later agone than last night why dont you leave that to the young men mr stevenson said shebut when i remember that i felt indignant at even john ruskin when he did something of the kind i really feel myself blush from head to heel if you want to make up the first volume there are a good many works which i took the trouble to prepare for publication and which have never been republished in addition to roads and dancing children referred to by you there is an autumn effect in the portfolio and a paper on fontainebleauforest notes is the name of itin cornhill i have no objection to any of these being edited say with a scythe and reproduced but i heartily abominate and reject the idea of reprinting the pentland rising for gods sake let me get buried first  tales and fantasies vols i and ii have my hearty approval but i think iii and iv had better be crammed into one as you suggest i will reprint none of the stories mentioned they are below the mark well i dare say the beastly bodysnatcher has merit and i am unjust to it from my recollections of the pall mall but the other two wont do for vols v and vi now changed into iv and v i propose the common title of south sea yarns there these are all my differences of opinion i agree with every detail of your arrangement and as you see my objections have turned principally on the question of hawking unripe fruit i dare say it is all pretty green but that is no reason for us to fill the barrow with trash think of having a new set of type cast paper especially made etc in order to set up rubbish that is not fit for the saturday scotsman it would be the climax of shame  i am sending you a lot of verses which had best i think be called underwoods book iii but in what order are they to go also i am going on every day a little till i get sick of it with the attempt to get the emigrant compressed into life i know i canor you can after medo it it is only a question of time and prayer and ink and should leave something no not good but not all bada very genuine appreciation of these folks you are to remember besides there is that paper of mine on bunyan in the magazine of art o and then theres another thing in seeley called some spewsome name i cannot recall it  wellcome here goes for juvenilia dancing infants roads an autumn effect forest notes but this should come at the end of them as its really rather riper the tother thing from seeley and ill tell you you may put in my letter to the church of scotlandits not written amiss and i dare say the philosophy of umbrellas might go in but there i stickand remember that was a collaboration with james walter ferrier o and there was a little skit called the charity bazaar which you might see i dont think it would do now i do not think there are two other words that should be printedby the way there is an article of mine called the day after tomorrow in the contemporary which you might find room for somewhere its no bad  very busy with all these affairs and some native ones also     to r a m stevenson        vailima june 17th 1894  my dear bobi must make out a letter this mail or perish in the attempt all the same i am deeply stupid in bed with a cold deprived of my amanuensis and conscious of the wish but not the furnished will you may be interested to hear how the family inquiries go it is now quite certain that we are a secondrate lot and came out of cunningham or clydesdale therefore british folk so that you are cymry on both sides and i cymry and pict we may have fought with king arthur and known merlin the first of the family stevenson of stevenson was quite a great party and dates back to the wars of edward first the last male heir of stevenson of stevenson died 1670 £220 10s to the bad from drink about the same time the stevensons who were mostly in cunningham before crop up suddenly in the parish of neilston over the border in renfrewshire of course they may have been there before but there is no word of them in that parish till 1675 in any extracts i have our first traceable ancestor was a tenant farmer of mure of cauldwellsjames in nether carsewell presently two families of maltmen are found in glasgow both by reduplicated proofs related to james the son of james in nether carsewell we descend by his second marriage from robert one of these died 1733 it is not very romantic up to now but has interested me surprisingly to fish out always hoping for moreand occasionally getting at least a little clearness and confirmation but the earliest date 1655 apparently the marriage of james in nether carsewell cannot as yet be pushed back from which of any number of dozen little families in cunningham we should derive god knows of course it doesnt matter a hundred years hence an argument fatal to all human enterprise industry or pleasure and to me it will be a deadly disappointment if i cannot roll this stone away one generation further might be nothing but it is my present object of desire and we are so near it there is a man in the same parish called constantine if i could only trace to him i could take you far afield by that one talisman of the strange christian name of constantine but no such luck and i kind of fear we shall stick at james    i james a tenant of the mures in nethercarsewell                        neilston married 1665 jean keir                                                                                            ii robert maltman in glasgow died 1733

kind of a pin to the whole stevenson system there he   was caution to robert the seconds will and to williams will and to   the will of a john another maltman  so much though all inchoate i trouble you with knowing that you at least must take an interest in it so much is certain of that strange celtic descent that the past has an interest for it apparently gratuitous but fiercely strong i wish to trace my ancestors a thousand years if i trace them by gallowses it is not love not pride not admiration it is an expansion of the identity intimately pleasing and wholly uncritical i can expend myself in the person of an inglorious ancestor with perfect comfort or a disgraced if i could find one i suppose perhaps it is more to me who am childless and refrain with a certain shock from looking forwards but i am sure in the solid grounds of race that you have it also in some degree  enough genealogy i do not know if you will be able to read my hand unhappily belle who is my amanuensis is out of the way on other affairs and i have to make the unwelcome effort o this is beautiful i am quite pleased with myself graham has just arrived last night my mother is coming by the other steamer in three days and has told me of your meeting and he said you looked a little older than i did so that i suppose we keep step fairly on the downward side of the hill he thought you looked harassed and i could imagine that too i sometimes feel harassed i have a great family here about me a great anxiety the loss to use my grandfathers expression the loss of our family is that we are disbelievers in the morrowperhaps i should say rather in next year the future is always black to us it was to robert stevenson to thomas i suspect to alan to r a m s it was so almost to his ruin in youth to r l s who had a hard hopeful strain in him from his mother it was not so much so once but becomes daily more so daily so much more so that i have a painful difficulty in believing i can ever finish another book or that the public will ever read it  i have so huge a desire to know exactly what you are doing that i suppose i should tell you what i am doing by way of an example i have a room now a part of the twelvefoot verandah sparred in at the most inaccessible end of the house daily i see the sunrise out of my bed which i still value as a tonic a perpetual tuning fork a look of gods face once in the day at six my breakfast comes up to me here and i work till eleven if i am quite well i sometimes go out and bathe in the river before lunch twelve in the afternoon i generally work again now alone drafting now with belle dictating dinner is at six and i am often in bed by eight this is supposing me to stay at home but i must often be away sometimes all day long sometimes till twelve one or two at night when you might see me coming home to the sleeping house sometimes in a trackless darkness sometimes with a glorious tropic moon everything drenched with dewunsaddling and creeping to bed and you would no longer be surprised that i live out in this country and not in bournemouthin bed  my great recent interruptions have as you know come from politics not much in my line you will say but it is impossible to live here and not feel very sorely the consequences of the horrid white mismanagement i tried standing by and looking on and it became too much for me they are such illogical fools a logical fool in an office with a lot of red tape is conceivable furthermore he is as much as we have any reason to expect of officialsa thoroughly commonplace unintellectual lot but these people are wholly on wires laying their ears down skimming away pausing as though shot and presto full spread on the other tack i observe in the official class mostly an insane jealousy of the smallest kind as compared to which the artists is of a grave modest characterthe actors even a desire to extend his little authority and to relish it like a glass of wine that is impayable sometimes when i see one of these little kings strutting over one of his victorieswholly illegal perhaps and certain to be reversed to his shame if his superiors ever heard of iti could weep the strange thing is that they have nothing else i auscultate them in vain no real sense of duty no real comprehension no real attempt to comprehend no wish for informationyou cannot offend one of them more bitterly than by offering information though it is certain that you have more and obvious that you have other information than they have and talking of policy they could not play a better stroke than by listening to you and it need by no means influence their action tenez you know what a french post office or railway official is that is the diplomatic card to the life dickens is not in it caricature fails  all this keeps me from my work and gives me the unpleasant side of the world when your letters are disbelieved it makes you angry and that is rot and i wish i could keep out of it with all my soul but i have just got into it again and farewell peace  my work goes along but slowly i have got to a crossing place i suppose the present book st ives is nothing it is in no style in particular a tissue of adventures the central character not very well done no philosophic pith under the yarn and in short if people will read it thats all i ask and if they wont damn them i like doing it though and if you ask me why after that i am on weir of hermiston and heathercat two scotch stories which will either be something different or i shall have failed the first is generally designed and is a private story of two or three characters in a very grim vein the secondalas the thoughtis an attempt at a real historical novel to present a whole field of time the raceour own racethe west land and clydesdale blue bonnets under the influence of their last trial when they got to a pitch of organisation in madness that no other peasantry has ever made an offer at i was going to call it the killing time but this man crockett has forestalled me in that well itll be a big smash if i fail in it but a gallant attempt all my weary reading as a boy which you remember well enough will come to bear on it and if my mind will keep up to the point it was in a while back perhaps i can pull it through  for two months past fanny belle austin her child and i have been alone but yesterday as i mentioned graham balfour arrived and on wednesday my mother and lloyd will make up the party to its full strength i wish you could drop in for a month or a week or two hours that is my chief want on the whole it is an unexpectedly pleasant corner i have dropped into for an end of it which i could scarcely have foreseen from wilsons shop or the princes street gardens or the portobello road still i would like to hear what my alter ego thought of it and i would sometimes like to have my old maîtreèsarts express an opinion on what i do i put this very tamely being on the whole a quiet elderly man but it is a strong passion with me though intermittent now try to follow my example and tell me something about yourself louisa the bab and your work and kindly send me some specimens of what youre about i have only seen one thing by you about notre dame in the westminster or st jamess since i left england now i suppose six years ago  i have looked this trash over and it is not at all the letter i wanted to writenot truck about officials ancestors and the like rancidnessbut you have to let your pen go in its own brokendown gait like an old butchers pony stop when it pleases and go on again as it willever my dear bob your affectionate cousin       r l stevenson     to sidney colvin        vailima june 18th 94  my dear colvinyou are to please understand that my last letter is withdrawn unconditionally you and baxter are having all the trouble of this edition and i simply put myself in your hands for you to do what you like with me and i am sure that will be the best at any rate hence you are to conceive me withdrawing all objections to your printing anything you please after all it is a sort of family affair about the miscellany section both plans seem to me quite good toss up i think the old gardener has to stay where i put him last it would not do to separate john and robert  in short i am only sorry i ever uttered a word about the edition and leave you to be the judge i have had a vile cold which has prostrated me for more than a fortnight and even now tears me nightly with spasmodic coughs but it has been a great victory i have never borne a cold with so little hurt wait till the clouds blow by before you begin to boast i have had no fever and though ive been very unhappy it is nigh over i think of course st ives has paid the penalty i must not let you be disappointed in st i it is a mere tissue of adventures the central figure not very well or very sharply drawn no philosophy no destiny to it some of the happenings very good in themselves i believe but none of them bildende none of them constructive except in so far perhaps as they make up a kind of sham picture of the time all in italics and all out of drawing here and there i think it is well written and here and there its not some of the episodic characters are amusing i do believe others not i suppose however they are the best of the thing such as it is if it has a merit to it i should say it was a sort of deliberation and swing to the style which seems to me to suit the mailcoaches and postchaises with which it sounds all through tis my most prosaic book  i called on the two german ships now in port and we are quite friendly with them and intensely friendly of course with our own curaçoas but it is other guess work on the beach some one has employed or subsidised one of the local editors to attack me once a week he is pretty scurrilous and pretty false the first effect of the perusal of the weekly beast is to make me angry the second is a kind of deep golden content and glory when i seem to say to people see this is my positioni am a plain man dwelling in the bush in a house and behold they have to get up this kind of truck against meand i have so much influence that they are obliged to write a weekly article to say i have none  by this time you must have seen lysaght and forgiven me the letter that came not at all he was really so nice a fellowhe had so much to tell me of meredithand the time was so shortthat i gave up the intervening days between mails entirely to entertain him  we go on pretty nicely fanny belle and i have had two months alone and it has been very pleasant but by tomorrow or next day noon we shall see the whole clan assembled again about vailima table which will be pleasant too seven persons in all and the babel of voices will be heard again in the big hall so long empty and silent goodbye love to all time to closeyours ever       r l s     to henry james        vailima july 7th 1894  dear henry jamesi am going to try and dictate to you a letter or a note and begin the same without any spark of hope my mind being entirely in abeyance this malady is very bitter on the literary man i have had it now coming on for a month and it seems to get worse instead of better if it should prove to be softening of the brain a melancholy interest will attach to the present document i heard a great deal about you from my mother and graham balfour the latter declares that you could take a first in any samoan subject if that be so i should like to hear you on the theory of the constitution also to consult you on the force of the particles o loo and ua which are the subject of a dispute among local pundits you might if you ever answer this give me your opinion on the origin of the samoan race just to complete the favour  they both say that you are looking well and i suppose i may conclude from that that you are feeling passably i wish i was do not suppose from this that i am ill in body it is the numskull that i complain of and when that is wrong as you must be very keenly aware you begin every day with a smarting disappointment which is not good for the temper i am in one of the humours when a man wonders how any one can be such an ass as to embrace the profession of letters and not get apprenticed to a barber or keep a bakedpotato stall but i have no doubt in the course of a week or perhaps tomorrow things will look better  we have at present in port the model warship of great britain she is called the curaçoa and has the nicest set of officers and men conceivable they the officers are all very intimate with us and the front verandah is known as the curaçoa club and the road up to vailima is known as the curaçoa track it was rather a surprise to me many naval officers have i known and somehow had not learned to think entirely well of them and perhaps sometimes ask myself a little uneasily how that kind of men could do great actions and behold the answer comes to me and i see a ship that i would guarantee to go anywhere it was possible for men to go and accomplish anything it was permitted man to attempt i had a cruise on board of her not long ago to manua and was delighted the goodwill of all on board the grim playfulness of77       quarters with the wounded falling down at the word the ambulances hastening up and carrying them away the captain suddenly crying fire in the wardroom and the squad hastening forward with the hose and last and most curious spectacle of all all the men in their dustcoloured fatigue clothes at a note of the bugle falling simultaneously flat on deck and the ship proceeding with its prostrate crewquasi to ram an enemy our dinner at night in a wild open anchorage the ship rolling almost to her gunwales and showing us alternately her bulwarks up in the sky and then the wild broken cliffy palmcrested shores of the island with the surf thundering and leaping close aboard we had the wardroom mess on deck lit by pink wax tapers everybody of course in uniform but myself and the first lieutenant who is a rheumaticky body wrapped in a boat cloak gradually the sunset faded out the island disappeared from the eye though it remained menacingly present to the ear with the voice of the surf and then the captain turned on the searchlight and gave us the coast the beach the trees the native houses and the cliffs by glimpses of daylight a kind of deliberate lightning about which time i suppose we must have come as far as the dessert and were probably drinking our first glass of port to her majesty we stayed two days at the island and had in addition a very picturesque snapshot at the native life the three islands of manua are independent and are ruled over by a little slip of a halfcaste girl about twenty who sits all day in a pink gown in a little white european house with about a quarter of an acre of roses in front of it looking at the palmtrees on the village street and listening to the surf this so far as i could discover was all she had to do this is a very dull place she said it appears she could go to no other village for fear of raising the jealousy of her own people in the capital and as for going about tafatafaoing as we say here its cost was too enormous a strong ablebodied native must walk in front of her and blow the conch shell continuously from the moment she leaves one house until the moment she enters another did you ever blow the conch shell i presume not but the sweat literally hailed off that man and i expected every moment to see him burst a bloodvessel we were entertained to kava in the guesthouse with some very original features the young men who run for the kava have a right to misconduct themselves ad libitum on the way back and though they were told to restrain themselves on the occasion of our visit there was a strange hurlyburly at their return when they came beating the trees and the posts of the houses leaping shouting and yelling like bacchants  i tasted on that occasion what it is to be great my name was called next after the captains and several chiefs a thing quite new to me and not at all samoan practice drank to me by name  and now if you are not sick of the curaçoa and manua i am at least on paper and i decline any longer to give you examples of how not to write  by the by you sent me long ago a work by anatole france which i confess i did not taste since then i have made the acquaintance of the abbé coignard and have become a faithful adorer i dont think a better book was ever written  and i have no idea what i have said and i have no idea what i ought to have said and i am a total ass but my heart is in the right place and i am my dear henry james yours       r l s     to marcel schwob        vailima upolu samoa july 7 1894  dear mr marcel schwobthank you for having remembered me in my exile i have read mimes twice as a whole and now as i write i am reading it again as it were by accident and a piece at a time my eye catching a word and travelling obediently on through the whole number it is a graceful book essentially graceful with its haunting agreeable melancholy its pleasing savoury of antiquity at the same time by its merits it shows itself rather as the promise of something else to come than a thing final in itself you have yet to give usand i am expecting it with impatiencesomething of a larger gait something daylit not twilit something with the colours of life not the flat tints of a temple illumination something that shall be said with all the clearnesses and the trivialities of speech not sung like a semiarticulate lullaby it will not please yourself as well when you come to give it us but it will please others better it will be more of a whole more worldly more nourished more commonplaceand not so pretty perhaps not even so beautiful no man knows better than i that as we go on in life we must part from prettiness and the graces we but attain qualities to lose them life is a series of farewells even in art even our proficiencies are deciduous and evanescent so here with these exquisite pieces the xviith xviiith and ivth of the present collection you will perhaps never excel them i should think the hermes never well you will do something else and of that i am in expectationyours cordially       robert louis stevenson     to a st gaudens        vailima samoa july 8 1894  my dear st gaudensthis is to tell you that the medallion has been at last triumphantly transported up the hill and placed over my smokingroom mantelpiece it is considered by everybody a firstrate but flattering portrait we have it in a very good light which brings out the artistic merits of the godlike sculptor to great advantage as for my own opinion i believe it to be a speaking likeness and not flattered at all possibly a little the reverse the verses curse the rhyme look remarkably well  please do not longer delay but send me an account for the expense of the gilt letters i was sorry indeed that they proved beyond the means of a small farmeryours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to miss adelaide boodle        vailima july 14 1894  my dear adelaide so at last you are going into mission work where i think your heart always was you will like it in a way but remember it is dreary long do you know the story of the american tramp who was offered meals and a days wage to chop with the back of an axe on a fallen trunk damned if i can go on chopping when i cant see the chips fly you will never see the chips fly in mission work never and be sure you know it beforehand the work is one long dull disappointment varied by acute revulsions and those who are by nature courageous and cheerful and have grown old in experience learn to rub their hands over infinitesimal successes however as i really believe there is some good done in the long rungutta cavat lapidem non vi in this businessit is a useful and honourable career in which no one should be ashamed to embark always remember the fable of the sun the storm and the travellers cloak forget wholly and for ever all small pruderies and remember that you cannot change ancestral feelings of right and wrong without what is practically soulmurder barbarous as the customs may seem always hear them with patience always judge them with gentleness always find in them some seed of good see that you always develop them remember that all you can do is to civilise the man in the line of his own civilisation such as it is and never expect never believe in thaumaturgic conversions they may do very well for st paul in the case of an andaman islander they mean less than nothing in fact what you have to do is to teach the parents in the interests of their greatgrandchildren  now my dear adelaide dismiss from your mind the least idea of fault upon your side nothing is further from the fact i cannot forgive you for i do not know your fault my own is plain enough and the name of it is coldhearted neglect and you may busy yourself more usefully in trying to forgive me but ugly as my fault is you must not suppose it to mean more than it does it does not mean that we have at all forgotten you that we have become at all indifferent to the thought of you see in my life of jenkin a remark of his very well expressed on the friendships of men who do not write to each other i can honestly say that i have not changed to you in any way though i have behaved thus ill thus cruelly evil is done by want ofwell principally by want of industry you can imagine what i would say in a novel of any one who had behaved as i have done deteriora sequor and you must somehow manage to forgive your old friend and if you will be so very good continue to give us news of you and let us share the knowledge of your adventures sure that it will be always followed with interesteven if it is answered with the silence of ingratitude for i am not a fool i know my faults i know they are ineluctable i know they are growing on me i know i may offend again and i warn you of it but the next time i offend tell me so plainly and frankly like a lady and dont lacerate my heart and bludgeon my vanity with imaginary faults of your own and purely gratuitous penance i might suspect you of irony  we are all fairly well though i have been off work and offas you know very wellletterwriting yet i have sometimes more than twenty letters and sometimes more than thirty going out each mail and fanny has had a most distressing bronchitis for some time which she is only now beginning to get over i have just been to see her she is lyingthough she had breakfast an hour ago about sevenin her big cool mosquitoproof room ingloriously asleep as for me you see that a doom has come upon me i cannot make marks with a penwitness ingloriously above and my amanuensis not appearing so early in the day for she is then immersed in household affairs and i can hear her steering the boys up and down the verandahsyou must decipher this unhappy letter for yourself and i fully admit with everything against you a letter should be always well written how much more a letter of apology legibility is the politeness of men of letters as punctuality of kings and beggars by the punctuality of my replies and the beauty of my handwriting judge what a fine conscience i must have  now my dear gamekeeper i must really draw to a close for i have much else to write before the mail goes out three days hence fanny being asleep it would not be conscientious to invent a message from her so you must just imagine her sentiments i find i have not the heart to speak of your recent loss you remember perhaps when my father died you told me those ugly images of sickness decline and impaired reason which then haunted me day and night would pass away and be succeeded by things more happily characteristic i have found it so he now haunts me strangely enough in two guises as a man of fifty lying on a hillside and carving mottoes on a stick strong and well and as a younger man running down the sands into the sea near north berwick myselfætat 11somewhat horrified at finding him so beautiful when stripped i hand on your own advice to you in case you have forgotten it as i know one is apt to do in seasons of bereavementever yours with much love and sympathy       robert louis stevenson     to mrs a baker      this refers again to the printing of some of his books in braille    type for the blind       vailima samoa july 16 1894  dear mrs bakeri am very much obliged to you for your letter and the enclosure from mr skinner mr skinner says he thinks mr stevenson must be a very kind man he little knows me but i am very sure of one thing that you are a very kind woman i envy youmy amanuensis being called away i continue in my own hand or what is left of itunusually legible i am thankful to seei envy you your beautiful choice of an employment there must be no regrets at least for a day so spent and when the night falls you need ask no blessing on your work inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of theseyours truly       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        july 1894  my dear colvini have to thank you this time for a very good letter and will announce for the future though i cannot now begin to put in practice good intentions for our correspondence i will try to return to the old system and write from time to time during the month but truly you did not much encourage me to continue however that is all bypast i do not know that there is much in your letter that calls for answer your questions about st ives were practically answered in my last so were your wails about the edition amateur emigrant etc by the end of the year st i will be practically finished whatever it be worth and that i know not when shall i receive proofs of the magnum opus or shall i receive them at all  the return of the amanuensis feebly lightens my heart you can see the heavy weather i was making of it with my unaided pen the last month has been particularly cheery largely owing to the presence of our good friends the curaçoas she is really a model ship charming officers and charming seamen they gave a ball last month which was very rackety and joyous and naval  on the following day about one oclock three horsemen might have been observed approaching vailima who gradually resolved themselves into two petty officers and a native guide drawing himself up and saluting the spokesman a corporal of marines addressed me thus me and my shipmates inwites mr and mrs stevens mrs strong mr austin and mr balfour to a ball to be given tonight in the selfsame all it was of course impossible to refuse though i contented myself with putting in a very brief appearance one glance was sufficient the ball went off like a rocket from the start i had only time to watch belle careering around with a gallant bluejacket of exactly her own heightthe standard of the british navyan excellent dancer and conspicuously full of smalltalkand to hear a remark from a beachcomber its a nice sight this some way to see the officers dancing like this with the men but i tell you sir these are the men thatll fight together  i tell you colvin the acquaintance of the menand boysmakes me feel patriotic eeles in particular is a man whom i respect i am half in a mind to give him a letter of introduction to you when he goes home in case you feel inclined to make a little of him give him a dinner ask henry james to come to meet him etcyou might let me know i dont know that he would show his best but he is a remarkably fine fellow in every department of life  we have other visitors in port a count festetics de tolna an austrian officer a very pleasant simple boyish creature with his young wife daughter of an american millionaire he is a friend of our own captain wurmbrand and it is a great pity wurmbrand is away  glad you saw and liked lysaght he has left in our house a most cheerful and pleasing memory as a good pleasant brisk fellow with good health and brains and who enjoys himself and makes other people happy i am glad he gave you a good report of our surroundings and way of life but i knew he would for i believe he had a glorious timeand gave one78  i am on fair terms with the two treaty officials though all such intimacies are precarious with the consuls i need not say my position is deplorable the president herr emil schmidt is a rather dreamy man whom i like lloyd graham and i go to breakfast with him tomorrow the next day the whole party of us lunch on the curaçoa and go in the evening to a bierabend at dr funks we are getting up a paperchase for the following week with some of the young german clerks and have in view a sort of childs party for grownup persons with kissing games etc here at vailima such is the gay scene in which we move now i have done something though not as much as i wanted to give you an idea of how we are getting on and i am keenly conscious that there are other letters to do before the mail goesyours ever       r l stevenson     to j m barrie        vailima july 13 1894  my dear barriethis is the last effort of an ulcerated conscience i have been so long owing you a letter i have heard so much of you fresh from the press from my mother and graham balfour that i have to write a letter no later than today or perish in my shame but the deuce of it is my dear fellow that you write such a very good letter that i am ashamed to exhibit myself before my junior which you are after all in the light of the dreary idiot i feel understand that there will be nothing funny in the following pages if i can manage to be rationally coherent i shall be more than satisfied  in the first place i have had the extreme satisfaction to be shown that photograph of your mother it bears evident traces of the hand of an amateur how is it that amateurs invariably take better photographs than professionals i must qualify invariably my own negatives have always represented a province of chaos and old night in which you might dimly perceive fleecy spots of twilight representing nothing so that if i am right in supposing the portrait of your mother to be yours i must salute you as my superior is that your mothers breakfast or is it only afternoon tea if the first do let me recommend to mrs barrie to add an egg to her ordinary which if you please i will ask her to eat to the honour of her son and i am sure she will live much longer for it to enjoy his fresh successes i never in my life saw anything more deliciously characteristic i declare i can hear her speak i wonder my mother could resist the temptation of your proposed visit to kirriemuir which it was like your kindness to propose by the way i was twice in kirriemuir i believe in the year 71 when i was going on a visit to glenogil it was kirriemuir was it not i have a distinct recollection of an inn at the endi think the upper endof an irregular open place or square in which i always see your characters evolve but indeed i did not pay much attention being all bent upon my visit to a shootingbox where i should fish a real troutstream and i believe preserved i did too and it was a charming stream clear as crystal without a trace of peata strange thing in scotlandand alive with trout the name of it i cannot remember it was something like the queens river and in some hazy way connected with memories of mary queen of scots it formed an epoch in my life being the end of all my troutfishing i had always been accustomed to pause and very laboriously to kill every fish as i took it but in the queens river i took so good a basket that i forgot these niceties and when i sat down in a hard rain shower under a bank to take my sandwiches and sherry lo and behold there was the basketful of trouts still kicking in their agony  i had a very unpleasant conversation with my conscience all that afternoon i persevered in fishing brought home my basket in triumph and sometime that night in the wee sma hours ayont the twal i finally forswore the gentle craft of fishing i dare say your local knowledge may identify this historic river i wish it could go farther and identify also that particular free kirk in which i sat and groaned on sunday while my hand is in i must tell you a story at that antique epoch you must not fall into the vulgar error that i was myself ancient i was on the contrary very young very green and what you will appreciate mr barrie very shy there came one day to lunch at the house two very formidable old ladiesor one very formidable and the other what you pleaseanswering to the honoured and historic name of the miss c as of balnamoon at table i was exceedingly funny and entertained the company with tales of geese and bubblyjocks i was great in the expression of my terror for these bipeds and suddenly this horrid severe and eminently matronly old lady put up a pair of gold eyeglasses looked at me awhile in silence and pronounced in a clangorous voice her verdict you give me very much the effect of a coward mr stevenson i had very nearly left two vices behind me at glenogilfishing and jesting at table and of one thing you may be very sure my lips were no more opened at that meal  july 29thno barrie tis in vain they try to alarm me with their bulletins no doubt youre ill and unco ill i believe but i have been so often in the same case that i know pleurisy and pneumonia are in vain against scotsmen who can write i once could you cannot imagine probably how near me this common calamity brings you ce que jai toussé dans ma vie how often and how long have i been on the rack at night and learned to appreciate that noble passage in the psalms when somebody or other is said to be more set on something than they who dig for hid treasuresyea than those who long for the morningfor all the world as you have been racked and you have longed keep your heart up and youll do tell that to your mother if you are still in any danger or suffering and by the way if you are at all like meand i tell myself you are very like mebe sure there is only one thing good for you and that is the sea in hot climates mount sir into a little frigot of 5000 tons or so and steer peremptorily for the tropics and what if the ancient mariner who guides your frigot should startle the silence of the ocean with the cry of land hosay when the day is dawningand you should see the turquoise mountain tops of upolu coming hand over fist above the horizon mr barrie sir tis then there would be larks and though i cannot be certain that our climate would suit you for it does not suit some i am sure as death the voyage would do you goodwould do you bestand if samoa didnt do you neednt stay beyond the month and i should have had another pleasure in my life which is a serious consideration for me i take this as the hand of the lord preparing your way to vailimain the desert certainlyin the desert of cough and by the ghoulhaunted woodland of feverbut whither that way points there can be no questionand there will be a meeting of the twa hoasting scots makers in spite of fate fortune and the devil absit omen  my dear barrie i am a little in the dark about this new work of yours79 what is to become of me afterwards you say carefullymethought anxiouslythat i was no longer me when i grew up i cannot bear this suspense what is it its no forgery and am i hangit these are the elements of a very pretty lawsuit which you had better come to samoa to compromise i am enjoying a great pleasure that i had long looked forward to reading ormes history of indostan i had been looking out for it everywhere but at last in four volumes large quarto beautiful type and page and with a delectable set of maps and plans and all the names of the places wrongly spelledit came to samoa little barrie i tell you frankly you had better come soon i am sair failed aready and what i may be if you continue to dally i dread to conceive i may be speechless already or at least for a month or so im little better than a teetolleri beg pardon a teetotaller it is not exactly physical for i am in good health working four or five hours a day in my plantation and intending to ride a paperchase next sundayay man thats a fact and i havena had the hert to breathe it to my mother yetthe obligations poleetical for i am trying every means to live well with my german neighboursand o barrie but its no easy to be sure there are many exceptions and the whole of the above must be regarded as privatestrictly private breathe it not in kirriemuir tell it not to the daughters of dundee what a nice extract this would make for the daily papers and how it would facilitate my position here  august 5ththis is sunday the lords day the hour of attack approaches and it is a singular consideration what i risk i may yet be the subject of a tract and a good tract toosuch as one which i remember reading with recreant awe and rising hair in my youth of a boy who was a very good boy and went to sunday schule and one day kipped from it and went and actually bathed and was dashed over a waterfall and he was the only son of his mother and she was a widow a dangerous trade that and one that i have to practise ill put in a word when i get home again to tell you whether im killed or not accident in the paper hunting field death of a notorious author we deeply regret to announce the death of the most unpopular man in samoa who broke his neck at the descent of magiagi from the misconduct of his little raving lunatic of an old beast of a pony it is proposed to commemorate the incident by the erection of a suitable pile the design by our local architect mr walker is highly artificial with a rich and voluminous crockett at each corner a small but impervious barrièer at the entrance an arch at the top an archer of a pleasing but solid character at the bottom the colour will be genuine williamblack and lang lang may the ladies sit wi their fans in their hands well well they may sit as they sat for me and little theyll reck the ungrateful jauds muckle they cared about tusitala when they had him but now ye can see the difference now leddies ye can repent when ower late o your former cauldness and what yell perhaps allow me to ca your tepeedity he was beautiful as the day but his day is done and perhaps as he was maybe gettin a wee thing flyblown its nane too shüne  monday august 6thwell sir i have escaped the dangerous conjunction of the widows only son and the sabbath day we had a most enjoyable time and lloyd and i were 3 and 4 to arrive i will not tell here what interval had elapsed between our arrival and the arrival of 1 and 2 the question sir is otiose and malign it deserves it shall have no answer and now without further delay to the main purpose of this hasty note we received and we have already in fact distributed the gorgeous fahbrics of kirriemuir whether from the splendour of the robes themselves or from the direct nature of the compliments with which you had directed us to accompany the presentations one young lady blushed as she received the proofs of your munificence bad ink and the dregs of it at that but the heart in the right place still very cordially interested in my barrie and wishing him well through his sickness which is of the body and long defended from mine which is of the head and by the impolite might be described as idiocy the whole head is useless and the whole sitting part painful reason the recent paper chase    there was racing and chasing in vailele plantation       and vastly we enjoyed it   but alas for the state of my foundation       for it wholly has destroyed it  come my mind is looking up the above is wholly impromptuon oath       tusitala     to sidney colvin      the missionary view of the sunday paperchase with an account of    stevensons apologies to the ladies and gentlemen of the mission    have been printed by mr w e clarke in the chronicle of the london    missionary society for april and may 1908       vailima aug 7th 1894  my dear colvinthis is to inform you sir that on sunday last and this is tuesday i attained my ideal here and we had a paperchase in vailele plantation about 15 miles i take it from us and it was all that could be wished it is really better fun than following the hounds since you have to be your own hound and a precious bad hound i was following every false scent on the whole course to the bitter end but i came in 3rd at the last on my little jack who stuck to it gallantly and awoke the praises of some discriminating persons 5  7  212  1412 miles yes that is the count we had quite the old sensations of exhilaration discovery an appeal to a savage instinct and i felt myself about 17 again a pleasant experience however it was on the sabbath day and i am now a pariah among the english as if i needed any increment of unpopularity i must not go again it gives so much unnecessary tribulation to poor people and sure we dont want to make tribulation i have been forbidden to work and have been instead doing my two or three hours in the plantation every morning i only wish somebody would pay me £10 a day for taking care of cacao and i could leave literature to others certainly if i have plenty of exercise and no work i feel much better but there is biles the butcher him we have always with us  i do not much like novels i begin to think but i am enjoying exceedingly ormes history of hindostan a lovely book in its way in large quarto with a quantity of maps and written in a very lively and solid eighteenth century way never picturesque except by accident and from a kind of conviction and a fine sense of order no historian i have ever read is so minute yet he never gives you a word about the people his interest is entirely limited in the concatenation of events into which he goes with a lucid almost superhuman and wholly ghostly gusto by the ghost of a mathematician the book might be announced a very brave honest book  your letter to hand  fact is i dont like the picter80 o its a good picture but if you ask me you know i believe stoutly believe that mankind including you are going mad i am not in the midst with the other frenzy dancers so i dont catch it wholly and when you show me a thingand ask me dont you knowwell well glad to get so good an account of the amateur emigrant talking of which i am strong for making a volume out of selections from the south sea letters i read over again the king of apemama and it is good in spite of your teeth and a real curiosity a thing that can never be seen again and the group is annexed and tembinoka dead i wonder couldnt you send out to me the first five butaritari letters and the low archipelago ones both of which i have lost or mislaid and i can chop out a perfectly fair volume of what i wish to be preserved it can keep for the last of the series  travels and excursions vol ii should it not include a paper on s f from the mag of art the a e the new pacific capital the old ditto silver squat this would give all my works on the states and though it aint very good its not so very bad travels and excursions vol iii to be these resuscitated lettersmiscellanies vol iicomme vous voudrez cher monsieur  monday aug 13thi have a sudden call to go up the coast and must hurry up with my information there has suddenly come to our naval commanders the need of action theyre away up the coast bombarding the atua rebels all morning on saturday the sound of the bombardment of luatuanuu kept us uneasy today again the big guns have been sounding further along the coast one delicious circumstance must not be forgotten our blessed president of the councila kind of hoaryheaded urchin with the dim timid eyes of extreme childhood and a kind of beautiful simplicity that endears him to me beyond wordshas taken the head of the armyhonour to him for it for his place is really thereand gone up the coast in the congenial company of his housekeeper a woman coming on for sixty with whom he takes his walks abroad in the morning in his shirtsleeves whom he reads to at night in a kind of popular history of germany in the silence of the presidential mansion and with whom and a couple of camp stools he walked out last sunday to behold the paperchase i cannot tell you how taken i am with this exploit of the presidents and the housekeepers it is like don quixote but infinitely superior if i could only do it without offence what a subject it would make  tomorrow morning early i am off up the coast myself therefore you must allow me to break off here without further ceremonyyours ever       robert louis stevenson     to dr bakewell      the following is to a physician in australia       vailima august 7 1894  dear dr bakewelli am not more than human i am more human than is wholly convenient and your anecdote was welcome what you say about unwilling work my dear sir is a consideration always present with me and yet not easy to give its due weight to you grow gradually into a certain income without spending a penny more with the same sense of restriction as before when you painfully scraped two hundred a year together you find you have spent and you cannot well stop spending a far larger sum and this expense can only be supported by a certain production however i am off work this month and occupy myself instead in weeding my cacao paperchases and the like i may tell you my average of work in favourable circumstances is far greater than you suppose from six oclock till eleven at latest81 and often till twelve and again in the afternoon from two to four my hand is quite destroyed as you may perceive today to a really unusual extent i can sometimes write a decent fist still but i have just returned with my arms all stung from three hours work in the cacaoyours etc       r l s     to james payn        vailima upolu samoa august 11 1894  my dear james payni hear from lang that you are unwell and it reminds me of two circumstances first that it is a very long time since you had the exquisite pleasure of hearing from me and second that i have been very often unwell myself and sometimes had to thank you for a grateful anodyne  they are not good the circumstances to write an anodyne letter the hills and my house at less than boom a minutes interval quake with thunder and though i cannot hear that part of it shells are falling thick into the fort of luatuanuu boom it is my friends of the curaçoa the falke and the bussard bombarding after all theseboommonths the rebels of atua boomboom it is most distracting in itself and the thought of the poor devils in their fort boom with their bits of rifles far from pleasant boomboom you can see how quick it goes and ill say no more about mr bowwow only you must understand the perpetual accompaniment of this discomfortable sound and make allowances for the value of my copy it is odd though i can well remember when the francoprussian war began and i was in eilean earraid far enough from the sound of the loudest cannonade i could hear the shots fired and i felt the pang in my breast of a man struck it was sometimes so distressing so instant that i lay in the heather on the top of the island with my face hid kicking my heels for agony and now when i can hear the actual concussion of the air and hills when i know personally the people who stand exposed to it i am able to go on taut bien que mal with a letter to james payn the blessings of age though mighty small are tangible i have heard a great deal of them since i came into the world and now that i begin to taste of themwell but this is one that people do get cured of the excess of sensibility and i had as lief these people were shot at as myselfor almost for then i should have some of the fun such as it is  you are to conceive me then sitting in my little gallery room shaken by these continual spasms of cannon and with my eye more or less singly fixed on the imaginary figure of my dear james payn i try to see him in bed no go i see him instead jumping up in his room in waterloo place where ex hypothesi he is not sitting on the table drawing out a very black briarroot pipe and beginning to talk to a slim and illdressed visitor in a voice that is good to hear and with a smile that is pleasant to see after a little more than half an hour the voice that was ill to hear has ceased the cannonade is over and i am thinking how i can get an answering smile wafted over so many leagues of land and water and can find no way  i have always been a great visitor of the sick and one of the sick i visited was w e henley which did not make very tedious visits so ill not get off much purgatory for them that was in the edinburgh infirmary the old one the true one with georgius secundus standing and pointing his toe in a niche of the façade and a mighty fine building it was and i remember one winters afternoon in that place of misery that henley and i chanced to fall in talk about james payn himself i am wishing you could have heard that talk i think that would make you smile we had mixed you up with john payne for one thing and stood amazed at your extraordinary even painful versatility and for another we found ourselves each students so well prepared for examinations on the novels of the real mackay perhaps after all this is worth something in lifeto have given so much pleasure to a pair so different in every way as were henley and i and to be talked of with so much interest by two such beg pardon clever lads  the cheerful lang has neglected to tell me what is the matter with you so im sorry to say i am cut off from all the customary consolations i cant say think how much worse it would be if you had a broken leg when you may have the crushing repartee up your sleeve but it is my leg that is broken this is a pity but there are consolations you are an englishman i believe you are a man of letters you have never been made cb you hair was not red you have played cribbage and whist you did not play either the fiddle or the banjo you were never an æsthete you never contributed to s journal your name is not jabez balfour you are totally unconnected with the army and navy departments i understand you to have lived within your incomewhy cheer up here are many legitimate causes of congratulation i seem to be writing an obituary notice absit omen but i feel very sure that these considerations will have done you more good than medicine  by the by did you ever play piquet i have fallen a victim to this debilitating game it is supposed to be scientific god save the mark what selfdeceivers men are it is distinctly less so than cribbage but how fascinating there is such material opulence about it such vast ambitions may be realisedand are not it may be called the monte cristo of games and the thrill with which you take five cards partakes of the nature of lustand you draw four sevens and a nine and the seven and nine of a suit that you discarded and o but the world is a desert you may see traces of discouragement in my letter all due to piquet there has been a disastrous turn of the luck against me a month or two ago i was two thousand ahead now and for a week back i have been anything from four thousand eight hundred to five thousand two hundred astern i have a sixième my beast of a partner has a septième and if i have three aces three kings three queens and three knaves excuse the slight exaggeration the devil holds quatorze of tensi remain my dear james payn your sincere and obliged friendold friend let me say       robert louis stevenson     to miss middleton      a letter from the lady to whom this is addressed and who had been a    friend of the stevenson family in edinburgh had called up some    memories of a skye terrier jura of whom readers have heard    something already       vailima samoa september 9 1894  dear miss middletonyour letter has been like the drawing up of a curtain of course i remember you very well and the skye terrier to which you refera heavy dull fatted graceless creature he grew up to bewas my own particular pet it may amuse you perhaps as much as the inn amused me if i tell you what made this dog particularly mine my father was the natural god of all the dogs in our house and poor jura took to him of course jura was stolen and kept in prison somewhere for more than a week as i remember when he came back smeoroch had come and taken my fathers heart from him he took his stand like a man and positively never spoke to my father again from that day until the day of his death it was the only sign of character he ever showed i took him up to my room and to be my dog in consequence partly because i was sorry for him and partly because i admired his dignity in misfortune  with best regards and thanks for having reminded me of so many pleasant days old acquaintances dead friends andwhat is perhaps as pathetic as any of themdead dogs i remain yours truly       robert louis stevenson     to a conan doyle      the following refers to the papers originally contributed by various    writers to mr jeromes periodical the idler under the title my    first book and afterwards republished in a volume the references    towards the end are to the illustrations in the pages of the idler       vailima samoa september 9 1894  my dear conan doyleif you found anything to entertain you in my treasure island article it may amuse you to know that you owe it entirely to yourself your first book was by some accident read aloud one night in my baronial all i was consumedly amused by it so was the whole family and we proceeded to hunt up back idlers and read the whole series it is a rattling good series even people whom you would not expect came in quite the proper tonemiss braddon for instance who was really one of the best where all are goodor all but one in short i fell in love with the first book series and determined that it should be all our first books and that i could not hold back where the white plume of conan doyle waved gallantly in the front i hope they will republish them though its a grievous thought to me that that effigy in the german caplikewise the other effigy of the noisome old man with the long hair telling indelicate stories to a couple of deformed negresses in a rancid shanty full of wreckageshould be perpetuated i may seem to speak in pleasantryit is only a seemingthat german cap sir would be found when i come to die imprinted on my heart enoughmy heart is too full adieuyours very truly       robert louis stevenson   in a german cap damn em     to sidney colvin        vailima september 1894  my dear colvinthis must be a very measly letter i have been trying hard to get along with st ives i should now lay it aside for a year and i dare say i should make something of it after all instead of that i have to kick against the pricks and break myself and spoil the book if there were anything to spoil which i am far from saying im as sick of the thing as ever any one can be its a rudderless hulk its a pagoda and you can just feelor i can feelthat it might have been a pleasant story if it had been only blessed at baptism  our politics have gone on fairly well but the result is still doubtful  sept 10thi know i have something else to say to you but unfortunately i awoke this morning with collywobbles and had to take a small dose of laudanum with the usual consequences of dry throat intoxicated legs partial madness and total imbecility and for the life of me i cannot remember what it is i have likewise mislaid your letter amongst the accumulations on my table not that there was anything in it altogether i am in a poor state i forgot to tell baxter that the dummy had turned up and is a fine personablelooking volume and very good reading please communicate this to him  i have just remembered an incident that i really must not let pass you have heard a great deal more than you wanted about our political prisoners well one day about a fortnight ago the last of them was set freeold poè whom i think i must have mentioned to you the fatherinlaw of my cook was one that i had had a great deal of trouble with i had taken the doctor to see him got him out on sick leave and when he was put back again gave bail for him i must not forget that my wife ran away with him out of the prison on the doctors orders and with the complicity of our friend the gaoler who really and truly got the sack for the exploit as soon as he was finally liberated poè called a meeting of his fellowprisoners all sunday they were debating what they were to do and on monday morning i got an obscure hint from talolo that i must expect visitors during the day who were coming to consult me these consultations i am now very well used to and seeing first that i generally dont know what to advise and second that they sometimes dont take my advicethough in some notable cases they have taken it generally to my own wonder with pretty good resultsi am not very fond of these calls they minister to a sense of dignity but not peace of mind and consume interminable time always in the morning too when i cant afford it however this was to be a new sort of consultation up came poè and some eight other chiefs squatted in a big circle around the old diningroom floor now the smokingroom and the family being represented by lloyd graham belle austin and myself proceeded to exchange the necessary courtesies then their talking man began he said that they had been in prison that i had always taken an interest in them that they had now been set at liberty without condition whereas some of the other chiefs who had been liberated before them were still under bond to work upon the roads and that this had set them considering what they might do to testify their gratitude they had therefore agreed to work upon my road as a free gift they went on to explain that it was only to be on my road on the branch that joins my house with the public way  now i was very much gratified at this compliment although to one used to natives it seemed rather a hollow one it meant only that i should have to lay out a good deal of money on tools and food and to give wages under the guise of presents to some workmen who were most of them old and in illhealth conceive how much i was surprised and touched when i heard the whole scheme explained to me they were to return to their provinces and collect their families some of the young men were to live in apia with a boat and ply up and down the coast to aana and atua our own tuamasaga being quite drained of resources in order to supply the working squad with food tools they did ask for but it was especially mentioned that i was to make no presents in short the whole of this little presentation to me had been planned with a good deal more consideration than goes usually with a native campaign  i sat on the opposite side of the circle to the talking man his face was quite calm and highbred as he went through the usual samoan expressions of politeness and compliment but when he came on to the object of their visit on their love and gratitude to tusitala how his name was always in their prayers and his goodness to them when they had no other friend was their most cherished memory he warmed up to real burning genuine feeling i had never seen the samoan mask of reserve laid aside before and it touched me more than anything else am  this morning as ever was bright and early up came the whole gang of them a lot of sturdy commonlooking lads they seemed to be for the most part and fell to on my new road old poè was in the highest of good spirits and looked better in health than he has done any time in two years being positively rejuvenated by the success of his scheme he jested as he served out the new tools and i am sorry to say damned the government up hill and down dale probably with a view to show off his position as a friend of the family before his workboys now whether or not their impulse will last them through the road does not matter to me one hair it is the fact that they have attempted it that they have volunteered and are now really trying to execute a thing that was never before heard of in samoa think of it it is roadmakingthe most fruitful cause after taxes of all rebellions in samoa a thing to which they could not be wiled with money nor driven by punishment it does give me a sense of having done something in samoa after all  now theres one long story for you about my blacksyours ever       robert louis stevenson     to charles baxter      the following was written on hearing of the death of his friends    father       vailima september 1894  my dear charles well there is no more edmund baxter now and i think i may say i know how you feel he was one of the best the kindest and the most genial men i ever knew i shall always remember his brisk cordial ways and the essential goodness which he showed me whenever we met with gratitude and the always is such a little while now he is another of the landmarks gone when it comes to my own turn to lay my weapons down i shall do so with thankfulness and fatigue and whatever be my destiny afterward i shall be glad to lie down with my fathers in honour it is human at least if not divine and these deaths make me think of it with an ever greater readiness strange that you should be beginning a new life when i who am a little your junior am thinking of the end of mine but i have had hard lines i have been so long waiting for death i have unwrapped my thoughts from about life so long that i have not a filament left to hold by i have done my fiddling so long under vesuvius that i have almost forgotten to play and can only wait for the eruption and think it long of coming literally no man has more wholly outlived life than i and still its good fun       r l s     to r a m stevenson      stevenson had received from his cousin a letter announcing among    other things the birth of a son to the writer and rambling    suggestively as may be guessed from the following reply over many    disconnected themes the ethnology of scotland paternity and    heredity civilisation versus primitive customs and instincts the    story of their own descent the method of writing in collaboration    education christianity and sex the religion of conduct anarchism    etc all which matters are here discursively touched on old skene    is of course the distinguished scottish antiquarian and historian    william forbes skene in whose firm skene  edwards ws stevenson    had for a time served irregularly enough as an unpaid clerk       vailima september 1894  dear bobyou are in error about the picts they were a gaelic race spoke a celtic tongue and we have no evidence that i know of that they were blacker than other celts the balfours i take it were plainly celts their name shows itthe cold croft it means so does their country where the black scotch come from nobody knows but i recognise with you the fact that the whole of britain is rapidly and progressively becoming more pigmented already in one mans life i can decidedly trace a difference in the children about a school door but colour is not an essential part of a man or a race take my polynesians an asiatic people probably from the neighbourhood of the persian gulf they range through any amount of shades from the burnt hue of the low archipelago islander which seems half negro to the bleached pretty women of the marquesas close by on the map who come out for a festival no darker than an italian their colour seems to vary directly with the degree of exposure to the sun and as with negroes the babes are born white only it should seem a little sack of pigment at the lower part of the spine which presently spreads over the whole field very puzzling but to return the picts furnish today perhaps a third of the population of scotland say another third for scots and britons and the third for norse and angles is a bad third edinburgh was a pictish place but the fact is we dont know their frontiers tell some of your journalist friends with a good style to popularise old skene or say your prayers and read him for yourself he was a great historian and i was his blessed clerk and did not know it and you will not be in a state of grace about the picts till you have studied him j horne stevenson do you know him is working this up with me and the fact isits not interesting to the publicbut its interesting and very interesting in itself and just now very embarrassingthis rural parish supplied glasgow with such a quantity of stevensons in the beginning of last century there is just a link wanting and we might be able to go back to the eleventh century always undistinguished but clearly traceable when i say just a link i guess i may be taken to mean a dozen what a singular thing is this undistinguished perpetuation of a family throughout the centuries and the sudden bursting forth of character and capacity that began with our grandfather but as i go on in life day by day i become more of a bewildered child i cannot get used to this world to procreation to heredity to sight to hearing the commonest things are a burthen the prim obliterated polite face of life and the broad bawdy and orgiasticor mænadicfoundations form a spectacle to which no habit reconciles me and i could wish my days to be bound each to each by the same openmouthed wonder they are anyway and whether i wish it or not  i remember very well your attitude to life this conventional surface of it you had none of that curiosity for the social stage directions the trivial ficelles of the business it is simian but that is how the wild youth of man is captured you wouldnt imitate hence you kept freea wild dog outside the kenneland came dam near starving for your pains the key to the business is of course the belly difficult as it is to keep that in view in the zone of three miraculous meals a day in which we were brought up civilisation has become reflex with us you might think that hunger was the name of the best sauce but hunger to the cold solitary under a bush of a rainy night is the name of something quite different i defend civilisation for the thing it is for the thing it has come to be the standpoint of a real old tory my ideal would be the female clan but how can you turn these crowding dumb multitudes back they dont do anything because they do things write able articles stitch shoes dig from the purely simian impulse go and reason with monkeys  no i am right about jean lillie jean lillie our double greatgrandmother the daughter of david lillie sometime deacon of the wrights married first alan stevenson who died may 26 1774 at santt kittes of a fiver by whom she had robert stevenson born 8th june 1772 and second in may or june 1787 thomas smith a widower and already the father of our grandmother this improbable double connection always tends to confuse a student of the family thomas smith being doubly our greatgrandfather  i looked on the perpetuation of our honoured name with veneration my mother collared one of the photos of course the other is stuck up on my wall as the chief of our sept do you know any of the gaelicceltic sharps you might ask what the name means it puzzles me i find a mstein and a macstephane and our own greatgrandfather always called himself steenson though he wrote it stevenson there are at least three places called stevensonstevenson in cunningham stevenson in peebles and stevenson in haddington and it was not the celtic trick i understand to call places after people i am going to write to sir herbert maxwell about the name but you might find some one  get the anglosaxon heresy out of your head they superimposed their language they scarce modified the race only in berwickshire and roxburgh have they very largely affected the place names the scandinavians did much more to scotland than the angles the saxons didnt come  enough of this sham antiquarianism yes it is in the matter of the book82 of course that collaboration shows as for the manner it is superficially all mine in the sense that the last copy is all in my hand lloyd did not even put pen to paper in the paris scenes or the barbizon scene it was no good he wrote and often rewrote all the rest i had the best service from him on the character of nares you see we had been just meeting the man and his memory was full of the mans words and ways and lloyd is an impressionist pure and simple the great difficulty of collaboration is that you cant explain what you mean i know what kind of effect i mean a character to givewhat kind of tache he is to make but how am i to tell my collaborator in words hence it was necessary to say make him soandso and this was all right for nares and pinkerton and loudon dodd whom we both knew but for bellairs for instancea man with whom i passed ten minutes fifteen years agowhat was i to say and what could lloyd do i as a personal artist can begin a character with only a haze in my head but how if i have to translate the haze into words before i begin in our manner of collaboration which i think the only possiblei mean that of one person being responsible and giving the coup de pouce to every part of the work i was spared the obviously hopeless business of trying to explain to my collaborator what style i wished a passage to be treated in these are the times that illustrate to a man the inadequacy of spoken language nowto be just to written languagei can or could find a language for my every mood but how could i tell any one beforehand what this effect was to be which it would take every art that i possessed and hours and hours of deliberate labour and selection and rejection to produce these are the impossibilities of collaboration its immediate advantage is to focus two minds together on the stuff and to produce in consequence an extraordinarily greater richness of purview consideration and invention the hardest chapter of all was cross questions and crooked answers you would not believe what that cost us before it assumed the least unity and colour lloyd wrote it at least thrice and i at least five timesthis is from memory and was that last chapter worth the trouble it cost alas that i should ask the question two classes of menthe artist and the educationalistare sworn on soul and conscience not to ask it you get an ordinary grinning redheaded boy and you have to educate him faith supports you you give your valuable hours the boy does not seem to profit but that way your duty lies for which you are paid and you must persevere education has always seemed to me one of the few possible and dignified ways of life a sailor a shepherd a schoolmasterto a less degree a soldierand i dont know why upon my soul except as a sort of schoolmasters unofficial assistant and a kind of acrobat in tights an artist almost exhaust the category  if i had to begin againi know notsi jeunesse savait si vieillesse pouvait  i know not at alli believe i should try to honour sex more religiously the worst of our education is that christianity does not recognise and hallow sex it looks askance at it over its shoulder oppressed as it is by reminiscences of hermits and asiatic selftortures it is a terrible hiatus in our modern religions that they cannot see and make venerable that which they ought to see first and hallow most well it is so i cannot be wiser than my generation  but no doubt there is something great in the halfsuccess that has attended the effort of turning into an emotional religion bald conduct without any appeal or almost none to the figurative mysterious and constitutive facts of life not that conduct is not constitutive but dear its dreary on the whole conduct is better dealt with on the castiron gentleman and duty formula with as little fervour and poetry as possible stoical and short there is a new something or other in the wind which exercises me hugely anarchyi mean anarchism people who for pitys sake commit dastardly murders very basely die like saints and leave beautiful letters behind em did you see vaillant to his daughter it was the new testament over again people whose conduct is inexplicable to me and yet their spiritual life higher than that of most this is just what the early christians must have seemed to the romans is this then a new drive83 among the monkeys mind you bob if they go on being martyred a few years more the gross dull not unkindly bourgeois may get tired or ashamed or afraid of going on martyring and the anarchists come out at the top just like the early christians that is of course they will step into power as a personnel but god knows what they may believe when they come to do so it cant be stranger or more improbable than what christianity had come to be by the same time  your letter was easily read the pagination presented no difficulty and i read it with much edification and gusto to look back and to stereotype one bygone humourwhat a hopeless thing the mind runs ever in a thousand eddies like a river between cliffs you the ego are always spinning round in it east west north and south you are twenty years old and forty and five and the next moment you are freezing at an imaginary eighty you are never the plain fortyfour that you should be by dates the most philosophical language is the gaelic which has no present tenseand the most useless how then to choose some former age and stick there       r l s     to sir herbert maxwell        vailima samoa september 10 1894  dear sir herbert maxwelli am emboldened by reading your very interesting rhind lectures to put to you a question what is my name stevenson  i find it in the forms stevinetoun stevensoune stevensonne stenesone stewinsoune mstein and macstephane my family and as far as i can gather the majority of the inglorious clan hailed from the borders of cunningham and renfrew and the upper waters of the clyde in the barony of bothwell was the seat of the laird stevenson of stevenson but as of course you know there is a parish in cunningham and places in peebles and haddington bearing the same name  if you can at all help me you will render me a real service which i wish i could think of some manner to repaybelieve me yours truly       robert louis stevenson   psi should have added that i have perfect evidence before me that for some obscure reason stevenson was a favourite alias with the mgregors     to sidney colvin        vailima samoa october 6th 1894  my dear colvinwe have had quite an interesting month and mostly in consideration of that road which i think i told you was about to be made it was made without a hitch though i confess i was considerably surprised when they got through i wrote a speech to them sent it down to a missionary to be translated and invited the lot to a feast i thought a good deal of this feast the occasion was really interesting i wanted to pitch it in hot and i wished to have as many influential witnesses present as possible well as it drew towards the day i had nothing but refusals everybody supposed it was to be a political occasion that i had made a hive of rebels up here and was going to push for new hostilities  the amanuensis has been ill and after the above trial petered out i must return to my own lone waverley the captain refused telling me why and at last i had to beat up for people almost with prayers however i got a good lot as you will see by the accompanying newspaper report the road contained this inscription drawn up by the chiefs themselves    the road of gratitude  considering the great love of tusitala in his loving care of us in our distress in the prison we have therefore prepared a splendid gift it shall never be muddy it shall endure for ever this road that we have dug  this the newspaper reporter could not give not knowing any samoan the same reason explains his references to seumanutafas speech which was not long and was important for it was a speech of courtesy and forgiveness to his former enemies it was very much applauded secondly it was not poè it was mataafa dont confuse with mataafa who spoke for the prisoners otherwise it is extremely correct  i beg your pardon for so much upon my aboriginals even you must sympathise with me in this unheardof compliment and my having been able to deliver so severe a sermon with acceptance it remains a nice point of conscience what i should wish done in the matter i think this meeting its immediate results and the terms of what i said to them desirable to be known it will do a little justice to me who have not had too much justice done me at the same time to send this report to the papers is truly an act of selfadvertisement and i dislike the thought query in a man who has been so much calumniated is that not justifiable i do not know be my judge mankind is too complicated for me even myself do i wish to advertise i think i do god help me i have had hard times here as every man must have who mixes up with public business and i bemoan myself knowing that all i have done has been in the interest of peace and good government and having once delivered my mind i would like it i think to be made public but the other part of me regimbs84  i know i am at a climacteric for all men who live by their wits so i do not despair but the truth is i am pretty nearly useless at literature and i will ask you to spare st ives when it goes to you it is a sort of count robert of paris but i hope rather a dombey and son to be succeeded by our mutual friend and great expectations and a tale of two cities no toil has been spared over the ungrateful canvas and it will not come together and i must live and my family were it not for my health which made it impossible i could not find it in my heart to forgive myself that i did not stick to an honest commonplace trade when i was young which might have now supported me during these ill years but do not suppose me to be down in anything else only for the nonce my skill deserts me such as it is or was it was a very little dose of inspiration and a pretty little trick of style long lost improved by the most heroic industry so far i have managed to please the journalists but i am a fictitious article and have long known it i am read by journalists by my fellownovelists and by boys with these incipit et explicit my vogue good thing anyway for it seems to have sold the edition and i look forward confidently to an aftermath i do not think my health can be so hugely improved without some subsequent improvement in my brains though of course there is the possibility that literature is a morbid secretion and abhors health i do not think it is possible to have fewer illusions than i i sometimes wish i had more they are amusing but i cannot take myself seriously as an artist the limitations are so obvious i did take myself seriously as a workman of old but my practice has fallen off i am now an idler and cumberer of the ground it may be excused to me perhaps by twenty years of industry and illhealth which have taken the cream off the milk  as i was writing this last sentence i heard the strident rain drawing near across the forest and by the time i was come to the word cream it burst upon my roof and has since redoubled and roared upon it a very welcome change all smells of the good wet earth sweetly with a kind of highland touch the crystal rods of the shower as i look up have drawn their crisscross over everything and a gentle and very welcome coolness comes up around me in little draughts blessed draughts not chilling only equalising the temperature now the rain is off in this spot but i hear it roaring still in the nigh neighbourhoodand that moment i was driven from the verandah by random raindrops spitting at me through the japanese blinds these are not tears with which the page is spotted now the windows stream the roof reverberates it is good it answers something which is in my heart i know not what old memories of the wet moorland belike  well it has blown by again and i am in my place once more with an accompaniment of perpetual dripping on the verandahand very much inclined for a chat the exact subject i do not know it will be bitter at least and that is strange for my attitude is essentially not bitter but i have come into these days when a man sees above all the seamy side and i have dwelt some time in a small place where he has an opportunity of reading little motives that he would miss in the great world and indeed today i am almost ready to call the world an error because because i have not drugged myself with successful work and there are all kinds of trifles buzzing in my ear unfriendly trifles from the least to thewell to the pretty big all these that touch me are pretty big and yet none touch me in the least if rightly looked at except the one eternal burthen to go on making an income for my family that is rightly the root and ground of my ill the jingling tingling damned mint sauce is the trouble always and if i could find a place where i could lie down and give up for say two years and allow the sainted public to support me if it were a lunatic asylum wouldnt i go just but we cant have both extremes at once worse luck i should like to put my savings into a proprietarian investment and retire in the meanwhile into a communistic retreat which is doubledealing but you men with aries dont know how alas family weighs on a fellows mind  i hear the article in next weeks herald is to be a great affair and all the officials who came to me the other day are to be attacked this is the unpleasant side of being without a salary in public life i will leave any one to judge if my speech was well intended and calculated to do good it was even daringi assure you one of the chiefs looked like a fiend at my description of samoan warfare your warning was not needed we are all determined to keep the peace and to hold our peace i know my dear fellow how remote all this sounds kindly pardon your friend i have my life to live here these interests are for me immediate and if i do not write of them i might as soon not write at all there is the difficulty in a distant correspondence it is perhaps easy for me to enter into and understand your interests i own it is difficult for you but you must just wade through them for friendships sake and try to find tolerable what is vital for your friend i cannot forbear challenging you to it as to intellectual lists it is the proof of intelligence the proof of not being a barbarian to be able to enter into something outside of oneself something that does not touch ones next neighbour in the city omnibus  goodbye my lord may your race continue and you flourishyours ever       tusitala     to alison cunningham      for a fuller account of the roadmaking affair here mentioned see    pp 431 462       vailima october 8th 1894  my dear cummyso i hear you are ailing think shame to yoursell so you think there is nothing better to be done with time than that and be sure we can all do much ourselves to decide whether we are to be ill or well like a man on the gymnastic bars we are all pretty well as for me there is nothing the matter with me in the world beyond the disgusting circumstance that i am not so young as once i was lloyd has a gymnastic machine and practises upon it every morning for an hour he is beginning to be a kind of young samson austin grows fat and brown and gets on not so ill with his lessons and my mother is in great price we are having knockmedown weather for heat i never remember it so hot before and i fancy it means we are to have a hurricane again this year i think since we came here we have not had a single gale of wind the pacific is but a child to the north sea but when she does get excited and gets up and girds herself she can do something good we have had a very interesting business here i helped the chiefs who were in prison and when they were set free what should they do but offer to make a part of my road for me out of gratitude well i was ashamed to refuse and the trumps dug my road for me and put up this inscription on a board  considering the great love of his excellency tusitala in his loving care for us in our tribulation in the prison we have made this great gift it shall never be muddy it shall go on for ever this road that we have dug we had a great feast when it was done and i read them a kind of lecture which i dare say auntie will have and can let you see weel guid bye to ye and joy be wi ye i hae nae time to say mair they say im gettin fata factyour laddie with all love       robert louis stevenson     to james payn        vailima samoa nov 4 1894  my dear james payni am asked to relate to you a little incident of domestic life at vailima i had read your gleams of memory no 1 it then went to my wife to osbourne to the cousin that is within my gates and to my respected amanuensis mrs strong sunday approached in the course of the afternoon i was attracted to the great allthe winders is by vanderputty which upon entering i beheld a memorable scene the floor was bestrewn with the forms of midshipmen from the curaçoaboldly say a wilderness of gunroomand in the midst of this sat mrs strong throned on the sofa and reading aloud gleams of memory they had just come the length of your immortal definition of boyhood in the concrete and i had the pleasure to see the whole party dissolve under its influence with inextinguishable laughter i thought this was not half bad for arthritic gout depend upon it sir when i go into the arthritic gout business i shall be done with literature or at least with the funny business it is quite true i have my battlefields behind me i have done perhaps as much work as anybody else under the most deplorable conditions but two things fall to be noticed in the first place i never was in actual pain and in the second i was never funny ill tell you the worst day that i remember i had a hemorrhage and was not allowed to speak then induced by the devil or an errant doctor i was led to partake of that bowl which neither cheers nor inebriatesthe castoroil bowl now when castoroil goes right it is one thing but when it goes wrong it is another and it went wrong with me that day the waves of faintness and nausea succeeded each other for twelve hours and i do feel a legitimate pride in thinking that i stuck to my work all through and wrote a good deal of admiral guinea which i might just as well not have written for all the reward it ever brought me in spite of the barbarous bad conditions i think that is my great boast and it seems a little thing alongside of your gleams of memory illustrated by spasms of arthritic gout we really should have an order of merit in the trade of letters for valour scott would have had it pope too myself on the strength of that castoroil and james payn would be a knight commander the worst of it is though lang tells me you exhibit the courage of huish that not even an order can alleviate the wretched annoyance of the business i have always said that there is nothing like pain toothache dumbague arthritic gout it does not matter what you call it if the screw is put upon the nerves sufficiently strong there is nothing left in heaven or in earth that can interest the sufferer still even to this there is the consolation that it cannot last for ever either you will be relieved and have a good hour again before the sun goes down or else you will be liberated it is something after all although not much to think that you are leaving a brave example that other literary men love to remember as i am sure they will love to remember everything about youyour sweetness your brightness your helpfulness to all of us and in particular those one or two really adequate and noble papers which you have been privileged to write during these last yearswith the heartiest and kindest goodwill i remain yours ever       r l s     to sidney colvin      this was the last letter i received from my friend on the morning of    his death the following month he spoke of being behindhand with his    december letter and of his intention to write it next day       vailima november 1894  dear colvinsaturday there was a ball to the ship and on sunday gurr had a child to be baptized belle was to be godmother and had to be got down which was impossible as the jester euclid says however we had four men of very different heights take the poles of a sort of bier and carry her shoulder high down the road till we met a trap on the return journey on sunday they were led by austin playing  on a bugle and you have no idea how picturesque a business it was the four halfnaked bearers the cane lounge at that height from the ground and belle in black and pretty pale reclining very like a dead warrior of yore however she wasnt dead yet all the rest of the afternoon we hung about and had consultations about the baptism just as we went in to dinner i saw the moon rise accurately full looking five times greater than nature and the face that we try to decipher in its silver disk wearing an obliterated but benignant expression the ball followed bluejackets and officers danced indiscriminately after their pleasant fashion and belle who lay in the hotel verandah and held a sort of reception all night had her longest visit from one of the bluejackets her partner in the last ball about one on the sunday morning all was over and we went to bedi alas only to get up again my room being in the verandah where a certain solemnly absurd family conclave all drunk was being held until i suppose three by six i was awake and went out on the verandah on the east the dawn had broken cold and pink and rust colour and the marshes were all smoking whitely and blowing into the bay like smoke but on the west all was golden the street was empty and right over it hung the setting moon accurately round yellow as an apricot but slumberous with an effect of afternoon you would not believe if you had not seen it then followed a couple of hours on the verandah i would be glad to forget by seven x y had joined me as drunk as they make em as he sat and talked to me he smelt of the charnel house methought he looked so old he is one month my senior he spoke so silly his poor leg is again covered with boils which will spell death to him andenough that interview has made me a teetotaller o it is bad to grow old for me it is practically hell i do not like the consolations of age i was born a young man i have continued so and before i end a pantaloon a drivellerenough again but i dont enjoy getting elderly belle and i got home about three in the afternoon she having in the meantime renounced all that makes life worth living in the name of little miss gurr and i seriously reflecting on renouncing the kindly bowl in earnest presently after arrived the news of margery ide the cjs daughter being seriously ill alarmingly ill fanny wanted to go down it was a difficult choice she was not fit for it on the other hand and by all accounts the patient would die if she did not get better nursing so we made up our own minds and f and i set out about dusk came to the cjs in the middle of dinner and announced our errand i am glad to say the cj received her very willingly and i came home again leaving her behind where she was certainly much wanted  nov 4thyou ask about st ives no there is no burford bridge in it and no boney he is a squire of dames and there are petticoats in the story and damned bad ones too and it is of a tolerable length a hundred thousand i believe at least also since you are curious on the point st ives learned his english from a mr vicary an english lawyer a prisoner in france he must have had a fine gift of languages  things are going on here in their usual gently disheartening gait the treaty officials are both good fellows whom i cant help liking but who will never make a hand of samoayours ever       r l stevenson     to professor meiklejohn      congratulating an old friend of savile club days see vol xxiii p    263 on his sailor son       vailima samoa nov 6th 1894  my dear meiklejohngreeting this is but a word to say how much we felicitate ourselves on having made the acquaintance of hughie he is having a famous good chance on board the curaçoa which is the best ship i have ever seen and as for himself he is a most engaging boy of whom you may very well be proud and i have no mortal manner of doubt but what you are he comes up here very often where he is a great favourite with my ladies and sings me the melancholy airs of my native land with much acceptancy his name has recently become changed in vailima beginning with the courteous mr meiklejohn it shaded off into the familiar hughie and finally degenerated into the whitrett85 i hear good reports of him abroad and ashore and i scarce need to add my own testimony  hughie tells me you have gone into the publishing business whereat i was much shocked my own affairs with publishers are now in the most flourishing state owing to my ingenuity in leaving them to be dealt with by a scotch writer to the signet it has produced revolutions in the book trade and my banking account i tackled the whitrett severely on a grammar you had published which i had not seen and condemned out of hand and in the broadest lallan i even condescended on the part of that grammar which i thought to be the worst and condemned your presentation of the english verb unmercifully it occurs to me since you are a publisher that the least thing you could do would be to send me a copy of that grammar to correct my estimate but i fear i am talking too long to one of the enemy i begin to hear in fancy the voice of meiklejohn upraised in the savile club no quarter to publishers so i will ask you to present my compliments to mrs meiklejohn upon her son and to accept for yourself the warmest reminiscences of auld lang syneyours sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to lieutenant eeles        vailima samoa november 24 1894  my dear eelesthe hand as you will perceive and also the spelling is teuilas but the scrannel voice is what remains of tusitalas first of all for business when you go to london you are to charter a hansom cab and proceed to the museum it is particular fun to do this on sundays when the monument is shut up your cabman expostulates with you you persist the cabman drives up in front of the closed gates and says i told you so sir you breathe in the porters ears the mystic name of colvin and he immediately unfolds the iron barrier you drive in and doesnt your cabman think youre a swell a lord mayor is nothing to it colvins door is the only one in the eastern gable of the building send in your card to him with from r l s in the corner and the machinery will do the rest henry jamess address is 34 de vere mansions west i cannot remember where the place is i cannot even remember on which side of the park but its one of those big cromwell roadlooking deserted thoroughfares out west in kensington or bayswater or between the two and anyway colvin will be able to put you on the direct track for henry james i do not send formal introductions as i have taken the liberty to prepare both of them for seeing you already  hoskyn is staying with us  it is raining dismally the curaçoa track is hardly passable but it must be trod tomorrow by the degenerate feet of their successor the wallaroos i think it a very good account of these last that we dont think them either deformed or habitual criminalsthey seem to be a kindly lot  the doctor will give you all the gossip i have preferred in this letter to stick to the strictly solid and necessary with kind messages from all in the house to all in the wardroom all in the gunroom and may we dare to breathe it to him who walks abaft believe me my dear eeles yours ever       r l stevenson     to sir herbert maxwell        vailima samoa december 1 1894  dear sir herbertthank you very much for your long and kind letter i shall certainly take your advice and call my cousin the lyon king into council it is certainly a very interesting subject though i dont suppose it can possibly lead to anything this connection between the stevensons and mgregors alas your invitation is to me a mere derision my chances of visiting heaven are about as valid as my chances of visiting monreith though i should like well to see you shrunken into a cottage a literary lord of ravenscraig i suppose it is the inevitable doom of all those who dabble in scotch soil but really your fate is the more blessed i cannot conceive anything more grateful to me or more amusing or more picturesque than to live in a cottage outside your own parkwallswith renewed thanks believe me dear sir herbert yours very truly       robert louis stevenson     to andrew lang      the following refers of course to weir of hermiston the chief    character of which was studied from the traditions of lord braxfield    and on which stevenson was working at the full height of his powers    when death overtook him two days later       vailima samoa december 1 1894  my dear langfor the portrait of braxfield much thanks it is engraved from the same raeburn portrait that i saw in 76 or 77 with so extreme a gusto that i have ever since been braxfields humble servant and am now trying as you know to stick him into a novel alas one might as well try to stick in napoleon the picture shall be framed and hung up in my study not only as a memento of you but as a perpetual encouragement to do better with his lordship i have not yet received the transcripts they must be very interesting do you know i picked up the other day an old longmans where i found an article of yours that i had missed about christies i read it with great delight the year ends with us pretty much as it began among wars and rumours of wars and a vast and splendid exhibition of official incompetenceyours ever       r l stevenson     to edmund gosse      the next and last letter is to mr gosse dated also only two days    before the writers death it acknowledges the dedication to    tusitala of that gentlemans volume of poems in russet and    silver just received       vailima samoa december 1 1894  i am afraid my dear weg that this must be the result of bribery and corruption the volume to which the dedication stands as preface seems to me to stand alone in your work it is so natural so personal so sincere so articulate in substance and what you always were sure ofso rich in adornment  let me speak first of the dedication i thank you for it from the heart it is beautifully said beautifully and kindly felt and i should be a churl indeed if i were not grateful and an ass if i were not proud i remember when symonds dedicated a book to me i wrote and told him of the pang of gratified vanity with which i had read it the pang was present again but how much more sober and autumnallike your volume let me tell you a story or remind you of a story in the year of grace something or other anything between 76 and 78 i mentioned to you in my usual autobiographical and inconsiderate manner that i was hard up you said promptly that you had a balance at your bankers and could make it convenient to let me have a cheque and i accepted and got the moneyhow much was ittwenty or perhaps thirty pounds i know notbut it was a great convenience the same evening or the next day i fell in conversation in my usual autobiographical and  see above with a denizen of the savile club name now gone from me only his figure and a dim threequarter view of his face remaining to him i mentioned that you had given me a loan remarking easily that of course it didnt matter to you whereupon he read me a lecture and told me how it really stood with you financially he was pretty serious fearing as i could not help perceiving that i should take too light a view of the responsibility and the service i was always thought too lightthe irresponsible jesteryou remember o quantum mutatus ab illo if i remember rightly the money was repaid before the end of the weekor to be more exact and a trifle pedantic the sennightbut the service has never been forgotten and i send you back this piece of ancient history consule planco as a salute for your dedication and propose that we should drink the health of the nameless one who opened my eyes as to the true nature of what you did for me on that occasion  but here comes my amanuensis so well get on more swimmingly now you will understand perhaps that what so particularly pleased me in the new volume what seems to me to have so personal and original a note are the middleaged pieces in the beginning the whole of them i may say though i must own an especial liking to    i yearn not for the fighting fate     that holds and hath achieved   i live to watch and meditate     and dreamand be deceived  you take the change gallantly not i i must confess it is all very well to talk of renunciation and of course it has to be done but for my part give me a roaring toothache i do like to be deceived and to dream but i have very little use for either watching or meditation i was not born for age and curiously enough i seem to see a contrary drift in my work from that which is so remarkable in yours you are going on sedately travelling through your ages decently changing with the years to the proper tune and here am i quite out of my true course and with nothing in my foolish elderly head but lovestories this must repose upon some curious distinction of temperaments i gather from a phrase boldly autobiographical that you arewell not precisely growing thin can that be the difference  it is rather funny that this matter should come up just now as i am at present engaged in treating a severe case of middle age in one of my storiesthe justiceclerk the case is that of a woman and i think that i am doing her justice you will be interested i believe to see the difference in our treatments secreta vitæ comes nearer to the case of my poor kirstie come to think of it gosse i believe the main distinction is that you have a family growing up around you and i am a childless rather bitter very cleareyed blighted youth i have in fact lost the path that makes it easy and natural for you to descend the hill i am going at it straight and where i have to go down it is a precipice  i must not forget to give you a word of thanks for an english village it reminds me strongly of keats which is enough to say and i was particularly pleased with the petulant sincerity of the concluding sentiment  well my dear gosse heres wishing you all health and prosperity as well as to the mistress and the bairns may you live long since it seems as if you would continue to enjoy life may you write many more books as good as this oneonly theres one thing impossible you can never write another dedication that can give the same pleasure to the vanished       tusitala   footnotes    74 this question is with a view to the adventures of the hero in     st ives who according to stevensons original plan was to have     been picked up from his foundered balloon by an american privateer    75 as to admire the black arrow    76 the suppressed first part of the amateur emigrant written in     san francisco in 1879 which it was proposed now to condense and to     some extent recast for the edinburgh edition    77 word omitted in ms    78 i may be allowed to quote the following sentence from a letter     of this gentleman written when the news of our friends death     reached englandso great was his power of winning love that     though i knew him for less than a week i could have borne the loss     of many a more intimate friend with less sorrow than stevensons     when i saw him last easter there was no suggestion of failure of     strength after all i had heard of his delicacy i was astonished at     his vigour he was up at five and at work soon after and at eleven     oclock at night he was dancing on the floor of the big room while i     played scotch and irish reels on the rickety piano he would talk to     me for hours of home and old friends but with a wonderful     cheerfulness knowing himself banished from them for life and yet     brought close to them by love i confidently counted on his living     he took keen interest in my own poor work and it was one of my     ambitions to send him a book some day which would better deserve his     attention    79 sentimental tommy whose chief likeness to r l s was meant     to be in the literary temperament and passion for the mot propre    80 a proposed frontispiece for one of the volumes of the edinburgh     edition    81 sic query least    82 of the wrecker    83 trieb impulse    84 it seemed an obvious duty to publish the speech in question     through the english press as the best proof both of stevensons     wise and understanding methods of dealing with his native friends     and of the affection and authority which he enjoyed among them i     have reprinted it as a necessary supplement to this letter in     appendix ii at end of the present volume    85 whitrett or whitrack is scots for a weasel why applied to mr     meiklejohn i know not     appendix i  account of the death and burial of r l stevenson by lloyd osbourne   he wrote hard all that morning of the last day his halffinished book hermiston he judged the best he had ever written and the sense of successful effort made him buoyant and happy as nothing else could in the afternoon the mail fell to be answered not business correspondencefor this was left till laterbut replies to the long kindly letters of distant friends received but two days since and still bright in memory  at sunset he came downstairs rallied his wife about the forebodings she could not shake off talked of a lecturing tour to america that he was eager to make as he was now so well and played a game at cards with her to drive away her melancholy he said he was hungry begged her assistance to help him make a salad for the evening meal and to enhance the little feast he brought up a bottle of old burgundy from the cellar he was helping his wife on the verandah and gaily talking when suddenly he put both hands to his head and cried out whats that then he asked quickly do i look strange even as he did so he fell on his knees beside her he was helped into the great hall between his wife and his bodyservant sosimo losing consciousness instantly as he lay back in the armchair that had once been his grandfathers little time was lost in bringing the doctorsanderson of the manofwar and his friend dr funk they looked at him and shook their heads they laboured strenuously and left nothing undone but he had passed the bounds of human skill  the dying man lay back in the chair breathing heavily his family about him frenzied with grief as they realised all hope was past the dozen and more samoans that formed part of the little clan of which he was chief sat in a wide semicircle on the floor their reverent troubled sorrowstricken faces all fixed upon their dying master some knelt on one knee to be instantly ready for any command that might be laid upon them a narrow bed was brought into the centre of the room the master was gently laid upon it his head supported by a rest the gift of shelleys son slower and slower grew his respiration wider the interval between the long deep breaths the rev mr clarke was now come an old and valued friend he knelt and prayed as the life ebbed away  he died at ten minutes past eight on monday evening the 3rd of december in the fortyfifth year of his age  the great union jack that flew over the house was hauled down and laid over the body fit shroud for a loyal scotsman he lay in the hall which was ever his pride where he had passed the gayest and most delightful hours of his life a noble room with open stairway and mullioned windows in it were the treasures of his faroff scottish home the old carved furniture the paintings and busts that had been in his fathers house before him the samoans passed in procession beside his bed kneeling and kissing his hand each in turn before taking their places for the long night watch beside him no entreaty could induce them to retire to rest themselves for the painful and arduous duties of the morrow it would show little love for tusitala they said if they did not spend their last night beside him mournful and silent they sat in deep dejection poor simple loyal folk fulfilling the duty they owed their chief  a messenger was despatched to the few chiefs connected with the family to announce the tidings and bid them assemble their men on the morrow for the work there was to do  sosimo asked on behalf of the roman catholics that they might be allowed to recite the prayers for the dead till midnight the solemn chants continued the prolonged sonorous prayers of the church of rome in commingled latin and samoan later still a chief arrived with his retainers bringing a precious mat to wrap about the dead  he too knelt and kissed the hand of tusitala and took his place amid the sleepless watchers another arrived with a fine mat a man of higher rank whose incipient consumption had often troubled the master  talofa tusitala he said as he drew nigh and took a long mournful look at the face he knew so well when later on he was momentarily required on some business of the morrow he bowed reverently before retiring tofa tusitala he said sleep tusitala  the morning of the 4th of december broke cool and sunny a beautiful day rare at this season of the year more fine mats were brought until the union jack lay nigh concealed beneath them among the newcomers was an old mataafa chief one of the builders of the road of the loving hearts a man who had spent many days in prison for participation in the rebellion i am only a poor samoan and ignorant said he as he crouched beside the body others are rich and can give tusitala the parting presents of rich fine mats i am poor and can give nothing this last day he receives his friends yet i am not afraid to come and look the last time in my friends face never to see him more till we meet with god behold tusitala is dead mataafa is also dead to us these two great friends have been taken by god when mataafa was taken who was our support but tusitala we were in prison and he cared for us we were sick and he made us well we were hungry and he fed us the day was no longer than his kindness you are great people and full of love yet who among you is so great as tusitala what is your love to his love our clan was mataafas clan for whom i speak this day therein was tusitala also we mourn them both  a meeting of chiefs was held to apportion the work and divide the men into parties forty were sent with knives and axes to cut a path up the steep face of the mountain and the writer himself led another party to the summitmen chosen from the immediate familyto dig the grave on a spot where it was mr stevensons wish that he should lie nothing more picturesque can be imagined than the narrow ledge that forms the summit of vaea a place no wider than a room and flat as a table on either side the land descends precipitously in front lies the vast ocean and the surfswept reefs to the right and left green mountains rise densely covered with the primeval forest two hundred years ago the eyes of another man turned towards that same peak of vaea as the spot that should ultimately receive his warworn body soalu a famous chief  all the morning samoans were arriving with flowers few of these were white for they have not learned our foreign custom and the room glowed with the many colours there were no strangers on that day no acquaintances those only were called who would deeply feel the loss at one oclock a body of powerful samoans bore away the coffin hid beneath a tattered red ensign that had flown above his vessel in many a corner of the south seas a path so steep and rugged taxed their strength to the utmost for not only was the journey difficult in itself but extreme care was requisite to carry the coffin shoulderhigh  half an hour later the rest of his friends followed it was a formidable ascent and tried them hard nineteen europeans and some sixty samoans reached the summit after a short rest the rev w e clarke read the burial service of the church of england interposing a prayer that mr stevenson had written and had read aloud to his family only the evening before his death     we beseech thee lord to behold us with favour folk of many    families and nations gathered together in the peace of this roof    weak men and women subsisting under the covert of thy patience     be patient still suffer us yet a while longerwith our broken    purposes of good and our idle endeavours against evilsuffer us a    while longer to endure and if it may be help us to do better    bless to us our extraordinary mercies if the day come when these    must be taken have us play the man under affliction be with our    friends be with ourselves go with each of us to rest if any awake    temper to them the dark hours of watching and when the day returns    to us our sun and comforter call us up with morning faces and with    morning heartseager to laboureager to be happy if happiness    shall be our portionand if the day be marked for sorrow strong to    endure it     we thank thee and praise thee and in the words of him to whom this    day is sacred close our oblation     appendix ii  address of r l stevenson to the chiefs on the opening of the road of gratitude october 1894   mr stevenson said we are met together today to celebrate an event and to do honour to certain chiefs my friendslelei mataafa salevao poè teleso tupuola lotofaga tupuola amaile muliaiga ifopo and fatialofa you are all aware in some degree of what has happened you know these chiefs to have been prisoners you perhaps know that during the term of their confinement i had it in my power to do them certain favours one thing some of you cannot know that they were immediately repaid by answering attentions they were liberated by the new administration by the king and the chief justice and the taitsifono who are here amongst us today and to whom we all desire to tender our renewed and perpetual gratitude for that favour as soon as they were free menowing no man anythinginstead of going home to their own places and families they came to me they offered to do this work for me as a free gift without hire without supplies and i was tempted at first to refuse their offer i knew the country to be poor i knew famine threatening i knew their families long disorganised for want of supervision yet i accepted because i thought the lesson of that road might be more useful to samoa than a thousand breadfruit trees and because to myself it was an exquisite pleasure to receive that which was so handsomely offered it is now done you have trod it today in coming hither it has been made for me by chiefs some of them old some sick all newly delivered from a harassing confinement and in spite of weather unusually hot and insalubrious i have seen these chiefs labour valiantly with their own hands upon the work and i have set up over it now that it is finished the name of the road of gratitude the road of loving hearts and the names of those that built it in perpetuam memoriam we say and speak idly at least so long as my own life shall be spared it shall be here perpetuated partly for my pleasure and in my gratitude partly for others to continually publish the lesson of this road  addressing himself to the chiefs mr stevenson then said  i will tell you chiefs that when i saw you working on that road my heart grew warm not with gratitude only but with hope it seemed to me that i read the promise of something good for samoa it seemed to me as i looked at you that you were a company of warriors in a battle fighting for the defence of our common country against all aggression for there is a time to fight and a time to dig you samoans may fight you may conquer twenty times and thirty times and all will be in vain there is but one way to defend samoa hear it before it is too late it is to make roads and gardens and care for your trees and sell their produce wisely and in one word to occupy and use your country if you do not others will  the speaker then referred to the parable of the talents matt xxv 1430 and continuing impressively asked what are you doing with your talent samoa your three talents savaii upolu and tutuila have you buried it in a napkin not upolu at least you have rather given it out to be trodden under feet of swine and the swine cut down food trees and burn houses according to the nature of swine or of that much worse animal foolish man acting according to his folly thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not and gather where i have not strawed but god has both sown and strawed for you here in samoa he has given you a rich soil a splendid sun copious rain all is ready to your hand half done and i repeat to you that thing which is sure if you do not occupy and use your country others will it will not continue to be yours or your childrens if you occupy it for nothing you and your children will in that case be cast out into outer darkness where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for that is the law of god which passeth not away i who speak to you have seen these things i have seen them with my eyesthese judgments of god i have seen them in ireland and i have seen them in the mountains of my own countryscotlandand my heart was sad these were a fine people in the pastbrave gay faithful and very much like samoans except in one particular that they were much wiser and better at that business of fighting of which you think so much but the time came to them as it now comes to you and it did not find them ready the messenger came into their villages and they did not know him they were told as you are told to use and occupy their country and they would not hear and now you may go through great tracts of the land and scarce meet a man or a smoking house and see nothing but sheep feeding the other people that i tell you of have come upon them like a foe in the night and these are the other peoples sheep who browse upon the foundation of their houses to come nearer and i have seen this judgment in oahu also i have ridden there the whole day along the coast of an island hour after hour went by and i saw the face of no living man except that of the guide who rode with me all along that desolate coast in one bay after another we saw still standing the churches that have been built by the hawaiians of old there must have been many hundreds many thousands dwelling there in old times and worshipping god in these now empty churches for today they were empty the doors were closed the villages had disappeared the people were dead and gone only the church stood on like a tombstone over a grave in the midst of the white mens sugar fields the other people had come and used that country and the hawaiians who occupied it for nothing had been swept away where is weeping and gnashing of teeth  i do not speak of this lightly because i love samoa and her people i love the land i have chosen it to be my home while i live and my grave after i am dead and i love the people and have chosen them to be my people to live and die with and i see that the day is come now of the great battle of the great and the last opportunity by which it shall be decided whether you are to pass away like these other races of which i have been speaking or to stand fast and have your children living on and honouring your memory in the land you received of your fathers  the land commission and the chief justice will soon have ended their labours much of your land will be restored to you to do what you can with now is the time the messenger is come into your villages to summon you the man is come with the measuring rod the fire is lighted in which you shall be tried whether you are gold or dross now is the time for the true champions of samoa to stand forth and who is the true champion of samoa it is not the man who blackens his face and cuts down trees and kills pigs and wounded men it is the man who makes roads who plants food trees who gathers harvests and is a profitable servant before the lord using and improving that great talent that has been given him in trust that is the brave soldier that is the true champion because all things in a country hang together like the links of the anchor cable one by another but the anchor itself is industry  there is a friend of most of us who is far away not to be forgotten where i am where tupuola is where poè lelei mataafa solevao poè teleso tupuola lotofaga tupuolo amaile muliaiga ifopo fatialofa lemusu are he knew what i am telling you no man better he saw the day was come when samoa had to walk in a new path and to be defended not only with guns and blackened faces and the noise of men shouting but by digging and planting reaping and sowing when he was still here amongst us he busied himself planting cacao he was anxious and eager about agriculture and commerce and spoke and wrote continually so that when we turn our minds to the same matters we may tell ourselves that we are still obeying mataafa ua tautala mai pea o ia ua mamao  i know that i do not speak to idle or foolish hearers i speak to those who are not too proud to work for gratitude chiefs you have worked for tusitala and he thanks you from his heart in this i could wish you could be an example to all samoai wish every chief in these islands would turn to and work and build roads and sow fields and plant food trees and educate his children and improve his talentsnot for love of tusitala but for the love of his brothers and his children and the whole body of generations yet unborn  chiefs on this road that you have made many feet shall follow the romans were the bravest and greatest of people mighty men of their hands glorious fighters and conquerors to this day in europe you may go through parts of the country where all is marsh and bush and perhaps after struggling through a thicket you shall come forth upon an ancient road solid and useful as the day it was made you shall see men and women bearing their burdens along that even way and you may tell yourself that it was built for them perhaps fifteen hundred years beforeperhaps before the coming of christby the romans and the people still remember and bless them for that convenience and say to one another that as the romans were the bravest men to fight so they were the best at building roads  chiefs our road is not built to last a thousand years yet in a sense it is when a road is once built it is a strange thing how it collects traffic how every year as it goes on more and more people are found to walk thereon and others are raised up to repair and perpetuate it and keep it alive so that perhaps even this road of ours may from reparation to reparation continue to exist and be useful hundreds and hundreds of years after we are mingled in the dust and it is my hope that our faraway descendants may remember and bless those who laboured for them today     index to the letters
