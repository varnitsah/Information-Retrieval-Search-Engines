lived an old man who was called the beeman because his whole time was spent in the company of bees he lived in a small hut which was nothing more than an immense beehive for these little creatures had built their honeycombs in every corner of the one room it contained on the shelves under the little table all about the rough bench on which the old man sat and even about the headboard and along the sides of his low bed all day the air of the room was thick with buzzing insects but this did not interfere in any way with the old beeman who walked in among them ate his meals and went to sleep without the slightest fear of being stung he had lived with the bees so long they had become so accustomed to him and his skin was so tough and hard that the bees no more thought of stinging him than they would of stinging a tree or a stone a swarm of bees had made their hive in a pocket of his old leathern doublet and when he put on this coat to take one of his long walks in the forest in search of wild bees nests he was very glad to have this hive with him for if he did not find any wild honey he would put his hand in his pocket and take out a piece of a comb for a luncheon the bees in his pocket worked very industriously and he was always certain of having something to eat with him wherever he went he lived principally upon honey and when he needed bread or meat he carried some fine combs to a village not far away and bartered them for other food he was ugly untidy shrivelled and brown he was poor and the bees seemed to be his only friends but for all that he was happy and contented he had all the honey he wanted and his bees whom he considered the best company in the world were as friendly and sociable as they could be and seemed to increase in number every day  one day there stopped at the hut of the beeman a junior sorcerer this young person who was a student of magic necromancy and the kindred arts was much interested in the beeman whom he had frequently noticed in his wanderings and he considered him an admirable subject for study he had got a great deal of useful practice by endeavoring to find out by the various rules and laws of sorcery exactly why the old beeman did not happen to be something that he was not and why he was what he happened to be he had studied a long time at this matter and had found out something  do you know he said when the beeman came out of his hut that you have been transformed  what do you mean by that said the other much surprised  you have surely heard of animals and human beings who have been magically transformed into different kinds of creatures  yes i have heard of these things said the beeman but what have i been transformed from  that is more than i know said the junior sorcerer but one thing is certainyou ought to be changed back if you will find out what you have been transformed from i will see that you are made all right again nothing would please me better than to attend to such a case  and having a great many things to study and investigate the junior sorcerer went his way  this information greatly disturbed the mind of the beeman if he had been changed from something else he ought to be that other thing whatever it was he ran after the young man and overtook him  if you know kind sir he said that i have been transformed you surely are able to tell me what it is that i was  no said the junior sorcerer my studies have not proceeded far enough for that when i become a senior i can tell you all about it but in the meantime it will be well for you to try to discover for yourself your original form and when you have done that i will get some of the learned masters of my art to restore you to it it will be easy enough to do that but you could not expect them to take the time and trouble to find out what it was  and with these words he hurried away and was soon lost to view  greatly disquieted the beeman retraced his steps and went to his hut never before had he heard any thing which had so troubled him  i wonder what i was transformed from he thought seating himself on his rough bench could it have been a giant or a powerful prince or some gorgeous being whom the magicians or the fairies wished to punish it may be that i was a dog or a horse or perhaps a fiery dragon or a horrid snake i hope it was not one of these but whatever it was every one has certainly a right to his original form and i am resolved to find out mine i will start early tomorrow morning and i am sorry now that i have not more pockets to my old doublet so that i might carry more bees and more honey for my journey  he spent the rest of the day in making a hive of twigs and straw and having transferred to this a number of honeycombs and a colony of bees which had just swarmed he rose before sunrise the next day and having put on his leathern doublet and having bound his new hive to his back he set forth on his quest the bees who were to accompany him buzzing around him like a cloud  as the beeman passed through the little village the people greatly wondered at his queer appearance with the hive upon his back the beeman is going on a long expedition this time they said but no one imagined the strange business on which he was bent about noon he sat down under a tree near a beautiful meadow covered with blossoms and ate a little honey then he untied his hive and stretched himself out on the grass to rest as he gazed upon his bees hovering about him some going out to the blossoms in the sunshine and some returning laden with the sweet pollen he said to himself they know just what they have to do and they do it but alas for me i know not what i may have to do and yet whatever it may be i am determined to do it in some way or other i will find out what was my original form and then i will have myself changed back to it  and now the thought came to him that perhaps his original form might have been something very disagreeable or even horrid  but it does not matter he said sturdily whatever i was that shall i be again it is not right for any one to retain a form which does not properly belong to him i have no doubt i shall discover my original form in the same way that i find the trees in which the wild bees hive when i first catch sight of a beetree i am drawn towards it i know not how something says to me that is what you are looking for in the same way i believe that i shall find my original form when i see it i shall be drawn towards it something will say to me that is it  when the beeman was rested he started off again and in about an hour he entered a fair domain around him were beautiful lawns grand trees and lovely gardens while at a little distance stood the stately palace of the lord of the domain richly dressed people were walking about or sitting in the shade of the trees and arbors splendidly caparisoned horses were waiting for their riders and everywhere were seen signs of opulence and gayety  i think said the beeman to himself that i should like to stop here for a time if it should happen that i was originally like any of these happy creatures it would please me much  he untied his hive and hid it behind some bushes and taking off his old doublet laid that beside it it would not do to have his bees flying about him if he wished to go among the inhabitants of this fair domain  for two days the beeman wandered about the palace and its grounds avoiding notice as much as possible but looking at every thing he saw handsome men and lovely ladies the finest horses dogs and cattle that were ever known beautiful birds in cages and fishes in crystal globes and it seemed to him that the best of all living things were here collected  at the close of the second day the beeman said to himself there is one being here toward whom i feel very much drawn and that is the lord of the domain i cannot feel certain that i was once like him but it would be a very fine thing if it were so and it seems impossible for me to be drawn toward any other being in the domain when i look upon him so handsome rich and powerful but i must observe him more closely and feel more sure of the matter before applying to the sorcerers to change me back into a lord of a fair domain  the next morning the beeman saw the lord of the domain walking in his gardens he slipped along the shady paths and followed him so as to observe him closely and find out if he were really drawn toward this noble and handsome being the lord of the domain walked on for some time not noticing that the beeman was behind him but suddenly turning he saw the little old man  what are you doing here you vile beggar he cried and he gave him a kick that sent him into some bushes that grew by the side of the path  the beeman scrambled to his feet and ran as fast as he could to the place where he had hidden his hive and his old doublet  if i am certain of any thing he thought it is that i was never a person who would kick a poor old man i will leave this place i was transformed from nothing that i see here  he now travelled for a day or two longer and then he came to a great black mountain near the bottom of which was an opening like the mouth of a cave  this mountain he had heard was filled with caverns and underground passages which were the abodes of dragons evil spirits horrid creatures of all kinds  ah me said the beeman with a sigh i suppose i ought to visit this place if i am going to do this thing properly i should look on all sides of the subject and i may have been one of those horrid creatures myself  thereupon he went to the mountain and as he approached the opening of the passage which led into its inmost recesses he saw sitting upon the ground and leaning his back against a tree a languid youth  goodday said this individual when he saw the beeman are you going inside  yes said the beeman that is what i intend to do  then said the languid youth slowly rising to his feet i think i will go with you i was told that if i went in there i should get my energies toned up and they need it very much but i did not feel equal to entering by myself and i thought i would wait until some one came along i am very glad to see you and we will go in together  so the two went into the cave and they had proceeded but a short distance when they met a very little creature whom it was easy to recognize as a very imp he was about two feet high and resembled in color a freshly polished pair of boots he was extremely lively and active and came bounding toward them  what did you two people come here for he asked  i came said the languid youth to have my energies toned up  you have come to the right place said the very imp we will tone you up and what does that old beeman want  he has been transformed from something and wants to find out what it is he thinks he may have been one of the things in here  i should not wonder if that were so said the very imp rolling his head on one side and eying the beeman with a critical gaze  all right said the very imp he can go around and pick out his previous existence we have here all sorts of vile creepers crawlers hissers and snorters i suppose he thinks any thing will be better than a beeman  it is not because i want to be better than i am said the beeman that i started out on this search i have simply an honest desire to become what i originally was  oh that is it is it said the other there is an idiotic mooncalf here with a clam head which must be just like what you used to be  nonsense said the beeman you have not the least idea what an honest purpose is i shall go about and see for myself  go ahead said the very imp and i will attend to this fellow who wants to be toned up so saying he joined the languid youth  look here said that individual regarding him with interest do you black and shine yourself every morning  no said the other it is waterproof varnish you want to be invigorated dont you well i will tell you a splendid way to begin you see that beeman has put down his hive and his coat with the bees in it just wait till he gets out of sight and then catch a lot of those bees and squeeze them flat if you spread them on a sticky rag and make a plaster and put it on the small of your back it will invigorate you like every thing especially if some of the bees are not quite dead  yes said the languid youth looking at him with his mild eyes but if i had energy enough to catch a bee i would be satisfied suppose you catch a lot for me  the subject is changed said the very imp we are now about to visit the spacious chamber of the king of the snapdragons  that is a flower said the languid youth  you will find him a gay old blossom said the other when he has chased you round his room and has blown sparks at you and has snorted and howled and cracked his tail and snapped his jaws like a pair of anvils your energies will be toned up higher than ever before in your life  no doubt of it said the languid youth but i think i will begin with something a little milder  well then said other there is a flattailed demon of the gorge in here he is generally asleep and if you say so you can slip into the farthest corner of his cave and ill solder his tail to the opposite wall then he will rage and roar but he cant get at you for he doesnt reach all the way across his cave i have measured him it will tone you up wonderfully to sit there and watch him  very likely said the languid youth but i would rather stay outside and let you go up in the corner the performance in that way will be more interesting to me  you are dreadfully hard to please said the very imp i have offered them to you loose and i have offered them fastened to a wall and now the best thing i can do is to give you a chance at one of them that cant move at all it is the ghastly griffin and is enchanted he cant stir so much as the tip of his whiskers for a thousand years you can go to his cave and examine him just as if he were stuffed and then you can sit on his back and think how it would be if you should live to be a thousand years old and he should wake up while you are sitting there it would be easy to imagine a lot of horrible things he would do to you when you look at his open mouth with its awful fangs his dreadful claws and his horrible wings all covered with spikes  i think that might suit me said the languid youth i would much rather imagine the exercises of these monsters than to see them really going on  come on then said the very imp and he led the way to the cave of the ghastly griffin  the beeman went by himself through a great part of the mountain and looked into many of its gloomy caves and recesses recoiling in horror from most of the dreadful monsters who met his eyes while he was wandering about an awful roar was heard resounding through the passages of the mountain and soon there came flapping along an enormous dragon with body black as night and wings and tail of fiery red in his great foreclaws he bore a little baby  horrible exclaimed the beeman he is taking that little creature to his cave to devour it  he saw the dragon enter a cave not far away and following looked in the dragon was crouched upon the ground with the little baby lying before him it did not seem to be hurt but was frightened and crying the monster was looking upon it with delight as if he intended to make a dainty meal of it as soon as his appetite should be a little stronger  it is too bad thought the beeman somebody ought to do something and turning around he ran away as fast as he could  he ran through various passages until he came to the spot where he had left his beehive picking it up he hurried back carrying the hive in his two hands before him when he reached the cave of the dragon he looked in and saw the monster still crouched over the weeping child without a moments hesitation the beeman rushed into the cave and threw his hive straight into the face of the dragon the bees enraged by the shock rushed out in an angry crowd and immediately fell upon the head mouth eyes and nose of the dragon the great monster astounded by this sudden attack and driven almost wild by the numberless stings of the bees sprang back to the farthest portion of his cave still followed by his relentless enemies at whom he flapped wildly with his great wings and struck with his paws while the dragon was thus engaged with the bees the beeman rushed forward and seizing the child he hurried away he did not stop to pick up his doublet but kept on until he reached the entrance of the caves there he saw the very imp hopping along on one leg and rubbing his back and shoulders with his hands and stopped to inquire what was the matter and what had become of the languid youth  he is no kind of a fellow said the very imp he disappointed me dreadfully i took him up to the ghastly griffin and told him the thing was enchanted and that he might sit on its back and think about what it could do if it was awake and when he came near it the wretched creature opened its eyes and raised its head and then you ought to have seen how mad that simpleton was he made a dash at me and seized me by the ears he kicked and beat me till i can scarcely move  his energies must have been toned up a good deal said the beeman  toned up i should say so cried the other i raised a howl and a scissorjawed clipper came out of his hole and got after him but that lazy fool ran so fast that he could not be caught  the beeman now ran on and soon overtook the languid youth  you need not be in a hurry now said the latter for the rules of this institution dont allow the creatures inside to come out of this opening or to hang around it if they did they would frighten away visitors they go in and out of holes in the upper part of the mountain  the two proceeded on their way  what are you going to do with that baby said the languid youth  i shall carry it along with me said the beeman as i go on with my search and perhaps i may find its mother if i do not i shall give it to somebody in that little village yonder any thing would be better than leaving it to be devoured by that horrid dragon  let me carry it i feel quite strong enough now to carry a baby  thank you said the beeman but i can take it myself i like to carry something and i have now neither my hive nor my doublet  it is very well that you had to leave them behind said the youth for the bees would have stung the baby  my bees never sting babies said the other  they probably never had a chance remarked his companion  they soon entered the village and after walking a short distance the youth exclaimed do you see that woman over there sitting at the door of her house she has beautiful hair and she is tearing it all to pieces she should not be allowed to do that  no said the beeman her friends should tie her hands  perhaps she is the mother of this child said the youth and if you give it to her she will no longer think of tearing her hair  but said the beeman you dont really think this is her child  suppose you go over and see said the other  the beeman hesitated a moment and then he walked toward the woman hearing him coming she raised her head and when she saw the child she rushed towards it snatched it into her arms and screaming with joy she covered it with kisses then with happy tears she begged to know the story of the rescue of her child whom she never expected to see again and she loaded the beeman with thanks and blessings the friends and neighbors gathered around and there was great rejoicing the mother urged the beeman and the youth to stay with her and rest and refresh themselves which they were glad to do as they were tired and hungry  they remained at the cottage all night and in the afternoon of the next day the beeman said to the youth it may seem an odd thing to you but never in all my life have i felt myself drawn towards any living being as i am drawn towards this baby therefore i believe that i have been transformed from a baby  good cried the youth it is my opinion that you have hit the truth and now would you like to be changed back to your original form  indeed i would said the beeman i have the strongest yearning to be what i originally was  the youth who had now lost every trace of languid feeling took a great interest in the matter and early the next morning started off to inform the junior sorcerer that the beeman had discovered what he had been transformed from and desired to be changed back to it  the junior sorcerer and his learned masters were filled with enthusiasm when they heard this report and they at once set out for the mothers cottage and there by magic arts the beeman was changed back into a baby the mother was so grateful for what the beeman had done for her that she agreed to take charge of this baby and to bring it up as her own  it will be a grand thing for him said the junior sorcerer and i am glad that i studied his case he will now have a fresh start in life and will have a chance to become something better than a miserable old man living in a wretched hut with no friends or companions but buzzing bees  the junior sorcerer and his masters then returned to their homes happy in the success of their great performance and the youth went back to his home anxious to begin a life of activity and energy  years and years afterward when the junior sorcerer had become a senior and was very old indeed he passed through the country of orn and noticed a small hut about which swarms of bees were flying he approached it and looking in at the door he saw an old man in a leathern doublet sitting at a table eating honey by his magic art he knew this was the baby which had been transformed from the beeman  upon my word exclaimed the sorcerer he has grown into the same thing again       the griffin and the minor canon                                       over the great door of an old old church which stood in a quiet town of a faraway land there was carved in stone the figure of a large griffin the oldtime sculptor had done his work with great care but the image he had made was not a pleasant one to look at it had a large head with enormous open mouth and savage teeth from its back arose great wings armed with sharp hooks and prongs it had stout legs in front with projecting claws but there were no legs behindthe body running out into a long and powerful tail finished off at the end with a barbed point this tail was coiled up under him the end sticking up just back of his wings  the sculptor or the people who had ordered this stone figure had evidently been very much pleased with it for little copies of it also in stone had been placed here and there along the sides of the church not very far from the ground so that people could easily look at them and ponder on their curious forms there were a great many other sculptures on the outside of this churchsaints martyrs grotesque heads of men beasts and birds as well as those of other creatures which cannot be named because nobody knows exactly what they were but none were so curious and interesting as the great griffin over the door and the little griffins on the sides of the church  a long long distance from the town in the midst of dreadful wilds scarcely known to man there dwelt the griffin whose image had been put up over the churchdoor in some way or other the oldtime sculptor had seen him and afterward to the best of his memory had copied his figure in stone the griffin had never known this until hundreds of years afterward he heard from a bird from a wild animal or in some manner which it is not now easy to find out that there was a likeness of him on the old church in the distant town now this griffin had no idea how he looked he had never seen a mirror and the streams where he lived were so turbulent and violent that a quiet piece of water which would reflect the image of any thing looking into it could not be found being as far as could be ascertained the very last of his race he had never seen another griffin therefore it was that when he heard of this stone image of himself he became very anxious to know what he looked like and at last he determined to go to the old church and see for himself what manner of being he was so he started off from the dreadful wilds and flew on and on until he came to the countries inhabited by men where his appearance in the air created great consternation but he alighted nowhere keeping up a steady flight until he reached the suburbs of the town which had his image on its church here late in the afternoon he alighted in a green meadow by the side of a brook and stretched himself on the grass to rest his great wings were tired for he had not made such a long flight in a century or more  the news of his coming spread quickly over the town and the people frightened nearly out of their wits by the arrival of so extraordinary a visitor fled into their houses and shut themselves up the griffin called loudly for some one to come to him but the more he called the more afraid the people were to show themselves at length he saw two laborers hurrying to their homes through the fields and in a terrible voice he commanded them to stop not daring to disobey the men stood trembling  what is the matter with you all cried the griffin is there not a man in your town who is brave enough to speak to me  i think said one of the laborers his voice shaking so that his words could hardly be understood thatperhapsthe minor canonwould come  go call him then said the griffin i want to see him  the minor canon who filled a subordinate position in the old church had just finished the afternoon services and was coming out of a side door with three aged women who had formed the weekday congregation he was a young man of a kind disposition and very anxious to do good to the people of the town apart from his duties in the church where he conducted services every weekday he visited the sick and the poor counselled and assisted persons who were in trouble and taught a school composed entirely of the bad children in the town with whom nobody else would have any thing to do whenever the people wanted something difficult done for them they always went to the minor canon thus it was that the laborer thought of the young priest when he found that some one must come and speak to the griffin  the minor canon had not heard of the strange event which was known to the whole town except himself and the three old women and when he was informed of it and was told that the griffin had asked to see him he was greatly amazed and frightened  me he exclaimed he has never heard of me what should he want with me  oh you must go instantly cried the two men he is very angry now because he has been kept waiting so long and nobody knows what may happen if you dont hurry to him  the poor minor canon would rather have had his hand cut off than go out to meet an angry griffin but he felt that it was his duty to go for it would be a woful thing if injury should come to the people of the town because he was not brave enough to obey the summons of the griffin so pale and frightened he started off  well said the griffin as soon as the young man came near i am glad to see that there is some one who has the courage to come to me  the minor canon did not feel very courageous but he bowed his head  is this the town said the griffin where there is a church with a likeness of myself over one of the doors  the minor canon looked at the frightful creature before him and saw that it was without doubt exactly like the stone image on the church yes he said you are right  well then said the griffin will you take me to it i wish very much to see it  the minor canon instantly thought that if the griffin entered the town without the people knowing what he came for some of them would probably be frightened to death and so he sought to gain time to prepare their minds  it is growing dark now he said very much afraid as he spoke that his words might enrage the griffin and objects on the front of the church can not be seen clearly it will be better to wait until morning if you wish to get a good view of the stone image of yourself  that will suit me very well said the griffin i see you are a man of good sense i am tired and i will take a nap here on this soft grass while i cool my tail in the little stream that runs near me the end of my tail gets redhot when i am angry or excited and it is quite warm now so you may go but be sure and come early tomorrow morning and show me the way to the church  the minor canon was glad enough to take his leave and hurried into the town in front of the church he found a great many people assembled to hear his report of his interview with the griffin when they found that he had not come to spread ruin and devastation but simply to see his stony likeness on the church they showed neither relief nor gratification but began to upbraid the minor canon for consenting to conduct the creature into the town  what could i do cried the young man if i should not bring him he would come himself and perhaps end by setting fire to the town with his redhot tail  still the people were not satisfied and a great many plans were proposed to prevent the griffin from coming into the town some elderly persons urged that the young men should go out and kill him but the young men scoffed at such a ridiculous idea then some one said that it would be a good thing to destroy the stone image so that the griffin would have no excuse for entering the town and this proposal was received with such favor that many of the people ran for hammers chisels and crowbars with which to tear down and break up the stone griffin but the minor canon resisted this plan with all the strength of his mind and body he assured the people that this action would enrage the griffin beyond measure for it would be impossible to conceal from him that his image had been destroyed during the night but the people were so determined to break up the stone griffin that the minor canon saw that there was nothing for him to do but to stay there and protect it all night he walked up and down in front of the churchdoor keeping away the men who brought ladders by which they might mount to the great stone griffin and knock it to pieces with their hammers and crowbars after many hours the people were obliged to give up their attempts and went home to sleep but the minor canon remained at his post till early morning and then he hurried away to the field where he had left the griffin  the monster had just awakened and rising to his forelegs and shaking himself he said that he was ready to go into the town the minor canon therefore walked back the griffin flying slowly through the air at a short distance above the head of his guide not a person was to be seen in the streets and they proceeded directly to the front of the church where the minor canon pointed out the stone griffin  the real griffin settled down in the little square before the church and gazed earnestly at his sculptured likeness for a long time he looked at it first he put his head on one side and then he put it on the other then he shut his right eye and gazed with his left after which he shut his left eye and gazed with his right then he moved a little to one side and looked at the image then he moved the other way after a while he said to the minor canon who had been standing by all this time  it is it must be an excellent likeness that breadth between the eyes that expansive forehead those massive jaws i feel that it must resemble me if there is any fault to find with it it is that the neck seems a little stiff but that is nothing it is an admirable likenessadmirable  the griffin sat looking at his image all the morning and all the afternoon the minor canon had been afraid to go away and leave him and had hoped all through the day that he would soon be satisfied with his inspection and fly away home but by evening the poor young man was utterly exhausted and felt that he must eat and sleep he frankly admitted this fact to the griffin and asked him if he would not like something to eat he said this because he felt obliged in politeness to do so but as soon as he had spoken the words he was seized with dread lest the monster should demand half a dozen babies or some tempting repast of that kind  oh no said the griffin i never eat between the equinoxes at the vernal and at the autumnal equinox i take a good meal and that lasts me for half a year i am extremely regular in my habits and do not think it healthful to eat at odd times but if you need food go and get it and i will return to the soft grass where i slept last night and take another nap  the next day the griffin came again to the little square before the church and remained there until evening steadfastly regarding the stone griffin over the door the minor canon came once or twice to look at him and the griffin seemed very glad to see him but the young clergyman could not stay as he had done before for he had many duties to perform nobody went to the church but the people came to the minor canons house and anxiously asked him how long the griffin was going to stay  i do not know he answered but i think he will soon be satisfied with regarding his stone likeness and then he will go away  but the griffin did not go away morning after morning he came to the church but after a time he did not stay there all day he seemed to have taken a great fancy to the minor canon and followed him about as he pursued his various avocations he would wait for him at the side door of the church for the minor canon held services every day morning and evening though nobody came now if any one should come he said to himself i must be found at my post when the young man came out the griffin would accompany him in his visits to the sick and the poor and would often look into the windows of the schoolhouse where the minor canon was teaching his unruly scholars all the other schools were closed but the parents of the minor canons scholars forced them to go to school because they were so bad they could not endure them all day at homegriffin or no griffin but it must be said they generally behaved very well when that great monster sat up on his tail and looked in at the schoolroom window  when it was perceived that the griffin showed no sign of going away all the people who were able to do so left the town the canons and the higher officers of the church had fled away during the first day of the griffins visit leaving behind only the minor canon and some of the men who opened the doors and swept the church all the citizens who could afford it shut up their houses and travelled to distant parts and only the working people and the poor were left behind after some days these ventured to go about and attend to their business for if they did not work they would starve they were getting a little used to seeing the griffin and having been told that he did not eat between equinoxes they did not feel so much afraid of him as before  day by day the griffin became more and more attached to the minor canon he kept near him a great part of the time and often spent the night in front of the little house where the young clergyman lived alone this strange companionship was often burdensome to the minor canon but on the other hand he could not deny that he derived a great deal of benefit and instruction from it the griffin had lived for hundreds of years and had seen much and he told the minor canon many wonderful things  it is like reading an old book said the young clergyman to himself but how many books i would have had to read before i would have found out what the griffin has told me about the earth the air the water about minerals and metals and growing things and all the wonders of the world  thus the summer went on and drew toward its close and now the people of the town began to be very much troubled again  it will not be long they said before the autumnal equinox is here and then that monster will want to eat he will be dreadfully hungry for he has taken so much exercise since his last meal he will devour our children without doubt he will eat them all what is to be done  to this question no one could give an answer but all agreed that the griffin must not be allowed to remain until the approaching equinox after talking over the matter a great deal a crowd of the people went to the minor canon at a time when the griffin was not with him  it is all your fault they said that that monster is among us you brought him here and you ought to see that he goes away it is only on your account that he stays here at all for although he visits his image every day he is with you the greater part of the time if you were not here he would not stay it is your duty to go away and then he will follow you and we shall be free from the dreadful danger which hangs over us  go away cried the minor canon greatly grieved at being spoken to in such a way where shall i go if i go to some other town shall i not take this trouble there have i a right to do that  no said the people you must not go to any other town there is no town far enough away you must go to the dreadful wilds where the griffin lives and then he will follow you and stay there  they did not say whether or not they expected the minor canon to stay there also and he did not ask them any thing about it he bowed his head and went into his house to think the more he thought the more clear it became to his mind that it was his duty to go away and thus free the town from the presence of the griffin  that evening he packed a leathern bag full of bread and meat and early the next morning he set out on his journey to the dreadful wilds it was a long weary and doleful journey especially after he had gone beyond the habitations of men but the minor canon kept on bravely and never faltered the way was longer than he had expected and his provisions soon grew so scanty that he was obliged to eat but a little every day but he kept up his courage and pressed on and after many days of toilsome travel he reached the dreadful wilds  when the griffin found that the minor canon had left the town he seemed sorry but showed no disposition to go and look for him after a few days had passed he became much annoyed and asked some of the people where the minor canon had gone but although the citizens had been so anxious that the young clergyman should go to the dreadful wilds thinking that the griffin would immediately follow him they were now afraid to mention the minor canons destination for the monster seemed angry already and if he should suspect their trick he would doubtless become very much enraged so every one said he did not know and the griffin wandered about disconsolate one morning he looked into the minor canons schoolhouse which was always empty now and thought that it was a shame that every thing should suffer on account of the young mans absence  it does not matter so much about the church he said for nobody went there but it is a pity about the school i think i will teach it myself until he returns  it was the hour for opening the school and the griffin went inside and pulled the rope which rang the schoolbell some of the children who heard the bell ran in to see what was the matter supposing it to be a joke of one of their companions but when they saw the griffin they stood astonished and scared  go tell the other scholars said the monster that school is about to open and that if they are not all here in ten minutes i shall come after them  in seven minutes every scholar was in place  never was seen such an orderly school not a boy or girl moved or uttered a whisper the griffin climbed into the masters seat his wide wings spread on each side of him because he could not lean back in his chair while they stuck out behind and his great tail coiled around in front of the desk the barbed end sticking up ready to tap any boy or girl who might misbehave the griffin now addressed the scholars telling them that he intended to teach them while their master was away in speaking he endeavored to imitate as far as possible the mild and gentle tones of the minor canon but it must be admitted that in this he was not very successful he had paid a good deal of attention to the studies of the school and he determined not to attempt to teach them any thing new but to review them in what they had been studying so he called up the various classes and questioned them upon their previous lessons the children racked their brains to remember what they had learned they were so afraid of the griffins displeasure that they recited as they had never recited before one of the boys far down in his class answered so well that the griffin was astonished  i should think you would be at the head said he i am sure you have never been in the habit of reciting so well why is this  because i did not choose to take the trouble said the boy trembling in his boots he felt obliged to speak the truth for all the children thought that the great eyes of the griffin could see right through them and that he would know when they told a falsehood  you ought to be ashamed of yourself said the griffin go down to the very tail of the class and if you are not at the head in two days i shall know the reason why  the next afternoon this boy was number one  it was astonishing how much these children now learned of what they had been studying it was as if they had been educated over again the griffin used no severity toward them but there was a look about him which made them unwilling to go to bed until they were sure they knew their lessons for the next day  the griffin now thought that he ought to visit the sick and the poor and he began to go about the town for this purpose the effect upon the sick was miraculous all except those who were very ill indeed jumped from their beds when they heard he was coming and declared themselves quite well to those who could not get up he gave herbs and roots which none of them had ever before thought of as medicines but which the griffin had seen used in various parts of the world and most of them recovered but for all that they afterward said that no matter what happened to them they hoped that they should never again have such a doctor coming to their bedsides feeling their pulses and looking at their tongues  as for the poor they seemed to have utterly disappeared all those who had depended upon charity for their daily bread were now at work in some way or other many of them offering to do odd jobs for their neighbors just for the sake of their mealsa thing which before had been seldom heard of in the town the griffin could find no one who needed his assistance  the summer had now passed and the autumnal equinox was rapidly approaching the citizens were in a state of great alarm and anxiety the griffin showed no signs of going away but seemed to have settled himself permanently among them in a short time the day for his semiannual meal would arrive and then what would happen the monster would certainly be very hungry and would devour all their children  now they greatly regretted and lamented that they had sent away the minor canon he was the only one on whom they could have depended in this trouble for he could talk freely with the griffin and so find out what could be done but it would not do to be inactive some step must be taken immediately a meeting of the citizens was called and two old men were appointed to go and talk to the griffin they were instructed to offer to prepare a splendid dinner for him on equinox dayone which would entirely satisfy his hunger they would offer him the fattest mutton the most tender beef fish and game of various sorts and any thing of the kind that he might fancy if none of these suited they were to mention that there was an orphan asylum in the next town  anything would be better said the citizens than to have our dear children devoured  the old men went to the griffin but their propositions were not received with favor  from what i have seen of the people of this town said the monster i do not think i could relish any thing which was prepared by them they appear to be all cowards and therefore mean and selfish as for eating one of them old or young i could not think of it for a moment in fact there was only one creature in the whole place for whom i could have had any appetite and that is the minor canon who has gone away he was brave and good and honest and i think i should have relished him  ah said one of the old men very politely in that case i wish we had not sent him to the dreadful wilds  what cried the griffin what do you mean explain instantly what you are talking about  the old man terribly frightened at what he had said was obliged to tell how the minor canon had been sent away by the people in the hope that the griffin might be induced to follow him  when the monster heard this he became furiously angry he dashed away from the old men and spreading his wings flew backward and forward over the town he was so much excited that his tail became redhot and glowed like a meteor against the evening sky when at last he settled down in the little field where he usually rested and thrust his tail into the brook the steam arose like a cloud and the water of the stream ran hot through the town the citizens were greatly frightened and bitterly blamed the old man for telling about the minor canon  it is plain they said that the griffin intended at last to go and look for him and we should have been saved now who can tell what misery you have brought upon us  the griffin did not remain long in the little field as soon as his tail was cool he flew to the townhall and rang the bell the citizens knew that they were expected to come there and although they were afraid to go they were still more afraid to stay away and they crowded into the hall the griffin was on the platform at one end flapping his wings and walking up and down and the end of his tail was still so warm that it slightly scorched the boards as he dragged it after him  when everybody who was able to come was there the griffin stood still and addressed the meeting  i have had a contemptible opinion of you he said ever since i discovered what cowards you are but i had no idea that you were so ungrateful selfish and cruel as i now find you to be here was your minor canon who labored day and night for your good and thought of nothing else but how he might benefit you and make you happy and as soon as you imagine yourselves threatened with a dangerfor well i know you are dreadfully afraid of meyou send him off caring not whether he returns or perishes hoping thereby to save yourselves now i had conceived a great liking for that young man and had intended in a day or two to go and look him up but i have changed my mind about him i shall go and find him but i shall send him back here to live among you and i intend that he shall enjoy the reward of his labor and his sacrifices go some of you to the officers of the church who so cowardly ran away when i first came here and tell them never to return to this town under penalty of death and if when your minor canon comes back to you you do not bow yourselves before him put him in the highest place among you and serve and honor him all his life beware of my terrible vengeance there were only two good things in this town the minor canon and the stone image of myself over your churchdoor one of these you have sent away and the other i shall carry away myself  with these words he dismissed the meeting and it was time for the end of his tail had become so hot that there was danger of its setting fire to the building  the next morning the griffin came to the church and tearing the stone image of himself from its fastenings over the great door he grasped it with his powerful forelegs and flew up into the air then after hovering over the town for a moment he gave his tail an angry shake and took up his flight to the dreadful wilds when he reached this desolate region he set the stone griffin upon a ledge of a rock which rose in front of the dismal cave he called his home there the image occupied a position somewhat similar to that it had had over the churchdoor and the griffin panting with the exertion of carrying such an enormous load to so great a distance lay down upon the ground and regarded it with much satisfaction when he felt somewhat rested he went to look for the minor canon he found the young man weak and half starved lying under the shadow of a rock after picking him up and carrying him to his cave the griffin flew away to a distant marsh where he procured some roots and herbs which he well knew were strengthening and beneficial to man though he had never tasted them himself after eating these the minor canon was greatly revived and sat up and listened while the griffin told him what had happened in the town  do you know said the monster when he had finished that i have had and still have a great liking for you  i am very glad to hear it said the minor canon with his usual politeness  i am not at all sure that you would be said the griffin if you thoroughly understood the state of the case but we will not consider that now if some things were different other things would be otherwise i have been so enraged by discovering the manner in which you have been treated that i have determined that you shall at last enjoy the rewards and honors to which you are entitled lie down and have a good sleep and then i will take you back to the town  as he heard these words a look of trouble came over the young mans face  you need not give yourself any anxiety said the griffin about my return to the town i shall not remain there now that i have that admirable likeness of myself in front of my cave where i can sit at my leisure and gaze upon its noble features and magnificent proportions i have no wish to see that abode of cowardly and selfish people  the minor canon relieved from his fears lay back and dropped into a doze and when he was sound asleep the griffin took him up and carried him back to the town he arrived just before daybreak and putting the young man gently on the grass in the little field where he himself used to rest the monster without having been seen by any of the people flew back to his home  when the minor canon made his appearance in the morning among the citizens the enthusiasm and cordiality with which he was received were truly wonderful he was taken to a house which had been occupied by one of the banished high officers of the place and every one was anxious to do all that could be done for his health and comfort the people crowded into the church when he held services so that the three old women who used to be his weekday congregation could not get to the best seats which they had always been in the habit of taking and the parents of the bad children determined to reform them at home in order that he might be spared the trouble of keeping up his former school the minor canon was appointed to the highest office of the old church and before he died he became a bishop  during the first years after his return from the dreadful wilds the people of the town looked up to him as a man to whom they were bound to do honor and reverence but they often also looked up to the sky to see if there were any signs of the griffin coming back however in the course of time they learned to honor and reverence their former minor canon without the fear of being punished if they did not do so  but they need never have been afraid of the griffin the autumnal equinox day came round and the monster ate nothing if he could not have the minor canon he did not care for any thing so lying down with his eyes fixed upon the great stone griffin he gradually declined and died it was a good thing for some of the people of the town that they did not know this  if you should ever visit the old town you would still see the little griffins on the sides of the church but the great stone griffin that was over the door is gone       old pipes and the dryad                                       a mountain brook ran through a little village over the brook there was a narrow bridge and from the bridge a footpath led out from the village and up the hillside to the cottage of old pipes and his mother for many many years old pipes had been employed by the villagers to pipe the cattle down from the hills every afternoon an hour before sunset he would sit on a rock in front of his cottage and play on his pipes then all the flocks and herds that were grazing on the mountains would hear him wherever they might happen to be and would come down to the villagethe cows by the easiest paths the sheep by those not quite so easy and the goats by the steep and rocky ways that were hardest of all  but now for a year or more old pipes had not piped the cattle home it is true that every afternoon he sat upon the rock and played upon his familiar instrument but the cattle did not hear him he had grown old and his breath was feeble the echoes of his cheerful notes which used to come from the rocky hill on the other side of the valley were heard no more and twenty yards from old pipes one could scarcely tell what tune he was playing he had become somewhat deaf and did not know that the sound of his pipes was so thin and weak and that the cattle did not hear him the cows the sheep and the goats came down every afternoon as before but this was because two boys and a girl were sent up after them the villagers did not wish the good old man to know that his piping was no longer of any use so they paid him his little salary every month and said nothing about the two boys and the girl  old pipess mother was of course a great deal older then he was and was as deaf as a gateposts latch hinges and alland she never knew that the sound of her sons pipe did not spread over all the mountainside and echo back strong and clear from the opposite hills she was very fond of old pipes and proud of his piping and as he was so much younger than she was she never thought of him as being very old she cooked for him and made his bed and mended his clothes and they lived very comfortably on his little salary  one afternoon at the end of the month when old pipes had finished his piping he took his stout staff and went down the hill to the village to receive the money for his months work the path seemed a great deal steeper and more difficult than it used to be and old pipes thought that it must have been washed by the rains and greatly damaged he remembered it as a path that was quite easy to traverse either up or down but old pipes had been a very active man and as his mother was so much older than he was he never thought of himself as aged and infirm  when the chief villager had paid him and he had talked a little with some of his friends old pipes started to go home but when he had crossed the bridge over the brook and gone a short distance up the hillside he became very tired and sat down upon a stone he had not been sitting there half a minute when along came two boys and a girl  children said old pipes im very tired tonight and i dont believe i can climb up this steep path to my home i think i shall have to ask you to help me  we will do that said the boys and the girl quite cheerfully and one boy took him by the right hand and the other by the left while the girl pushed him in the back in this way he went up the hill quite easily and soon reached his cottage door old pipes gave each of the three children a copper coin and then they sat down for a few minutes rest before starting back to the village  im sorry that i tired you so much said old pipes  oh that would not have tired us said one of the boys if we had not been so far today after the cows the sheep and the goats they rambled high up on the mountain and we never before had such a time in finding them  had to go after the cows the sheep and the goats exclaimed old pipes what do you mean by that  the girl who stood behind the old man shook her head put her hand on her mouth and made all sorts of signs to the boy to stop talking on this subject but he did not notice her and promptly answered old pipes  why you see good sir said he that as the cattle cant hear your pipes now somebody has to go after them every evening to drive them down from the mountain and the chief villager has hired us three to do it generally it is not very hard work but tonight the cattle had wandered far  how long have you been doing this asked the old man  the girl shook her head and clapped her hand on her mouth more vigorously than before but the boy went on  i think it is about a year now he said since the people first felt sure that the cattle could not hear your pipes and from that time weve been driving them down but we are rested now and will go home goodnight sir  the three children then went down the hill the girl scolding the boy all the way home old pipes stood silent a few moments and then he went into his cottage  mother he shouted did you hear what those children said  children exclaimed the old woman i did not hear them i did not know there were any children here  then old pipes told his mother shouting very loudly to make her hear how the two boys and the girl had helped him up the hill and what he had heard about his piping and the cattle  they cant hear you cried his mother why whats the matter with the cattle  ah me said old pipes i dont believe theres any thing the matter with the cattle it must be with me and my pipes that there is something the matter but one thing is certain if i do not earn the wages the chief villager pays me i shall not take them i shall go straight down to the village and give back the money i received today  nonsense cried his mother im sure youve piped as well as you could and no more can be expected and what are we to do without the money  i dont know said old pipes but im going down to the village to pay it back  the sun had now set but the moon was shining very brightly on the hillside and old pipes could see his way very well he did not take the same path by which he had gone before but followed another which led among the trees upon the hillside and though longer was not so steep  when he had gone about halfway the old man sat down to rest leaning his back against a great oaktree as he did so he heard a sound like knocking inside the tree and then a voice distinctly said  let me out let me out  old pipes instantly forgot that he was tired and sprang to his feet this must be a dryadtree he exclaimed if it is ill let her out  old pipes had never to his knowledge seen a dryadtree but he knew there were such trees on the hillsides and the mountains and that dryads lived in them he knew too that in the summertime on those days when the moon rose before the sun went down a dryad could come out of her tree if any one could find the key which locked her in and turn it old pipes closely examined the trunk of the tree which stood in the full moonlight if i see that key he said i shall surely turn it before long he perceived a piece of bark standing out from the tree which appeared to him very much like the handle of a key he took hold of it and found he could turn it quite around as he did so a large part of the side of the tree was pushed open and a beautiful dryad stepped quickly out  for a moment she stood motionless gazing on the scene before herthe tranquil valley the hills the forest and the mountainside all lying in the soft clear light of the moon oh lovely lovely she exclaimed how long it is since i have seen any thing like this and then turning to old pipes she said how good of you to let me out i am so happy and so thankful that i must kiss you you dear old man and she threw her arms around the neck of old pipes and kissed him on both cheeks you dont know she then went on to say how doleful it is to be shut up so long in a tree i dont mind it in the winter for then i am glad to be sheltered but in summer it is a rueful thing not to be able to see all the beauties of the world and its ever so long since ive been let out people so seldom come this way and when they do come at the right time they either dont hear me or they are frightened and run away but you you dear old man you were not frightened and you looked and looked for the key and you let me out and now i shall not have to go back till winter has come and the air grows cold oh it is glorious what can i do for you to show you how grateful i am  i am very glad said old pipes that i let you out since i see that it makes you so happy but i must admit that i tried to find the key because i had a great desire to see a dryad but if you wish to do something for me you can if you happen to be going down toward the village  to the village exclaimed the dryad i will go anywhere for you my kind old benefactor  well then said old pipes i wish you would take this little bag of money to the chief villager and tell him that old pipes cannot receive pay for the services which he does not perform it is now more than a year that i have not been able to make the cattle hear me when i piped to call them home i did not know this until tonight but now that i know it i cannot keep the money and so i send it back and handing the little bag to the dryad he bade her goodnight and turned toward his cottage  goodnight said the dryad and i thank you over and over and over again you good old man  old pipes walked toward his home very glad to be saved the fatigue of going all the way down to the village and back again to be sure he said to himself this path does not seem at all steep and i can walk along it very easily but it would have tired me dreadfully to come up all the way from the village especially as i could not have expected those children to help me again when he reached home his mother was surprised to see him returning so soon  what she exclaimed have you already come back what did the chief villager say did he take the money  old pipes was just about to tell her that he had sent the money to the village by a dryad when he suddenly reflected that his mother would be sure to disapprove such a proceeding and so he merely said he had sent it by a person whom he had met  and how do you know that the person will ever take it to the chief villager cried his mother you will lose it and the villagers will never get it oh pipes pipes when will you be old enough to have ordinary common sense  old pipes considered that as he was already seventy years of age he could scarcely expect to grow any wiser but he made no remark on this subject and saying that he doubted not that the money would go safely to its destination he sat down to his supper his mother scolded him roundly but he did not mind it and after supper he went out and sat on a rustic chair in front of the cottage to look at the moonlit village and to wonder whether or not the chief villager really received the money while he was doing these two things he went fast asleep  when old pipes left the dryad she did not go down to the village with the little bag of money she held it in her hand and thought about what she had heard this is a good and honest old man she said and it is a shame that he should lose this money he looked as if he needed it and i dont believe the people in the village will take it from one who has served them so long often when in my tree have i heard the sweet notes of his pipes i am going to take the money back to him she did not start immediately because there were so many beautiful things to look at but after a while she went up to the cottage and finding old pipes asleep in his chair she slipped the little bag into his coatpocket and silently sped away  the next day old pipes told his mother that he would go up the mountain and cut some wood he had a right to get wood from the mountain but for a long time he had been content to pick up the dead branches which lay about his cottage today however he felt so strong and vigorous that he thought he would go and cut some fuel that would be better than this he worked all the morning and when he came back he did not feel at all tired and he had a very good appetite for his dinner  now old pipes knew a good deal about dryads but there was one thing which although he had heard he had forgotten this was that a kiss from a dryad made a person ten years younger the people of the village knew this and they were very careful not to let any child of ten years or younger go into the woods where the dryads were supposed to be for if they should chance to be kissed by one of these treenymphs they would be set back so far that they would cease to exist a story was told in the village that a very bad boy of eleven once ran away into the woods and had an adventure of this kind and when his mother found him he was a little baby of one year old taking advantage of her opportunity she brought him up more carefully than she had done before and he grew to be a very good boy indeed  now old pipes had been kissed twice by the dryad once on each cheek and he therefore felt as vigorous and active as when he was a hale man of fifty his mother noticed how much work he was doing and told him that he need not try in that way to make up for the loss of his piping wages for he would only tire himself out and get sick but her son answered that he had not felt so well for years and that he was quite able to work in the course of the afternoon old pipes for the first time that day put his hand in his coatpocket and there to his amazement he found the little bag of money well well he exclaimed i am stupid indeed i really thought that i had seen a dryad but when i sat down by that big oaktree i must have gone to sleep and dreamed it all and then i came home thinking i had given the money to a dryad when it was in my pocket all the time but the chief villager shall have the money i shall not take it to him today but tomorrow i wish to go to the village to see some of my old friends and then i shall give up the money  toward the close of the afternoon old pipes as had been his custom for so many years took his pipes from the shelf on which they lay and went out to the rock in front of the cottage  what are you going to do cried his mother if you will not consent to be paid why do you pipe  i am going to pipe for my own pleasure said her son i am used to it and i do not wish to give it up it does not matter now whether the cattle hear me or not and i am sure that my piping will injure no one  when the good man began to play upon his favorite instrument he was astonished at the sound that came from it the beautiful notes of the pipes sounded clear and strong down into the valley and spread over the hills and up the sides of the mountain beyond while after a little interval an echo came back from the rocky hill on the other side of the valley  ha ha he cried what has happened to my pipes they must have been stopped up of late but now they are as clear and good as ever  again the merry notes went sounding far and wide the cattle on the mountain heard them and those that were old enough remembered how these notes had called them from their pastures every evening and so they started down the mountainside the others following  the merry notes were heard in the village below and the people were much astonished thereby why who can be blowing the pipes of old pipes they said but as they were all very busy no one went up to see one thing however was plain enough the cattle were coming down the mountain and so the two boys and the girl did not have to go after them and had an hour for play for which they were very glad  the next morning old pipes started down to the village with his money and on the way he met the dryad oh ho he cried is that you why i thought my letting you out of the tree was nothing but a dream  a dream cried the dryad if you only knew how happy you have made me you would not think it merely a dream and has it not benefited you do you not feel happier yesterday i heard you playing beautifully on your pipes  yes yes cried he i did not understand it before but i see it all now i have really grown younger i thank you i thank you good dryad from the bottom of my heart it was the finding of the money in my pocket that made me think it was a dream  oh i put it in when you were asleep she said laughing because i thought you ought to keep it goodby kind honest man may you live long and be as happy as i am now  old pipes was greatly delighted when he understood that he was really a younger man but that made no difference about the money and he kept on his way to the village as soon as he reached it he was eagerly questioned as to who had been playing his pipes the evening before and when the people heard that it was himself they were very much surprised thereupon old pipes told what had happened to him and then there was greater wonder with hearty congratulations and handshakes for old pipes was liked by every one the chief villager refused to take his money and although old pipes said that he had not earned it every one present insisted that as he would now play on his pipes as before he should lose nothing because for a time he was unable to perform his duty  so old pipes was obliged to keep his money and after an hour or two spent in conversation with his friends he returned to his cottage  there was one individual however who was not at all pleased with what had happened to old pipes this was an echodwarf who lived on the hills on the other side of the valley and whose duty it was to echo back the notes of the pipes whenever they could be heard there were a great many other echodwarfs on these hills some of whom echoed back the songs of maidens some the shouts of children and others the music that was often heard in the village but there was only one who could send back the strong notes of the pipes of old pipes and this had been his sole duty for many years but when the old man grew feeble and the notes of his pipes could not be heard on the opposite hills this echodwarf had nothing to do and he spent his time in delightful idleness and he slept so much and grew so fat that it made his companions laugh to see him walk  on the afternoon on which after so long an interval the sound of the pipes was heard on the echo hills this dwarf was fast asleep behind a rock as soon as the first notes reached them some of his companions ran to wake him rolling to his feet he echoed back the merry tune of old pipes naturally he was very much annoyed and indignant at being thus obliged to give up his life of comfortable leisure and he hoped very much that this pipeplaying would not occur again the next afternoon he was awake and listening and sure enough at the usual hour along came the notes of the pipes as clear and strong as they ever had been and he was obliged to work as long as old pipes played the echodwarf was very angry he had supposed of course that the pipeplaying had ceased forever and he felt that he had a right to be indignant at being thus deceived he was so much disturbed that he made up his mind to go and try to find out whether this was to be a temporary matter or not he had plenty of time as the pipes were played but once a day and he set off early in the morning for the hill on which old pipes lived it was hard work for the fat little fellow and when he had crossed the valley and had gone some distance into the woods on the hillside he stopped to rest and in a few minutes the dryad came tripping along  ho ho exclaimed the dwarf what are you doing here and how did you get out of your tree  doing cried the dryad i am being happy thats what i am doing and i was let out of my tree by the good old man who plays the pipes to call the cattle down from the mountain and it makes me happier to think that i have been of service to him i gave him two kisses of gratitude and now he is young enough to play his pipes as well as ever  the echodwarf stepped forward his face pale with passion am i to believe he said that you are the cause of this great evil that has come upon me and that you are the wicked creature who has again started this old man upon his career of pipeplaying what have i ever done to you that you should have condemned me for years and years to echo back the notes of those wretched pipes  at this the dryad laughed loudly  what a funny little fellow you are she said any one would think you had been condemned to toil from morning till night while what you really have to do is merely to imitate for half an hour every day the merry notes of old pipess piping fie upon you echodwarf you are lazy and selfish and that is what is the matter with you instead of grumbling at being obliged to do a little wholesome work which is less i am sure than that of any other echodwarf upon the rocky hillside you should rejoice at the good fortune of the old man who has regained so much of his strength and vigor go home and learn to be just and generous and then perhaps you may be happy goodby  insolent creature shouted the dwarf as he shook his fat little fist at her ill make you suffer for this you shall find out what it is to heap injury and insult upon one like me and to snatch from him the repose that he has earned by long years of toil and shaking his head savagely he hurried back to the rocky hillside  every afternoon the merry notes of the pipes of old pipes sounded down into the valley and over the hills and up the mountainside and every afternoon when he had echoed them back the little dwarf grew more and more angry with the dryad each day from early morning till it was time for him to go back to his duties upon the rocky hillside he searched the woods for her he intended if he met her to pretend to be very sorry for what he had said and he thought he might be able to play a trick upon her which would avenge him well one day while thus wandering among the trees he met old pipes the echodwarf did not generally care to see or speak to ordinary people but now he was so anxious to find the object of his search that he stopped and asked old pipes if he had seen the dryad the piper had not noticed the little fellow and he looked down on him with some surprise  no he said i have not seen her and i have been looking everywhere for her  you cried the dwarf what do you wish with her  old pipes then sat down on a stone so that he should be nearer the ear of his small companion and he told what the dryad had done for him  when the echodwarf heard that this was the man whose pipes he was obliged to echo back every day he would have slain him on the spot had he been able but as he was not able he merely ground his teeth and listened to the rest of the story  i am looking for the dryad now old pipes continued on account of my aged mother when i was old myself i did not notice how very old my mother was but now it shocks me to see how feeble and decrepit her years have caused her to become and i am looking for the dryad to ask her to make my mother younger as she made me  the eyes of the echodwarf glistened here was a man who might help him in his plans  your idea is a good one he said to old pipes and it does you honor but you should know that a dryad can make no person younger but one who lets her out of her tree however you can manage the affair very easily all you need do is to find the dryad tell her what you want and request her to step into her tree and be shut up for a short time then you will go and bring your mother to the tree she will open it and every thing will be as you wish is not this a good plan  excellent cried old pipes and i will go instantly and search more diligently for the dryad  take me with you said the echodwarf you can easily carry me on your strong shoulders and i shall be glad to help you in any way that i can  now then said the little fellow to himself as old pipes carried him rapidly along if he persuades the dryad to get into a treeand she is quite foolish enough to do itand then goes away to bring his mother i shall take a stone or a club and i will break off the key of that tree so that nobody can ever turn it again then mistress dryad will see what she has brought upon herself by her behavior to me  before long they came to the great oaktree in which the dryad had lived and at a distance they saw that beautiful creature herself coming toward them  how excellently well every thing happens said the dwarf put me down and i will go your business with the dryad is more important than mine and you need not say any thing about my having suggested your plan to you i am willing that you should have all the credit of it yourself  old pipes put the echodwarf upon the ground but the little rogue did not go away he concealed himself between some low mossy rocks and he was so much of their color that you would not have noticed him if you had been looking straight at him  when the dryad came up old pipes lost no time in telling her about his mother and what he wished her to do at first the dryad answered nothing but stood looking very sadly at old pipes  do you really wish me to go into my tree again she said i should dreadfully dislike to do it for i dont know what might happen it is not at all necessary for i could make your mother younger at any time if she would give me the opportunity i had already thought of making you still happier in this way and several times i have waited about your cottage hoping to meet your aged mother but she never comes outside and you know a dryad cannot enter a house i cannot imagine what put this idea into your head did you think of it yourself  no i cannot say that i did answered old pipes a little dwarf whom i met in the woods proposed it to me  oh cried the dryad now i see through it all it is the scheme of that vile echodwarfyour enemy and mine where is he i should like to see him  i think he has gone away said old pipes  no he has not said the dryad whose quick eyes perceived the echodwarf among the rocks there he is seize him and drag him out i beg of you  old pipes perceived the dwarf as soon as he was pointed out to him and running to the rocks he caught the little fellow by the arm and pulled him out  now then cried the dryad who had opened the door of the great oak just stick him in there and we will shut him up then i shall be safe from his mischief for the rest of the time i am free  old pipes thrust the echodwarf into the tree the dryad pushed the door shut there was a clicking sound of bark and wood and no one would have noticed that the big oak had ever had an opening in it  there said the dryad now we need not be afraid of him and i assure you my good piper that i shall be very glad to make your mother younger as soon as i can will you not ask her to come out and meet me  of course i will cried old pipes and i will do it without delay  and then the dryad by his side he hurried to his cottage but when he mentioned the matter to his mother the old woman became very angry indeed she did not believe in dryads and if they really did exist she knew they must be witches and sorceresses and she would have nothing to do with them if her son had ever allowed himself to be kissed by one of them he ought to be ashamed of himself as to its doing him the least bit of good she did not believe a word of it he felt better than he used to feel but that was very common she had sometimes felt that way herself and she forbade him ever to mention a dryad to her again  that afternoon old pipes feeling very sad that his plan in regard to his mother had failed sat down upon the rock and played upon his pipes the pleasant sounds went down the valley and up the hills and mountain but to the great surprise of some persons who happened to notice the fact the notes were not echoed back from the rocky hillside but from the woods on the side of the valley on which old pipes lived the next day many of the villagers stopped in their work to listen to the echo of the pipes coming from the woods the sound was not as clear and strong as it used to be when it was sent back from the rocky hillside but it certainly came from among the trees such a thing as an echo changing its place in this way had never been heard of before and nobody was able to explain how it could have happened old pipes however knew very well that the sound came from the echodwarf shut up in the great oaktree the sides of the tree were thin and the sound of the pipes could be heard through them and the dwarf was obliged by the laws of his being to echo back those notes whenever they came to him but old pipes thought he might get the dryad in trouble if he let any one know that the echodwarf was shut up in the tree and so he wisely said nothing about it  one day the two boys and the girl who had helped old pipes up the hill were playing in the woods stopping near the great oaktree they heard a sound of knocking within it and then a voice plainly said  let me out let me out  for a moment the children stood still in astonishment and then one of the boys exclaimed  oh it is a dryad like the one old pipes found lets let her out  what are you thinking of cried the girl i am the oldest of all and i am only thirteen do you wish to be turned into crawling babies run run run  and the two boys and the girl dashed down into the valley as fast as their legs could carry them there was no desire in their youthful hearts to be made younger than they were and for fear that their parents might think it well that they should commence their careers anew they never said a word about finding the dryadtree  as the summer days went on old pipess mother grew feebler and feebler one day when her son was away for he now frequently went into the woods to hunt or fish or down into the valley to work she arose from her knitting to prepare the simple dinner but she felt so weak and tired that she was not able to do the work to which she had been so long accustomed alas alas she said the time has come when i am too old to work my son will have to hire some one to come here and cook his meals make his bed and mend his clothes alas alas i had hoped that as long as i lived i should be able to do these things but it is not so i have grown utterly worthless and some one else must prepare the dinner for my son i wonder where he is and tottering to the door she went outside to look for him she did not feel able to stand and reaching the rustic chair she sank into it quite exhausted and soon fell asleep  the dryad who had often come to the cottage to see if she could find an opportunity of carrying out old pipess affectionate design now happened by and seeing that the muchdesired occasion had come she stepped up quietly behind the old woman and gently kissed her on each cheek and then as quietly disappeared  in a few minutes the mother of old pipes awoke and looking up at the sun she exclaimed why it is almost dinnertime my son will be here directly and i am not ready for him and rising to her feet she hurried into the house made the fire set the meat and vegetables to cook laid the cloth and by the time her son arrived the meal was on the table  how a little sleep does refresh one she said to herself as she was bustling about she was a woman of very vigorous constitution and at seventy had been a great deal stronger and more active than her son was at that age the moment old pipes saw his mother he knew that the dryad had been there but while he felt as happy as a king he was too wise to say any thing about her  it is astonishing how well i feel today said his mother and either my hearing has improved or you speak much more plainly than you have done of late  the summer days went on and passed away the leaves were falling from the trees and the air was becoming cold  nature has ceased to be lovely said the dryad and the nightwinds chill me it is time for me to go back into my comfortable quarters in the great oak but first i must pay another visit to the cottage of old pipes  she found the piper and his mother sitting side by side on the rock in front of the door the cattle were not to go to the mountain any more that season and he was piping them down for the last time loud and merrily sounded the pipes of old pipes and down the mountainside came the cattle the cows by the easiest paths the sheep by those not quite so easy and the goats by the most difficult ones among the rocks while from the great oaktree were heard the echoes of the cheerful music  how happy they look sitting there together said the dryad and i dont believe it will do them a bit of harm to be still younger and moving quietly up behind them she first kissed old pipes on his cheek and then his mother  old pipes who had stopped playing knew what it was but he did not move and said nothing his mother thinking that her son had kissed her turned to him with a smile and kissed him in return and then she arose and went into the cottage a vigorous woman of sixty followed by her son erect and happy and twenty years younger than herself  the dryad sped away to the woods shrugging her shoulders as she felt the cool evening wind  when she reached the great oak she turned the key and opened the door come out she said to the echodwarf who sat blinking within winter is coming on and i want the comfortable shelter of my tree for myself the cattle have come down from the mountain for the last time this year the pipes will no longer sound and you can go to your rocks and have a holiday until next spring  upon hearing these words the dwarf skipped quickly out and the dryad entered the tree and pulled the door shut after her now then she said to herself he can break off the key if he likes it does not matter to me another will grow out next spring and although the good piper made me no promise i know that when the warm days arrive next year he will come and let me out again  the echodwarf did not stop to break the key of the tree he was too happy to be released to think of any thing else and he hastened as fast as he could to his home on the rocky hillside                                       the dryad was not mistaken when she trusted in the piper when the warm days came again he went to the oaktree to let her out but to his sorrow and surprise he found the great tree lying upon the ground a winter storm had blown it down and it lay with its trunk shattered and split and what became of the dryad no one ever knew       the queens museum                                       there was once a queen who founded in her capital city a grand museum this institution was the pride of her heart and she devoted nearly all her time to overseeing the collection of objects for it and their arrangement in the spacious halls this museum was intended to elevate the intelligence of her people but the result was quite disappointing to the queen for some reason and what it was she could not imagine the people were not interested in her museum she considered it the most delightful place in the world and spent hours every day in examining and studying the thousands of objects it contained but although here and there in the city there was a person who cared to visit the collection the great body of the people found it impossible to feel the slightest interest in it at first this grieved the queen and she tried to make her museum better but as this did no good she became very angry and she issued a decree that all persons of mature age who were not interested in her museum should be sent to prison  this decree produced a great sensation in the city the people crowded to the building and did their very best to be interested but in the majority of cases the attempt was an utter failure they could not feel any interest whatever the consequence was that hundreds and thousands of the people were sent to prison and as there was not room enough for them in the ordinary jails large temporary prisons were erected in various parts of the city those persons who were actually needed for work or service which no one else could do were allowed to come out in the daytime on parole but at night they had to return to their prisons  it was during this deplorable state of affairs that a stranger entered the city one day he was surprised at seeing so many prisons and approaching the window in one of them behind the bars of which he saw a very respectablelooking citizen he asked what all this meant the citizen informed him how matters stood and then with tears mounting to his eyes he added  oh sir i have tried my best to be interested in that museum but it is impossible i cannot make myself care for it in the slightest degree and what is more i know i shall never be able to do so and i shall languish here for the rest of my days  passing on the stranger met a mother coming out of her house her face was pale and she was weeping bitterly filled with pity he stopped and asked her what was the matter oh sir she said for a week i have been trying for the sake of my dear children to take an interest in that museum for a time i thought i might do it but the hopes proved false it is impossible i must leave my little ones and go to prison  the stranger was deeply affected by these cases and many others of a similar character which he soon met with it is too bad too bad he said to himself i never saw a city in so much trouble there is scarcely a family i am told in which there is not some uninterested personi must see the queen and talk to her about it and with this he wended his way to the palace  he met the queen just starting out on her morning visit to the museum when he made it known that he was a stranger and desired a short audience she stopped and spoke to him  have you visited my museum yet she said there is nothing in the city so well worth your attention as that you should go there before seeing any thing else you have a high forehead and an intelligent expression and i have no doubt that it will interest you greatly i am going there myself and i shall be glad to see what effect that fine collection has upon a stranger  this did not suit the stranger at all from what he had heard he felt quite sure that if he went to the museum he would soon be in jail and so he hurried to propose a plan which had occurred to him while on his way to the palace  i came to see your majesty on the subject of the museum he said and to crave permission to contribute to the collection some objects which shall be interesting to every one i understand that it is highly desirable that every one should be interested  of course it is said the queen and although i think that there is not the slightest reason why every one should not feel the keenest interest in what the museum already contains i am willing to add to it whatever may make it of greater value  in that case said the stranger no time should be lost in securing what i wish to present  go at once said the queen but how soon can you return  it will take some days at least said the stranger  give me your parole to return in a week said the queen and start immediately  the stranger gave his parole and left the palace having filled a leathern bag with provisions from a cooks shop he went out of the city gates as he walked into the open country he said to himself  i have certainly undertaken a very difficult enterprise where i am to find any thing that will interest all the people in that city i am sure i do not know but my heart is so filled with pity for the great number of unfortunate persons who are torn from their homes and shut up in prison that i am determined to do something for them if i possibly can there must be some objects to be found in this vast country that will interest every one  about noon he came to a great mountainside covered with a forest thinking that he was as likely to find what he sought in one place as another and preferring the shade to the sun he entered the forest and walked for some distance along a path which gradually led up the mountain having crossed a brook with its edges lined with watercresses he soon perceived a large cave at the entrance of which sat an aged hermit ah said the stranger to himself this is indeed fortunate this good and venerable man who passes his life amid the secrets of nature can surely tell me what i wish to know saluting the hermit he sat down and told the old man the object of his quest  i am afraid you are looking for what you will not find said the hermit most people are too silly to be truly interested in any thing they herd together like cattle and do not know what is good for them there are now on this mountainside many commodious and comfortable caves all of which would be tenanted if people only knew how improving and interesting it is to live apart from their fellowmen but so far as it can be done i will help you in your quest which i think is a worthy one i can do nothing for you myself but i have a pupil who is very much given to wandering about and looking for curious things he may tell you where you will be able to find something that will interest everybody though i doubt it you may go and see him if you like and i will excuse him from his studies for a time so that he may aid you in your search  the hermit then wrote an excuse upon a piece of parchment and giving it to the stranger he directed him to the cave of his pupil  this was situated at some distance and higher up the mountain and when the stranger reached it he found the pupil fast asleep upon the ground this individual was a longlegged youth with long arms long hair a long nose and a long face when the stranger awakened him told him why he had come and gave him the hermits excuse the sleepy eyes of the pupil brightened and his face grew less long  thats delightful he said to be let off on a monday for i generally have to be satisfied with a halfholiday wednesdays and saturdays  is the hermit very strict with you asked the stranger  yes said the pupil i have to stick closely to the cave though i have been known to go fishing on days when there was no holiday i have never seen the old man but once and that was when he first took me you know it wouldnt do for us to be too sociable that wouldnt be hermitlike he comes up here on the afternoons i am out and writes down what i am to do for the next halfweek  and do you always do it asked the stranger  oh i get some of it done said the pupil but there have been times when i have wondered whether it wouldnt have been better for me to have been something else but i have chosen my profession and i suppose i must be faithful to it we will start immediately on our search but first i must put the cave in order for the old man will be sure to come up while i am gone  so saying the pupil opened an old parchment book at a marked page and laid it on a flat stone which served as a table and then placed a skull and a couple of bones in a proper position near by  the two now started off the pupil first putting a line and hook in his pocket and pulling out a fishingrod from under some bushes  what do you want with that asked the stranger we are not going to fish  why not said the pupil if we come to a good place we might catch something that would be a real curiosity  before long they came to a mountain brook and here the pupil insisted on trying his luck the stranger was a little tired and hungry and so was quite willing to sit down for a time and eat something from his bag the pupil ran off to find some bait and he staid away so long that the stranger had quite finished his meal before he returned he came back at last however in a state of great excitement  come with me come with me he cried i have found something that is truly astonishing come quickly  the stranger arose and hurried after the pupil whose long legs carried him rapidly over the mountainside reaching a large hole at the bottom of a precipitous rock the pupil stopped and exclaiming come in here and i will show you something that will amaze you he immediately entered the hole  the stranger who was very anxious to see what curiosity he had found followed him some distance along a narrow and winding underground passage the two suddenly emerged into a high and spacious cavern which was lighted by openings in the roof on the floor in various places were strongly fastened boxes and packages of many sorts bales and bundles of silks and rich cloths with handsome caskets and many other articles of value  what kind of a place is this exclaimed the stranger in great surprise  dont you know cried the pupil his eyes fairly sparkling with delight it is a robbers den isnt it a great thing to find a place like this  a robbers den exclaimed the stranger in alarm let us get out of it as quickly as we can or the robbers will return and we shall be cut to pieces  i dont believe they are coming back very soon said the pupil and we ought to stop and take a look at some of these things  fly you foolish youth cried the stranger you do not know what danger you are in and so saying he turned to hasten away from the place  but he was too late at that moment the robber captain and his band entered the cave when these men perceived the stranger and the hermits pupil they drew their swords and were about to rush upon them when the pupil sprang forward and throwing up his long arms exclaimed  stop it is a mistake  at these words the robber captain lowered his sword and motioned to his men to halt a mistake he said what do you mean by that  i mean said the pupil that i was out looking for curiosities and wandered into this place by accident we havent taken a thing you may count your goods and you will find nothing missing we have not even opened a box although i very much wanted to see what was in some of them  are his statements correct said the captain turning to the stranger  entirely so was the answer  you have truthful features and an honest expression said the captain and i do not believe you would be so dishonorable as to creep in here during our absence and steal our possessions your lives shall be spared but you will be obliged to remain with us for we cannot allow any one who knows our secret to leave us you shall be treated well and shall accompany us in our expeditions and if your conduct merits it you shall in time be made full members  bitterly the stranger now regretted his unfortunate position he strode up and down one side of the cave vowing inwardly that never again would he allow himself to be led by a hermits pupil that individual however was in a state of high delight he ran about from box to bale looking at the rare treasures which some of the robbers showed him  the two captives were fed and lodged very well and the next day the captain called them and the band together and addressed them  we are now twentynine in number he said twentyseven full members and two on probation tonight we are about to undertake a very important expedition in which we shall all join we shall fasten up the door of the cave and at the proper time i shall tell you to what place we are going  an hour or two before midnight the band set out accompanied by the stranger and the hermits pupil and when they had gone some miles the captain halted them to inform them of the object of the expedition we are going he said to rob the queens museum it is the most important business we have ever undertaken  at these words the stranger stepped forward and made a protest i left the city yesterday he said commissioned by the queen to obtain one or more objects of interest for her museum and to return now to rob an institution which i have promised to enrich will be simply impossible  you are right said the captain after a moments reflection such an action would be highly dishonorable on your part if you will give me your word of honor that you will remain by this stone until our return the expedition will proceed without you  the stranger gave his word and having been left sitting upon the stone soon dropped asleep and so remained until he was awakened by the return of the band a little before daylight they came slowly toiling along each man carrying an enormous bundle upon his back near the end of the line was the hermits pupil bearing a load as heavy as any of the others the stranger offered to relieve him for a time of his burden but the pupil would not allow it  i dont wish these men to think i cant do as much as they can he said you ought to have been along we had a fine time we swept that museum clean i tell you we didnt leave a thing on a shelf or in a case  what sort of things are they asked the stranger  i dont know replied the pupil we didnt have any light for fear people would notice it but the moon shone in bright enough for us to see all the shelves and the cases and our orders were not to try and examine any thing but to take all that was there the cases had great cloth covers on them and we spread these on the floor and made bundles of the curiosities we are going to examine them carefully as soon as we get to the den  it was broad daylight when the robbers reached their cave the bundles were laid in a great circle on the floor and at a given signal they were opened for a moment each robber gazed blankly at the contents of his bundle and then they all began to fumble and search among the piles of articles upon the cloths but after a few minutes they arose looking blanker and more disappointed than before  so far as i can see said the captain there is nothing in the whole collection that i care for i do not like a thing here  nor i nor i nor i cried each one of his band  i suppose said the captain after musing for a moment that as these things are of no use to us we are bound in honor to take them back  hold said the stranger stepping forward do not be in too great a hurry to do that he then told the captain of the state of affairs in the city and explained in full the nature of the expedition he had undertaken for the queen i think it would be better he said if these things were not taken back for the present if you have a safe place where you can put them i will in due time tell the queen where they are and if she chooses she can send for them  good said the captain it is but right that she should bear part of the labor of transportation there is a disused cave a mile or so away and we will tie up these bundles and carry them there and then we shall leave the matter to you we take no further interest in it and if you have given your parole to the queen to return in a week the captain further continued of course youll have to keep it did you give your parole also he asked turning to the pupil  oh no cried that youth there was no time fixed for my return and i am sure that i like a robbers life much better than that of a hermit there is ever so much more spice and dash in it  the stranger was then told that if he would promise not to betray the robbers he might depart he gave the promise but added sadly that he had lost so much time that he was afraid he would not now be able to attain the object of his search and return within the week  if that is the case said the captain we will gladly assist you comrades he cried addressing his band after stowing this useless booty in the disused cave and taking some rest and refreshment we will set out again and the object of our expedition shall be to obtain something for the queens museum which will interest every one  shortly after midnight the robbers set out accompanied by the stranger and the pupil when they had walked about an hour the captain as was his custom brought them to a halt that he might tell them where they were going i have concluded said he that no place is so likely to contain what we are looking for as the castle of the great magician alfrarmedj we will therefore proceed thither and sack the castle  will there not be great danger in attacking the castle of a magician asked the stranger in somewhat anxious tones  of course there will be said the captain but we are not such cowards as to hesitate on account of danger forward my men and on they all marched  when they reached the magicians castle the order was given to scale the outer wall this the robbers did with great agility and the hermits pupil was among the first to surmount it but the stranger was not used to climbing and he had to be assisted over the wall inside the great courtyard they perceived numbers of weirdsstrange shadowy creatures who gathered silently around them but not in the least appalled the robbers formed into a body and marched into the castle the door of which stood open they now entered a great hall having at one end a doorway before which hung a curtain following their captain the robbers approached this curtain and pushing it aside entered the room beyond there behind a large table sat the great magician alfrarmedj busy over his mystic studies which he generally pursued in the dead hours of the night drawing their swords the robbers rushed upon him  surrender cried the captain and deliver to us the treasures of your castle  the old magician raised his head from his book and pushing up his spectacles from his forehead looked at them mildly and said  freeze  instantly they all froze as hard as ice each man remaining in the position in which he was when the magical word was uttered with uplifted swords and glaring eyes they stood rigid and stiff before the magician after calmly surveying the group the old man said  i see among you one who has an intelligent brow and truthful expression his head may thaw sufficiently for him to tell me what means this untimely intrusion upon my studies  the stranger now felt his head begin to thaw and in a few moments he was able to speak he then told the magician about the queens museum and how it had happened that he had come there with the robbers  your motive is a good one said the magician though your actions are somewhat erratic and i do not mind helping you to find what you wish in what class of objects do the people of the city take the most interest  truly i do not know said the stranger  this is indeed surprising exclaimed alfrarmedj how can you expect to obtain that which will interest every one when you do not know what it is in which every one takes an interest go find out this and then return to me and i will see what can be done  the magician then summoned his weirds and ordered them to carry the frozen visitors outside the castle walls each one of the rigid figures was taken up by two weirds who carried him out and stood him up in the road outside the castle when all had been properly set up with the captain at their head the gates were shut and the magician still sitting at his table uttered the word thaw  instantly the whole band thawed and marched away at daybreak they halted and considered how they should find out what all the people in the city took an interest in  one thing is certain cried the hermits pupil whatever it is it isnt the same thing  your remark is not well put together said the stranger but i see the force of it it is true that different people like different things but how shall we find out what the different people like  by asking them said the pupil  good cried the captain who preferred action to words this night we will ask them he then drew upon the sand a plan of the citywith which he was quite familiar having carefully robbed it for many yearsand divided it into twentyeight sections each one of which was assigned to a man i omit you the captain said to the stranger because i find that you are not expert at climbing he then announced that at night the band would visit the city and that each man should enter the houses in his district and ask the people what it was in which they took the greatest interest  they then proceeded to the cave for rest and refreshment and a little before midnight they entered the city and each member of the band including the hermits pupil proceeded to attend to the business assigned to him it was ordered that no one should disturb the queen for they knew that what she took most interest in was the museum during the night nearly every person in the town was aroused by a blackbearded robber who had climbed into one of the windows of the house and who instead of demanding money and jewels simply asked what it was in which that person took the greatest interest upon receiving an answer the robber repeated it until he had learned it by heart and then went to the next house as so many of the citizens were confined in prisons which the robbers easily entered they transacted the business in much less time than they would otherwise have required  the hermits pupil was very active climbing into and out of houses with great agility he obtained his answers quite as easily as did the others but whenever he left a house there was a shade of disappointment upon his features among the last places that he visited was a room in which two boys were sleeping he awoke them and asked the usual question while they were trembling in their bed not knowing what to answer the pupil drew his sword and exclaimed come now no prevarication you know its fishingtackle speak out each of the boys then promptly declared it was fishingtackle and the pupil left greatly gratified i was very much afraid he said to himself that not a person in my district would say fishingtackle and i am glad to think that there were two boys who had sense enough to like something that is really interesting  it was nearly daylight when the work was finished and then the band gathered together in an appointed place on the outside of the city where the stranger awaited them each of the men had an excellent memory which was necessary in their profession and they repeated to the stranger all the objects and subjects that had been mentioned to them and he wrote them down upon tablets  the next night accompanied by the band he proceeded to the castle of the magician the great gate of which was silently opened for them by the weirds when they were ushered into the magicians room alfrarmedj took the tablets from the stranger and examined them carefully  all these things should make a very complete collection he said and i think i have specimens of the various objects in my interminable vaults he then called his weirds and giving one of them the tablets told him to go with his companions into the vaults and gather enough of the things therein mentioned to fill a large museum in half an hour the weirds returned and announced that the articles were ready in the great courtyard  go then said the magician and assist these men to carry them to the queens museum  the stranger then heartily thanked alfrarmedj for the assistance he had given and the band accompanied by a number of weirds proceeded to carry the objects of interest to the queens museum it was a strange procession half a dozen weirds carried a stuffed mammoth followed by others bearing the skeleton of a whale while the robbers and the rest of their queer helpers were loaded with every thing relating to history science and art which ought to be in a really good museum when the whole collection had been put in place upon the floors the shelves and in the cases it was nearly morning the robbers with the hermits pupil retired to the cave the weirds disappeared while the stranger betook himself to the queens palace where as soon as the proper hour arrived he requested an audience  when he saw the queen he perceived that she was very pale and that her cheeks bore traces of recent tears you are back in good time she said to him but it makes very little difference whether you have succeeded in your mission or not there is no longer any museum there has been a great robbery and the thieves have carried off the whole of the vast and valuable collection which i have been so long in making  i know of that affair said the stranger and i have already placed in your museumbuilding the collection which i have obtained if your majesty pleases i shall be glad to have you look at it it may in some degree compensate for that which has been stolen  compensate cried the queen nothing can compensate for it i do not even wish to see what you have brought  be that as your majesty pleases said the stranger but i will be so bold as to say that i have great hopes that the collection which i have obtained will interest the people will your majesty graciously allow them to see it  i have no objection to that said the queen and indeed i shall be very glad if they can be made to be interested in the museum i will give orders that the prisons be opened so that everybody can go to see what you have brought and those who shall be interested in it may return to their homes i did not release my obstinate subjects when the museum was robbed because their fault then was just as great as it was before and it would not be right that they should profit by my loss  the queens proclamation was made and for several days the museum was crowded with people moving from morning till night through the vast collection of stuffed animals birds and fishes rare and brilliant insects mineral and vegetable curiosities beautiful works of art and all the strange valuable and instructive objects which had been brought from the interminable vaults of the magician alfrarmedj the queens officers who had been sent to observe whether or not the people were interested were in no doubt upon this point every eye sparkled with delight for every one found something which was the very thing he wished to see and in the throng was the hermits pupil standing in rapt ecstasy before a large case containing all sorts of fishingtackle from the smallest hooks for little minnows to the great irons and spears used in capturing whales  no one went back to prison and the city was full of reunited households and happy homes on the morning of the fourth day a grand procession of citizens came to the palace to express to the queen their delight and appreciation of her museum the great happiness of her subjects could but please the queen she called the stranger to her and said to him  tell me how you came to know what it was that would interest my people  i asked them said the stranger that is to say i arranged that they should be asked  that was well done said the queen but it is a great pity that my long labors in their behalf should have been lost for many years i have been a collector of buttonholes and there was nothing valuable or rare in the line of my studies of which i had not an original specimen or a facsimile my agents brought me from foreign lands even from the most distant islands of the sea buttonholes of every kind in silk in wool in cloth of gold in every imaginable material and of those which could not be obtained careful copies were made there was not a duplicate specimen in the whole collection only one of each kind nothing repeated never before was there such a museum with all my power i strove to educate my people up to an appreciation of buttonholes but with the exception of a few tailors and seamstresses nobody took the slightest interest in what i had provided for their benefit i am glad that my people are happy but i cannot restrain a sigh for the failure of my efforts  the longer your majesty lives said the stranger the better you will understand that we cannot make other people like a thing simply because we like it ourselves  stranger said the queen gazing upon him with admiration are you a king in disguise  i am he replied  i thought i perceived it said the queen and i wish to add that i believe you are far better able to govern this kingdom than i am if you choose i will resign it to you  not so your majesty said the other i would not deprive you of your royal position but i should be happy to share it with you  that will answer very well said the queen and turning to an attendant she gave orders that preparations should be made for their marriage on the following day  after the royal wedding which was celebrated with great pomp and grandeur the queen paid a visit to the museum and much to her surprise was greatly delighted and interested the king then informed her that he happened to know where the robbers had stored her collection which they could not sell or make use of and if she wished he would regain the collection and erect a building for its reception  we will not do that at present said the queen when i shall have thoroughly examined and studied all these objects most of which are entirely new to me we will decide about the buttonholes  the hermits pupil did not return to his cave he was greatly delighted with the spice and dash of a robbers life so different from that of a hermit and he determined if possible to change his business and enter the band he had a conversation with the captain on the subject and that individual encouraged him in his purpose  i am tired the captain said of a robbers life i have stolen so much that i cannot use what i have i take no further interest in accumulating spoils the quiet of a hermits life attracts me and if you like we will change places i will become the pupil of your old master and you shall be the captain of my band  the change was made the captain retired to the cave of the hermits pupil while the latter with the hearty consent of all the men took command of the band of robbers  when the king heard of this change he was not at all pleased and he sent for the expupil  i am willing to reward you he said for assisting me in my recent undertaking but i cannot allow you to lead a band of robbers in my dominions  a dark shade of disappointment passed over the expupils features and his face lengthened visibly  it is too bad he said to be thus cut short at the very outset of a brilliant career ill tell you what ill do he added suddenly his face brightening if youll let me keep on in my new profession ill promise to do nothing but rob robbers  very well said the king if you will confine yourself to that you may retain your position  the members of the band were perfectly willing to rob in the new way for it seemed quite novel and exciting to them the first place they robbed was their own cave and as they all had excellent memories they knew from whom the various goods had been stolen and every thing was returned to its proper owner the expupil then led his band against the other dens of robbers in the kingdom and his movements were conducted with such dash and vigor that the various hordes scattered in every direction while the treasures in their dens were returned to the owners or if these could not be found were given to the poor in a short time every robber except those led by the expupil had gone into some other business and the victorious youth led his band into other kingdoms to continue the great work of robbing robbers  the queen never sent for the collection of curiosities which the robbers had stolen from her she was so much interested in the new museum that she continually postponed the reestablishment of her old one and as far as can be known the buttonholes are still in the cave where the robbers shut them up       christmas before last  or the fruit of the fragile palm                                       the horn o plenty was a fine big oldfashioned ship very high in the bow very high in the stern with a quarterdeck always carpeted in fine weather because her captain could not see why one should not make himself comfortable at sea as well as on land covajos maroots was her captain and a fine jolly oldfashioned elderly sailor he was the horn o plenty always sailed upon one sea and always between two ports one on the west side of the sea and one on the east the port on the west was quite a large city in which captain covajos had a married son and the port on the east was another city in which he had a married daughter in each family he had several grandchildren and consequently it was a great joy to the jolly old sailor to arrive at either port the captain was very particular about his cargo and the horn o plenty was generally laden with good things to eat or sweet things to smell or fine things to wear or beautiful things to look at once a merchant brought to him some boxes of bitter aloes and mustard plasters but captain covajos refused to take them into his ship  i know said he that such things are very useful and necessary at times but you would better send them over in some other vessel the horn o plenty has never carried any thing that to look at to taste or to smell did not delight the souls of old and young i am sure you cannot say that of these commodities if i were to put such things on board my ship it would break the spell which more than fifty savory voyages have thrown around it  there were sailors who sailed upon that sea who used to say that sometimes when the weather was hazy and they could not see far they would know they were about to meet the horn o plenty before she came in sight her planks and timbers and even her sails and masts had gradually become so filled with the odor of good things that the winds that blew over her were filled with an agreeable fragrance  there was another thing about which captain covajos was very particular he always liked to arrive at one of his ports a few days before christmas never in the course of his long life had the old sailor spent a christmas at sea and now that he had his fine grandchildren to help make the holidays merry it would have grieved him very much if he had been unable to reach one or the other of his ports in good season his jolly old vessel was generally heavily laden and very slow and there were many days of calms on that sea when she did not sail at all so that her voyages were usually very very long but the captain fixed the days of sailing so as to give himself plenty of time to get to the other end of his course before christmas came around  one spring however he started too late and when he was about the middle of his voyage he called to him baragat bean his old boatswain this venerable sailor had been with the captain ever since he had commanded the horn o plenty and on important occasions he was always consulted in preference to the other officers none of whom had served under captain covajos more then fifteen or twenty years  baragat said the captain we have just passed the isle of guineahens you can see its one mountain standing up against the sky to the north  aye aye sir said old baragat there she stands the same as usual  that makes it plain said the captain that we are not yet halfway across and i am very much afraid that i shall not be able to reach my dear daughters house before christmas  that would be doleful indeed said baragat but ive feared something of the kind for weve had calms nearly every other day and sometimes when the wind did blow it came from the wrong direction and its my belief that the ship sailed backward  that was very bad management said the captain the chief mate should have seen to it that the sails were turned in such a manner that the ship could not go backward if that sort of thing happened often it would become quite a serious affair  but what is done cant be helped said the boatswain and i dont see how you are going to get into port before christmas  nor do i said the captain gazing out over the sea  it would give me a sad turn sir said baragat to see you spend christmas at sea a thing you never did before nor ever shall do if i can help it if youll take my advice sir youll turn around and go back its a shorter distance to the port we started from than to the one we are going to and if we turn back now i am sure we all shall be on shore before the holidays  go back to my sons house exclaimed captain covajos where i was last winter why that would be like spending last christmas over again  but that would be better than having none at all sir said the boatswain and a christmas at sea would be about equal to none  good exclaimed the captain i will give up the coming christmas with my daughter and her children and go back and spend last christmas over again with my son and his dear boys and girls have the ship turned around immediately baragat and tell the chief mate i do not wish to sail backward if it can possibly be avoided  for a week or more the horn o plenty sailed back upon her track towards the city where dwelt the captains son the weather was fine the carpet was never taken up from the quarterdeck and every thing was going on very well when a man who happened to have an errand at one of the topmasts came down and reported that far away to the north he had seen a little open boat with some people in it  ah me said captain covajos it must be some poor fellows who are shipwrecked it will take us out of our course but we must not leave them to their fate have the ship turned about so that it will sail northward  it was not very long before they came up with the boat and much to the captains surprise he saw that it was filled with boys  who are you he cried as soon as he was near enough and where do you come from  we are the first class in long division said the oldest boy and we are cast away have you any thing to eat that you can spare us we are almost famished  we have plenty of every thing said the captain come on board instantly and all your wants shall be supplied  how long have you been without food he asked when the boys were on the deck of the vessel  we have had nothing to eat since breakfast said one of them and it is now late in the afternoon some of us are nearly dead from starvation  it is very hard for boys to go so long without eating said the good captain and leading them below he soon set them to work upon a bountiful meal  not until their hunger was fully satisfied did he ask them how they came to be cast away  you see sir said the oldest boy that we and the multiplication class had a holiday today and each class took a boat and determined to have a race so as to settle once for all which was the highest branch of arithmetic multiplication or long division our class rowed so hard that we entirely lost sight of the multiplicationers and found indeed that we were out of sight of every thing so that at last we did not know which was the way back and thus we became castaways  where is your school asked the captain  it is on apple island said the boy and although it is a long way off for a small boat with only four oars for nine boys it cant be very far for a ship  that is quite likely said the captain and we shall take you home baragat tell the chief mate to have the vessel turned toward apple island that we may restore these boys to their parents and guardians  now the chief mate had not the least idea in the world where apple island was but he did not like to ask because that would be confessing his ignorance so he steered his vessel toward a point where he believed he had once seen an island which probably was the one in question the horn o plenty sailed in this direction all night and when day broke and there was no island in sight she took another course and so sailed this way and that for six or seven days without ever seeing a sign of land all this time the first class in long division was as happy as it could be for it was having a perfect holiday fishing off the sides of the vessel climbing up the ladders and ropes and helping the sailors whistle for wind but the captain now began to grow a little impatient for he felt he was losing time so he sent for the chief mate and said to him mildly but firmly  i know it is out of the line of your duty to search for island schools but if you really think that you do not know where apple island lies i wish you to say so frankly and openly  frankly and openly answered the mate i dont think i do  very well said the captain now that is a basis to work upon and we know where we stand you can take a little rest and let the second mate find the island but i can only give him three days in which to do it we really have no time to spare  the second mate was very proud of the responsibility placed upon him and immediately ordered the vessel to be steered due south  one is just as likely he said to find a totally unknown place by going straight ahead in a certain direction as by sailing here there and everywhere in this way you really get over more water and there is less wear and tear of the ship and rigging  so he sailed due south for two days and at the end of that time they came in sight of land this was quite a large island and when they approached near enough they saw upon its shores a very handsome city  is this apple island said captain covajos to the oldest boy  well sir answered the youth i am not sure i can say with certainty that i truly believe that it is but i think if we were to go on shore the people there would be able to tell us how to go to apple island  very likely said the good captain and we will go on shore and make inquiriesand it has struck me baragat he said that perhaps the merchants in the city where my son lives may be somewhat annoyed when the horn o plenty comes back with all their goods on board and not disposed of not understanding my motives they may be disposed to think ill of me consequently the idea has come into my head that it might be a good thing to stop here for a time and try to dispose of some of our merchandise the city seems to be quite prosperous and i have no doubt there are a number of merchants here  so the horn o plenty was soon anchored in the harbor and as many of the officers and crew as could be spared went on shore to make inquiries of course the first class in long division was not left behind and indeed they were ashore as soon as anybody the captain and his companions were cordially welcomed by some of the dignitaries of the city who had come down to the harbor to see the strange vessel but no one could give any information in regard to apple island the name of which had never been heard on those shores the captain was naturally desirous of knowing at what place he had landed and was informed that this was the island of the fragile palm  that is rather an odd name said the old captain why is it so called  the reason is this said his informant near the centre of the island stands a tall and very slender palmtree which has been growing there for hundreds of years it bears large and handsome fruit which is something like the cocoanut and in its perfection is said to be a transcendently delicious fruit  said to be exclaimed the captain are you not positive about it  no said the other no one living has ever tasted the fruit in its perfection when it becomes overripe it drops to the ground and even then it is considered royal property and is taken to the palace for the kings table but on fêtedays and grand occasions small bits of it are distributed to the populace  why dont you pick the fruit asked captain covajos when it is in its best condition to eat  it would be impossible said the citizen for any one to climb up that tree the trunk of which is so extremely delicate and fragile that the weight of a man would probably snap it and of course a ladder placed against it would produce the same result many attempts have been made to secure this fruit at the proper season but all of them have failed another palmtree of a more robust sort was once planted near this one in the hope that when it grew high enough men could climb up the stronger tree and get the fruit from the other but although we waited many years the second tree never attained sufficient height and it was cut down  it is a great pity said the captain but i suppose it cannot be helped and then he began to make inquiries about the merchants in the place and what probability there was of his doing a little trade here the captain soon discovered that the cargo of his ship was made up of goods which were greatly desired by the citizens of this place and for several days he was very busy in selling the good things to eat the sweet things to smell the fine things to wear and the beautiful things to look at with which the hold of the horn o plenty was crowded  during this time the first class in long division roamed in delight over the city the busy streets the shops the handsome buildings and the queer sights which they occasionally met interested and amused them greatly but still the boys were not satisfied they had heard of the fragile palm and they made up their minds to go and have a look at it therefore taking a guide they tramped out into the country and in about an hour they came in sight of the beautiful tree standing in the centre of the plain the trunk was indeed exceedingly slender and as the guide informed them the wood was of so very brittle a nature that if the tree had not been protected from the winds by the high hills which encircled it it would have been snapped off ages ago under the broad tuft of leaves that formed its top the boys saw hanging large clusters of the precious fruit great nuts as big as their heads  at what time of the year asked the oldest boy is that fruit just ripe enough to eat  now answered the guide this is the season when it is in the most perfect condition in about a month it will become entirely too ripe and soft and will drop but even then the king and all the rest of us are glad enough to get a taste of it  i should think the king would be exceedingly eager to get some of it just as it is said the boy  indeed he is replied the guide he and his father and i dont know how many grandfathers back have offered large rewards to any one who would procure them this fruit in its best condition but nobody has ever been able to get any yet  the reward still holds good i suppose said the head boy  oh yes answered the guide there never was a king who so much desired to taste the fruit as our present monarch  the oldest boy looked up at the top of the tree shut one eye and gave his head a little wag whereupon every boy in the class looked up shut one eye and slightly wagged his head after which the oldest boy said that he thought it was about time for them to go back to the ship  as soon as they reached the vessel and could talk together freely the boys had an animated discussion it was unanimously agreed that they would make an attempt to get some of the precious fruit from the fragile palm and the only difference of opinion among them was as to how it should be done most of them were in favor of some method of climbing the tree and trusting to its not breaking but this the oldest boy would not listen to the trunk might snap and then somebody would be hurt and he felt in a measure responsible for the rest of the class at length a good plan was proposed by a boy who had studied mechanics  what we ought to do with that tree said he is to put a hinge into her then we could let her down gently pick off the fruit and set her up again  but how are you going to do it asked the others  this is the way said the boy who had studied mechanics you take a saw and then about two feet from the ground you begin and saw down diagonally for a foot and a half to the centre of the trunk then you go on the other side and saw down in the same way the two outs meeting each other now you have the upper part of the trunk ending in a wedge which fits into a cleft in the lower part of the trunk then about nine inches below the place where you first began to saw you bore a hole straight through both sides of the cleft and the wedge between them then you put an iron bolt through this hole and you have your tree on a hinge only she wont be apt to move because she fits in so snug and tight then you get a long rope and put one end in a slipknot loosely around the trunk then you get a lot of poles and tie them end to end and push this slipknot up until it is somewhere near the top when you pull it tight then you take another rope with a slipknot and push this a little more than halfway up the trunk by having two ropes that way you prevent too much strain coming on any one part of the trunk then after that you take a mallet and chisel and round off the lower corners of the wedge so that it will turn easily in the cleft then we take hold of the ropes let her down gently pick off the fruit and haul her up again that will all be easy enough  this plan delighted the boys and they all pronounced in its favor but the oldest one suggested that it would be better to fasten the ropes to the trunk before they began to saw upon it and another boy asked how they were going to keep the tree standing when they hauled her up again  oh that is easy said the one who had studied mechanics you just bore another hole about six inches above the first one and put in another bolt then of course she cant move  this settled all the difficulties and it was agreed to start out early the next morning gather the fruit and claim the reward the king had offered they accordingly went to the captain and asked him for a sharp saw a mallet and chisel an auger two iron bolts and two very long ropes these having been cheerfully given to them were put away in readiness for the work to be attempted  very early on the next morning the first class in long division set out for the fragile palm carrying their tools and ropes few people were awake as they passed through the city and without being observed they reached the little plain on which the tree stood the ropes were attached at the proper places the tree was sawn diagonally according to the plan the bolt was put in and the corners of the wedge were rounded off then the eldest boy produced a pound of butter whereupon his comrades who had seized the ropes paused in surprise and asked him why he had brought the butter  i thought it well was the reply to bring along some butter because when the tree is down we can grease the hinge and then it will not be so hard to pull it up again  when all was ready eight of the boys took hold of the long ropes while another one with a pole pushed against the trunk of the fragile palm when it began to lean over a little he dropped his pole and ran to help the others with the ropes slowly the tree moved on its hinge descending at first very gradually but it soon began to move with greater rapidity although the boys held it back with all their strength and in spite of their most desperate efforts the top came to the ground at last with a great thump and then they all dropped their ropes and ran for the fruit fortunately the great nuts incased in their strong husks were not in the least injured and the boys soon pulled them off about forty in all some of the boys were in favor of cracking open a few of the nuts and eating them but this the eldest boy positively forbade  this fruit he said is looked upon as almost sacred and if we were to eat any of it it is probable that we should be put to death which would be extremely awkward for fellows who have gone to all the trouble we have had we must set up the tree and carry the fruit to the king  according to this advice they thoroughly greased the hinge in the tree with the butter and then set themselves to work to haul up the trunk this however was much more difficult than letting it down and they had to lift up the head of it and prop it up on poles before they could pull upon it with advantage the tree although tall was indeed a very slender one with a small top and if it had been as fragile as it was supposed to be the boys efforts would surely have broken it at last after much tugging and warm work they pulled it into an upright position and put in the second bolt they left the ropes on the tree because as some of them had suggested the people might want to let the tree down again the next year it would have been difficult for the boys to carry in their arms the great pile of fruit they had gathered but having noticed a basketmakers cottage on their way to the tree two of them were sent to buy one of his largest baskets or hampers this was attached to two long poles and having been filled with the nuts the boys took the poles on their shoulders and marched into the city  on their way to the palace they attracted a great crowd and when they were ushered into the presence of the king his surprise and delight knew no bounds at first he could scarcely believe his eyes but he had seen the fruit so often that there could be no mistake about it  i shall not ask you he said to the boys how you procured this fruit and thus accomplished a deed which has been the object of the ambition of myself and my forefathers all i ask is did you leave the tree standing  we did said the boys  then all that remains to be done said his majesty is to give you the reward you have so nobly earned treasurer measure out to each of them a quart of gold coin and pray be quick about it for i am wild with desire to have a table spread and one of these nuts cracked that i may taste of its luscious contents  the boys however appeared a little dissatisfied huddling together they consulted in a low tone and then the eldest boy addressed the king  may it please your majesty he said we should very much prefer to have you give each of us one of those nuts instead of a quart of gold  the king looked grave this is a much greater reward he said than i had ever expected to pay but since you ask it you must have it you have done something which none of my subjects has ever been able to accomplish and it is right therefore that you should be fully satisfied  so he gave them each a nut with which they departed in triumph to the ship  by the afternoon of the next day the captain had sold all his cargo at very good prices and when the money was safely stored away in the horn o plenty he made ready to sail for he declared he had really no time to spare i must now make all possible haste he said to old baragat to find apple island put these boys ashore and then speed away to the city where lives my son we must not fail to get there in time to spend last christmas over again  on the second day after the horn o plenty had left the island of the fragile palm one of the sailors who happened to be aloft noticed a low black and exceedingly unpleasantlooking vessel rapidly approaching this soon proved to be the ship of a band of corsairs who having heard of the large amount of money on the horn o plenty had determined to pursue her and capture the rich prize all sails were set upon the horn o plenty but it soon became plain that she could never outsail the corsair vessel  what our ship can do better than any thing else said baragat to the captain is to stop short stop her short and let the other one go by  this manoeuvre was executed but although the corsair passed rapidly by not being able to stop so suddenly it soon turned around and came back its decks swarming with savage men armed to the teeth  they are going to board us cried baragat they are getting out their grapplingirons and they will fasten the two ships together  let all assemble on the quarterdeck said the captain it is higher there and we shall not be so much exposed to accidents  the corsair ship soon ran alongside the horn o plenty and in a moment the two vessels were fastened together and then the corsairs every man of them each with cutlass in hand and a belt full of dirks and knives swarmed up the side of the horn o plenty and sprang upon its central deck some of the ferocious fellows seeing the officers and crew all huddled together upon the quarterdeck made a movement in that direction this so frightened the chief mate that he sprang down upon the deck of the corsair ship a panic now arose and he was immediately followed by the officers and crew the boys of course were not to be left behind and the captain and baragat felt themselves bound not to desert the crew and so they jumped also none of the corsairs interfered with this proceeding for each one of them was anxious to find the money at once when the passengers and crew of the horn o plenty were all on board the corsair ship baragat came to the captain and said  if i were you sir id cast off those grapnels and separate the vessels if we dont do that those rascals when they have finished robbing our moneychests will come back here and murder us all  that is a good idea said captain covajos and he told the chief mate to give orders to cast off the grapnels push the two vessels apart and set some of the sails  when this had been done the corsair vessel began to move away from the other and was soon many lengths distant from her when the corsairs came on deck and perceived what had happened they were infuriated and immediately began to pursue their own vessel with the one they had captured but the horn o plenty could not by any possibility sail as fast as the corsair ship and the latter easily kept away from her  now then said baragat to the captain what you have to do is easy enough sail straight for our port and those searobbers will follow you for of course they will wish to get their own vessel back again and will hope by some carelessness on our part to overtake us in the mean time the money will be safe enough for they will have no opportunity of spending it and when we come to port we can take some soldiers on board and go back and capture those fellows they can never sail away from us on the horn o plenty  that is an admirable plan said the captain and i shall carry it out but i cannot sail to port immediately i must first find apple island and land these boys whose parents and guardians are probably growing very uneasy i suppose the corsairs will continue to follow us wherever we go  i hope so said baragat at any rate we shall see  the first class in long division was very much delighted with the change of vessels and the boys rambled everywhere and examined with great interest all that belonged to the corsairs they felt quite easy about the only treasures they possessed because when they had first seen the piratical vessel approaching they had taken the precious nuts which had been given to them by the king and had hidden them at the bottom of some large boxes in which the captain kept the sailors winter clothes  in this warm climate said the eldest boy the robbers will never meddle with those winter clothes and our precious fruit will be perfectly safe  if you had taken my advice said one of the other boys we should have eaten some of the nuts those at least we should have been sure of  and we should have had that many less to show to the other classes said the eldest boy nuts like these i am told if picked at the proper season will keep for a long time  for some days the corsairs on board the horn o plenty followed their own vessel but then they seemed to despair of ever being able to overtake it and steered in another direction this threatened to ruin all the plans of captain covajos and his mind became troubled then the boy who had studied mechanics came forward and said to the captain  ill tell you what id do sir if i were you id follow your old ship and when night came on id sail up quite near to her and let some of your sailors swim quietly over and fasten a cable to her and then you could tow her after you wherever you wished to go  but they might unfasten the cable or cut it said baragat who was standing by  that could easily be prevented said the boy at their end of the cable must be a stout chain which they cannot cut and it must be fastened so far beneath the surface of the water that they will not be able to reach it to unfasten it  a most excellent plan said captain covajos let it be carried out  as soon as it became quite dark the corsair vessel quietly approached the other and two stout sailors from finland who swam very well were ordered to swim over and attach the chainend of a long cable to the horn o plenty it was a very difficult operation for the chain was heavy but the men succeeded at last and returned to report  we put the chain on fast and strong sir they said to the captain and six feet under water but the only place we could find to make it fast to was the bottom of the rudder  that will do very well remarked baragat for the horn o plenty sails better backward than forward and will not be so hard to tow  for week after week and month after month captain covajos in the corsair vessel sailed here and there in search of apple island always towing after him the horn o plenty with the corsairs on board but never an island with a school on it could they find and one day old baragat came to the captain and said  if i were you sir id sail no more in these warm regions i am quite sure that apples grow in colder latitudes and are never found so far south as this  that is a good idea said captain covajos we should sail for the north if we wished to find an island of apples have the vessel turned northward  and so for days and weeks the two vessels slowly moved on to the north one day the captain made some observations and calculations and then he hastily summoned baragat  do you know said he that i find it is now near the end of november and i am quite certain that we shall not get to the port where my son lives in time to celebrate last christmas again it is dreadfully slow work towing after us the horn o plenty full of corsairs wherever we go but we cannot cast her off and sail straight for our port for i should lose my good ship the merchants would lose all their money and the corsairs would go unpunished and besides all that think of the misery of the parents and guardians of those poor boys no i must endeavor to find apple island and if i cannot reach port in time to spend last christmas with my son i shall certainly get there in season for christmas before last it is true that i spent that christmas with my daughter but i cannot go on to her now i am much nearer the city where my son lives and besides it is necessary to go back and give the merchants their money so now we shall have plenty of time and need not feel hurried  no said baragat heaving a vast sigh we need not feel hurried  the mind of the eldest boy now became very much troubled and he called his companions about him i dont like at all said he this sailing to the north it is now november and although it is warm enough at this season in the southern part of the sea it will become colder and colder as we go on the consequence of this will be that those corsairs will want winter clothes they will take them out of the captains chests and they will find our fruit  the boys groaned that is true said one of them but still we wish to go back to our island  of course said the eldest boy it is quite proper that we should return to long division but think of the hard work we did to get that fruit and think of the quarts of gold we gave up for it it would be too bad to lose it now  it was unanimously agreed that it would be too bad to lose the fruit and it was also unanimously agreed that they wished to go back to apple island but what to do about it they did not know  day by day the weather grew colder and colder and the boys became more and more excited and distressed for fear they should lose their precious fruit the eldest boy lay awake for several nights and then a plan came into his head he went to captain covajos and proposed that he should send a flag of truce over to the corsairs offering to exchange winter clothing he would send over to them the heavy garments they had left on their own vessel and in return would take the boxes of clothes intended for the winter wear of his sailors in this way they would get their fruit back without the corsairs knowing any thing about it the captain considered this an excellent plan and ordered the chief mate to take a boat and a flag of truce and go over to the horn o plenty and make the proposition the eldest boy and two of the others insisted on going also in order that there might be no mistake about the boxes but when the flagoftruce party reached the horn o plenty they found not a corsair there every man of them had gone they had taken with them all the moneychests but to the great delight of the boys the boxes of winter clothes had not been disturbed and in them still nestled safe and sound the precious nuts of the fragile palm  when the matter had been thoroughly looked into it became quite evident what the corsairs had done there had been only one boat on board the horn o plenty and that was the one on which the first class in long division had arrived the night before the two vessels had passed within a mile or so of a large island which the captain had approached in the hope it was the one they were looking for and they passed it so slowly that the corsairs had time to ferry themselves over a few at a time in the little boat taking with them the moneyand all without discovery  captain covajos was greatly depressed when he heard of the loss of all the money  i shall have a sad tale to tell my merchants he said and christmas before last will not be celebrated so joyously as it was the first time but we cannot help what has happened and we all must endeavor to bear our losses with patience we shall continue our search for apple island but i shall go on board my own ship for i have greatly missed my carpeted quarterdeck and my other comforts the chief mate however and a majority of the crew shall remain on board the corsair vessel and continue to tow us the horn o plenty sails better stern foremost and we shall go faster that way  the boys were overjoyed at recovering their fruit and most of them were in favor of cracking two or three of the great nuts and eating their contents in honor of the occasion but the eldest boy dissuaded them  the good captain he said has been very kind in endeavoring to take us back to our school and still intends to keep up the search for dear old apple island the least we can do for him is to give him this fruit which is all we have and let him do what he pleases with it this is the only way in which we can show our gratitude to him  the boys turned their backs on one another and each of them gave his eyes a little rub but they all agreed to give the fruit to the captain  when the good old man received his present he was much affected i will accept what you offer me he said for if i did not i know your feelings would be wounded but you must keep one of the nuts for yourselves and more than that if we do not find apple island in the course of the coming year i invite you all to spend christmas before last over again with me at my sons house  all that winter the two ships sailed up and down and here and there but never could they find apple island when christmastime came old baragat went around among the boys and the crew and told them it would be well not to say a word on the subject to the captain for his feelings were very tender in regard to spending christmas away from his families and the thing had never happened before so nobody made any allusion to the holidays and they passed over as if they had been ordinary days  during the spring and all through the summer the two ships kept up the unavailing search but when the autumn began captain covajos said to old baragat i am very sorry but i feel that i can no longer look for apple island i must go back and spend christmas before last over again with my dearest son and if these poor boys never return to their homes i am sure they cannot say it was any fault of mine  no sir said baragat i think you have done all that could be expected of you  so the ships sailed to the city on the west side of the sea and the captain was received with great joy by his son and his grandchildren he went to the merchants and told them how he had lost all their money he hoped they would be able to bear their misfortune with fortitude and begged as he could do nothing else for them that they would accept the eight great nuts from the fragile palm that the boys had given him to his surprise the merchants became wild with delight when they received the nuts the money they had lost was as nothing they said compared to the value of this incomparable and precious fruit picked in its prime and still in a perfect condition  it had been many many generations since this rare fruit the value of which was like unto that of diamonds and pearls had been for sale in any market in the world and kings and queens in many countries were ready to give for it almost any price that might be asked  when the good old captain heard this he was greatly rejoiced and as the holidays were now near he insisted that the boys should spend christmas before last over again at his sons house he found that a good many people here knew where apple island was and he made arrangements for the first class in long division to return to that island in a vessel which was to sail about the first of the year  the boys still possessed the great nut which the captain had insisted they should keep for themselves and he now told them that if they chose to sell it they would each have a nice little fortune to take back with them the eldest boy consulted the others and then he said to the captain  our class has gone through a good many hardships and has had a lot of trouble with that palmtree and other things and we think we ought to be rewarded so if it is all the same to you i think we will crack the nut on christmas day and we all will eat it  i never imagined cried captain covajos as he sat on that christmas day surrounded by his sons family and the first class in long division the eyes of the whole party sparkling with ecstasy as they tasted the peerless fruit of the fragile palm that christmas before last could be so joyfully celebrated over again       prince hassaks march                                       in the spring of a certain year long since passed away prince hassak of itoby determined to visit his uncle the king of yan  whenever my uncle visited us said the prince or when my late father went to see him the journey was always made by sea and in order to do this it was necessary to go in a very roundabout way between itoby and yan now i shall do nothing of this kind it is beneath the dignity of a prince to go out of his way on account of capes peninsulas and promontories i shall march from my palace to that of my uncle in a straight line i shall go across the country and no obstacle shall cause me to deviate from my course mountains and hills shall be tunnelled rivers shall be bridged houses shall be levelled a road shall be cut through forests and when i have finished my march the course over which i have passed shall be a mathematically straight line thus will i show to the world that when a prince desires to travel it is not necessary for him to go out of his way on account of obstacles  as soon as possible after the prince had determined upon this march he made his preparations and set out he took with him a few courtiers and a large body of miners rocksplitters bridgebuilders and workmen of that class whose services would very probably be needed besides these he had an officer whose duty it was to point out the direct course to be taken and another who was to draw a map of the march showing the towns mountains and the various places it passed through there were no compasses in those days but the coursemarker had an instrument which he would set in a proper direction by means of the stars and then he could march by it all day besides these persons prince hassak selected from the schools of his city five boys and five girls and took them with him he wished to show them how when a thing was to be done the best way was to go straight ahead and do it turning aside for nothing  when they grow up they will teach these things to their children said he and thus i shall instil good principles into my people  the first day prince hassak and his party marched over a level country with no further trouble than that occasioned by the tearing down of fences and walls and the destruction of a few cottages and barns after encamping for the night they set out the next morning but had not marched many miles before they came to a rocky hill on the top of which was a handsome house inhabited by a jollycumpop  your highness said the coursemarker in order to go in a direct line we must make a tunnel through this hill immediately under the house this may cause the building to fall in but the rubbish can be easily removed  let the men go to work said the prince i will dismount from my horse and watch the proceedings  when the jollycumpop saw the party halt before his house he hurried out to pay his respects to the prince when he was informed of what was to be done the jollycumpop could not refrain from laughing aloud  i never heard he said of such a capital idea it is so odd and original it will be very funny i am sure to see a tunnel cut right under my house  the miners and rocksplitters now began to work at the base of the hill and then the jollycumpop made a proposition to the prince  it will take your men some time he said to cut this tunnel and it is a pity your highness should not be amused in the meanwhile it is a fine day suppose we go into the forest and hunt  this suited the prince very well for he did not care about sitting under a tree and watching his workmen and the jollycumpop having sent for his horse and some bows and arrows the whole party with the exception of the laborers rode toward the forest a short distance away  what shall we find to hunt asked the prince of the jollycumpop  i really do not know exclaimed the latter but well hunt whatever we happen to seedeer small birds rabbits griffins rhinoceroses any thing that comes along i feel as gay as a skipping grasshopper my spirits rise like a soaring bird what a joyful thing it is to have such a hunt on such a glorious day  the gay and happy spirits of the jollycumpop affected the whole party and they rode merrily through the forest but they found no game and after an hour or two they emerged into the open country again at a distance on a slight elevation stood a large and massive building  i am hungry and thirsty said the prince and perhaps we can get some refreshments at yonder house so far this has not been a very fine hunt  no cried the jollycumpop not yet but what a joyful thing to see a hospitable mansion just at the moment when we begin to feel a little tired and hungry  the building they were approaching belonged to a potentate who lived at a great distance in some of his travels he had seen this massive house and thought it would make a good prison he accordingly bought it fitted it up as a jail and appointed a jailer and three myrmidons to take charge of it this had occurred years before but no prisoners had ever been sent to this jail a few days preceding the jollycumpops hunt the potentate had journeyed this way and had stopped at his jail after inquiring into its condition he had said to the jailer  it is now fourteen years since i appointed you to this place and in all that time there have been no prisoners and you and your men have been drawing your wages without doing any thing i shall return this way in a few days and if i still find you idle i shall discharge you all and close the jail  this filled the jailer with great dismay for he did not wish to lose his good situation when he saw the prince and his party approaching the thought struck him that perhaps he might make prisoners of them and so not be found idle when the potentate returned he came out to meet the hunters and when they asked if they could here find refreshment he gave them a most cordial welcome his men took their horses and inviting them to enter he showed each member of the party into a small bedroom of which there seemed to be a great many  here are water and towels he said to each one and when you have washed your face and hands your refreshments will be ready then going out he locked the door on the outside  the party numbered seventeen the prince three courtiers five boys five girls the coursemarker the mapmaker and the jollycumpop the heart of the jailer was joyful seventeen inmates was something to be proud of he ordered his myrmidons to give the prisoners a meal of bread and water through the holes in their celldoors and then he sat down to make out his report to the potentate  they must all be guilty of crimes he said to himself which are punished by long imprisonment i dont want any of them executed  so he numbered his prisoners from one to seventeen according to the cell each happened to be in and he wrote a crime opposite each number the first was highway robbery the next forgery and after that followed treason smuggling barnburning bribery poaching usury piracy witchcraft assault and battery using false weights and measures burglary counterfeiting robbing henroosts conspiracy and poisoning his grandmother by proxy  this report was scarcely finished when the potentate returned he was very much surprised to find that seventeen prisoners had come in since his previous visit and he read the report with interest  here is one who ought to be executed he said referring to number seventeen and how did he poison his grandmother by proxy did he get another woman to be poisoned in her stead or did he employ some one to act in his place as the poisoner  i have not yet been fully informed my lord said the jailer fearful that he should lose a prisoner but this is his first offence and his grandmother who did not die has testified to his general good character  very well said the potentate but if he ever does it again let him be executed and by the way i should like to see the prisoners  thereupon the jailer conducted the potentate along the corridors and let him look through the holes in the doors at the prisoners within  what is this little girl in for he asked  the jailer looked at the number over the door and then at his report  piracy he answered  a strange offence for such a child said the potentate  they often begin that sort of thing very early in life said the jailer  and this fine gentleman said the potentate looking in at the prince what did he do  the jailer glanced at the number and the report  robbed henroosts he said  he must have done a good deal of it to afford to dress so well said the potentate passing on and looking into other cells it seems to me that many of your prisoners are very young  it is best to take them young my lord said the jailer they are very hard to catch when they grow up  the potentate then looked in at the jollycumpop and asked what was his offence  conspiracy was the answer  and where are the other conspirators  there was only one said the jailer  number seventeen was the oldest of the courtiers  he appears to be an elderly man to have a grandmother said the potentate she must be very aged and that makes it all the worse for him i think he should be executed  oh no my lord cried the jailor i am assured that his crime was quite unintentional  then he should be set free said the potentate  i mean to say said the jailer that it was just enough intentional to cause him to be imprisoned here for a long time but not enough to deserve execution  very well said the potentate turning to leave take good care of your prisoners and send me a report every month  that will i do my lord said the jailer bowing very low  the prince and his party had been very much surprised and incensed when they found that they could not get out of their rooms and they had kicked and banged and shouted until they were tired but the jailer had informed them that they were to be confined there for years and when the potentate arrived they had resigned themselves to despair the jollycumpop however was affected in a different way it seemed to him the most amusing joke in the world that a person should deliberately walk into a prisoncell and be locked up for several years and he lay down on his little bed and laughed himself to sleep  that night one of the boys sat at his ironbarred window wide awake he was a truant and had never yet been in any place from which he could not run away he felt that his schoolfellows depended upon him to run away and bring them assistance and he knew that his reputation as a truant was at stake his responsibility was so heavy that he could not sleep and he sat at the window trying to think of a way to get out after some hours the moon arose and by its light he saw upon the grass not far from his window a number of little creatures which at first he took for birds or small squirrels but on looking more attentively he perceived that they were pigwidgeons they were standing around a flat stone and seemed to be making calculations on it with a piece of chalk at this sight the heart of the truant jumped for joy pigwidgeons can do any thing he said to himself and these certainly can get us out he now tried in various ways to attract the attention of the pigwidgeons but as he was afraid to call or whistle very loud for fear of arousing the jailor he did not succeed happily he thought of a peashooter which he had in his pocket and taking this out he blew a pea into the midst of the little group with such force that it knocked the chalk from the hand of the pigwidgeon who was using it the little fellows looked up in astonishment and perceived the truant beckoning to them from his window at first they stood angrily regarding him but on his urging them in a loud whisper to come to his relief they approached the prison and clambering up a vine soon reached his windowsill the truant now told his mournful tale to which the pigwidgeons listened very attentively and then after a little consultation among themselves one of them said we will get you out if you will tell us how to divide fivesevenths by six  the poor truant was silent for an instant and then he said that is not the kind of thing i am good at but i expect some of the other fellows could tell you easily enough our windows must be all in a row and you can climb up and ask some of them and if any one tells you will you get us all out  yes said the pigwidgeon who had spoken before we will do that for we are very anxious to know how to divide fivesevenths by six we have been working at it for four or five days and there wont be any thing worth dividing if we wait much longer  the pigwidgeons now began to descend the vine but one of them lingering a little the truant who had a great deal of curiosity asked him what it was they had to divide  there were eight of us the pigwidgeon answered who helped a farmers wife and she gave us a pound of butter she did not count us properly and divided the butter into seven parts we did not notice this at first and two of the party who were obliged to go away to a distance took their portions and departed and now we can not divide among six the fivesevenths that remain  that is a pretty hard thing said the truant but i am sure some of the boys can tell you how to do it  the pigwidgeons visited the next four cells which were occupied by four boys but not one of them could tell how to divide fivesevenths by six the prince was questioned but he did not know and neither did the coursemarker nor the mapmaker it was not until they came to the cell of the oldest girl that they received an answer she was good at mental arithmetic and after a minutes thought she said it would be five fortyseconds  good cried the pigwidgeons we will divide the butter into fortytwo parts and each take five and now let us go to work and cut these bars  three of the six pigwidgeons were workers in iron and they had their little files and saws in pouches by their sides they went to work manfully and the others helped them and before morning one bar was cut in each of the seventeen windows the cells were all on the ground floor and it was quite easy for the prisoners to clamber out that is it was easy for all but the jollycumpop he had laughed so much in his life that he had grown quite fat and he found it impossible to squeeze himself through the opening made by the removal of one iron bar the sixteen other prisoners had all departed the pigwidgeons had hurried away to divide their butter into fortytwo parts and the jollycumpop still remained in his cell convulsed with laughter at the idea of being caught in such a curious predicament  it is the most ridiculous thing in the world he said i suppose i must stay here and cry until i get thin and the idea so tickled him that he laughed himself to sleep  the prince and his party kept together and hurried from the prison as fast as they could when the day broke they had gone several miles and then they stopped to rest where is that jollycumpop said the prince i suppose he has gone home he is a pretty fellow to lead us into this trouble and then desert us how are we to find the way back to his house coursemarker can you tell us the direction in which we should go  not until tonight your highness answered the coursemarker when i can set my instrument by the stars  the princes party was now in a doleful plight every one was very hungry they were in an open plain no house was visible and they knew not which way to go they wandered about for some time looking for a brook or a spring where they might quench their thirst and then a rabbit sprang out from some bushes the whole party immediately started off in pursuit of the rabbit they chased it here there backward and forward through hollows and over hills until it ran quite away and disappeared then they were more tired thirsty and hungry than before and to add to their miseries when night came on the sky was cloudy and the coursemarker could not set his instrument by the stars it would be difficult to find sixteen more miserable people than the prince and his companions when they awoke the next morning from their troubled sleep on the hard ground nearly starved they gazed at one another with feelings of despair  i feel said the prince in a weak voice that there is nothing i would not do to obtain food i would willingly become a slave if my master would give me a good breakfast  so would i ejaculated each of the others  about an hour after this as they were all sitting disconsolately upon the ground they saw slowly approaching a large cart drawn by a pair of oxen on the front of the cart which seemed to be heavily loaded sat a man with a red beard reading a book the boys when they saw the cart set up a feeble shout and the man lifting his eyes from his book drove directly toward the group on the ground dismounting he approached prince hassak who immediately told him his troubles and implored relief we will do any thing said the prince to obtain food  standing for a minute in a reflective mood the man with the red beard addressed the prince in a slow meditative manner how would you like he said to form a nucleus  can we get any thing to eat by it eagerly asked the prince  yes replied the man you can  well do it immediately cried the whole sixteen without waiting for further information  which will you do first said the man listen to my explanations or eat  eat cried the entire sixteen in chorus  the man now produced from his cart a quantity of bread meat wine and other provisions which he distributed generously but judiciously to the hungry prince and his followers every one had enough but no one too much and soon revived and strengthened they felt like new beings  now said the prince we are ready to form a nucleus as we promised how is it done  i will explain the matter to you in a few words said the man with the red beard for a long time i have been desirous to found a city in order to do this one must begin by forming a nucleus every great city is started from a nucleus a few persons settle down in some particular spot and live there then they are a nucleus then other people come there and gather around this nucleus and then more people come and more until in course of time there is a great city i have loaded this cart with provisions tools and other things that are necessary for my purpose and have set out to find some people who would be willing to form a nucleus i am very glad to have found you and that you are willing to enter into my plan and this seems a good spot for us to settle upon  what is the first thing to be done said the prince  we must all go to work said the man with the red beard to build dwellings and also a schoolhouse for these young people then we must till some ground in the suburbs and lay the foundations at least of a few public buildings  all this will take a good while will it not said the prince  yes said the man it will take a good while and the sooner we set about it the better  thereupon tools were distributed among the party and prince courtiers boys girls and all went to work to build houses and form the nucleus of a city  when the jailer looked into his cells in the morning and found that all but one of his prisoners had escaped he was utterly astounded and his face when the jollycumpop saw him made that individual roar with laughter the jailer however was a man accustomed to deal with emergencies you need not laugh he said every thing shall go on as before and i shall take no notice of the absence of your companions you are now numbered one to seventeen inclusive and you stand charged with highway robbery forgery treason smuggling barnburning bribery poaching usury piracy witchcraft assault and battery using false weights and measures burglary counterfeiting robbing henroosts conspiracy and poisoning your grandmother by proxy i intended today to dress the convicts in prison garb and you shall immediately be so clothed  i shall require seventeen suits said the jollycumpop  yes said the jailer they shall be furnished  and seventeen rations a day said the jollycumpop  certainly replied the jailer  this is luxury roared the jollycumpop i shall spend my whole time in eating and putting on clean clothes  seventeen large prison suits were now brought to the jollycumpop he put one on and hung up the rest in his cell these suits were half bright yellow and half bright green with spots of bright red as big as saucers  the jailer now had doors cut from one cell to another if the potentate comes here and wants to look at the prisoners he said to the jollycumpop you must appear in cell number one so that he can look through the hole in the door and see you then as he walks along the corridor you must walk through the cells and whenever he looks into a cell you must be there  he will think merrily replied the jollycumpop that all your prisoners are very fat and that the little girls have grown up into big men  i will endeavor to explain that said the jailer  for several days the jollycumpop was highly amused at the idea of his being seventeen criminals and he would sit first in one cell and then in another trying to look like a ferocious pirate a hardhearted usurer or a meanspirited chicken thief and laughing heartily at his failures but after a time he began to tire of this and to have a strong desire to see what sort of a tunnel the princes miners and rocksplitters were making under his house i had hoped he said to himself that i should pine away in confinement and so be able to get through the windowbars but with nothing to do and seventeen rations a day i see no chance of that but i must get out of this jail and as there seems no other way i will revolt thereupon he shouted to the jailer through the hole in the door of his cell we have revolted we have risen in a body and have determined to resist your authority and break jail  when the jailer heard this he was greatly troubled do not proceed to violence he said let us parley  very well replied the jollycumpop but you must open the cell door we cannot parley through a hole  the jailer thereupon opened the cell door and the jollycumpop having wrapped sixteen suits of clothes around his left arm as a shield and holding in his right hand the iron bar which had been cut from his window stepped boldly into the corridor and confronted the jailer and his myrmidons  it will be useless for you to resist he said you are but four and we are seventeen if you had been wise you would have made us all cheating shopkeepers chicken thieves or usurers then you might have been able to control us but when you see before you a desperate highwayman a daring smuggler a bloodthirsty pirate a wily poacher a powerful ruffian a reckless burglar a bold conspirator and a murderer by proxy you well may tremble  the jailer and his myrmidons looked at each other in dismay  we sigh for no blood continued the jollycumpop and will readily agree to terms we will give you your choice will you allow us to honorably surrender and peacefully disperse to our homes or shall we rush upon you in a body and after overpowering you by numbers set fire to the jail and escape through the crackling timbers of the burning pile  the jailer reflected for a minute it would be better perhaps he said that you should surrender and disperse to your homes  the jollycumpop agreed to these terms and the great gate being opened he marched out in good order now said he to himself the thing for me to do is to get home as fast as i can or that jailer may change his mind but being in a great hurry he turned the wrong way and walked rapidly into a country unknown to him his walk was a very merry one by this time he said to himself the prince and his followers have returned to my house and are tired of watching the rocksplitters and miners how amused they will be when they see me come back in this gay suit of green and yellow with red spots and with sixteen similar suits upon my arm how my own dogs will bark at me and how my own servants will not know me it is the funniest thing i ever knew of and his gay laugh echoed far and wide but when he had gone several miles without seeing any signs of his habitation his gayety abated it would have been much better he said as he sat down to rest under the shade of a tree if i had brought with me sixteen rations instead of these sixteen suits of clothes  the jollycumpop soon set out again but he walked a long distance without seeing any person or any house toward the close of the afternoon he stopped and looking back he saw coming toward him a large party of foot travellers in a few moments he perceived that the person in advance was the jailer at this the jollycumpop could not restrain his merriment how comically it has all turned out he exclaimed here ive taken all this trouble and tired myself out and have nearly starved myself and the jailer comes now with a crowd of people and takes me back i might as well have staid where i was ha ha  the jailer now left his party and came running toward the jollycumpop i pray you sir he said bowing very low do not cast us off  who are you all asked the jollycumpop looking with much surprise at the jailers companions who were now quite near  we are myself my three myrmidons and our wives and children our situations were such good ones that we married long ago and our families lived in the upper stories of the prison but when all the convicts had left we were afraid to remain for should the potentate again visit the prison he would be disappointed and enraged at finding no prisoners and would probably punish us grievously so we determined to follow you and to ask you to let us go with you wherever you are going i wrote a report which i fastened to the great gate and in it i stated that sixteen of the convicts escaped by the aid of outside confederates and that seventeen of them mutinied in a body and broke jail  that report laughed the jollycumpop your potentate will not readily understand  if i were there said the jailer i could explain it to him but as it is he must work it out for himself  have you any thing to eat with you asked the jollycumpop  oh yes said the jailer we brought provisions  well then i gladly take you under my protection let us have supper i have had nothing to eat since morning and the weight of sixteen extra suits of clothes does not help to refresh one  the jollycumpop and his companions slept that night under some trees and started off early the next morning if i could only get myself turned in the proper direction said he i believe we should soon reach my house  the prince his courtiers the boys and girls the coursemarker and the mapmaker worked industriously for several days at the foundation of their city they dug the ground they carried stones they cut down trees this work was very hard for all of them for they were not used to it after a few days labor the prince said to the man with the red beard who was reading his book i think we have now formed a nucleus any one can see that this is intended to be a city  no said the man with the red beard nothing is truly a nucleus until something is gathered around it proceed with your work while i continue my studies upon civil government  toward the close of that day the redbearded man raised his eyes from his book and beheld the jollycumpop and his party approaching hurrah he cried we are already attracting settlers and he went forth to meet them  when the prince and the courtiers saw the jollycumpop in his bright and variegated dress they did not know him but the boys and girls soon recognized his jovial face and tired as they were they set up a hearty laugh in which they were loudly joined by their merry friend while the jollycumpop was listening to the adventures of the prince and his companions and telling what had happened to himself the man with the red beard was talking to the jailer and his party and urging them to gather around the nucleus which had been here formed and help to build a city  nothing will suit us better exclaimed the jailer and the sooner we build a town wall so as to keep off the potentate if he should come this way the better shall we be satisfied  the next morning the prince said to the redbearded man others have gathered around us we have formed a nucleus and thus have done all that we promised to do we shall now depart  the man objected strongly to this but the prince paid no attention to his words what troubles me most he said to the jollycumpop is the disgraceful condition of our clothes they have been so torn and soiled during our unaccustomed work that they are not fit to be seen  as for that said the jollycumpop i have sixteen suits with me in which you can all dress if you like they are of unusual patterns but they are new and clean  it is better said the prince for persons in my station to appear inordinately gay than to be seen in rags and dirt we will accept your clothes  thereupon the prince and each of the others put on a prison dress of bright green and yellow with large red spots there were some garments left over for each boy wore only a pair of trousers with the waistband tied around his neck and holes cut for his arms while the large jackets with the sleeves tucked made very good dresses for the girls the prince and his party accompanied by the jollycumpop now left the redbearded man and his new settlers to continue the building of the city and set off on their journey the coursemarker had not been informed the night before that they were to go away that morning and consequently did not set his instrument by the stars  as we do not know in which way we should go said the prince one way will be as good as another and if we can find a road let us take it it will be easier walking  in an hour or two they found a road and they took it after journeying the greater part of the day they reached the top of a low hill over which the road ran and saw before them a glittering sea and the spires and houses of a city  it is the city of yan said the coursemarker  that is true said the prince and as we are so near we may as well go there  the astonishment of the people of yan when this party dressed in bright green and yellow with red spots passed through their streets was so great that the jollycumpop roared with laughter this set the boys and girls and all the people laughing and the sounds of merriment became so uproarious that when they reached the palace the king came out to see what was the matter what he thought when he saw his nephew in his fantastic guise accompanied by a party apparently composed of sixteen other lunatics cannot now be known but after hearing the princes story he took him into an inner apartment and thus addressed him my dear hassak the next time you pay me a visit i beg for your sake and my own that you will come in the ordinary way you have sufficiently shown to the world that when a prince desires to travel it is often necessary for him to go out of his way on account of obstacles  my dear uncle replied hassak your words shall not be forgotten  after a pleasant visit of a few weeks the prince and his party in new clothes returned by sea to itoby whence the jollycumpop soon repaired to his home there he found the miners and rocksplitters still at work at the tunnel which had now penetrated halfway through the hill on which stood his house you may go home he said for the prince has changed his plans i will put a door to this tunnel and it will make an excellent cellar in which to keep my wine and provisions  the day after the princes return his mapmaker said to him your highness according to your commands i made each day a map of your progress to the city of yan here it is  the prince glanced at it and then he cast his eyes upon the floor leave me he said i would be alone  illustration the map of the princes journey from itoby to yan       the battle of the third cousins                                       there were never many persons who could correctly bound the autocracy of mutjado the reason for this was that the boundary line was not stationary whenever the autocrat felt the need of money he sent his taxgatherers far and wide and people who up to that time had no idea of such a thing found that they lived in the territory of mutjado but when times were ordinarily prosperous with him and people in the outlying districts needed protection or public works the dominion of the autocrat became very much contracted  in the course of time the autocrat of mutjado fell into bad health and sent for his doctor that learned man prescribed some medicine for him and as this did him no good he ordered another kind he continued this method of treatment until the autocrat had swallowed the contents of fifteen phials and flasks some large and some small as none of these were of the slightest benefit the learned doctor produced another kind of medicine which he highly extolled  take a dose of this twice a day said he and you will soon find  a new medicine interrupted the autocrat in disgust i will have none of it these others were bad enough and rather than start with a new physic i prefer to die take away your bottles little and big and send me my secretary  when that officer arrived the autocrat informed him that he had determined to write his will and that he should set about it at once  the autocrat of mutjado had no son and his nearest male relatives were a third cousin on his fathers side and another third cousin on his mothers side of course these persons were in nowise related to each other and as they lived in distant countries he had never seen either of them he had made up his mind to leave his throne and dominions to one of these persons but he could not determine which of them should be his heir  one has as good a right as the other he said to himself and i cant bother my brains settling the matter for them let them fight it out and whoever conquers shall be autocrat of mutjado  having arranged the affair in this manner in his will he signed it and soon after died  the autocrats third cousin on his fathers side was a young man of about twentyfive named alberdin he was a good horseman and trained in the arts of warfare and when he was informed of the terms of his distinguished relatives will he declared himself perfectly willing to undertake the combat for the throne he set out for mutjado where he arrived in a reasonable time  the third cousin on the mothers side was a very different person he was a boy of about twelve years of age and as his father and mother had died when he was very young he had been for nearly all his life under the charge of an elderly and prudent man who acted as his guardian and tutor these two also soon arrived in mutjadothe boy phedo being mounted on a little donkey which was his almost constant companion as soon as they reached the territory of the late autocrat old salim the tutor left the boy at an inn and went forward by himself to take a look at the other third cousin when he saw alberdin mounted on his fine horse and looking so strong and valiant his heart was much disturbed  i had hoped he said to himself that the other one was a small boy but such does not appear to be the case there is but one way to have a fair fight between these two they must not now be allowed to see each other if they can be kept apart until my boy grows up he will then be able with the military education which i intend he shall have to engage in combat with any man they must not meet for at least thirteen years phedo will then be twentyfive and able to do worthy combat to be sure i am somewhat old myself to undertake to superintend so long a delay but i must do my best to keep well and strong and to attain the greatest possible longevity  salim had always been in the habit of giving thirtytwo chews to every mouthful of meat and a proportionate number of chews to other articles of food and had so far been very healthy but he now determined to increase the number of chews to thirtysix for it would be highly necessary for him to live until it was time for the battle between the third cousins to take place  having made up his mind on these points the old tutor introduced himself to alberdin and told him that he had come to arrange the terms of combat  in the first place said alberdin i should like to know what sort of a person my opponent is  he is not a cavalryman like you answered salim he belongs to the heavy infantry  at this alberdin looked grave he knew very well that a stout and resolute man on foot had often the advantage of one who is mounted he would have preferred meeting a horseman and fighting on equal terms  has he had much experience in war asked the young man  it is not long answered the tutor since he was almost constantly in arms winter and summer  he must be a practised warrior thought alberdin i must put myself in good fightingtrim before i meet him  after some further conversation on the subject the old man advised alberdin to go into camp on a beautiful plain not far from the base of a low line of mountains  your opponent said he will intrench himself in the valley on the other side with the mountains between you neither of you need fear a surprise and when both are ready a place of meeting can be appointed  now then said salim to himself when this had been settled if i can keep them apart for thirteen years all may be well  as soon as possible alberdin pitched a tent upon the appointed spot and began to take daily warlike exercise in the plain endeavoring in every way to put himself and his horse into proper condition for the combat  on the other side of the mountain old salim intrenched himself and the boy phedo he carefully studied several books on military engineering and caused a fortified camp to be constructed on the most approved principles it was surrounded by high ramparts and outside of these was a moat filled with water in the centre of the camp was a neat little house which was well provided with books provisions and every thing necessary for a prolonged stay when the drawbridge was up it would be impossible for alberdin to get inside of the camp and moreover the ramparts were so high that he could not look over them to see what sort of antagonist he was to have old salim did not tell the boy why he brought him here to live it would be better to wait until he was older before informing him of the battle which had been decreed he told phedo that it was necessary for him to have a military education which could very well be obtained in a place like this and he was also very careful to let him know that there was a terrible soldier in that part of the country who might at any time if it were not for the intrenchments pounce down upon him and cut him to pieces every fine day phedo was allowed to take a ride on his donkey outside of the fortifications but during this time the old tutor kept a strict watch on the mountain and if a horseman had made his appearance little phedo would have been whisked inside and the drawbridge would have been up in a twinkling  after about two weeks of this life phedo found it dreadfully stupid to see no one but his old tutor and never to go outside of these great ramparts except for donkeyrides which were generally very short he therefore determined late one moonlight night to go out and take a ramble by himself he was not afraid of the dreadful soldier of whom the old man had told him because at that time of night this personage would of course be in bed and asleep considering these things he quietly dressed himself took down a great key from over his sleeping tutors head opened the heavy gate let down the drawbridge mounted upon his donkey and rode forth upon the moonlit plain  that nightride was a very delightful one and for a long time the boy and the donkey rambled and ran first going this way and then that they gradually climbed the mountain and reaching the brow they trotted about for a while and then went down the other side the boy had been so twisted and turned in his course that he did not notice that he was not descending toward his camp and the donkey whose instinct told it that it was not going the right way was also told by its instinct that it did not wish to go the right way and that the intrenchments offered it no temptations to return when the morning dawned phedo perceived that he was really lost and he began to be afraid that he might meet the terrible soldier but after a time he saw riding toward him a very pleasantlooking young man on a handsome horse and he immediately took courage  now said he to himself i am no longer in danger if that horrible cutthroat should appear this good gentleman will protect me  alberdin had not seen any one for a long time and he was very glad to meet with so nice a little boy when phedo told him that he was lost he invited him to come to his tent near by and have breakfast while they were eating their meal alberdin asked the boy if in the course of his rambles he had met with a heavy infantry soldier probably armed to the teeth and very large and strong  oh ive heard of that dreadful man cried phedo and i am very glad that i did not meet him if he comes i hope youll protect me from him  i will do that said alberdin but i am afraid i shall not be able to help you find your way home for in doing so i should throw myself off my guard and might be set upon unexpectedly by this fellow with whom i have a regular engagement to fight there is to be a time fixed for the combat for which i feel myself nearly ready but i have no doubt that my enemy will be very glad to take me at a disadvantage if i give him a chance  phedo looked about him with an air of content the tent was large and well furnished there seemed to be plenty of good things to eat the handsome horseman was certainly a very goodhumored and agreeable gentleman and moreover the tent was not shut in by high and gloomy ramparts  i do not think you need trouble yourself said he to his host to help me to find my way home i live with my tutor and i am sure that when he knows i am gone he will begin to search for me and after awhile he will find me until then i can be very comfortable here  for several days the two third cousins of the autocrat lived together in the tent and enjoyed each others society very much then alberdin began to grow a little impatient  if i am to fight this heavy infantry man he said i should like to do it at once i am now quite ready and i think he ought to be i expected to hear from him before this time and i shall start out and see if i can get any news of his intentions i dont care about going over the mountain without giving him notice but the capital city of mutjado is only a days ride to the west and there i can cause inquiries to be made when he would like to meet me and where  i will go with you said phedo greatly delighted at the idea of visiting the city  yes i will take you said alberdin your tutor dont seem inclined to come for you and of course i cant leave you here  the next day alberdin on his horse and phedo on his donkey set out for the city where they arrived late in the afternoon after finding a comfortable lodging alberdin sent messengers to the other side of the mountain where his opponent was supposed to be encamped and gave them power to arrange with him for a meeting he particularly urged them to try to see the old man who had come to him at first and who had seemed to be a very fairminded and sensible person in two days however the messengers returned stating that they had found what they supposed to be the intrenched camp of the heavy infantry man they had been sent in search of but that it was entirely deserted and nobody could be seen anywhere near it  it is very likely said alberdin that he has watched my manoeuvres and exercises from the top of the mountain and has concluded to run away i shall give him a reasonable time to show himself and then if he does not come forward i will consider him beaten and claim the autocracy  that is a good idea said phedo but i think if you can you ought to find him and kill him or drive him out of the country thats what i should do if i were you  of course i shall do that if i can said alberdin but i could not be expected to wait for him forever  when his intention had been proclaimed alberdin was informed of something which he did not know before and that was that the late autocrat had left an only daughter a princess about twenty years old but although she was his daughter she could not inherit his crown for the laws of the country forbade that any woman should become autocrat a happy idea now struck alberdin  i will marry the princess he said and then every one will think that it is the most suitable thing for me to become autocrat  so alberdin sent to the princess to ask permission to speak with her and was granted an audience with much courtesy and politeness he made known his plans to the lady and hoped that she would consider it advisable to marry him  i am sorry to interfere with any of your arrangements said the princess but as soon as i heard the terms of my fathers will i made up my mind to marry the victor in the contest as i cannot inherit the throne myself the next best thing is to be the wife of the man who does go forth then and find your antagonist and when you have conquered him i will marry you  and if he conquers me you will marry him said alberdin  yes sir answered the princess with a smile and dismissed him  it was plain enough that there was nothing for alberdin to do but to go and look for the heavy infantry man phedo was very anxious to accompany him and the two mounted as before set out from the city on their quest  when old salim the tutor of phedo awoke in the morning and found the boy gone he immediately imagined that the youngster had ran away to his old home so he set forth with all possible speed hoping to overtake him but when he reached the distant town where phedo had lived he found that the boy had not been there and after taking some needful rest he retraced his steps crossed the mountains and made his way toward the capital city hoping to find news of him there it was necessary for him to be very careful in his inquiries for he wished no one to find out that the little boy he was looking for was the third cousin of the late autocrat on the mothers side he therefore disguised himself as a migratory medical man and determined to use all possible caution when he reached the camp of the young horseman alberdin and found that personage gone his suspicions became excited  if these two have run off together he said to himself my task is indeed difficult if the man discovers it is the boy he has to fight my poor phedo will be cut to pieces in a twinkling i do not believe there has been any trouble yet for the boy does not know that he is to be one of the combatants and the man would not be likely to suspect it come what may the fight must not take place for thirteen years and in order that i may still better preserve my health and strength to avert the calamity during that period i will increase my number of chews to fortytwo to each mouthful of meat  when old salim reached the city he soon found that alberdin and the boy had been there and that they had gone away together  nothing has happened so far said the old man with a sigh of relief and things may turn out all right yet ill follow them but i must first find out what that cavalryman had to say to the princess for he had been told of the interview at the palace  it was not long before the migratory medical man was brought to the princess there was nothing the matter with her but she liked to meet with persons of skill and learning to hear what they had to say  have you any specialty she asked of the old man  yes said he i am a germdoctor  what is that asked the princess  all diseases replied the old man come from germs generally very little ones my business is to discover these and find out all about them  then i suppose said the princess you know how to cure the diseases  you must not expect too much answered the old man it ought to be a great satisfaction to us to know what sort of germ is at the bottom of our woes  i am very well myself said the princess and so far as i know none of my household are troubled by germs but there is something the matter with my mind which i wish you could relieve she then told the old man how she had determined to marry the victor in the contest for her fathers throne and how she had seen one for the claimants whom she considered to be a very agreeable and deserving young man while the other she had heard was a great strong foot soldier who was probably very disagreeable and even horrid if this one should prove the conqueror she did not know what she should do you see i am in a great deal of trouble said she can you do any thing to help me  the pretending migratory medical man looked at her attentively for a few moments and then he said  the reason why you intend to marry the victor in the coming contest is that you wish to remain here in your fathers palace and to continue to enjoy the comforts and advantages to which you have been accustomed  yes said the princess that is it  well having discovered the germ of your disorder said the old man the great point is gained i will see what i can do  and with a respectful bow he left her presence  well said old salim to himself as he went away she can never marry my boy for that is certainly out of the question but now that i have found out her motive i think i can arrange matters satisfactorily so far as she is concerned but to settle the affair between that young man and phedo is immensely more difficult the first thing is to find them  having learned the way they had gone the old tutor travelled diligently and in two days came up with alberdin and phedo when he first caught sight of them he was very much surprised to see that they were resting upon the ground quite a long distance apart with a little stream between them noticing that alberdins back was toward him he threw off his disguise and hastened to phedo the boy received him with the greatest delight and after many embraces they sat down to talk phedo told the old man all that had happened and finished by relating that as they had that day stopped by this stream to rest alberdin had taken it into his head to inquire into the parentage of his young companion and after many questions about his family it had been made clear to both of them that they were the two third cousins who were to fight for the autocracy of mutjado  he is very angry said the boy at the tricks that have been played upon him and went off and left me is it true that i am to fight him i dont want to do it for i like him very much  it will be a long time before you are old enough to fight said salim so we need not consider that you stay here and ill go over and talk to him  salim then crossed the stream and approached alberdin when the young man saw him and recognized him as the person who had arranged the two encampments he turned upon him with fury  wretched old man who came to me as the emissary of my antagonist you are but the tutor of that boy if i had known the truth at first i would have met him instantly would have conquered him without hurting a hair on his head and carrying him bound to the capital city would have claimed the autocracy and would now have been sitting upon the throne instead of that look at the delay and annoyance to which i have been subjected i have also taken such a fancy to the boy that rather than hurt him or injure his prospects i would willingly resign my pretensions to the throne and go back contentedly to my own city but this cannot now be done i have fallen in love with the daughter of the late autocrat and she will marry none but the victorious claimant behold to what a condition you have brought me  the old man regarded him with attention  i wish very much said he to defer the settlement of this matter for thirteen years are you willing to wait so long  no i am not said alberdin  very well then said the old man each third cousin must retire to his camp and as soon as matters can be arranged the battle must take place  there is nothing else to be done said alberdin in a troubled voice but i shall take care that the boy receives no injury if it can possibly be avoided  the three now retraced their steps and in a few days were settled down alberdin in his tent in the plain and salim and phedo in their intrenchments on the other side of the low mountain the old man now gave himself up to deep thought he had discovered the germ of alberdins trouble and in a few days he had arranged his plans and went over to see the young man  it has been determined said he that a syndicate is to be formed to attend to this business for phedo  a syndicate cried alberdin what is that  a syndic answered salim is a person who attends to business for others and a syndicate is a body of men who are able to conduct certain affairs better than any individual can do it in a week from today phedos syndicate will meet you in the large plain outside of the capital city there the contest will take place shall you be ready  i dont exactly understand it said alberdin but i shall be there  general notice was given of the coming battle of the contestants for the throne and thousands of the inhabitants of the autocracy assembled on the plain on the appointed day the princess with her ladies was there and as everybody was interested everybody was anxious to see what would happen  alberdin rode into the open space in the centre of the plain and demanded that his antagonist should appear thereupon old salim came forward leading phedo by the hand  this is the opposing heir he said but as every one can see that he is too young to fight a battle a syndicate has been appointed to attend to the matter for him and there is nothing in the will of the late autocrat which forbids this arrangement the syndicate will now appear  at this command there came into the arena a horseman heavily armed a tall foot soldier completely equipped for action an artilleryman with a small cannon on wheels a sailor with a boardingpike and a drawn cutlass and a soldier with a revolving gun which discharged one hundred and twenty balls a minute  all being ready exclaimed salim the combat for the autocracy will begin  alberdin took a good long look at the syndicate ranged before him then he dismounted from his horse drew his sword and stuck it point downward into the sand  i surrender he said  so do i cried the princess running toward him and throwing herself into his arms  the eyes of alberdin sparkled with joy  let the autocracy go he cried now that i have my princess the throne and the crown are nothing to me  so long as i have you returned the princess i am content to resign all the comforts and advantages to which i have been accustomed  phedo who had been earnestly talking with his tutor now looked up  you shall not resign any thing he cried we are all of the same blood and we will join together and form a royal family and we will all live at the palace alberdin and my tutor shall manage the government for me until i am grown up and if i have to go to school for a few years i suppose i must and that is all there is about it  the syndicate was now ordered to retire and disband the heralds proclaimed phedo the conquering heir and the people cheered and shouted with delight all the virtues of the late autocrat had come to him from his mother and the citizens of mutjado much preferred to have a new ruler from the mothers family  i hope you bear no grudge against me said salim to alberdin but if you had been willing to wait for thirteen years you and phedo might have fought on equal terms as it is now it would have been as hard for him to conquer you as for you to conquer the syndicate the odds would have been quite as great  dont mention it said alberdin i prefer things as they are i should have hated to drive the boy away and deprive him of a position which the people wish him to have now we are all satisfied  phedo soon began to show signs that he would probably make a very good autocrat he declared that if he was to be assisted by ministers and cabinet officers when he came to the throne he would like them to be persons who had been educated for their positions just as he was to be educated for his own consequently he chose for the head of his cabinet a bright and sensible boy and had him educated as a minister of state for minister of finance he chose another boy with a very honest countenance and for the other members of his cabinet suitable youths were selected he also said that he thought there ought to be another officer one who would be a sort of minister of general comfort who would keep an eye on the health and happiness of the subjects and would also see that every thing went all right in the palace not only in regard to meals but lots of other things for this office he chose a bright young girl and had her educated for the position of queen       the banished king                                       there was once a kingdom in which every thing seemed to go wrong everybody knew this and everybody talked about it especially the king the bad state of affairs troubled him more than it did any one else but he could think of no way to make them better  i cannot bear to see things going on so badly he said to the queen and his chief councillors i wish i knew how other kingdoms were governed  one of his councillors offered to go to some other countries and see how they were governed and come back and tell him all about it but this did not suit his majesty  you would simply return he said and give me your ideas about things i want my own ideas  the queen then suggested that he should take a vacation and visit other kingdoms and see for himself how things were managed in them  this did not suit the king a vacation would not answer he said i should not be gone a week before something would happen here which would make it necessary for me to come back  the queen then suggested that he be banished for a certain time say a year in that case he could not come back and would be at full liberty to visit foreign kingdoms and find out how they were governed  this plan pleased the king if it were made impossible for me to come back he said of course i could not do it the scheme is a good one let me be banished and he gave orders that his council should pass a law banishing him for one year  preparations were immediately begun to carry out this plan and in day or two the king bade farewell to the queen and left his kingdom a banished man he went away on foot entirely unattended but as he did not wish to cut off all communication between himself and his kingdom he made an arrangement which he thought a very good one at easy shouting distance behind him walked one of the officers of the court and at shouting distance behind him walked another and so on at distances of about a hundred yards from each other in this way there would always be a line of men extending from the king to his palace whenever the king had walked a hundred yards the line moved on after him and another officer was put in the gap between the last man and the palace door thus as the king walked on his line of followers lengthened and was never broken whenever he had any message to send to the queen or any other person in the palace he shouted it to the officer next him who shouted it to the one next to him and it was so passed on until it reached the palace if he needed food clothes or any other necessary thing the order for it was shouted along the line and the article was passed to him from man to man each one carrying it forward to his neighbor and then retiring to his proper place  in this way the king walked on day by day until he had passed entirely out of his own kingdom at night he stopped at some convenient house on the road and if any of his followers did not find himself near a house or cottage when the king shouted back the order to halt he laid himself down to sleep wherever he might be by this time the increasing line of followers had used up all the officers of the court and it became necessary to draw upon some of the under government officers in order to keep the line perfect  the king had not gone very far outside the limits of his dominions when he met a sphinx he had often heard of these creatures although he had never seen one before but when he saw the winged body of a lion with a womans head he knew instantly what it was he knew also that the chief business of a sphinx was that of asking people questions and then getting them into trouble if the right answers were not given he therefore determined that he would not be caught by any such tricks as these and that he would be on his guard if the sphinx spoke to him the creature was lying down when the king first saw it but when he approached nearer it rose to its feet there was nothing savage about its look and the king was not at all afraid  where are you going said the sphinx to him in a pleasant voice  give it up replied the king  what do you mean by that said the other with an air of surprise  i give that up too said the king  the sphinx then looked at him quite astonished  i dont mind telling you said the king of my own free will and not in answer to any questions that i do not know where i am going i am a king as you may have noticed and i have been banished from my kingdom for a year i am now going to look into the government of other countries in order that i may find out what it is that is wrong in my own kingdom every thing goes badly and there is something very faulty at the bottom of it all what this is i want to discover  i am much interested in puzzles and matters of that kind said the sphinx and if you like i will go with you and help to find out what is wrong in your kingdom  all right said the king i shall be glad of your company  what is the meaning of this long line of people following you at regular distances asked the sphinx  give it up said the king  the sphinx laughed  i dont mind telling you said the king of my own free will and not in answer to any question that these men form a line of communication between me and my kingdom where matters i fear must be going on worse than ever in my absence  the two now travelled on together until they came to a high hill from which they could see not very far away a large city  that city said the sphinx is the capital of an extensive country it is governed by a king of mingled sentiments suppose we go there i think you will find a government that is rather peculiar  the king consented and they walked down the hill toward the city  how did the king get his sentiments mingled asked the king  i really dont know how it began said the sphinx but the king when a young man had so many sentiments of different kinds and he mingled them up so much that no one could ever tell exactly what he thought on any particular subject of course his people gradually got into the same frame of mind and you never can know in this kingdom exactly what people think or what they are going to do you will find all sorts of people here giants dwarfs fairies gnomes and personages of that kind who have been drawn here by the mingled sentiments of the people i myself came into these parts because the people every now and then take a great fancy to puzzles and riddles  on entering the city the king was cordially welcomed by his brother sovereign to whom he told his story and he was lodged in a room in the palace such of his followers as came within the limits of the city were entertained by the persons near to whose houses they found themselves when the line halted  every day the sphinx went with him to see the sights of this strange city they took long walks through the streets and sometimes into the surrounding countryalways going one way and returning another the sphinx being very careful never to bring the king back by the same road or street by which they went in this way the kings line of followers which of course lengthened out every time he took a walk came to be arranged in long loops through many parts of the city and suburbs  many of the things the king saw showed plainly the mingled sentiments of the people for instance he would one day visit a great smiths shop where heavy masses of iron were being forged the whole place resounding with tremendous blows from heavy hammers and the clank and din of iron on the anvils while the next day he would find the place transformed into a studio where the former blacksmith was painting dainty little pictures on the delicate surface of eggshells the king of the country in his treatment of his visitor showed his peculiar nature very plainly sometimes he would receive him with enthusiastic delight while at others he would upbraid him with having left his dominions to go wandering around the earth in this senseless way one day his host invited him to attend a royal dinner but when he went to the grand dininghall pleased with anticipations of a splendid feast he found that the sentiments of his majesty had become mingled and that he had determined instead of having a dinner to conduct the funeral services of one of his servants who had died the day before all the guests were obliged by politeness to remain during the ceremonies which our king not having been acquainted with the deceased servant had not found at all interesting  now said the king to the sphinx i am in favor of moving on i am tired of this place where every sentiment is so mingled with others that you can never tell what anybody really thinks or feels i dont believe any one in this country was ever truly glad or sorry they mix one sentiment so quickly with another that they never can discover the actual ingredients of any of their impulses  when this king first began to mingle his sentiments said the sphinx it was because he always desired to think and feel exactly right he did not wish his feelings to run too much one way or the other  and so he is never either right or wrong said the king i dont like that at all i want to be one thing or the other  i have wasted a good deal of time at this place remarked the king as they walked on and i have seen and heard nothing which i wish to teach my people but i must find out some way to prevent every thing going wrong in my kingdom i have tried plan after plan and sometimes two or three together and have kept this up year after year and yet nothing seems to do my kingdom any good  have you heard how things are going on there now asked the sphinx  give it up said the king but i dont mind saying of my own accord and not as answer to any question that i have sent a good many communications to my queen but have never received any from her so i do not know how things are going on in my kingdom  they then travelled on the long line of followers coming after keeping their relative positions a hundred yards apart and passing over all the ground the king had traversed in his circuitous walks about the city thus the line crept along like an enormous snake in straight lines loops and coils and every time the king walked a hundred yards a fresh man from his capital city was obliged to take his place at the tail of the procession  by the way said the sphinx after they had walked an hour or more if you want to see a kingdom where there really is something to learn you ought to go to the country of the gaumers which we are now approaching  all right said the king let us go there  in the course of the afternoon they reached the edge of a high bluff on the level ground beneath this precipice said the sphinx is the country of the dwarfs called gaumers you can sit on the edge of the bluff and look down upon it  the king and the sphinx then sat down and looked out from the edge over the country of the little people the officer of the court who had formed the head of the line wished very much to see what they were looking at but when the line halted he was not near enough  you will notice said the sphinx that the little houses and huts are gathered together in clusters each one of these clusters is under a separate king  why dont they all live under one ruler asked the king that is the proper way  they do not think so said the sphinx in each of these clusters live the gaumers who are best suited to each other and if any gaumer finds he cannot get along in one cluster he goes to another the kings are chosen from among the very best of them and each one is always very anxious to please his subjects he knows that every thing that he and his queen and his children eat or drink or wear or have must be given to him by his subjects and if it were not for them he could not be their ruler and so he does every thing that he can to make them happy and contented for he knows if he does not please them and govern them well they will gradually drop off from him and go to other clusters and he will be left without any people or any kingdom  that is a very queer way of ruling said the king i think the people ought to try to please their sovereign  he is only one and they are a great many said the sphinx consequently they are much more important no subject is ever allowed to look down upon a king simply because he helps to feed and clothe him and send his children to school if any one does a thing of this kind he is banished until he learns better  all that may be very well for gaumers said the king but i can learn nothing from a government like that where every thing seems to be working in an opposite direction from what everybody knows is right and proper a king anxious to deserve the good opinion of his subjects what nonsense it ought to be just the other way the ideas of this people are as dwarfish as their bodies  the king now arose and took up the line of march turning away from the country of the gaumers but he had not gone more than two or three hundred yards before he received a message from the queen it came to him very rapidly every man in the line seeming anxious to shout it to the man ahead of him as quickly as possible the message was to the effect that he must either stop where he was or come home his constantly lengthening line of communication had used up all the chief officers of the government all the clerks in the departments and all the officials of every grade excepting the few who were actually needed to carry on the government and if any more men went into the line it would be necessary to call upon the laborers and other persons who could not be spared  i think said the sphinx that you have made your line long enough  and i think said the king that you made it a great deal longer than it need to have been by taking me about in such winding ways  it may be so said the sphinx with its mystic smile  well i am not going to stop here said the king and so i might as well go back as soon as i can and he shouted to the head man of the line to pass on the order that his edict of banishment be revoked  in a very short time the news came that the edict was revoked the king then commanded that the procession return home tailend foremost the march was at once begun each man as he reached the city going immediately to his home and family  the king and the greater part of the line had a long and weary journey as they followed each other through the country and over the devious ways in which the sphinx had led them in the city of mingled sentiments the king was obliged to pursue all these complicated turnings or be separated from his officers and so break up his communication with his palace the sphinx accompanied him  when at last he reached his palace his line of former followers having apparently melted entirely away he hurried upstairs to the queen leaving the sphinx in the courtyard  the king found when he had time to look into the affairs of his dominions that every thing was in the most admirable condition the queen had retained a few of the best officials to carry on the government and had ordered the rest to fall one by one into the line of communication the king set himself to work to think about the matter it was not long before he came to the conclusion that the main thing which had been wrong in his kingdom was himself he was so greatly impressed with this idea that he went down to the courtyard to speak to the sphinx about it  i dare say you are right said the sphinx and i dont wonder that what you learned when you were away and what you have seen since you came back have made you feel certain that you were the cause of every thing going wrong in this kingdom and now what do you intend to do about your government  give it up promptly replied the king  that is exactly what i should advise said the sphinx  the king did give up his kingdom he was convinced that being a king was exactly the thing he was not suited for and that he would get on much better in some other business or profession he determined to be a traveller and explorer and to go abroad into other countries to find out things that might be useful to his own nation his queen had shown that she could govern the country most excellently and it was not at all necessary for him to stay at home she had ordered all the men who had made up his line to follow the kings example and to go into some good business in order that not being bothered with so many officers she would be able to get along quite easily  the king was very successful in his new pursuit and although he did not this time have a line of followers connecting him with the palace he frequently sent home messages which were of use and value to his nation  i may as well retire said the sphinx to itself as the king has found his vocation and every thing is going all right it is not necessary i should remain where i may be looked upon as a questionable personage       the philopena                                       there were once a prince and a princess who when quite young ate a philopena together they agreed that the one who at any hour after sunrise the next day should accept any thing from the otherthe giver at the same time saying philopenashould be the loser and that the loser should marry the other  they did not meet as soon as they had expected the next day and at the time our story begins many years had elapsed since they had seen each other and the prince and the princess were nearly grown up they often thought of the philopena they had eaten together and wondered if they should know each other when they met he remembered her as a pretty little girl dressed in green silk and playing with a snowwhite cat while she remembered him as a handsome boy wearing a little sword the handle of which was covered with jewels but they knew that each must have changed a great deal in all this time  neither of these young people had any parents the prince lived with guardians and the princess with uncles  the guardians of the prince were very enterprising and energetic men and were allowed to govern the country until the prince came of age the capital city was a very fine city when the old king died but the guardians thought it might be much finer so they set to work with all their might and main to improve it they tore down old houses and made a great many new streets they built grand and splendid bridges over the river on which the city stood they constructed aqueducts to bring water from streams many miles away and they were at work all the time upon some extensive building enterprise  the prince did not take much interest in the works which were going on under direction of his guardians and when he rode out he preferred to go into the country or to ride through some of the quaint old streets where nothing had been changed for hundreds of years  the uncles of the princess were very different people from the guardians of the prince there were three of them and they were very quiet and cosey old men who disliked any kind of bustle or disturbance and wished that every thing might remain as they had always known it it even worried them a little to find that the princess was growing up they would have much preferred that she should remain exactly as she was when they first took charge of her then they never would have been obliged to trouble their minds about any changes in the manner of taking care of her but they did not worry their minds very much after all they wished to make her guardianship as little laborious or exhausting as possible and so divided the work one of them took charge of her education another of her food and lodging and the third of her dress the first sent for teachers and told them to teach her the second had handsome apartments prepared for her use and gave orders that she should have every thing she needed to eat and drink while the third commanded that she should have a complete outfit of new clothes four times a year thus every thing went on very quietly and smoothly and the three uncles were not obliged to exhaust themselves by hard work there were never any new houses built in that city and if any thing had to be repaired it was done with as little noise and dirt as possible the city and the whole kingdom were quiet and serene and the three uncles dozed away most of the day in three great comfortable thrones  everybody seemed satisfied with this state of things except the princess she often thought to herself that nothing would be more delightful than a little noise and motion and she wondered if the whole world were as quiet as the city in which she lived at last she became unable to bear the dreadful stillness of the place any longer but she could think of nothing to do but to go and try to find the prince with whom she had eaten a philopena if she should win he must marry her and then perhaps they could settle down in some place where things would be bright and lively so early one morning she put on her white dress and mounting her prancing black horse she rode away from the city only one person saw her go for nearly all the people were asleep  about this time the prince made up his mind that he could no longer stand the din and confusion the everlasting upsetting and settingup in his native city he would go away and see if he could find the princess with whom he had eaten a philopena if he should win she would be obliged to marry him and then perhaps they could settle down in some place where it was quiet and peaceful so on the same morning in which the princess rode away he put on a handsome suit of black clothes and mounting a gentle white horse he rode out of the city only one person saw him go for even at that early hour the people were so busy that little attention was paid to his movements  about half way between these two cities in a tall tower which stood upon a hill there lived an inquisitive dwarf whose whole object in life was to find out what people were doing and why they did it from the top of this tower he generally managed to see all that was going on in the surrounding country and in each of the two cities that have been mentioned he had an agent whose duty it was to send him word by means of carrier pigeons whenever a new thing happened before breakfast on the morning when the prince and princess rode away a pigeon from the city of the prince came flying to the tower of the inquisitive dwarf  some new building started i suppose said the dwarf as he took the little roll of paper from under the pigeons wing but no it is very different the prince has ridden away from the city alone and is travelling to the north  but before he could begin to puzzle his brains about the meaning of this departure another pigeon came flying in from the city of the princess  well cried the dwarf this is amazing it is a long time since i have had a message from that city and my agent has been drawing his salary without doing any work what possibly can have happened there  when he read that the princess had ridden alone from the city that morning and was travelling to the south he was truly amazed  what on earth can it mean he exclaimed if the city of the prince were to the south of that of the princess then i might understand it for they would be going to see each other and that would be natural enough but as his city is to the north of her city they are travelling in opposite directions and what is the meaning of this i most certainly must find out  the inquisitive dwarf had three servants whom he employed to attend to his most important business these were a gryphoness a water sprite and an absolute fool this last one was very valuable for there were some things he would do which no one else would think of attempting the dwarf called to him the gryphoness the oldest and most discreet of the three and told her of the departure of the princess  hasten southward he said as fast as you can and follow her and do not return to me until you have found out why she left her city where she is going and what she expects to do when she gets there your appearance may frighten her and therefore you must take with you the absolute fool to whom she will probably be willing to talk but you must see that every thing is managed properly  having despatched these two the inquisitive dwarf then called the water sprite who was singing to herself at the edge of a fountain and telling her of the departure of the prince ordered her to follow him and not to return until she had found out why he left his city where he was going and what he intended to do when he got there  the road to the north he said lies along the river bank therefore you can easily keep him company  the water sprite bowed and dancing over the dewy grass to the river threw herself into it sometimes she swam beneath the clear water sometimes she rose partly in the air where she seemed like a little cloud of sparkling mist borne onward by the wind and sometimes she floated upon the surface her pale blue robes undulating with the gentle waves while her white hands and feet shone in the sun like tiny crests of foam thus singing to herself she went joyously and rapidly on aided by a full strong wind from the south she did not forget to glance every now and then upon the road which ran along the river bank and in the course of the morning she perceived the prince he was sitting in the shade of a tree near the waters edge while his white horse was grazing near by  the water sprite came very gently out of the river and seating herself upon the edge of the grassy bank she spoke to him the prince looked up in astonishment but there was nothing in her appearance to frighten him  i came said the water sprite at the command of my master to ask you why you left your city where you are going and what you intend to do when you get there  the prince then told her why he had left his city and what he intended to do when he had found the princess  but where i am going he said i do not know myself i must travel and travel until i succeed in the object of my search  the water sprite reflected for a moment and then she said  if i were you i would not travel to the north it is cold and dreary there and your princess would not dwell in such a region a little above us on the other side of this river there is a stream which runs sometimes to the east and sometimes to the south and which leads to the land of the lovely lakes this is the most beautiful country in the world and you will be much more likely to find your princess there than among the desolate mountains of the north  i dare say you are right said the prince and i will go there if you will show me the way  the road runs along the bank of the river said the water sprite and we shall soon reach the land of the lovely lakes  the prince then mounted his horse forded the river and was soon riding along the bank of the stream while the water sprite gayly floated upon its dancing ripples                                       when the gryphoness started southward in pursuit of the princess she kept out of sight among the bushes by the roadside but sped swiftly along the absolute fool however mounted upon a fine horse rode boldly along upon the open road he was a goodlooking youth with rosy cheeks bright eyes and a handsome figure as he cantered gayly along he felt himself capable of every noble action which the human mind has ever conceived the gryphoness kept near him and in the course of the morning they overtook the princess who was allowing her horse to walk in the shade by the roadside the absolute fool dashed up to her and taking off his hat asked her why she had left her city where she was going and what she intended to do when she got there  the princess looked at him in surprise i left my city because i wanted to she said i am going about my business and when i get to the proper place i shall attend to it  oh said the absolute fool you refuse me your confidence do you but allow me to remark that i have a gryphoness with me who is very frightful to look at and whom it was my intention to keep in the bushes but if you will not give fair answers to my questions she must come out and talk to you and that is all there is about it  if there is a gryphoness in the bushes said the princess let her come out no matter how frightful she is i would rather she should come where i can see her than to have her hiding near me  the gryphoness who had heard these words now came out into the road the horse of the princess reared in affright but his young rider patted him on the neck and quieted his fears  what do you and this young man want said the princess to the gryphoness and why do you question me  it is not of our own will that we do it said the gryphoness very respectfully but our master the inquisitive dwarf has sent us to obtain information about the points on which the young man questioned you and until we have found out these things it is impossible for us to return  i am opposed to answering impertinent questions replied the princess but in order to rid myself of you i will tell you the reason of my journey and she then stated briefly the facts of the case  ah me said the gryphoness i am very sorry but you cannot tell us where you are going and we cannot return until we know that but you need not desire to be rid of us for it may be that we can assist you in the object of your journey this young man is sometimes very useful and i shall be glad to do any thing that i can to help you if you should think that i would injure you or willingly annoy you by my presence it would grieve me to the heart and as she spoke a tear bedimmed her eye  the princess was touched by the emotion of the gryphoness  you may accompany me she said and i will trust you both you must know this country better than i do have you any advice to give me in regard to my journey  one thing i would strongly advise said the gryphoness and that is that you do not travel any farther until we know in what direction it will be best to go there is an inn close by kept by a worthy woman if you will stop there until tomorrow this young man and i will scour the country round about and try to find some news of your prince the young man will return and report to you tomorrow morning and if you should need help or escort he will aid and obey you as your servant as for me unless we have found the prince i shall continue searching for him there is a prince in the city to the north of my masters tower and it is not unlikely that it is he whom you seek  you can find out if it is he answered the princess by asking about the philopena  that will i do said the gryphoness and i will return hither as speedily as possible and with a respectful salutation the gryphoness and the absolute fool departed by different ways  the princess then repaired to the inn where she took lodgings  the next morning the absolute fool came back to the inn and seeing the princess said i rode until after nightfall searching for the prince before it occurred to me that even if i should find him i would not know him in the dark as soon as i thought of that i rode straight to the nearest house and slept until daybreak when i remembered that i was to report to you this morning but as i have heard no news of the prince and as this is a beautiful clear day i think it would be extremely foolish to remain idly here where there is nothing of interest going on and when a single hours delay may cause you to miss the object of your search the prince may be in one place this morning and there is no knowing where he will be in the afternoon while the gryphoness is searching we should search also we can return before sunset and we will leave word here as to the direction we have taken so that when she returns she can quickly overtake us it is my opinion that not a moment should be lost i will be your guide i know this country well  the princess thought this sounded like good reasoning and consented to set out there were some beautiful mountains to the southeast and among these the absolute fool declared a prince of good taste would be very apt to dwell they therefore took this direction but when they had travelled an hour or more the mountains began to look bare and bleak and the absolute fool declared that he did not believe any prince would live there he therefore advised that they turn into a road that led to the northeast it was a good road and therefore he thought it led to a good place where a person of good sense would be likely to reside along this road they therefore travelled they had ridden but a few miles when they met three men well armed and mounted these men drew up their horses and respectfully saluted the princess  highborn lady they said for by your aspect we know you to be such we would inform you that we are the soldiers of the king the outskirts of whose dominions you have reached it is our duty to question all travellers and if their object in coming to our country is a good one to give them whatever assistance and information they may require will you tell us why you are come  impertinent vassals cried the absolute fool riding up in a great passion how dare you interfere with a princess who has left her city because it was so dull and stupid and is endeavoring to find a prince with whom she has eaten a philopena in order that she may marry him out of my way or i will draw my sword and cleave you to the earth and thus punish your unwarrantable curiosity  the soldiers could not repress a smile  in order to prevent mischief they said to the absolute fool we shall be obliged to take you into custody  this they immediately did and then requested the princess to accompany them to the palace of their king where she would receive hospitality and aid  the king welcomed the princess with great cordiality he had no son and he much wished he had one for in that case it might be his prince for whom the young lady was looking but there was a prince he said who lived in a city to the north who was probably the very man and he would send and make inquiries in the mean time the princess would be entertained by himself and his queen and if her servant would make a suitable apology his violent language would be pardoned but the absolute fool positively refused to do this  i never apologize he cried no man of spirit would do such a thing what i say i stand by  very well said the king then you shall fight a wild beast and he gave orders that the affair should be arranged for the following day  in a short time however some of his officers came to him and told him that there were no wild beasts those on hand having been kept so long that they had become tame  to be sure theres the old lion sardon they said but he is so dreadfully cross and has had so much experience in these fights that for a long time it has not been considered fair to allow any one to enter the ring with him  it is a pity said the king to make the young man fight a tame beast but under the circumstances the best thing to do will be to represent the case to him just as it is tell him we are sorry we have not an ordinary wild beast but that he can take his choice between a tame one and the lion sardon whose disposition and experience you will explain to him  when the matter was stated to the absolute fool he refused with great scorn to fight a tame beast  i will not be degraded in the eyes of the public he said i will take the old lion  the next day the court and the public assembled to see the fight but the queen and our princess took a ride into the country not wishing to witness a combat of this kind especially one which was so unequal the king ordered that every advantage should be given to the young man in order that he might have every possible chance of success in fighting an animal which had been a victor on so many similar occasions a large iron cage furnished with a turnstile into which the absolute fool could retire for rest and refreshment but where the lion could not follow him was placed in the middle of the arena and the youth was supplied with all the weapons he desired when every thing was ready the absolute fool took his stand in the centre of the arena and the door of the lions den was opened the great beast came out he looked about for an instant and then with majestic step advanced toward the young man when he was within a few paces of him he crouched for a spring  the absolute fool had never seen so magnificent a creature and he could not restrain his admiration with folded arms and sparkling eyes he gazed with delight upon the lions massive head his long and flowing mane his magnificent muscles and his powerful feet and legs there was an air of grandeur and strength about him which completely enraptured the youth approaching the lion he knelt before him and gazed with wondering ecstasy into his great glowing eyes what glorious orbs he inwardly exclaimed what unfathomable expression what possibilities what reminiscences and everywhere what majesty of curve  the lion was a good deal astonished at the conduct of the young man and he soon began to suppose that this was not the person he was to fight but probably a keeper who was examining into his condition after submitting to this scrutiny a few minutes he gave a mighty yawn which startled the spectators but which delighted the absolute fool for never before had he beheld such a depth of potentiality he knelt in silent delight at this exhibition of the beauty of strength  old sardon soon became tired of all this however and he turned and walked back to his den when their man is ready he thought to himself i will come out and fight him  one tremendous shout now arose from the multitude the youth has conquered they cried he has actually frightened the lion back into his den rushing into the arena they raised the absolute fool upon their shoulders and carried him in triumph to the open square in front of the palace that he might be rewarded for his bravery here the king followed by his court quickly appeared for he was as much delighted as any one at the victory of the young man  noble youth he exclaimed you are the bravest of the brave you are the only man i know who is worthy of our royal daughter and you shall marry her forthwith long since i vowed that only with the bravest should she wed  at this moment the queen and the princess returning from their ride heard with joy the result of the combat and riding up to the victor the queen declared that she would gladly join with her royal husband in giving their daughter to so brave a man  the absolute fool stood for a moment in silent thought then addressing the king he said  was your majestys father a king  he was was the answer  was his father of royal blood  no he was not replied the king my grandfather was a man of the people but his preeminent virtue his great ability as a statesman and the dignity and nobility of his character made him the unanimous choice of the nation as its sovereign  i am sorry to hear that said the absolute fool for it makes it necessary for me to decline the kind offer of your daughter in marriage if i marry a princess at all she must be one who can trace back her lineage through a long line of royal ancestors and as he spoke his breast swelled with manly pride  for a moment the king was dumb with rage then loudly he shouted ho guards annihilate him avenge this insult  at these words the sword of every bystander leaped from its scabbard but before any one could take a step forward the princess seized the absolute fool by his long and flowing locks and put spurs to her horse the young man yelled with pain and shouted to her to let go but she held firmly to his hair and as he was extraordinarily active and fleet of foot he kept pace with the galloping horse a great crowd of people started in pursuit but as none of them were mounted they were soon left behind  let go my hair let go my hair shouted the absolute fool as he bounded along you dont know how it hurts let go let go  but the princess never relinquished her hold until they were out of the kings domain  a little more cried the indignant youth when she let him go and you would have pulled out a handful of my hair  a little less said the princess contemptuously and you would have been cut to pieces for you have not sense enough to take care of yourself i am sorry i listened to you and left the inn to which the gryphoness took me it would have been far better to wait there for her as she told me to do  yes said the absolute fool it would have been much better  now said the princess we will go back there and see if she has returned  if we can find it said the other which i very much doubt  there were several roads at this point and of course they took the wrong one as they went on the absolute fool complained bitterly that he had left his horse behind him and was obliged to walk sometimes he stopped and said he would go back after it but this the princess sternly forbade                                       when the gryphoness reached the city of the prince it was night but she was not sorry for this she did not like to show herself much in the daytime because so many people were frightened by her after a good deal of trouble she discovered that the prince had certainly left the city although his guardians did not seem to be aware of it they were so busy with a new palace in part of which they were living that they could not be expected to keep a constant eye upon him in the morning she met an old man who knew her and was not afraid of her and who told her that the day before when he was up the river he had seen the prince on his white horse riding on the bank of the stream and that near him in the water was something which now looked like a woman and again like a puff of mist the gryphoness reflected  if this prince has gone off in that way she said to herself i believe that he is the very one whom the princess is looking for and that he has set out in search of her and that creature in the water must be our water sprite whom our master has probably sent out to discover where the prince is going if he had told me about this it would have saved much trouble from the direction in which they were going i feel sure that the water sprite was taking the prince to the land of the lovely lakes she never fails to go there if she can possibly get an excuse i will follow them i suppose the princess will be tired waiting at the inn but i must know where the prince is and if he is really her prince before i go back to her  when the gryphoness reached the land of the lovely lakes she wandered all that day and the next night but she saw nothing of those for whom she was looking  the princess and the absolute fool journeyed on until near the close of the afternoon when the sky began to be overcast and it looked like rain they were then not far from a large piece of water and at a little distance they saw a ship moored near the shore  i shall seek shelter on board that ship said the princess  it is going to storm remarked the absolute fool i should prefer to be on dry land  as the land is not likely to be very dry when it rains said the princess i prefer a shelter even if it is upon wet water  women will always have their own way muttered the absolute fool  the ship belonged to a crew of amazon sailors who gave the princess a hearty welcome  you may go on board if you choose said the absolute fool to the princess but i shall not risk my life in a ship manned by women  it is well that you are of that opinion said the captain of the amazons who had heard this remark for you would not be allowed to come on board if you wished to but we will give you a tent to protect you and the horse in case it should rain and will send you something to eat  while the princess was taking tea with the amazon captain she told her about the prince and how she was trying to find him  good cried the captain i will join in the search and take you in my ship some of my crew told me that yesterday they saw a young man who looked like a prince riding along the shore of a lake which adjoins the one we are on in the morning we will sail after him we shall keep near the shore and your servant can mount your horse and ride along the edge of the lake from what i know of the speed of this vessel i think he can easily keep up with us  early in the morning the amazon captain called her crew together hurrah my brave girls she said we have an object i never sail without an object and it lights me to get one the purpose of our present cruise is to find the prince of whom this princess is in search and we must spare no pains to bring him to her dead or alive  luckily for her peace of mind the princess did not hear this speech the day was a fine one and before long the sun became very hot the ship was sailing quite near the land when the absolute fool rode down to the waters edge and called out that he had something very important to communicate to the princess as he was not allowed to come on board she was obliged to go on shore to which she was rowed in a small boat  i have been thinking said the absolute fool that it is perfectly ridiculous and very uncomfortable to continue this search any longer i would go back but my master would not suffer me to return without knowing where you are going i have therefore a plan to propose give up your useless search for this prince who is probably not nearly so handsome and intellectual as i am and marry me we will then return and i will assume the reins of government in your domain  follow the vessel said the princess as you have been doing for i wish some one to take care of my horse and without another word she returned to the ship  i should like to sail as far as possible from shore during the rest of the trip said she to the captain  put the helm bias shouted the amazon captain to the steerswoman and keep him well out from land  when they had sailed through a small stream into the lake adjoining the outlook who was swinging in a hammock hung between the tops of the two masts sang out prince ahead instantly all was activity on board the vessel story books were tucked under coils of rope hemstitching and embroidery were laid aside and every woman was at her post  the princess is taking a nap said the captain and we will not awaken her it will be so nice to surprise her by bringing the prince to her we will run our vessel ashore and then steal quietly upon him but do not let him get away cut him down if he resists  the prince who was plainly visible only a short distance ahead was so pleasantly employed that he had not noticed the approach of the ship he was sitting upon a low mosscovered rock close to the waters edge and with a small handnet which he had found on the shore he was scooping the most beautiful fishes from the lake holding them up in the sunlight to admire their brilliant colors and graceful forms and then returning them uninjured to the water the water sprite was swimming near him and calling to the fish to come up and be caught for the gentle prince would not hurt them it was very delightful and rare sport and it is not surprising that it entirely engrossed the attention of the prince the amazons silently landed and softly stole along the shore a little back from the water then at their captains command they rushed upon the prince  it was just about this time that the gryphoness who had been searching for the prince caught her first sight of him perceiving that he was about to be attacked she rushed to his aid the amazon sailors reached him before she did and seizing upon him they began to pull him away the prince resisted stoutly but seeing that his assailants were women he would not draw his sword the amazon captain and mate who were armed with broad knives now raised their weapons and called upon the prince to surrender or die but at this moment the gryphoness reached the spot and catching the captain and mate each by an arm she dragged them back from the prince the other amazons however continued the combat and the prince defended himself by pushing them into the shallow water where the water sprite nearly stifled them by throwing over them showers of spray and now came riding up the absolute fool seeing a youth engaged in combat with the amazon sailors his blood boiled with indignation  a man fighting women he exclaimed what a coward my arm shall ever assist the weaker sex  jumping from the horse he drew his sword and rushed upon the prince the gryphoness saw the danger of the latter and she would have gone to his assistance but she was afraid to loosen her hold of the amazon captain and mate  spreading her wings she flew to the top of a tree where she deposited the two warlike women upon a lofty branch from which she knew it would take them a long time to get down to the ground when she descended she found that the absolute fool had reached the prince the latter being a brave fellow although of so gentle a disposition had been glad to find a man among his assailants and had drawn his sword to defend himself the two had just begun to fight when the gryphoness seized the absolute fool by the waist and hurled him backward into some bushes  you must not fight him she cried to the prince he is beneath your rank and as you will not draw your sword against these amazons you must fly from them if you run fast they cannot overtake you  the prince followed her advice and sheathing his sword he rapidly ran along the bank followed by some of the amazons who had succeeded in getting the water out of their eyes and mouths  run from women contemptuously remarked the absolute fool if you had not interfered with me he said to the gryphoness i should soon have put an end to such a coward  the prince had nearly reached the place opposite to which the ship was moored when the princess who had been awakened by the noise of the combat appeared upon the deck of the vessel the moment she saw the prince she felt convinced that he was certainly the one for whom she was looking fearing that the pursuing amazons might kill him she sprang from the vessel to his assistance but her foot caught in a rope and instead of reaching the shore she fell into the water which was here quite deep and immediately sank out of sight the prince who had noticed her just as she sprang and who felt equally convinced that she was the one for whom he was searching stopped his flight and rushed to the edge of the bank just as the princess rose to the surface he reached out his hand to her and she took it  philopena cried the prince  you have won said the princess gayly shaking the water from her curls as he drew her ashore  at the request of the princess the pursuing amazons forbore to assail the prince and when the captain and the mate had descended from the tree every thing was explained  within an hour the prince and princess after taking kind leave of the gryphoness and water sprite and of the amazon sailors who cheered them loudly rode away to the city of the princess while the three servants of the inquisitive dwarf returned to their master to report what had happened  the absolute fool was in a very bad humor for he was obliged to go back on foot having left his horse in the kingdom where he had so narrowly escaped being killed and besides this he had had his hair pulled and had not been treated with proper respect by either the princess or the gryphoness he felt himself deeply injured when he reached home he determined that he would not remain in a position where his great abilities were so little appreciated i will do something he said which shall prove to the world that i deserve to stand among the truly great i will reform my fellow beings and i will begin by reforming the inquisitive dwarf thereupon he went to his master and said  sir it is foolish and absurd for you to be meddling thus with the affairs of your neighbors give up your inquisitive habits and learn some useful business while you are doing this i will consent to manage your affairs  the inquisitive dwarf turned to him and said i have a great desire to know the exact appearance of the north pole go and discover it for me  the absolute fool departed on this mission and has not yet returned  when the princess with her prince reached her city her uncles were very much amazed for they had not known she had gone away if you are going to get married they said we are very glad for then you will not need our care and we shall be free from the great responsibility which is bearing us down  in a short time the wedding took place and then the question arose in which city should the young couple dwell the princess decided it  in the winter she said to the prince we will live in your city where all is life and activity and where the houses are so well built with all the latest improvements in the summer we will come to my city where everything is old and shady and serene this they did and were very happy  the gryphoness would have been glad to go and live with the princess for she had taken a great fancy to her but she did not think it worth her while to ask permission to do this  my impulses i know are good she said but my appearance is against me  as for the water sprite she was in a truly disconsolate mood because she had left so soon the land of the lovely lakes where she had been so happy the more she thought about it the more she grieved and one morning unable to bear her sorrow longer she sprang into the great jet of the fountain high into the bright air the fountain threw her scattering her into a thousand drops of glittering water but not one drop fell back into the basin the great warm sun drew them up and in a little white cloud they floated away across the bright blue sky      scribners books for the young  thirtieth thousand  in little lord fauntleroy we gain another charming child to add to our gallery
